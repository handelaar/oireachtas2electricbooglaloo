      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 7, 10 and 11.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) Nos. 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate; (2) in the case of the resumed debate on No. 11, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 14 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 8.30 p. m. today.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the proposal that Nos. 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate is satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with the resumed debate on No. 11, the budget debate, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that Private Members' Business shall conclude at 8.30 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 March, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht told the House that he would introduce legislation this session to amend the broadcasting Acts.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that he will do so?  Will he indicate also if this will deal with and include the results of his review of section 31, in view of the extreme concern in some <Col N="1374" /> quarters that the present position may result in the Provisional Sinn Féin representatives on RTE not being asked hard questions about their support for murder on this island and on the neighbouring island?</P>

      <P>Yes.  Legislation on a revised broadcasting Act is nearing completion although it may not be ready for introduction this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a direct contradiction by the Minister, who said it would be introduced this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision will be considered by the Government in due course.  As I said, work is proceeding on the broadcasting Bill and if it is ready it will be introduced this session.  If not it will be introduced early in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle, but if there is no meeting of the Whips it cannot be done. The Taoiseach has not indicated his willingness <Col N="1375" /> to have this debate broadcast, although previously he indicated his willingness to allow other debates to be broadcast.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is all right.  If the Deputy is in touch with his Whips &mdash; which I think he is &mdash; he will know that the committees are being discussed by the Whips and as soon as they are finalised the matter will be proceeded with here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will arrange to have this motion taken quickly and if he will allow some brief time for its discussion?  There is an amendment down about the research services of the House, which have been gravely neglected in the last 20 years in terms of financial support.  There is need for a report on the adequacy of the research services, as provided in the amendment.  The sooner the motion on the committee establishment is moved and the amendment is put, the sooner the work will start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very anxious to have all committees set up immediately.  Maybe the Whips could reach final agreement on this matter and we will then proceed with it.  Perhaps Deputy Bruton is anxious that Deputy Mitchell write new menus for the restaurant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 32, after &ldquo;offices&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical change in the definition of the term &ldquo;Departments&rdquo;.  It is necessary because there are some Appropriation Accounts &mdash; for example, the Secret Service Vote and the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; which are not prepared &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo; a Department or office.  Such Appropriation Accounts are prepared &ldquo;by&rdquo; the appropriate Department &mdash; for example, in the two cases referred to here, by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise one point with the Minister.  The first definition in the Bill relates to accounting officers. Will the Minister agree that safeguards in relation to current and future public expenditure are not adequate in terms of eliminating waste, overlap and duplication? Will she also agree that secretaries of spending Departments are the most suitable people to be accounting officers in terms of the control of public expenditure?  Is it not <i>de facto</i> the case within the Government system that mainline spending Departments become the <Col N="1385" /> lobbyists for those spending sectors and that the Department of Finance acts as the controller of expenditure, if there is such a controller?  My view on this matter &mdash; this is only an introductory aspect to it &mdash; is that our whole system of controlling public expenditure is intended to deal with accuracy, compliance and history as opposed to futuristic and current aspects of waste and control.  Would the Minister not agree that accounting officers do not necessarily put in place controls of expenditure in the global sense in the Department but instead they simply dot the i's and cross the t's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The function of Secretaries of Government Departments as accounting officers is to ensure that the policies of the Department are carried out, and to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Department, including efficiency in spending money.  This Bill proposes to extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to providing value for money audits.  The kind of issues that arise in value for money audits arise from historical experience and are applied to future policy.</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from a report prepared by the Committee of Public Accounts in which I know Deputy Gay Mitchell was very much involved.  Subsequently a White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office was prepared.  This Bill takes on board the points made at that time and is an extension of the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the whole area of value for money.  This is a positive move that should be welcomed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not confuse the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General as the constitutional officer who is independent of the line Departments in drawing attention to practices and procedures in Departments, particularly to the value for money audit, with the role of the Secretaries of Government Departments as accounting officers.  It is important that the Secretaries of Government Departments with responsibility for day-to-day <Col N="1386" /> management of Government spending should continue to be the accounting officers for those Departments.  They can be questioned by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity for Members to go through Committee Stage.  I agree that the Secretary of the Department is in general the person who should be the accounting officer.  That has worked well under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  This Bill is an updating of that Act.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister mentioned the background to this, I chaired an advisory group on public financial accountability which reported to the Committee of Public Accounts.  That group consisted of me, the Comptroller and Auditor General and people from the public and private sectors.  Most of our recommendations are included in this Bill.  In relation to the section on accounting officer, one thing which is not in the Bill &mdash; and which the Minister might consider including &mdash; is allowing the Committee of Public Accounts to pursue into the private sector or wherever it sees fit, the expenditure of public funds.  It should not be a question of saying that it must only report on what the Comptroller and Auditor General reports to the House.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General is to be independent, the Committee of Public Accounts must also be independent. The committee must not depend on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, one of the great officers of State, as he is the only constitutional officer who works directly for the Dáil and not for the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Northern Ireland when the De Lorean factory located there, the Public Accounts Committee in the British House of Commons, under their National Audit Act, 1983, were able to examine the expenditure of private money and call witnesses in relation to De Lorean.  If that factory had been located in the South we could not have done the same thing.  We should not just depend on accounting officers, the Committee <Col N="1387" /> of Public Accounts should have the power to subpoena whoever it sees fit to appear before it.  Persons should be compelled to appear before it and give evidence and there should be a penalty for non-compliance.  The accounting officer route is the right one for Government Departments, the IDA and the National Treasury Management Agency. However, not only accounting officers should be required to attend, anybody whom the Public Accounts Committee, as the senior committee of this House, requires to attend should comply with its request.  That would happen in any Parliament in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>It seems that much of what has been said already would be more appropriate to section 2. We might proceed to adopt section 1 as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to underline the last point made by Deputy Mitchell concerning powers to pursue money into the private sector.  The committee is likely to be frequently confronted, if it is to do its job conclusively, with situations where it will require such powers.  Indeed we had a rather celebrated case in the period of the last Dáil which Deputy Mitchell handled with considerable skill and even-handedness in a very emotive and controversial political climate.  I would like to hear the Minister address that specific point.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage, if I can secure the necessary expertise in the interim, I intend to return to a point which related to the question of accounting officers and specifically the absence of any parliamentary accountability <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the recent devaluation crisis, it seems there are matters of policy that are exclusively the remit of the Central Bank and for which it should be made accountable.  In my experience, the accounting officer for the Department of Finance will not take on aspects of that responsibility.  I am aware that he is responsible for the National Treasury <Col N="1388" /> Management Agency, but there is secrecy surrounding major decisions by the Central Bank which ought not to continue unchallenged.  Decisions by the Central Bank have major economic implications, as we saw during recent months, and to this day we have had no statement of explanation or statement of policy consideration or of any of the other considerations that the Central Bank took into account in being the main mover in some of these decisions.  Some method of accountability should be worked out.  Perhaps this is as good an opportunity as we will get.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 44 to 48 and in page 6, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Issues or transfers of money from the account of the Exchequer aforesaid required for the time being to meet disbursements referred to in subsection (1) shall be made on the authority of credits under this section upon orders issued in writing or by means of an electronic funds transfer system to the Central Bank&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Before discussing the amendment I wish to inform the Deputies that the issue of the right to call witnesses under penalty will be dealt with under a privilege and compellability Bill which will be introduced. The issue raised by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to the Central Bank does not arise under this Bill, but any policy questions in relation to the Central Bank would appropriately be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

Will this Bill affect the Committee of Public Accounts only or will it extend to all committees of this House and the other House?

      <P>I am not in a position to give details of that Bill as I am not personally involved in its operation.  That <Col N="1390" /> Bill is being prepared by the Government. I am prepared to accept amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the National Treasury Managment Agency Bill was going through the House I had consultations with the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have always found the Department of Finance very co-operative. They sought to insert in that Bill the appointment of the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency as an accounting officer.  That was the first time that was done and was a wise and good move.  I am very appreciative of that and it is good for the House.</P>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  In general, there should not be any agencies which are not accountable. There are people with supreme authority in some cases who have no accountability. Deputy Rabbitte gave the example of the Central Bank and I would give the example of An Bord Pleanála.  I am not suggesting the Committee of Public Accounts should have a policy responsibility because that is not their role; that is the role of the Government and the Dáil, but they should have financial accountability.  They should be asked about the workings of their office and know that at some stage they will have to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should wield the sort of authority and power they do without being made accountable.  It is not a question of affecting their independence.  They can be independent and accountable at the same time.  In the case of the two agencies &mdash; the Central Bank and An Bord Pleanála &mdash; we have made them independent but not accountable.  That is wrong and it should not be allowed continue. The precedent set in the case of the National Treasury Management Agency, which will now be extended to the IDA which in future will have its own accounting officer, should be used for the Central Bank, An Bord Pleanála and other such agencies so that they <Col N="1391" /> could at least be reviewed by some committee. I suggest the appropriate committee is the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputies Rabbitte and Gay Mitchell.  I recently had detailed discussions with officials of the Central Bank whose accountability to this House is virtually non-existent. While I acknowledge the need for the Central Bank to be independent, in terms of the integrity of the currency, I am concerned about such matters as the current situation in relation to building societies and an internal probe in one society relating to an executive chairman. The Central Bank is the supervisory authority and is not accountable for its actions.  In fact, it is forbidden to make a statement.</P>
      <P>Another area relates to devaluation.  If this House wished to find out if speculators gained on devaluation or by how much the Central Bank lost, what its liability was to the European banking system, or the cost of replenishing the national reserves, it should be entitled to ask those valid questions.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, questions of that nature are deflected and defused by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister of State, in the work she is doing on other committees being formed by this House such as committees dealing with economic enterprise, finance and general affairs, should introduce a provision whereby the Governor, board of directors and management of the Central Bank could be brought to account for the cost of some of its policies &mdash; or perhaps errors &mdash; and the reasoning behind such policies.  It is very much in the public interest that there should be transparency in relation to those activities and the Central Bank's supervisory powers.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to the Minister for accepting amendment No. 3.  I am very interested in the points made by Deputies Gay Mitchell, Rabbitte and Yates.  While Deputy Gay Mitchell is my brother he was also the last Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and his work in that committee should be recognised.  Indeed, he is largely responsible for the Bill before us which is a significant achievement.  It may well be that I, as his successor as chairman of the committee can explore the point concerning the accountability of the Central Bank without, as Deputies said, infringing its independence on currency issues. It will be a difficult task but is one that ought to be studied and I intend to do so. This legislation does not make it mandatory that reports be made without delay. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, seek the insertion of the words &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the earliest opportunity&rdquo; in subsection (7).  Will the Minister of State agree to accept them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister of State, since she was under the impression that the Minister for Finance did answer to the House in respect of the affairs and decisions of the Central Bank, whether on reflection she would consider &mdash; she has available to her expertise which is not available to an Opposition spokesperson &mdash; taking on board the drafting of a suitable amendment to require the Central Bank to be responsible in certain limited respects to the Committee of Public Accounts?  All my colleagues agree that we are not trying to abrogate the independence of the Central Bank but we have seen, during the crises in the currency markets in recent months, precisely how important a role the Central Bank has to play in terms of the knock-on effect of decisions it makes throughout the economy.  There has been some very critical public comment in newspaper articles and so on about the conduct of the Central Bank.  Indeed, some articles written by present or former staff of the Central Bank raised issues of public concern.</P>
      <P>This Bill presents us with an opportunity to make the Central Bank accountable to this House in respect of certain matters.  The Minister may wish to take that on board.  We cannot put questions about something as important as interest rates to the Minister for Finance in this House because he will say it is a matter for the Central Bank.  Deputy Yates instanced the developments in building societies in recent weeks when again, as a result of an Act passed by this House a few years ago, responsibility was seen to rest with the Central Bank.  Your office, Sir, informed me that the Minister for Finance will not take questions relating to the affairs of those financial institutions. The Central Bank should not be shrouded in secrecy.  We are not trying to encroach on its independence, but we are entitled to know the rationale behind certain decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the experience of the past few months to draw on in regard to what my colleagues said, but, inevitably, similar situations will arise in future.  The apparent unaccountability of <Col N="1394" /> the Central Bank must be seriously questioned. The thrust of this Bill is in the right direction and given the move towards monetary union, the problems in the exchange rate mechanism and the decisions that inevitably will have to be made &mdash; some of which will be made in the calm light of day but others in a crisis &mdash; it is vital that the Central Bank in particular must in some way be accountable for its actions.  The past six months have clearly shown that.  That would be welcomed in general, perhaps not by those in the Central Bank, but by the community at large and particularly by Members of this House.  Given our past experience and the likelihood of the Central Bank having to make major decisions in the future, it must be accountable to somebody and this is an opportunity to address that issue.  Therefore, I welcome this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies have raised two separate issues.  Deputies Rabbitte and Cullen raised the question of accountability to this House of the Central Bank's economic policy, exchange rate policy, interest rate policy and so on. The appropriate forum for an in-depth examination of the economic policy of the Central Bank will be the new finance committee which will be set up by this House.  Under the Central Bank Act, the Central Bank has statutory independence. What the Deputies have proposed does not arise under a Comptroller and Auditor General Bill which deals with accountability for moneys voted by this House.  Because Central Bank moneys are not voted by this House, the accountability of the Central Bank cannot be dealt with under this Bill and the general question of economic policy does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with value for money audits, not the policy underlying the particular spending programmes.  It deals with the effectiveness of those spending programmes and individual Ministers are answerable to this House in regard to the policy issues.  Serious economic policy issues have been raised and Members are concerned with the area of economic <Col N="1395" /> policy which is handled by the Central Bank, but, as I said, the appropriate body to discuss those issues will be the new finance committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that policy issues are not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General, they are an audit or accounting function.  The Minister of State has missed the point to some extent because it is not true that only agencies whose moneys are voted by this House have an accounting officer. The NTMA has an accounting officer and under this procedure the IDA will appoint an accounting officer.  The Bill will empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a range of functions and remove other functions from him.  For example, he will no longer audit commercial State-sponsored bodies because that is considered part of the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. The Comptroller and Auditor General will be assigned all the non-commercial areas, including the IDA, but the Central Bank and An Bord Pleanála are part of the non-commercial area.  It would be within the terms of this Bill &mdash; and it should be amended if the Minister does have the power &mdash; to appoint an accounting officer for the Central Bank and An Bord Pleanála and any other non-commercial agency.  In that way non-commercial agencies &mdash; all the pieces of the jigsaw &mdash; would come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his report would be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That would not affect their independence or interfere with their policies, it is simply a matter of having some accountability procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Lord Mayor of Dublin I was invited to make an official visit to London recently, the first such visit in the history of the State.  While there I had occasion to have lunch with the Governor of the Bank of England and I asked him if he had appeared before parliamentary committees. He said that he did so regularly, <Col N="1396" /> yet the Bank of England is an independent body.  I accept that the relationship between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England is different from the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank. Nevertheless, we have created a certain amount of independent bodies, for example, the Central Bank and An Bord Pleanála which, in principle, is wrong. We are the Legislature and under the Constitution this is the House of Representatives. We are not just a lawmaking body, the Executive and their agencies are accountable to us.  In this Bill we are updating the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the supreme auditor of the State, an officer of the Constitution working for this House. We are also updating the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts and we should seek to make those agencies accountable.  I am not saying we should interfere with their independence, they are entitled to that but this Bill should, in particular, deal with their financial accountability.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider this matter before Report Stage because this principle is well covered in the Bill.</P>

At the same time, their actions or inactions, competence or incompetence, negligence or otherwise can cost taxpayers a great deal of money.  Under this Bill the question of negligence or competence is not properly addressed and such agencies would not be answerable to this House. I do not wish to curtail the independence of the Central Bank in dealing with the defence of our currency, but it is worth noting the position of the Bundesbank in Germany or the Federal Reserve in the United States.  However, I would not wish to see the Central Bank becoming an instrument of Government policy to be used at the whim of the Government, which is the case in the UK.  It is important that the Central Bank maintains its <Col N="1397" /> independence in key respects, but that must be reconciled with the need for accountability to this House.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Deputies.  Two separate points are being made in relation to the Central Bank.  I take on the board the point made in relation to the inclusion of An Bord Pleanála in the Schedule, and an amendment to this effect can be put down.</P>
      <P>The points made in regard to the Central Bank are too wide to take on board in this legislation &mdash; they have many ramifications, for example, whether the duty of the Central Bank in regard to economic policy should mean a loss or a net gain to the Exchequer.  The role of the Central Bank in regard to economic policy is a much wider issue, and I do not think it can be governed by short term profit and loss considerations within the running of the bank.  That is not the way to deal with economic and monetary policy.  As I suggested, the appropriate forum in which to discuss the role of the Central Bank, and that ought to be a very useful debate as this morning's debate has been useful is the Finance committee which will be set up by this House, and out of which some changes may arise.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a separate technical point under section 2, which I would like the Minister to clarify.  In regard to the control of disbursements of money from the Central Fund by the Comptroller and Auditor General, I understand that only four-fifths of a Department's Estimate can be expended without a Vote being approved by this House.  A number of new offices and Departments were set up this year, for example, the Office of the Tánaiste and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I realise that the Department of Enterprise and Employment was previously the Department of Industry and Commerce.  How is it legal for new Departments to spend money and for the Comptroller and Auditor General to release money when the Department, as such, did not exist previously?  This section deals with the disbursement of money by the Comptroller and Auditor General out of the Exchequer account in the Central Bank.  How is the £830,000 payable to the Office of the Tánaiste legal under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

With regard to the staff in the Office of the Tánaiste, the salary of the assistant secretary, who was only appointed at the beginning of the week, is currently being paid by her parent Department, the Department of Social Welfare.  Some staff will be transferred from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as they are surplus to requirements there and they will carry out certain functions in the Office of the Tánaiste.  Pending the approval of a Vote by the House, they will be paid by the <Col N="1399" /> Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, it is all legal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer again to the distinction the Minister has drawn between economic policy and auditing the accounts of the Central Bank.  I fully appreciate that distinction, but accountability has wonderful ways of working in practice.  In my experience, while the Committee of Public Accounts always scrupulously acknowledged that its role was an accounting and value for money one, it was very difficult on occasion to distinguish that role from questions of policy without formally going into that. Under the chairmanship of Deputy Gay Mitchell, members of the committee never felt unnecessarily constrained in this area.  I do not know what Deputy Mitchell major will be like in the chair. My only attempt at getting in so far was ruled out of order last week.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that once the Central Bank is listed in the Schedule and is accountable for the accounts of its office, it is inevitable, in the normal process of accountability and democracy, that certain questions will be raised.  The very fact of being accountable and having to appear before a Dáil committee will put a somewhat different complexion on the traditional secrecy of the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (9), line 26, to delete &ldquo;April&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;February&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small but significant amendment. At present Departmental accounts are prepared <Col N="1400" /> on a calendar year basis &mdash; they start on 1 January and terminate on 31 December. The Bill proposes that all spending Departments must submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General before 1 April.  That is an unduly long period.  A greater degree of expedition needs to be introduced into the system, and I propose that the date be brought forward to 1 February.  I know that the civil servants will oppose this proposal as it means more demands would be put on them and they would have to act more promptly.  However, I believe the benefits of bringing the date forward to 1 February would be seen throughout the system.  Under the present system, the Comptroller and Auditor General does not complete his review of the accounts until the autumn, the report has then to be published and the Committee of Public Accounts do not have the opportunity to look at it until the end of the year.  This means that the process of accountability is historic; the examination takes place almost a year after the expenditure has occurred.  We need to expedite the process whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General receives the accounts and produces his report and the Committee of Public Accounts commences work.  The clear impression is that the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General start work long after the horse has bolted.  This, of course, is of no comfort to the taxpayer who has to foot the bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The date for the submission of appropriation accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General is being brought forward in the Bill from 30 April to 31 March.  It must be borne in mind that a number of Departments will sometimes have to wait for accounts from different offices before they are in a position to present their accounts.  While we are in a position to bring forward the date by one month at this stage it is not possible to meet the date proposed by Deputy Yates in his amendment. Improvements are either being effected or are envisaged in the system.  Section 3 <Col N="1401" /> (12) provides that the Minister may, by order, vary the date and it is envisaged that we will be able to continue to shorten the time for the submission of accounts. We are trying to meet the spirit of the Deputy's proposal.  In view of this, perhaps he will withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (10) (b), line 42, after &ldquo;safeguarding of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the maximisation of the benefits derived from&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on Departments and agencies which receive money from the Exchequer to not only safeguard money but also to maximise its use.  When I was Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I was somewhat astonished to find that, while the private sector was busily exploiting the property boom during that period, as it has done during the preceding period, CIE and the Post Office, who had extensive property assets, did not maximise the use of that property.  A great opportunity to bring in revenue by the proper use of these assets was lost.  Although authorities are more alert to these possibilities today, they are still not nearly alert enough.  We should put an onus on public Departments and other agencies to whom this Bill applies to maximise the potential of the assets at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the point that has just been made by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  There is an obvious impact from maximising benefits in this area.  I can think of an example where the opposite happened when the IDA were forced, because of Government policy at the time, to sell off many of their land banks when the land boom was over when huge losses were sustained, even on the <Col N="1402" /> original prices paid for the land.  The point Deputy Mitchell is making is that whenever the opportunity occurs to maximise assets, it should be seized. Nothing should be allowed to remain static or wrapped in cotton wool and left to one side.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is looking for value for money. This directly encompasses that concept of getting value for money on an ongoing basis.  I support the amendment that has been put down here and I think it should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points the Deputies are making.  We all want to ensure maximum benefit from public expenditure of any kind.  It is considered, however, that the provision in section 9 of the Bill, giving the Comptroller and Auditor General full power to carry out examinations of the economy and efficiency of all Departments and bodies audited by him or her under this Bill or under any other Act, confers full powers which will cover the point Deputies are trying to make.  Therefore, the words the Deputies want to add are redundant.  We feel that the formulation of the Bill, as drafted, covers the point in the best wording possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not absolutely convinced that it is adequate.  Certainly, my experience as a Minister taught me that civil servants adhere to the letter of the law and confine themselves to what is specifically required by law &mdash; and with good reason.  If they do not they are likely to be tripped up and asked why they had done something when they did not have specific authority to do so.  Adding the word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; or similar words will impose that specific additional responsibility on Departments and agencies covered by this Bill not only to make sure that money is not used fraudulently or inefficiently but to take advantage of developments and, where possible, to maximise the assets and revenue of such body.  In the Department in which I was a Minister huge opportunities were lost to engage in joint ventures, etc. which would have brought in money and saved <Col N="1403" /> money for the Exchequer.  I know CIE is not covered by this Bill, but when this city was going through a phase of building office blocks CIE left expensive sites lying fallow and derelict.  Yet they needed subvention from this House of as much as £109 million per year, although they had the potential to use their assets to better effect to bring in a flow of funds and thereby ease the demand on the taxpayer and on the Exchequer.  I would ask the Minister to at least consider this point and see if there is a better formulation she could bring forward on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice I have is that the wording in section 9 empowers the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out such examinations as he or she considers appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining whether the resources of the Department, person, body or fund have been used, acquired or disposed of economically and efficiently, that the powers already cover the kind of point the Deputy is trying to make and that this is the best way of phrasing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section. While I am on my feet I want to pay tribute to the Secretary of the Department, Mr. Seán Cromien.  As Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee I found him very accommodating and understanding.  He never went beyond what was proper for him to do but was generous within that and certainly very accessible.  I grew to respect him very much in his role as accounting officer. During his time he did accept the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee that the finance accounts be modernised, and they were modernised. He brought back the new format of the <Col N="1404" /> finance accounts to the Public Accounts Committee, and that is something I would like to express my appreciation of, because the finance accounts are now more readable.  Hitherto they were not so readable because there were so many notes, etc.  Perhaps they could be looked at again to try to make them even more user friendly.</P>
      <P>Whereas the Comptroller and Auditor General audited the constituent parts of the finance accounts, he never actually audited the finance accounts and put a certificate on them until now.  It is a good principle and a good idea because the whole of the finance accounts will be there together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I would like to stress is that the Comptroller and Auditor General should not just audit the expenditure but should audit and report on any loss of revenue.  He does that very well where he is aware of it.  Let me give an example. One of the great scandals that did not get the coverage it should have got was in relation to the belief that somebody had decided to sell off Telecom Éireann and to commission a privatisation report without any ministerial sanction and without the consent of the accounting officer of the Department of Finance. This was an asset, no less an asset than a typewriter, a computer or a land bank owned by the State and the accounting officer should be every bit as accountable to the Public Accounts Committee for the sale of that asset as he would be for the sale of a bit of land, a computer or anything else.  Yet he was not aware of this, perhaps because somebody had decided off their own bat to commission a privatisation report from somebody they knew with a view to selling off an asset. That is something that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be empowered to look into and report on.  Who would have the authority to do such a thing?  I recall doing an interview for &ldquo;Today at Five&rdquo; in which they said that later on in the programme they would have the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee who had done an interview, but that interview disappeared and I never found out why that happened.  Of <Col N="1405" /> all the controversies that came before this House, that one got away.  That controversy had the capacity to be the most scandalous &mdash; that someone could take a personal decision in relation to an asset that belongs to the people of this country and that the accounting officer of a Department had authority to report that but did not do so, not because of any fault on his part or a failure of the legislation.  It is very clear that in that instance correct procedures were not followed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should, in reporting on the Finance Accounts, scan commercial State bodies, which will no longer be within his remit, to ensure that they are not cutting across the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General or accounting officers, specifically in relation to the disposal of shares or assets which are properly within the ownership of the State.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome section 4, which extends significantly the roles of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts to the Finance Accounts as revised.

In relation to the attempt being made by interests in Telecom to privatise the company, any such proposal would, of course, have to go before the relevant Minister and the Government. No semi-State body is authorised to privatise itself.  That issue does not arise in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue may not arise in relation to the Bill, but the Minister must know that it arises this week, in that the Minister for Finance has confessed to the House that he had no role, good, bad or indifferent, in the proposal to sell off the State's remaining shareholding in Greencore.  Greencore executives were involved in seeking purchasers for that <Col N="1406" /> stake yet the Minister said that he first heard of it on 16 February.  The issue arose in the case referred to by Deputy Mitchell when he spoke about Telecom, leading to investigations into Telecom that unearthed a great deal more than an attempt to bring in consultants to prepare the company for privatisation.  It unearthed material that is still the subject of investigation, in respect of which great difficulty seems to have been encountered by the inspector.  The issue may not arise in the context of this Bill, but Deputy Mitchell has made a valid point. Perhaps the issue should arise in the Bill if it is within the capability of the House to make provision in that way.</P>

      <P>I am sure that my successor as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts will deal very ably with the Bill.  I was very privileged to have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts from 1981 and to have been its chairman for almost six years.  I should like to record my appreciation, as already expressed, to the Secretary of the Department of Finance, for the work of the <Col N="1407" /> various accounting officers with whom I have dealt.  In my time as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts my appreciation of the public service grew as I recognised their ability and commitment. In particular, I say a word of very special thanks and appreciation to the Comptroller and Auditor General, with whom I worked very closely, to his staff and the staff of the committee.  The Committee of Public Accounts was represented by every party, certainly the make-up of the House was reflected on the committee.  In all my time on the committee its members never divided on a party political basis.  Some of the issues dealt with by the committee were extremely difficult, particularly during the previous Dáil when the committee dealt with them very well.</P>
      <P>I wish also to record my appreciation of the role of the members of the committee. Certainly I got a lot of favourable comment &mdash; of course people knew I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; but other members of the committee gave me great leeway and there was a tremendous working relationship. The Committee of Public Accounts proves that, despite what is said about politicians, they can, when they put their minds to it, get together and do good work.  The Committee of Public Accounts discharges a very important function on behalf of this House.  Certainly in my time the committee had the co-operation of the Department of Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the staff of the House and of the committee itself in carrying out that function.  That appreciation should be placed on the record of the House.</P>

The Bill before the <Col N="1408" /> House today is a tribute to the work of the committee and its chairman.  It deals with issues raised by the Committee of Public Accounts and discussed with Deputy Gay Mitchell, as chairman of the committee, and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts has long pressed for a wider remit for the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the value for money audit, which is the central thrust of the Bill introduced in a positive spirit of co-operation.</P>

The House owes a great deal to the dedication and efficiency with which Deputy Mitchell conducted his chairmanship of that committee.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts was a working committee of the House in the best sense of the word.  As Deputy Mitchell said, some of the issues dealt with were controversial.  I particularly recall the Carysfort affair, which would have tested the wisdom of Solomon. Much skill was needed to steer a course through a Scylla and Charybdis and come out at the other end, which Deputy Mitchell managed to do.

At the time we were thousands of feet under ground at Tara Mines, inspecting whether the State had got a fair return for its stake, which had been disposed of just prior to our visit.  One of Deputy Mitchell's colleagues was responsible for having him summoned to one of the pit stops to take a telephone call for &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  Of course there was no such telephone call, and by the time Deputy Mitchell returned to the truck the rest of us had gone and had left him underground. That incident is not to be taken as any kind of comment on the very valuable work done by Deputy Mitchell for the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <P>I am not here to make a long presentation on that matter. If the Deputy has any specific questions <Col N="1411" /> in relation to that overall area they would be better tabled to the Minister for Agriculture. The relevant subsection makes statutory provision for the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the Irish operations of the guarantee section of FEOGA.  The House will be aware that we will be establishing an International Affairs Committee which will subsume the functions of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. That will afford Members an opportunity to tease out all sorts of detail in relation to FEOGA funds.  The provision in this Bill is merely to bring that particular audit under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>As I understand it the Department of Agriculture as an intervention agency is an agent for the European Communities.  Where the <Col N="1412" /> Department of Agriculture is involved, the provisions of section 4 provide for the audit of the accounts of transactions in the State in each financial year of the guarantee section of the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund as established by the Treaty of Rome and so on.

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a national scheme and would not be the subject of audit by the European Court of Auditors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that in the matter of export credit insurance, value for money and the risk involved, henceforth the Comptroller and Auditor General will have a role to play in analysing what was the value for money in regard to the attendant risk and the amount of money granted?  For example, if all of the money available under the export credit insurance scheme was given to one industry only, not just one company, <Col N="1413" /> could the Comptroller and Auditor General question why it was not given to others?</P>

Any issues arising under the Vote for that Department can be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and reported on to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one further question in relation to the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  We may need to tease out this section somewhat more on Report Stage and ascertain whether there is proper accountability in respect of export credit insurance and intervention and how they may relate improperly from time to time. Would the Minister say whether the provisions of this section cover the national lottery and disbursement of such funds? I am very concerned about the attitude obtaining in regard to the national lottery. Is it being assured that somehow it deals with unaccountable funds, that its funds are less rigidly spent and can be obtained more easily than normal Exchequer moneys?  The attitude appears to be: we will get it from the national lottery, as though they were not public moneys.  Can the Minister say whether the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in auditing the national lottery will be able to examine the efficacy and efficiency and indeed the justification for some or all of that expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard some hair-raising stories about the way money was spent; I have heard stories about Ministers at functions announcing a cheque would arrive the following day without any application for the money being made.  I have heard that two such instances occurred during the past year.  Frequently, it is paid under the guise of the national lottery as if money <Col N="1414" /> can be slipped through without anyone being held accountable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on that?  She stated that disbursements under the national lottery included in the Estimates will be subject to the terms of the Bill.  Are any disbursements under the national lottery not included in the Estimates and, if so, who has to account for them and in what manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The projects to which the Deputy referred are covered by the Estimates.  For example, youth and sport grants are covered in the Estimate for the Department of Education while amenity grants are covered in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  They will be subject to the terms of the Bill.  Everything, except operational costs, is covered by the Estimates and, therefore, will be subject to the terms of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Court of Auditors will be responsible for auditing European moneys disbursed here.  However, the export credit insurance scheme, for example, falls directly within the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and there is nothing to prevent him carrying out an assessment of the efficacy of that scheme.  In other words, to answer Deputy Yates's question, this major issue of concern to the beef tribunal could have been investigated by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General provided, of course, he had been given the basic facts.  For example, one would have to know &mdash; we still do not know this &mdash; when the export credit insurance scheme was revived.  No date for that can be found.  There are several other aspects of it which it would not be proper to go into now.  While we have to be very wary of <Col N="1415" /> the many people who criticised the cost of the beef tribunal and approached the issue with value laden judgments, this work could have been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General provided one had been given full and truthful answers to parliamentary questions and the information had been made available.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case also that there is nothing to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor General, or the Committee of Public Accounts suggesting to the Comptroller and Auditor General, that other instruments of economic policy be assessed in terms of value for money? For example, I recall the Comptroller and Auditor General in the last Dáil carrying out an audit report on the efficacy of section 84 based lending.  He dealt with the cost to the Exchequer, whether it was truly an instrument of industrial development and whether the lending institutions benefited most rather than the borrower and so forth.  Finally, may I inquire who will be accounting officer for Temple Bar Properties Limited?</P>

In that event it would seem that no accounting officer will be held accountable to this House, through the Committee of Public Accounts, for Temple Bar Properties Limited.  It may be that as a result of this legislation it will be the responsibility of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give notice that, to cover the points raised by Deputy Rabbitte, I <Col N="1417" /> intend to table two amendments on Report Stage to include Temple Bar Properties Limited in the First Schedule and to exclude it under the Second Schedule. Those amendments would have the effect of making Temple Bar Properties Limited answerable to this House through the Committee of Public Accounts.  The point made by Deputy Rabbitte is a valid and interesting one.</P>
    <P>The national lottery is not mentioned in any of the Schedules but An Post is. Under the Second Schedule it is excluded from the application of this Bill and, therefore, will not be covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position because the national lottery is deemed to be a subsidiary of An Post and it is excluded under the Second Schedule from application of sections 8 and 9? Would the Minister of State be prepared to include it in the Bill and within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>As the national lottery is a wholly owned subsidiary of An Post it is included, with An Post, in the Second Schedule.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies will have a role to play, I have tabled an amendment to reverse this decision and give the Comptroller and Auditor General a role in regard to the commercial State-sponsored bodies.  It is interesting that as we go through the Bill we can think of examples as to why he should have this role, notwithstanding the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored <Col N="1418" /> Bodies in this area.  We will be addressing this at a later stage but I do not believe that all the commercial side of the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be excluded from his remit.

There seems to be an odd relationship, to say the least, between Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and the Temple Bar renewal project which I understood also came within the remit of the Department of the Environment.  As one of the local representatives in the area people have been saying to me recently that the Temple Bar Council is unhappy with the close relationship between two semi-State bodies and the development of the area.  I would welcome any further information that the Minister of State could provide on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come into the House today with a detailed brief on every semi-State body listed in the Schedules.  I am not in a position to answer questions on the operational details of those bodies.  The principle adopted in this Bill &mdash; we will be coming to it in later sections &mdash; was that the commercial semi-State bodies would not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They would be in a position to obtain their own audit advice and the commercial auditors would have the normal duties of commercial auditors in any public company.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's function will be extended in relation to the areas which will be assigned to his responsibility.  That is the basic principle and thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section of an important Bill.  It deals with the question of which bodies will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take the point raised by <Col N="1420" /> Deputies Rabbittee and Cullen and other Deputies in relation to so-called commercial semi-State bodies, some of whom are in receipt of very substantial annual grants from the Exchequer.  Where there are substantial grants, as in the case of Córas Iompair Éireann, and the Exchequer may be subventing perhaps £100 million per year to that body, surely the Comptroller and Auditor General should have some residual inspection powers in respect of that money voted by the Oireachtas?  He may not necessarily have to audit such bodies but he should be able to report to the House on whether subvented money is being expended properly, efficiently and effectively.  Will the Minister agree to amend the Bill, if necessary, to grant the Comptroller and Auditor General inspection powers where substantial public funds are invested in State sponsored bodies designated as commercial?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The House through its Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies will have an opportunity to debate the functions of those bodies.  The thrust of this Bill is to bring into audit and to broaden the scope of audit of a variety of non-commercial companies which are in receipt of substantial public moneys dealt with under section 5 and listed in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The decision taken has been that the commercial semi-State bodies will be dealt with by the commercial auditors who have duties and responsibilities under law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (5), between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) The date specified under this subsection shall not be later than 6 months following the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 6 (5) states:</P>
      <P>(5) The accounts of a health board shall be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit on or before such date in the year following the financial year to which they relate as may stand specified for the time being by order made for the purposes of this section by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the specified date shall not be later than six months following the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate.  In this case it should not be more than six months after the expiry date of the financial year to which the accounts apply.  I consider that a reasonable provision bearing in mind what Deputy Yates and the Minister stated earlier about bringing forward the accounts of Departments to 1 April rather than 30 April.  Indeed, Deputy Yates wished to bring the date forward to the end of February or the beginning of March.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, the other amendments are similar.  One set of amendments relates to the health boards and the other set relates to the vocational education committees.  There is a dictum in law that justice delayed is justice denied and this could also be applied to accounts.  If accounts are delayed very often the focus on them is lost and real accountability may also be lost.  There is a need to have <Col N="1422" /> these accounts brought forward at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy is trying to achieve but in the circumstances the import of his amendments may not be the most effective way to do it.  If we specify a date in legislation it tends to be the date that will accommodate the slowest body in the system. While many bodies are operating computerised systems and are in a position to present returns very readily, some bodies still retain manual systems.  To specify a date that accommodates the slowest body may give the wrong signal to those who can readily present the information.  The way we will deal with this in the Bill is to specify that the dates will be set by regulation.  That is preferable.  Some bodies will be well able to have their accounts ready before six months and we hope to make progress in tightening the dates progressively by ministerial order. Realistically speaking, this is the best course to follow.</P>
      <P>In some cases it may be an improvement to have the information presented within a four month or six months period but I hope it will not be too long before we can expect an even better performance.  As soon as the Bill comes into effect ministerial orders will be made and the dates will be set as tightly as the Minister for Finance believes can be achieved.  A regular review of the dates of submission will be instituted with a view to achieving progressive improvements.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be taking on the audits of the vocational education committees and the health boards for the first time.  Also he may have views on what are appropriate submission dates and this needs to be taken into account.  Obviously he will be anxious that the accounts be presented to him as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the spirit of what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  I now give an undertaking to Members that we will endeavour to bring forward the dates as speedily as possible.  If we were to fix <Col N="1423" /> the date in legislation we would have to accommodate the slowest body in the system and that would not achieve what we are setting out to do, the speedy presentation of accounts and the speedy audit of them.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy J. Mitchell.  The Minister's point does not hold good.  If she still has ministerial powers she can shorten the timeframe and set an earlier date at a later time. Deputy Mitchell seeks to set an absolute limit of no more than six months.  I do not think there can be any reasonable excuse for not doing that.  At present there is no time limit on the submission of accounts by health boards.  When this goes beyond parliamentary scrutiny and accountability, the Minister might not be in the job and her assurances may then be worthless.  I think it is only reasonable that this modest time limit suggested by Deputy Mitchell should be what the House insists on.  If at a later date computerisation means that the timeframe can be shortened by way of ministerial order, that does not take from the point Deputy Mitchell is making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by previous speakers.  I very much welcome this section which provides for the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the accounts of the health boards.  This is long overdue.  Huge sums of State moneys are being dispersed to the health boards and this accounts for the largest budget of any Department. The Comptroller and Auditor General will spend a great deal of time in the short term examining this.  It is essential that a time limit be set.  As Deputy Yates said, it can always be shortened; but it is very important that a definitive date is stated to ensure that things happen as quickly as possible and meet the Comptroller and Auditor General's requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister may well know, all the assurances in the world need not necessarily ensure that things happen.  I would like to see a time constraint because it would act as a signal to the health boards <Col N="1424" /> that change will occur.  The opportunity exists in this Bill to set a time limit and I think a time limit should be set for the health boards, given the huge sums involved.  The time limit can always be foreshortened at some date in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment.  We in this House have to accept responsibility for what we put in this Bill and I think specifying a period of six months is reasonable.  Promises are not just good enough.  Several health boards, including the health board in my area, the Western Health Board, are suffering because at the end of the year they are often owed £3 million or £4 million by the Departments.  They are struggling to maintain services in spite of the fact that they may be owed this money for 12 months or more.  The figures are astronomical and cannot be allowed to continue. We must make provision for this in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect again on this group of reasonable amendments.  Anybody who has been a member of a local authority will know that audits have been delayed in many of the bodies referred to in this group of amendments by as long as three or four years.  When I was Minister for Transport I was astonished to find that many of the harbour authorities had not had an audit for four years.  That should not be the case.  That means there is no accountability for public funds.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Yates said, six months is the outside limit, and in a sense that is as much a restriction on the Minister as on the agencies concerned.  The Minister, if he or she sees fit, may shorten the period; so it is a little disingenuous of the Minister of State to say that the six months will become the latest date to become enshrined in the legislation.  It will not become the latest date if the Minister is determined that an earlier date will be required by order.</P>

      <P>I welcome the assurances the Minister has given in this regard.  I support her.  In view of the <Col N="1425" /> extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's powers in these areas is it envisaged that in the future, with the possible reorganisation of the health boards and, in the field of education, with the setting up of local education boards, his control will extend to all areas?  In the areas of health and education, voluntary bodies over which we have no control whatsoever spend huge amounts of State money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will reply to Deputy Broughan.  The principle of this Bill is to extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to local bodies which are not directly elected and which deal directly with substantial amounts of central Government funds.  I presume that principle will continue to apply in any reorganisation.  May I say to the Deputies opposite that I take very seriously the assurances I give to the House on speeding up the audits and they are given in good faith.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments relates to various bodies &mdash; from the Bray vocational education committee, which administers one school, to the health boards, including the Eastern Health Board, which deal with hundreds of millions of pounds.  There is a diversity of systems in place.  I know that in part of the Eastern Health Board manual accounting procedures are still in place, with obvious inherent delays.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General takes over the auditing function he will be as concerned as the Deputies to ensure that the accounts are presented speedily so that he can get to work on them.  I have given an assurance to this House that it is the solemn intention to shorten by regulation the timeframe to what we can humanly achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section the substantive issue &mdash; Deputy Cullen referred to this matter &mdash; relates to whether the accounts of health boards and vocational education committees should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The local government audit service currently audits these accounts.  All Deputies will have received a submission from the IMPACT trade union about this matter in which it raises some valid points as to the reason accounts of elected bodies are excluded from audit by the <Col N="1427" /> Comptroller and Auditor General while those of non-elected bodies such as health boards are included.  As a member of two local authorities, I do not agree with that.  All accounts should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the local government audit service comes into operation.  There is a strong case for giving assurances to staff about job preservation because we are talking about extending the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We should follow the route of the UK national audit office which audits all accounts.  That would give information relating to health boards in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, competitiveness and so on.  We need to regionalise and decentralise the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I agree that the local government audit service should be incorporated with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The local government audit service comes under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and is therefore in the public sector.  There is need to amalgamate these two offices; it would be a sensible and coherent move.  In that way local authorities, health boards and vocational education committees would work together in a uniform way and would know where they stand.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to clarify the position for the people working in the local government audit service.  What is their future role?  Liaison between the two offices is not sufficient.  Assurances need to be given in this regard, because on the one hand the Comptroller and Auditor General will say that as a result of the legislation he will need extra resources and staff, while people in the local government audit service who are currently carrying out the audit service for health boards do not know what their fortune is.  IMPACT have suggested that the system be left as it is.  There is merit in amalgamating the two offices, but at the same time must be safeguarded.  I believe it is possible to marry the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Detailed arguments have been put forward in the White Paper as to why the accounts of health boards and vocational education committees are included in the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General while those of local authorities are excluded.  Members of health boards should not be subject to less scrutiny than members of county councils &mdash; very often councillors are members of vocational education committees and health boards. This is a false distinction and it should be removed.  If there is a case to be made for accounts of health boards and vocational education committees to be excluded from audit by the local government audit service, the same case can be made in relation to accounts of urban councils, town commissions and county councils.  What is needed is a national office of the Comptroller and Auditor General covering all areas of the public service.  It is not sufficient to have a strong Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and a weak local government audit service.  The policy in this regard is <i>ad hoc</i> and in some ways this Bill will add to that problem.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give assurances about staff and to consider the question of amalgamating the two offices while at the same time decentralising and regionalising the system and applying uniform treatment for elected bodies, health boards and vocational education committees,</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A new section 17 is proposed which will give assurances in relation to staff.  It will provide for arrangements to be made for the transfer of staff from the local government audit service.  This relates to staff in general rather than to staff working on specific audits, as was the case in the previous section 17.  There will be flexibility in relation to recruiting staff to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General from the local government audit service. It is envisaged that in future there will be a regional dimension to the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle, as laid down and decided on by the Government, is that in <Col N="1429" /> dealing with local bodies that are not directly elected and the majority of whose funds come from central Government, the audits are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Most of the funds of health boards and vocational education committees come from central Government and there is need to account to this House for that money.  Roughly half the funding of local authorities, whose members are directly elected, is locally raised.  It was considered appropriate that the local government audit service would continue to audit the accounts of local authorities and that the reports would be answerable to the local elected members.  The distinction is drawn on the basis of whether the proportion of public funding comes primarily from this House or is raised locally.  As this House is the directly elected body dealing with the Votes for Health and Education, it is appropriate that the Comptroller and Auditor General report to this House on the accounts of vocational education committees and health boards.  There is a directly elected structure dealing with local authorities and a substantial amount of their money is raised locally rather than through central Government.  It is on that basis the Government decided to make a distinction between the two services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the future role of the local government audit service? This Bill clearly diminishes its role in that it will no longer deal with vocational education committees and health boards. I appreciate the point about the new section 17 in terms of assurances for staff. It is a little vague, but the unions will deal with that matter in negotiation and I understand consultation is taking place in that regard.  A pedantic approach has been taken in the distinction between elected and non-elected bodies.  In my experience members of local authorities comprise the majority membership of health boards and vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The domestic rate support grant, which comes directly from this House, is a vital part of public funding.  Therefore, the <Col N="1430" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's Office is entitled to know, for example, whether the ESB charges every local authority the same price for erecting public lights.  Is the cost of resurfacing trunk, county and minor roads the same throughout the country?  I am told that what is charged by contractors for bitumen and other substances varies greatly. These are areas of valid questioning that could be carried out by the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Only the Comptroller and Auditor General can get all the information and do a full analysis. The permanent presence the Comptroller and Auditor General has in Departments could work its way through local authorities so that we could get the inside story, which is the case in Departments at present.  Another example relates to the fire brigade service.  Is the cost of a fire brigade tender in Sligo the same as in Kerry, and if not, why?</P>
    <P>The question of value for money applies to all bodies and we should not distinguish between money spent by a local authority or a health board.  If local authorities are not given a local Government audit service, one might just as well close the service down.  We could use the skills and experience of those personnel by amalgamating the two offices and by not drawing this distinction.  All the powers of the local Government auditor to inspect local authorities could be retained.  All the local accountability of the members to the auditor can still be retained.  I do not seek to change what is good in the local Government audit service, but to bring some element of commonsense to it.  I disagree with the Minister's distinction with regard to funding and his comments on councillors.  In County Wexford I could name councillors who are members of the vocational education committee and the health board and they are either vigilant or neglilgent about public money right across the board, depending on their characters.</P>
    <P>At present 50 per cent of local authority funding comes from the Exchequer but a future Government could decide to <Col N="1431" /> have a property tax centrally paid in and then we would have a far larger proportion. This percentage changes and, in 1977, when rates were abolished, I am sure the figures were entirely different. We have seen the erosion of the domestic rates support grant.  The Minister should again look at this and in discussions with the personnel of the local Government audit service secure their future by combining the two services, so that we can get a proper league table of the most efficient &mdash; and inefficient &mdash; health board or local authorities because the taxpayer pays the bill for them all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Yates on the question of local authorities.  I want to see the primary of elected authorities strengthened. In the context of this Bill, I see the merit of allowing local authorities to retain the local government audit service.</P>
      <P>Another point which is probably more important is where we go from here in the context of what is happening in this Bill to the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Without allowing for it in this Bill, we are heading towards a national service that should be in control throughout the country with a strong regional input from the various services. It is unnecessary and unhelpful to create a distinction between the local government audit service and the national service. The existence of a unified strong body would facilitate the easier flow of information and there would be better value for money, particularly at local level.  We should have a national unit with a separate strong regional focus under the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Bill is pushing us down that road without necessarily dealing with the outcome.  A future Bill in this area will probably be along those lines.  Despite the definitions and the differences being created and the substantial weakening of the local Government audit service, by removing the health boards and the vocational education committees from its remit, with which I agree, what is left should not be necessaarily on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> The answer to that difficulty is to have one effective national unit with a strong regional basis.  Unquestionably the flow of information necessary to pinpoint value for money would become easier under a national service.  That should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in this matter and I welcome the insertion in section 17.  The last thing we want is to extend the dead hand of the Department of the Environment further into local authorities.  In the premier local authority of which I am a member only a small proportion of income comes from central Government.  We provide the vast bulk of our own income.  The local audit service should audit our work at first hand.  I agree with the Minister that there is a democratic surplus in relation to local authorities which, in the Dublin area, does not apply to the health boards and the vocational education committees. There should be as much scope as possible for local decision making and control.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government, in another area of the Minister's responsibility will look seriously at extending the powers and facilities of local councillors.  The strengthening of local Government would benefit our economy.  I support the general drift of this amendment.  Our locally elected democratic councils should look after their own financial affairs.  The inputs from central Government can be looked through the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>Ultimately this is a matter of policy.  The White Paper and the Bill respect the local nature of accountability in the elected local authorities where, as Deputy Broughan said, a substantial amount of the money is generated locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new procedures will allow the local government audit service to concentrate on a uniform class of local authorities rather than working with health boards, vocational education committees and local authorities.  That will allow the development of custom built value for <Col N="1433" /> money audit within the local government audit service.  The Government has agreed to a formalised strengthening of the existing liaison arrangements between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the local government audit service.  It is interesting to note that the Committee of Public Accounts in the 1988 special report did not recommend the audit of local government by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Broughan, I would be the last to extend the dead hand of the Department of the Environment at the expense of councillors, but the issue here is the Comptroller and Auditor General versus the local government auditor.  I fear for the jobs of the people in the local government audit service and an amalgamation of the two offices would be the best way to secure those jobs.

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) Accounts of elected local authorities (other than those which may be audited by him under other provisions of this Act) shall be audited <Col N="1435" /> by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the manner provided in section 6.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, references in section 6 to a vocational education committee and to the Minister for Education shall be construed as references to a local authority and to the Minister for the Environment, respectively.</P>
    <P>(3)  Fees under section 12 shall not be chargeable by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of audits under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have just debated whether local authorities should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I have made the point that the local government audit service should be amalgamated with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Minister of State said this was a policy question.  We now have a Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1992 &mdash; the previous Bill was in 1966 &mdash; and I hope it will not be as long again before policy is reviewed.  There should be an ongoing review of policy if the taxpayer is to get value for money.  It may transpire that the move of health boards and vocational education committees under the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General service, as opposed to the local government audit service, is a success.  As spokesman on transport I was unable to elicit from the Minister for the Environment satisfactory information in relation to cost comparisons between local authorities, and that information is absolutely essential.  As spokesman on health I had a similar experience.  I recall that the price paid for eggs, cotton wool and laundry &mdash; non-medical items &mdash; varied enormously between the eight health boards.  There were some hospitals where the heaters were on full blast and the windows wide open.  Those hospitals were very inefficiently run.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will discover exactly which health boards are well run and <Col N="1436" /> which are not.  A county councillor in Letterkenny cannot know whether his county manager is doing as good as or a better job than his Cork counterpart as he does not have the information.  No matter how vigilant he is as a local public representative he does not have the data available to him to enable him make cost comparisons of that kind.  On the policy side, emphasis has been laid on the liaison which will take place between the local government audit service and the Comptroller and Audit General service. I would ask the Minister and the Department to keep an open mind on policy in this area.  If the need evolves for a uniformity of costings or improvements in efficiency, there are some very good managers in health boards who have obtained efficiencies for which they have been badly rewarded by the Department of Finance.  If they have underused their expenditure the estimate for the following year is reduced and this can act as a distincentive in the system.  I am happy to withdraw my amendment because we have discussed the principle contained in it.  I would ask the Minister of State that the whole question of the local authorities would be reviewed because councillors, no matter how vigilant, do not have the resources to know how effective or efficient their local authority is as opposed to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already discussed at some length the point of principle. Under section 9, as part of the value for money examination, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be in a position to examine the steps taken in the Department of the Environment to ensure that their disbursements to local authorities are economic and efficient and that the Department has adequate arrangements to appraise the effectiveness of that expenditure.  That will give a role in relation to supervising Exchequer disbursements to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unified local government audit service will be in a position, particularly if it is concentrating on just one aspect of local authorities, to look at value for <Col N="1437" /> money in relation to, for instance, roads, drainage operations, parks and so on. Because it will have a more homogenous set of functions, the local government audit service may be in a good position to provide the kind of overview Deputy Yates is seeking in terms or comparing one local authority with another.  That is the function of the local government audit service.</P>

      <P>Out of £10.5 billion of public expenditure there are areas of fat in the system. Because of the retrenchment of public expenditure from 1987 to 1989 I do not accept that everything is pared to the bone.  There are areas of overlap, duplication and waste, though marginal in some cases.  Even a marginal change, resulting in an efficiency of 2 per cent could save £200 million, and that is a lot of money.  I am not saying the waste is widespread but in terms of this volume of expenditure there is no reason it could not be pared down in some way.  One way of discovering where the waste is and where substantial savings could be made is to insert a provision in the Bill to require the Comptroller and Auditor General to include in his annual report to the Committee of Public Accounts cost comparisons in the provision of public services between the public and private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> In the case of local authorities, cost comparisons can be made between direct labour schemes and contract. These are matters of fact rather than opinion.  I have no ideology, sentiment or any other reason for making this point.  I am merely seeking value for money.  Such procedure is applied in many areas.  For example, is there an accepted level of absenteeism in the public sector whereby people feel they are entitled to so many days off each year on grounds of illness?  There is no disability benefit system for civil servants. I would be very interested in a study on the level of absenteeism from sickness in the public sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector.  It is suggested sometimes that because people are allowed so many days sick leave per year, without question, they take those days.  People who do not avail of such sick leave, sometimes regarded as one of the perks in the public sector, are regarded as not being as cute as they might be.  Of course, such a study might reveal that the public sector is more efficient than the private sector and that the private sector is profiteering on contracts. Nevertheless, there is no basis for drawing conclusions one way or the other on such issues in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    <P>Local government audited reports do not carry out a proper analysis.  They basically state that the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed and, in the historic nature of accounting, the audit is correct. They do not address the detailed question of value for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but a management consultancy role might be carried out in private sector companies.  In other words, an auditor might highlight the need for a management analysis of particular areas, and in the private sector one pays for what one gets.  The average sole trader or small company for £1,500 will merely want their accounts audited for tax purposes but large companies may require an accountant's report detailing <Col N="1439" /> points in relation to efficiency, cost savings and on on.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 proposes the insertion of a new section whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General should include a comparison of costs in his report to ascertain where potential savings can be made.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should report to this House so that we are more informed about the way in which public expenditure is examined. We are elected on behalf of the taxpayers to spend their money and we should have access to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In any Department, the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with one of four topics.  In other words, in the Department of Agriculture he might deal with the TB scheme and not with the intervention scheme.  In a cursory way, I would like him to include in his studies some element of comparison between the two sectors.  I would like him to be able to say, having analysed all the areas, he may not be able to stand over the relative costings between one local authority and another in regard to, for example, fire services, public lighting, road resurfacing and house repairs.  In regard to house repairs, some years ago we sold half of our local authority houses, but have we halved the number of staff in the housing administration and repair sections of all local authorities?  Perhaps we should not do that because of the backlog of repairs, but if the number of houses to be repaired is halved, we should not need the same number of people to repair them.  As a shadow Minister it is not possible for me to determine the truth about any of those issues.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the overall philosophy of the office procedures of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are historical and deal only with the question of accuracy, establishing if the money was spent as appropriated by this House and whether any fraud was involved.  That is valid and necessary, but we need to go further and have an informed debate in regard to getting value for money.  The Minister may say that project audit reports are produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> Last year only two such reports were produced, one relating to the BES scheme and the other on the collection of TV licences.  That is a pathetic record for an office dealing with an expenditure of £10.5 billion and I am not being disrespectful to the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office in saying that.  That is not even scratching the surface of accountability regarding value for money.  It is a joke.</P>
    <P>I would like a new office of public expenditure controller established which could give advice on current and future expenditure.  In the next ten years there will be a reduction in the number of pupils in our educational system.  We will have more teachers than pupils, and that is desirable.  There may be a strong case for lowering the pupil-teacher ratio; but if that results in more sabbaticals and teacher training will we get value for money?  What would be the demographic dividend to the taxpayer if we did not use the money for what is intended by the teachers' union?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>I do not disagree with the principle of reducing the pupil/teacher ratio or appointing more remedial teachers, but it is reasonable to ask what the taxpayer would have got if we had not done those things.  We must have an informed debate on public expenditure control but the reality is that a few academic economists, perceived as Thatcherite killjoys, take a sadistic macho pleasure in cutting public expenditure while we have very well articulated, well reasoned genuine cases for increased expenditure.  We must have an independent office which would report to this House on how we might get value for money.  If we need to cut public expenditure we should do so in a way that impacts least on the public and provides better administration and value for money.  There is a major gap in our public offices in this regard and those two modest proposals in my amendment are worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>Much of what the Deputy proposes in his amendment would be possible under the terms of the Bill.  In regard to Government Departments, section 3 (10) provides the Comptroller and Auditor General with ample scope to comment on his reports and the comparisons which he has made. As regards bodies listed in the First Schedule &mdash; health boards, vocational education committees and bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; section 11 (2) (a) (ii) of the Bill empowers the Comptroller and Auditor General to report on any general matters which he wishes to raise.  Comparative studies could clearly be reported on under this section and it would be a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out such comparisons as he deemed useful.</P>
      <P>As regards comparisons between public institutions and private companies, the Comptroller and Auditor General has no special rights of access to private bodies unless they are substantially dependent on public funding. It would be inappropriate to provide any powers of access in this Bill.  There will of course be nothing to prevent the Comptroller and Auditor General drawing conclusions in regard to any information on private sector operations which he can obtain on a voluntary basis for that purpose.  Indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General already does this.  His recent project audit report on stores control draws comparisons between the public service and private sector.  Such information tends to be of a general nature &mdash; for example, regarding good management systems and good practice.  Having regard to those considerations, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a once-off opportunity to legislate in this area and because we have an excellent Comptroller and Auditor General at present, we should not assume that we will always have somebody as enthusiastic as the present office holder.  If the Minister believes that section 3 (10) is appropriate in regard to <Col N="1442" /> what should be contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, I would ask her to consider inserting a paragraph (e) that would allow him freedom, would not question his entitlement to make private and public sector comparisons and allow that area to be extended.  The stores and management report was one of two published in that year.  While it was significant and will have future benefits, it is only an example of the possibilities of what the Comptroller and Auditor General can investigate. There is no doubt that the new policies of stock control should be applied &mdash; in other words of not having hoards of Garda helmets or whatever in storage &mdash; and adopting the principle of &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; management in regard to running stock controls on a much tighter cash flow basis.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, in the business world the one thing that discriminates the private sector from the public sector is that it must be competitive in order to survive.  That is its defining principle.  A business will go out of business if it is not competitive.  We are dealing here with areas of public administration which do not have to be competitive &mdash; no one can put them out of business, no one is even considering doing that and no one will do so in the future.  I am not upset about this.  The point is that the lack of a competitive and tendering environment in many areas of the public service means there is a need for greater scrutiny.  I am happy to withdrawn my amendment on the understanding that the Minister will consider including a specific provision in a new paragraph (e) in section 3 (10) which would give the Comptroller and Auditor General the scope to go further in the area of cost comparisons, which, as the Minister said, he has already initiated.</P>

As I understand it, the section gives this latitude to the Comptroller and Auditor General without imposing a specific obligation on him.  The general framework of value for money audits implies that <Col N="1443" /> people look at value in a comparative way.  That is part of the general remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would prefer to have a more general form of wording than the specific wording proposed by the Deputy.  The Deputy's point has been well made, and I will look at the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the accounts, books and other records of any person for a financial year of the person in which the person received any moneys from a person to which subsection (1) (b) applies or from a Minister of the Government or a Department or directly from the Central Fund if the amount or the aggregate of the amounts received constitutes not less than 50 per cent, of the gross receipts of the person in that year,</P>
      <P>(d) the accounts, books and records of any person for a financial year at the end of which not less than 50 per cent, of the equity share capital of the person has been financed by a Minister of the Government or a Department or the Central Fund or by any combination thereof:</P>
      <P>Provided, however, that the provisions of section 12 shall not apply to any inspection under paragraph (c) or (d).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking in these amendments to extend the inspection rights conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General in section 8 to the accounts of bodies, persons <Col N="1444" /> and organisations which rely on public moneys for more than 50 per cent of their revenue.  These are reasonable amendments.  The giving of money to the Red Cross in 1970 in relation to the arms trial could be investigated by a sub-committee of this House because it was a grant-in-aid.  As I understand it, if a grant-in-aid is not spent within the calendar year it can be spent the next year while a grant <i>per se</i> given in the calendar year is not subject to this type of inspection. We either have a principle of accountability and transparency or we do not.  If people want public money it must be open to public scrutinty.  I am zealous about achieving efficiency in the public sector, but I am no less enthusiastic about ensuring efficiency in terms of private bodies, persons and organisations which also receive public money.  The Minister's proposals in this regard is a bit watered down and it needs to be beefed up somewhat.</P>
    <P>These amendments do not propose to impose a necessity on the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out such inspections.  I would make the point that another Bill dealing with the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General may not be introduced during our lifetime. The nature of legislation is that it seeks to deal with as many issues as possible at one time so that it is not necessary to deal with it again for some time.  Therefore, it is important that we avail of this opportunity to give the Comptroller and Auditor General these extra powers of inspection.  I do not think there is any reasonable excuse for not accepting these amendments, particularly amendment No. 22.</P>
    <P>The other amendments deal with the same point.  They include different riders such as a resolution of the Dáil and other regulations which may be established for the purposes of such inspection.  The principle of public money being subject to public accountability is a valid one. How the money is given or by whom it is given is not a valid reason for exempting one from the inspection process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 26 is <Col N="1445" /> very broad in its implication.  We touched on this issue earlier in the debate.  It mainly related to the Second Schedule.  I am not satisfied, for all the reasons I outlined earlier and others, that commercial semi-State bodies should effectively be excluded from any inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General. If it is legitimate for him to inspect non-commercial State companies then it should be even more legitimate for him to look at the operation of semi-State companies in the commercial sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that a committee of the House examines the commercial sector.  However, this committee does not have the specific role and authority of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I do not understand why companies such as NET and Aer Lingus should not be subject to inspection.  Such inspections would be helpful in terms of achieving value for money and would enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a comparison between semi-State bodies and how money is spent.  It would also enable him to have an overview of how similar systems operate in various companies and see which ones are giving the best value for money and working properly.  He would then be in a position to make judgments and suggest changes which could lead to substantial savings, cost efficiency, effectiveness, best practice in business, best use of economies of scale and so on.  These matters should come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is wrong to exclude the commercial semi-State sector from inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to Córas Iompair Éireann, a huge conglomerate involved in the provision of transport, which was broken down into Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann and the possible welcome development of a rapid transit system in Dublin.  If £110 million-£115 million of State funds, not to mention hidden subsidies which could amount to £40 million-£60 million, is given to those companies I do not understand why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be given the power to inspect them.  He, or she as may be the <Col N="1446" /> case in the future, should have the power to investigate such companies.</P>
    <P>What the Comptroller and Auditor General may see when inspecting the non-commercial companies may be applicable equally to companies in the commercial area and <i>vice versa.</i> In confining the inspection role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to non-commercial companies, it presupposes that somehow there is no relationship to the activities carried out in the commercial semi-State companies. It would be wrong to make a presumption. Issues such as the systems used, best practices and the utilisation of resources are equally applicable regardless of which side of the line companies are on.  Giving the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to inspect commercial semi-State companies would strengthen his position and the position of his office.  If his office is to develop along the lines referred to earlier it is very important that the Comptroller and Auditor General be given the power to inspect the commercial semi-State sector also.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes that this section should apply to all bodies and persons, including those specified in the Second Schedule other than local authorities. This proposal could be made more specific by stating the companies which should be looked at.  However, I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor General should as a point of principle be excluded from inspecting commercial semi-State companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 would extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to cover bodies receiving money from organisations which are funded directly from public funds, or where 50 per cent of their equity share capital is publicly owned.  This would include bodies receiving grants from the IDA, Bord Fáilte, Bord Tráchtála and other such State agencies and would also cover the commercial State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believes that bodies funded directly by Departments on an <Col N="1447" /> annual basis who are receiving over 50 per cent of their funding should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Section 8 (1) (b) of the Bill makes provision accordingly for the inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General of such bodies.  However, the Government considers that it would be better for the present if the Comptroller and Auditor General, in the context of the widening of his remit for which this Bill provides, concentrated his efforts on the arrangements within those agencies for monitoring the operations of bodies receiving grants from them rather than inspecting the recipient bodies himself. He will be empowered to do this by section 9 of the Bill.  This would be a better and indeed a more cost effective, approach than for the Comptroller and Auditor General to dissipate his efforts in inspecting the recipients of grants from State agencies.  If he is dissatisfied with the procedures in agencies for monitoring the expenditure of bodies to which they make payments from public funds, he would certainly be able to report on that. As a general point, I would be concerned at the possibility that the general effectiveness of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be weakened, by his officers directly pursuing public moneys beyond those agencies which are assigned the responsibility of issuing grants.  In other words, it is the responsibility of individual agencies to make sure, where they are disbursing money, that they have procedures in place for ensuring it is done effectively.  If the control were to move from, say, the Department of Enterprise and Employment back to the Comptroller and Auditor General, we would be likly to see a dilution of control.  It is up to the Department of Enterprise and Employment or the IDA to see that they have procedures in place for chasing moneys where they are disbursing them to organisations.</P>
    <P>In regard to paragraph (d) in the amendment, this would cover all the State bodies, commercial and non-commercial. All the non-commercial State bodies, whose equity share capital is provided <Col N="1448" /> by the State, will of course, be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, the Bill provides for the audit of their subsidiaries by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is intended that all future non-commercial semi-State bodies will also be subject to these provisions.  Since this will place a statutory obligation on the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit all the non-commercial State bodies, the question of inspection will not arise.</P>
    <P>In regard to the commercial State bodies, to which amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26 also refer, there are weighty arguments against taking this step even though it may appear superficially attractive.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) of the Bill provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall not inspect the commercial State bodies or their subsidiaries as outlined in the Second Schedule.  The Committee of Public Accounts, in their 1988 Special Report, recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be relieved of the responsibility for those few commercial bodies which at that time were still audited.</P>
    <P>The core constitutional function of the Comptroller and Auditor General relates to departmental expenditure, the extension of his role to cover bodies which are dependent on an ongoing basis on voted funds is a logic extension.  Furthermore, the involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General could merely dilute the responsibility and, ultimately, the legal liability of the private sector auditors in carrying out a full, objective and professional audit.  Involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General would also greatly complicate the relationship between these bodies and their auditors and could inhibit the auditors from giving the type of forthright commercial advice and services which auditing firms are generally now in a position to offer.  It would also tend to dissipate the Comptroller and Auditor General's resources and distract his attention from matters relating to his core constitutional role.  It would tend to lead to constant pressure on the <Col N="1449" /> Comptroller and Auditor General to police the commercial State sector and to be involved in contentious matters which are properly the province of the Ministers concerned answering directly to Dáil Éireann, the Garda, the DPP or the courts.</P>
    <P>In addition the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in examining the economy, efficiency and management effectiveness of Departments will, of course, also involve him in examining the arrangements in Departments for monitoring the operation and performance of commercial semi-State bodies under their aegis.  This general approach is likely to be more productive than a direct involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance book &ldquo;Public Financial Procedures&rdquo;, which is sent to all accounting officers on their appointment, sets down Departments' responsibilities in regard to bodies under their aegis.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential that a clear framework exists (whether administratively or legislatively or both) within which proper control and accountability mechanisms are working to ensure that public funds are used effectively, that they are accounted for properly and that reporting to the responsible Ministers and to the Oireachtas is timely, accurate and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>In his examination of Departments the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to check whether such a clear framework is in place.</P>
    <P>One of the most important considerations is that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies is given wide-ranging terms of reference which help to ensure that commercial State bodies are already accountable to Parliament.  Involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General would lead to subsequent involvement by the Committee of Public Accounts in this area, an unnecessary duplication of effort by two Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> In a case where there is agreement in this House that the Comptroller and Auditor General should report to the House on a matter, a resolution can be passed in this House to that effect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25, is largely consequential on amendments Nos. 23 and 24 which have already been referred to. With regard to the final paragraph of this amendment, I would draw the attention of the House to section 7 (2) of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923, which is being retained, which provides that it shall be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to Dáil Éireann on such matters and at such times as shall, from time to time, be prescribed by law or by resolution of Dáil Éireann.  This provision has not, to my knowledge, been used in the history of the State and I consider it would be used only in most exceptional circumstances having regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's independent position as a constitutional officer of the State. Nonetheless, it clearly provides a mechanism for this House to deal with exceptional matters which may be of such general concern that it would seem appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate and report to the House on such a matter. The proposal in this amendment to refer to this power is, therefore, unnecessary as the power sought is already available and a resolution can set down, as appropriate in each case, the terms of reference for the Comptroller and Auditor General when preparing his report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be hard on the Minister. I never cease to be amazed at the ability of Ministers to read prepared data which seems so removed from a proper discharge of his or her responsibilities. The Minister has a mind of her own and she must ask about the LEADER programme, what happened in Tipperary, to Aer Lingus Holidays, whether the system works, and whether parent Departments give answers or have adequate controls. This is a very modest proposal to grant inspection rights to someone who, <Col N="1451" /> uniquely in the Constitution, reports to this House.  We are talking about Deputies' rights.  The Minister is a Deputy; she got the highest number of votes in the election.  Surely it makes sense to her that she is accountable to the people of South Dublin?  Nobody else is accountable to them in this context.</P>
      <P>The Minister should count the organisations on the Second Schedule, 31 are mentioned.  Even with a zealous chairman such as the previous one, Senator Roche, it will not get around 31 different bodies to see what is happening.  The system, as it is, does not work, and there has been a modest proposal that, in areas where this House is not satisfied, the Comptroller and Auditor General should have the right to inspect.  For example, in relation to Tipperary Enterprises £0.5 million vanished without trace, all sorts of people may have got money to which they were not entitled.  We are just looking for the reasonable right to inspect.  The amount that vanished in the case of Aer Lingus Holidays is £70 million.  I went to a lot of trouble with the management of Aer Lingus.  I asked questions in the Dáil to try to get some answers and I found a maze.  Aer Lingus said it was suing the auditors of its accounts.  It also said it was not happy with its management accountancy practices and that they have been changed.  When I asked questions I was told that the Minister is not directly responsible.  There was a complete clamp-down and a file is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions because it is alleged that the people in Aer Lingus may have been involved in some matter which caused the loss of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my written reply to Deputy Bruton on 11 March, the powers and functions of the proposed employment protection unit are the subjects of wideranging consultations between my Department, the relevant State agencies and the social partners.  These consultations will be concluded shortly and, in the light of all the information and suggestions for the operation of the unit emerging from these consultations and having regard to job protection mechanisms in operation in other countries, I will give detailed consideration to the powers and functions appropriate to the proposed employment protection unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I would not envisage that the employment protection unit would reactivate the functions of Fóir <Col N="1458" /> Teoranta or that it would act as a vehicle for channelling State equity into small companies experiencing temporary cash flow problems.  Its role would be essentially of an advisory nature.</P>
    <P>The development of an integrated early warning system will obviously be an essential component of an employment protection service and the consultations undertaken by my Department to date have given detailed consideration to this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister has provided no funds for the unit in the coming year and that one of the Ministers of State said an early warning system was already in place? Despite this we have witnessed 2,000 redundancies, a growth of 25 per cent in redundancies within a fortnight, yet we do not appear to have any idea from Government as to what precisely this unit is to do about these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first question I should say there are sufficient funds available within the generality of my Estimate to staff this protection unit.  Second, in respect of the numbers of redundancies that have been notified and the fact that a colleague of mine referred to the fact that we have an early warning system &mdash; which is correct &mdash; I should say that the IDA provide an early warning monitoring system for companies with which they have direct contact, they having received grants from the IDA.  I might add that it is a condition of receipt of grants from the IDA that companies notify them of any changes in their levels of employment.  I do not think there is any difficulty in relation to the establishment of this unit.  The details of this unit will be finalised after a meeting with the social partners scheduled for Tuesday next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is something of a pretence to talk about a jobs protection unit which will be in a position only to offer advice. Are we not smothered with advisory bodies, in the Minister's proposed reorganisation <Col N="1459" /> of industrial activity, through his numerous national enterprise boards?  Would he not accept that people expected direct assistance in some shape or form, to be given to companies in trouble, to emerge from this unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The essence of the job protection unit is to provide an early warning system, advance notice, so that preventive action &mdash; whatever that might be &mdash; can be taken in sufficient time.  It may involve technological changes, additional finance, a change in work practices, a whole range of things, the most important common denominator being that adequate notice be given in sufficient time to effect the necessary changes.  It is that, and that only, that would be the remit of the employment protection unit at this time.  I do not want to pre-empt the final outcome of consultations with the many people directly involved and which are due to be finalised next week. Thereafter we can establish the unit and ascertain how it functions.  If it needs to be improved or is not doing the task we all want it to do, we will re-examine it and ensure that it works in the manner in which we want it to work.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to parliamentary questions on 11 March 1993 by the Minister for Finance about the jobs fund under the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I will be making an input to decision making at Government level on the approval of projects which will arise for consideration in the context of both the Public Capital Programme and the environmental and transport infrastructure developments to be assisted under the Cohesion Fund.  Primary responsibility for the assessment of such projects obviously will be a matter for <Col N="1460" /> the Minister in whose areas of competence the projects will arise.</P>
    <P>So far as my Department is concerned, the Government is providing additional resources in the context of the overall Jobs Fund in 1993 for the establishment of County Enterprise Partnership Boards.  An allocation of £25 million for spending via the CEPB's this year is being included in the Vote of my Department to be published in the 1993 Revised Estimates Volume and, as a voted expenditure item, will be subject to standard Government statutory and accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the outcome of the review of the establishment procedures, structure and staffing of these boards, which is currently taking place following the transfer of responsibility for this area to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, I should emphasise that the Government is committed to encouraging local initiative by a greater devolution of functions which would enable local communities to obtain funding to develop their own areas.  While the main thrust of our approach to job creation must be based on market-led growth, active intervention is necessary also to target resources to quality programmes which can provide the basis for progression to permanent jobs for all those seeking to gain or regain a foothold in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Mr. R. Burton Mr. R. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is farcical to call what he has just described a jobs fund?  Is it not the case that the Public Capital Programme, published with the Estimates, provided 90 per cent of what the Minister now calls a jobs fund?  Furthermore, would he not agree that the allocation of £25 million to the county enterprise boards is half what was agreed by the previous Government for allocation when they announced it? In addition, would he not agree that there will be nothing new available from this so-called jobs fund to help with the initiation of new enterprise here but instead will mean that we will witness the halving of a 10 per cent budget from this fund?</P>

      <P>I attended an informal meeting of Ministers of Industry on 19 and 20 March last at Nyborg in Denmark. There were three items on the agenda for the meeting viz.: industrial policy, the situation in the steel industry in the Community and the situation in the shipbuilding industry.  Because the discussions on industrial policy and the situation in the steel industry took more time than anticipated the discussion on the shipbuilding industry was very brief and was effectively postponed to the May Council of Ministers of Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion on the steel industry the Commission reported on recent developments.  Major retrenchments in <Col N="1462" /> the industry have been announced in Germany.  Financial arrangements for necessary rationalisation in the industry are under consideration by the Commission. The Commission is investigating whether recent support made available by Spain and Italy to steel industry projects are compatible with EC State aids policy for the industry.  These issues will be considered again at the next Council meeting in May.</P>
    <P>The discussion on industrial policy was wide-ranging.  The Presidency had circulated a paper broadly endorsing the previous Commission approach to industrial policy published in 1990.  Basically this proposes that the best approach to the promotion of a strong, competitive industrial structure is to adopt what are known as &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; measures across all areas of public policy which create the conditions within which profitable industrial projects can develop and prosper. The objective is to promote permanent adaptation to industrial change in an open and competitive market.  The need is also accepted to establish better control of Government subsidies for industry, especially in the case of highly capital-intensive projects.</P>
    <P>There was a widespread acceptance at the Council that these principles of an industrial policy for the community remain valid.  I made the case that the approach and principles adopted for a Community industrial policy, while still of relevance, need to be examined and updated in the light of developments that had since taken place including the high levels of unemployment now found across all Community countries.  I stated that the currency turmoil of recent months has been of particular importance from an industrial policy point of view. It has undermined investor confidence in productive investment projects with a consequent diminution in employment and the analysis of that important issue called for at the Birmingham Summit was not yet available.  I emphasised the need to have this commission on analysis available as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I endorsed the need to improve controls over State aids, particularly in the <Col N="1463" /> more prosperous and central regions of the Community which use these aids to attract investment at the expense of employment in peripheral regions of the Community.  I also stressed the importance which a Community industrial policy must attach to the development of small and medium-sized industries which are of particular importance to the creation of employment in Ireland.  I drew attention to the opportunities for employment creation in smaller countries from the increasing interaction of new developments in telecommunications with the production, distribution and marketing of industrial products.  I stressed that a dynamic Community industrial policy is necessary and must be based on the solid foundation of a European Single Market and the development and application of new technologies which require to be made widely available to small and medium-sized industries in countries such as Ireland with the support of Community policies.</P>
    <P>There was widespread agreement at the Council on the need to update the Commission's 1990 document on industrial policy in the light of the discussion at the Council and the Commission are to do further work on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer but, as I am sure he would agree, half of it was jargon and gave no hint of action.  I take it from what he said that he does not have specific proposals to tackle unemployment here, which is far worse than in the rest of Europe. The Minister referred to State aids for industry.  In relation to what happened in Digital, did he refer to the possibility of State interference in that debacle some weeks ago and use it as an example to show it appeared that sovereign Governments were interfering in the normal commercial process by offering incentives to companies to locate in one country as opposed to another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically stated at the Council that it made nonsense of Community <Col N="1464" /> industrial and regional policy if the level of State support for industries in the golden triangle &mdash; Germany and the Benelux countries &mdash; was higher than that which could be obtained in any of the countries on the periphery of the Community, including Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Portugal or Greece.  I also referred to the need, as part of an integrated industrial policy, to bring telecommunications systems, in particular the telephone system, in all the Twelve member states into line as quickly as possible to allow disadvantaged countries on the periphery of the Community, including Ireland, to avail of the benefits associated with top quality telecommunications systems to gain access to the rest of the market.  To answer the second part of the Deputy's question, I did not specifically raise the case of Digital; I referred to the general position, that countries on the periphery of the Community would be placed at a disadvantage if national governments or regional governments, such as the German Lander, are able to outbid bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority or the Scottish Development Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  Will he agree that he had a tremendous opportunity at the meeting of the Council which, as he said at the outset, was an informal one to use the case of Digital in making his argument?  It is extraordinary that the Minister did not refer to it or use it as a specific example in highlighting the imbalance within Europe and the need to strengthen the regions.  It seemed that what happened in the case of Digital flew in the face of the development of an evenhanded policy.  The Minister mentioned the shipping industry which, as I am sure he agrees, is of prime importance to us. There is a number of proposals on the table at present to develop the Irish shipping industry, including one relating to the possibility of investment in mobile assets.  I did not catch the date for the next meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The funding available this year for the social employment scheme/community employment development programme is £83.811 million.  This will allow for an average participation level of around 13,500 compared with 12,000 in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not decide to abolish the community employment development programme.  Changes were proposed in relation to the additional benefits which the 3,000 participants in the pilot programme would have been eligible to receive in addition to those to which they were entitled under the terms and conditions of the social employment scheme.  It was proposed that these should be changed but we reversed this decision in the light of the representations to us by the social partners. I was happy to acknowledge that the representations by the social partners were well meant and intentioned and we took the necessary corrective action.  In regard to FÁS we are trying to ensure that there will be stability in the operation of the social employment scheme to remove what has bedevilled the operation of FÁS schemes over a number of years, the stop-go approach which made it extremely difficult for FÁS regional offices to regulate in an orderly manner the way in which the programme worked.  I am in consultation with the Department of Finance to deal with that matter.  There is a further question on the Order Paper which deals with this matter in more detail.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the structures and extent of staffing in his Department to compile and analyse data concerning industrial policy and performance; the plans, if any, he has to expand the planning unit inherited from the former Department of Industry and Commerce; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report recommended that my Department, which now includes the former Department of Labour as well as the industry, technology, regulatory and other units of the former Department of Industry and Commerce, should see &ldquo;its role as being predominately one of policy determination <Col N="1468" /> for industrial development, supervision of its implementation and a recognition of the importance of the business-related and regulatory environment&rdquo;. I agree with that recommendation.</P>
      <P>The main institutional recommendations in the Culliton report in relation to industrial policy and performance in so far as they relate to my Department covered the advisability of its main role being one of policy determination and supervision; the removal of a number of regulatory and administrative functions; industrial performance review at three yearly intervals should include industrial policy; and better arrangements to improve exchange and contacts with industry and business.</P>
      <P>I generally accept these recommendations and I am in the process of implementing them.</P>
      <P>As regards the planning unit of the Department, that unit now employs three times the number it employed in June 1991.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report itself set the agenda for industrial policy and it is a very wide agenda.  It requires a response from a very broad range of Government policies, Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to respond to so broad an agenda for industrial policy and for policy change, is a matter for the Department as a whole and not for any particular unit or division of the Department.  All units and divisions of the Department are engaged in policy analysis and appraisal.  My officials are ensuring that skills for analysis are upgraded.  Appropriate training and courses in analytical and economic appraisal skills are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the information for policy analysis is of the highest quality. As a large proportion of the information used is gathered administratively from State agencies, I want to acknowledge the support that they give in enabling the analysis, appraisal and planning functions to operate.  I consider that further development of the data for policy <Col N="1469" /> analysis will be important for this function in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was prompted by the controversy in recent times about the reliability of trade statistics, output and export figures, the controversy of one year ago and the net cost per job created and the apparent massive conflicts between the figures from the IDA and the Department.  I am merely trying to establish whether the Department has its own ability to analyse data.  The Minister agrees that the task of his Department is primarily &ldquo;one of policy determination&rdquo;.  Does the Minister agree that one cannot determine policy unless the data is reliable?  Will the Minister state precisely what expertise is in his Department to analyse the available data?  Will he explain the massive conflict in the data on the effectiveness of State expenditure per sustainable job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the absolute necessity to have accurate, reliable and readily available data to provide the basis for any analysis. The Government has expressed its concern about the way in which revisions had to be made in the recent statistics published by the CSO.</P>
      <P>With regard to my Department, I am satisfied we have the required abilities to carry out the analysis that should be done, but that has to be upgraded on a permanent basis.  We are in the process of effectively creating a new Department from the conjunction of the former Department of Labour and those elements that were previously functions of the former Department of Industry and Commerce.  If we identify areas of deficiency in relation to the tasks described by the Deputy I can assure the House that we will not hesitate to fill those deficiencies by whatever means required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that assurance from the Minister, because it is crucial. However, I wish to pursue a specific point because he said all divisions within his Department are engaged in data <Col N="1470" /> analysis.  Is there a particular facility within the Department to analyse data and compile statistics because we ought not to have been left in the situation that we all claim to be surprised at the NESC findings or CSO revisions?  Is there a particular facility in the Department to do that job?</P>

We intend to get better at our job and we will take on the necessary skills and upgrade the current skills in order to do that job.  I accept the validity of the Deputy's observation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 26 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA advises me on a regular basis of impending job losses and rationalisation <Col N="1471" /> plans in grant-assisted multinational corporations operating in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Where rationalisation involving a substantial reduction in employment in its Irish plant is contemplated by a multinational company in order to secure the continuation of the Irish operation, I am prepared to provide very possible assistance to find a solution which will not result in a decrease in employment. Where necessary, especially where substantial reductions in employment are being considered, I am prepared to meet senior management of the companies concerned to explore all options for retaining and securing the maximum number of jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While rationalisation and restructuring of manufacturing operations in Ireland are a consequence of international competition, so too are the expansion and development of the Irish operations of multinational companies operating successfully here.  This is evidenced by the fact that multinational corporations are currently employing some 92,000 Irish workers at their Irish locations.  Last year, more than 6,000 first-time jobs were created here by overseas companies.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, multinational corporations operating in Ireland had 89 expansion projects approved and 188 greenfield projects were also approved for overseas companies in various locations outside the Shannon free zone.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 92,000 direct jobs, multinational companies operating here also make a significant contribution in supporting jobs throughout the economy through their purchases of Irish materials and services, the value of which now amounts to £2.4 billion annually.  The national linkage programme is aimed at maximising the job creation impact of multinational company activity in Ireland by promoting closer links between multinational plants and indigenous suppliers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that Deputies raise the question of company closures in their constituencies on a regular basis?  What fire brigade <Col N="1472" /> mechanism is in place to ensure that this does not happen?  Would the Minister agree that in the case of Digital &mdash; there is a specific question on the extra concessions that were made available to that company &mdash; the fire brigade action was too late?  Does a mechanism exist to prevent this happening again?</P>
      <P>What effect will the tax changes that President Clinton introduced have on the U.S. multinational mobile investment that we need to attract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Which question would the Deputy like me to answer first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Both have an impact on multinationals coming to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond first to the Deputy's reference to fire brigade action and to motions raised on the Adjournment. By the time the call is made for fire brigade action, it is in all probability too late and for that reason we are trying to establish, as I indicated in an earlier reply, a job protection unit whose primary function would be to provide an early warning system to prevent the fire breaking out in the first instance.  In response to the Deputy's question on what happens to companies who get into trouble, if the IDA can be satisfied that a substantial contribution would result in a change in the way the company functions so as to ensure its continued survival or diversification in operation to provide new jobs within the criteria laid down by the IDA, it can negotiate with the company if it gets sufficient time to do so to see if new industrial activity, technology or product can be produced to ensure that the existing employment is maintained.  The IDA has set criteria in relation to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the implications of the changes in US tax, the proposals for changing the law in relation to US tax deferrals for US companies operating outside the United States are a matter of concern to the companies in the first instance, to the IDA and the Government. We are aware of the position.  We are monitoring it very closely and taking <Col N="1473" /> an active interest in what is an internal US matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the impact of taxation could have serious implications in relation to multinationals and future investment in this country &mdash; I know the Taoiseach expressed his concern in this regard on St. Patrick's Day &mdash; has the Minister made direct contact with the US authorities in relation to our extreme concern on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, taxation in the United States is a matter for Congress and is not an executive function of the White House.  To that extent the Irish Government and our representatives in Washington, and indeed throughout the United States, have been in contact with the relevant persons on whom ultimate responsibility rests in relation to the way in which the US organises its tax affairs.  The companies have raised this matter more vociferiously than anyone else.  Most US companies who might be affected by changes in the US tax deferral system are companies which recognise that if they want to prosper locally they will have to expand globally.  They believe that changes in the US tax system may affect their ability to prosper in the manner they so ordain.  That is the point we wish to support because it will have the greatest impact on the decision-making process of Congress.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he intends to implement the recommendation in the Culliton report that the budget available to the IDA to support the activities of multinationals should be progressivly squeezed?  This would be a reversal of what has been happening in the last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it would necessarily be a reversal of what has been happening in the last five years.  In effect, Culliton proposed that we should shift the emphasis from grants to equity, and we endorse that recommendation.  As to whether the budget should be squeezed <Col N="1474" /> so as to reduce the amount of money available to attract inward investment, I would not agree with that proposal if as a consequence we were to forego investment by companies who might otherwise come here but we were simply not prepared on a competitive cost-per-job basis to attract that investment into this economy.</P>

      <P>On the question of retention of maximum employment in the State, does the Minister acknowledge that a factor that massively impacts on this is the scale of repatriation of profits to the countries of origin?  Does he think the tax code could be revised with a view to encouraging these companies to invest a portion of their profits in Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's replies.  Would he agree that the recent fashionable exercise of bashing multinationals is ill-conceived and damaging and should be discouraged?  As regards taxation arrangements between the United States and Ireland, I would point to the example of Denmark, who is a member of the EC and is also part of another economic bloc with Finland. Given the relationship between Ireland and America, which is quite unique, is it not possible to enter into a trade agreement which may overcome the taxation difficulty while also giving us an advantage in attracting multinationals to this country?  With the globalisation of markets multinationals are going to locate throughout the world and we must ensure that a number of them are located here. The opportunity surely exists for the <Col N="1475" /> Minister to talk with his colleagues in the United States with a view to reaching an agreement that would be similar to but would not impinge on our EC arrangements, as Denmark has done with Finland and Scandinavian countries.</P>

      <P>In respect of our attitude towards multinationals, there has been certain adverse comments about what the Deputy referred to as the bashing of multinationals, which has been very unhelpful.  Utterances by many people have been misinterpreted.  It has to be clearly understood that at the end of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the loyalty of a multinational must be to its shareholders, its immediate workforce and, in all probability, its country of origin.  To that extent we have to recognise that multinationals make decisions from time to time which are not necessarily to the immediate benefit of certain overseas locations &mdash; tragically that was the case in recent times.</P>
      <P>As regards the special trading relationship between Denmark and Finland, I do not know the full details of that relationship but I suspect, because of the position taken by the Nordic Council and Scandinavia, it predates Denmark's entry to the European Community.  The Commission has responsibility for the negotiation of trade on behalf of the 12 member states.  That is why Commissioner MacSharry negotiated the terms of the agricultural components of GATT rather than the Irish or French Minister for Agriculture.  I suspect &mdash; I will come back to the Deputy on this point &mdash; we cannot negotiate separate trade agreements for the Irish economy with, for example, the United States.  I understand that would be a matter for the Commission.  However, I will inquire into the matter and come back to the Deputy on it.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister, given that he indicated earlier that he rejects the first Culliton recommendation in relation to grant support &mdash; namely, to squeeze the budget for foreign multinational companies &mdash; would he not accept that in the last recorded year multinationals provided 40 per cent fewer gross new jobs than did the Irish industry, but on a larger budget?  What is the Minister's reason for throwing out what was a fundamental recommendation of the Culliton report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should consider the overall picture.  We are specifically providing for the first time in this year's budget £25 million for domestic indigenous industry by way of moneys for the county enterprise partnership boards. From memory I think the grant in overall terms for the IDA is between £80 million and £100 million &mdash; I would have to check the records in respect of that matter.  The budget will be reduced in effective terms and the focus will be shifted from grant to equity, but not at the risk of losing jobs that would otherwise be created here but could not be attracted here because we decided arbitrarily or abstractly to simply squeeze the budget as a result of a particular recommendation.  The Culliton report contains many recommendations and I will be dealing with them at a later date when the response of the Government to the Culliton report and the report of the Moriarty task force is published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the early warning system referred to by the Minister.  Prior to his finalising the job protection unit, would the Minister not agree that when a question is put to his Department regarding a change of jobs and contact with the IDA a reply should be given?  Several questions in my name have been disallowed because the Minister's office said the Minister has no responsibility to this House for the actions of the IDA.  For example, I put down a question to the Minister about a company situated opposite my house which is losing 40 jobs, but I was told the <Col N="1477" /> question could not be answered because the Minister has no responsibility to the House in this matter.  Surely the Minister should utilise this House to reply to questions put to him by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments and will consider how information given to Members of the Oireachtas on all sides of the House by their constituents as to the vulnerability of a person's employment can be fed into the early warning job protection unit system in a confidential and constructive manner rather than raising it as an adjournment matter. That is not to say they would be precluded from so doing, but if concern is expressed to a Deputy by his or her constituent that their job is at risk I am open in principle to the suggestion that Members of the Oireachtas who are in touch with ordinary people should be afforded an opportunity to communicate on a confidential basis &mdash; or on any other basis &mdash; with the job protection unit to say that they have been informed that jobs may be at risk.  That is a valuable contribution and I welcome it.</P>

The figure is now closer to £9 million for 1993.  That is about £2 million now, a further £2 million in April and about £5 million towards the end of the year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the proposed county enterprise partnership boards was transferred to me at the end of January 1993.  I have asked my Department to undertake a review of the establishment procedures, staffing and funding involved in the establishment of new structures.  It is particularly important to ensure that they support and do not hinder activity already undertaken effectively through existing structures.  It is also necessary to ensure that they do not cut across work already being done under the Leader programme, INTERREG and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area based initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> The new boards can, with local community involvement, play a significant role in tourism development at county and sub-county level.  In consultation with the relevant interested parties, including the Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am considering how the new boards can make an effective contribution to generating employment through community and rural-based enterprise projects with a significant tourism dimension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the proposed review is based on the fact that he has major reservations in relation to the composition of the county enterprise boards?  Will he also confirm if reservations have been expressed by the social partners, particularly IBEC and ICOS, and by the EC in relation to the composition and the non-democratic nature of the proposed boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed my major reservations about the proposals of the previous Government.  I have no reservations about the Programme for Government which I helped to negotiate and which was endorsed by our two parties. The Programme for Government provided <i>inter alia</i> for the transfer to the Department of Enterprise and Employment of total responsibility for the establishment and operation of county enterprise partnership boards.  That is being done and involves among other things the transfer or staff and resources from the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach.  With regard to representations from the social partners, I confirm that people actively involved in the LEADER programme and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area based companies have expressed concern, as indicated in my formal reply, that the work they are already doing should not be undermined or duplicated.  That is a valid point.  My two colleagues, and I are looking closely at how to complement and add to the work already done.  With regard to the operation of the global grant to which the Deputy's question refers, the EC has <Col N="1481" /> indicated to us &mdash; and we have accepted &mdash; that the management in the form of the chairperson and the chief executive of that company should not be serving civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the county will remain a unit regardless of the review?  In relation to the role of tourism, does the Minister now intend to leave the regional tourism boards intact or will he continue to implement the proposal of the previous Government to merge these boards into the new county network?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the interaction of the regional tourism organisations and the enterprise boards on 12 March a press release was issued by me, my Department and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, indicating that the RTOs as they currently stand will remain as they are and that we are not proposing to interfere with them because of the nature of these bodies and the fact that they were receiving contributions and subscriptions from other organisations.</P>
      <P>With regard to whether the county structure will be the fundamental structure, that is a matter which is being reviewed.  We want to make local enterprise work efficiently and effectively. There has to be a meeting of minds between a spontaneous response and a support interaction, including financial assistance.  That, in many cases will occur at county level.  In some areas, including Dublin city and county for example, the area may be too large and may need a number of bodies.  We are trying to get the right formula in place before we rush in and perhaps undermine the work of existing bodies.</P>

Mine was a very lone view in the House at the time.

Would the Minister not consider that some element of appropriate regional planning structures should be put in place rather than proceed with these county enterprise boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire Deputy Rabbitte's ability to take a particular point and twist it into an entire thesis. My criticism of the boards related to the manner in which it was originally proposed they would operate, but not of the concept.  On the contrary it is clear &mdash; indeed, the Culliton report, to which we have made frequent reference this afternoon, has conceded this &mdash; that even if we were to do all the things Culliton proposes the actual number of jobs created would not meet the huge demand which this country has and will continue to have for at least the next five to seven years.  Against that background it is absolutely essential that we stimulate, or allow to blossom, local initiative and local enterprise where it exists to complement the work of Culliton on the one hand and the continued investment of multinational companies at the same time.  There are three legs to the one stool.  The county enterprise concept of local community initiative, which will provide sustainable, community or co-operative employment, is a critical component of this Government's programme.  It will be implemented sensibly and intelligently with collective and local support.</P>

Would he not agree with the RTOs remaining in place for the good reasons outlined?  He indicated a number of other organisations that already exist.  In the context of his review would he undertake a comparison of a similar regional structure, instead of the county enterprise boards, based on the RTOs as a comparable model of what may happen in the county structure? Would he consider undertaking a model of both to see whether the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so to speak?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13, 29, 34 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new apprenticeship system <Col N="1488" /> agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and contained in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997,</i> responsibility for recruitment of apprentices will rest with employers, subject to agreed minimum educational standards being achieved by the potential apprentice.</P>
    <P>The National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee of FÁS are currently addressing the issue of special provision for entry to apprenticeships for women. One of the key aims of the new apprenticeships system as agreed within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to increase the number of apprentices in the currently designated trades and that in addition further trades should be designated for apprenticeship thereby increasing the numbers further.</P>
    <P>FÁS have advised that a 10 per cent target of all apprenticeships to be taken up by women is unlikely to be achieved in the short-term within the current range of designated occupations.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputies that I will be making it a priority within my area of responsibility to increase the number of apprenticeships which are taken up by women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Will the Minister tell the House how many female apprentices are included in the current body of apprentices and what percentage of places do those females represent?  What additional area of designation does the Minister have in mind to increase the number of women taking up apprenticeship places to 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of registered apprentices at the end of 1992 was 13,632 and the number of women apprentices at that time was 196.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost 1.4 per cent. I accept it is absurd and freely admit that the number of female apprentices in the system up to the end of 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey should permit me to continue.  From 1989 to 1992, the number increased from 0.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent.  I accept it is a feeble increase.  One of my main priorities in the new apprenticeship system will be to ensure that more women are recruited through the bursary system which is presently in operation and I will be persuading schools, parents and employers that women are as useful as men in the traditionally recognised apprenticeship areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Owen's question on the extension of the designated trades to include more apprenticeships, the sub-committee of FÁS dealing with apprenticeships is discussing that matter and will report back to me.  That committee is considering some interesting proposals. It is clearly the wish of the Government, expressed through the Programme for Government, that there should be an ever-widening application of apprenticeships, programme training and so on, into what would not up to now have been regarded as traditional areas of apprenticeship. Parents, employers and young people now demand structured training where they can obtain national and internationally recognised certificates leading to a qualification.  I am very interested in this area and intend to develop it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to confirm those figures with the Minister.  Did the Minister say that of the 13,632 apprenticeships taken up in 1992, only 196 were taken up by females?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why it is unlikely that FÁS will achieve the 10 per cent target in the near future? What does she mean by &ldquo;the near future&rdquo; and what will her future be?  Can the Minister say that by 1994 this figure will have doubled, trebled or quadrupled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will talk about the future of apprenticeships.  I share the Deputy's amazement at the figures.  That percentage of female apprenticeships is absurd considering the number of affirmative programmes being implemented in the traditional areas.  I hope to change that position as soon as possible.  In regard to FÁS not being able to attain the 10 per cent target in the short term, the Deputy must admit that an increase from 1 per cent to 10 per cent will be a major step but I will be insisting that the future lies in a combination of affirmative programmes for the traditional areas plus a widening of the designation of the trade areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>How was the 10 per cent figure, referred to in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, arrived at?  Surely the Minister is aware that in reality many apprenticeships are not conducive to females and that the number of apprenticeships to which a female can apply is restricted? With our high unemployment level and many people seeking apprenticeships, employers will have a say in relation to the people they employ.  Are there any incentives for employers to employ females as opposed to males?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Laoighis-Offaly</i>): In deference to the views Deputy Finucane may have accumulated on the basis of his experience, will the Minister agree that training organisations such as FÁS, have made particular efforts and have been relatively successful in recent years in encouraging women to take up direct apprenticeship programmes, particularly through the pre-apprenticeship scheme? Will she agree also that, notwithstanding that success, we have a continuing difficulty with the non-acceptance of women apprentices in the workplace and that something needs to be done through the business and employer organisations to ensure that this blockage is removed and the situation dramatically improved?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The situation has improved. FÁS has made real efforts but they have not been strong enough and have not received sufficient backing from employers.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 14, subsection (1), between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; (c) the accounts, books and other records of any person for a financial year of the person in which the person received any moneys from a person to which subsection (1) (b) applies or from a Minister of the Government or a Department or directly from the Central Fund if the amount or the aggregate of the amounts received constitutes not less than 50 per cent of the gross receipts of the person in that year,</P>

    <P>Provided, however, that the provisions of section 12 shall not apply to any inspection under paragraph (c) or (d).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Yates.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress, the Minister read out a lengthy prepared script which outlined the reasons inspection rights should not be conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to organisations, bodies and persons who have received money from State bodies.  The Minister gave three principal reasons why this should not be the case: first, semi-State bodies have their own private auditors in the commercial sector; second, semi-State companies should be dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies; and, third, she did not wish to dilute the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to such an extent that he would have so many things to look after that he could not do his job effectively.  If one examines these reasons bit by bit one will find that they can be taken apart very simply.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dilution of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is nothing in the amendments which obliges the Comptroller and Auditor General to look into every nook and cranny of expenditure in all of the 31 semi-State companies.  We are saying that he should have this power in the event of a Leader programme in County Tipperary going wrong or a crisis similar to the one involving Aer Lingus Holidays, which lost £70 million.  Somebody representing this House should have the power to investigate such matters.  I do not think the acceptance of these amendments would dilute the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second reason given by the Minister, we cannot assume that everything is all right with the audit process. <Col N="1566" /> I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the most recent accounts for the National Stud available in the Dáil Library are three years old. If the Minister regards this as acceptable in terms of the auditing process, I certainly do not, especially when the stud is losing over £500,000 a year and losing money on a prime 800 acre farm in the heart of County Kildare.  If it was a private company, it would be gone out of business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third reason, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies is not capable of carrying out the remit the Minister says it is capable of carrying out.  This committee has a budget of £30,000, its members are very busy and the most it could publish is four or five reports a year.  The Second Schedule lists some 31 organisations which have to be scrutinised by this committee. The committee has no staff to carry out inspections, etc.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is an established office with established personnel of the quality necessary to carry out these inspections.</P>
    <P>The power we are seeking to give the Comptroller and Auditor General has been recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts and the advisory group. It will give the Comptroller and Auditor General the right, on behalf of this House, to inspect in cases where something has gone wrong &mdash; obviously he would not do this in every case &mdash; the expenditure of public moneys.  I ask the Minister to exercise her authority as an office holder and accept these amendments, and not simply be a mouthpiece for the Government.  We have put forward valid arguments for the acceptance of these amendments which will ensure accountability, transparency and value for money.</P>

      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies is the appropriate body to look at the accounts of semi-State bodies.  Where there are allegations of possible criminal activity, <Col N="1567" /> or criminal negligence in regard to public moneys, other organs of the State &mdash; for example, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Fraud Squad &mdash; are empowered to investigate such cases.  The Government took the view in the White Paper that a distinction should be drawn between commercial semi-State bodies and non-commercial semi-State bodies.  The non-commercial semi-State bodies are included under the terms of the Bill.  It was decided that commercial semi-State bodies should, in line with other commercial organisations, be audited by outside auditors, who in turn have rights and obligations under their professional codes of practice to trace what they may perceive to be irregularities and misuse of funds and to outline ways in which procedures could be improved and made more effective.  That is what is proposed in the Bill.  Therefore, I regret that it will not be possible to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to be true to herself.  I have absolutely no doubt that if she was on this side of the House she would, in even more vociferous terms, make the arguments being made over here.  I fail to understand why the Minister will not include the commercial semi-State sector and grant the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to inspect them where he deems it appropriate.  Deputy Yates made a valid point, there is no obligation on the Comptroller and Auditor General to inspect.  Nobody is forcing him to look at all these bodies.  However, I have no doubt that a situation will arise when we will all regret the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be precluded from examining some particular situation concerning one of the commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because such a substantial amount of public funding goes into this area, it is nearly more important that he should be able to look at those areas.  For instance, in regard to Bord Gáis Éireann, NET and IFI, questions have been asked on the <Col N="1568" /> subject of value for money spent.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General could examine those companies to see what value the taxpayer is getting for above-the-line obvious State subsidies and below-the-line State subsidies we would now be in a fundamentally different position in the context of just those three companies, not to speak of the possibilities that have been outlined by others in regard to other areas.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister is taking the Department line on this as I do not believe it is her own view or consistent with one she would have expressed in the past.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamenal mistake to exclude the commercial semi-State sector from inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General where he deems it necessary. If he feels it is necessary to give most of his time to the non-commercial sector, I have no objection, but let the person who holds the office be the judge of that.  We must not lose sight of the uniqueness of that person's position in being answerable to the Dáil as opposed to the Executive. That fact emphasises the need for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be able to investigate particular situations where he deems it necessary without being blocked in the way he is by this legislation.  It is not enough to suggest that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies covers it as it patently does not.  Other than the Comptroller and Auditor General being able to pursue matters that others cannot pursue to the degree that he can because of lack of time or resources, there is no other mechanism. There should be an opportunity for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the commercial semi-State sector. I appeal to the Minister to consider this for Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's line.  I do not think she has responded effectively to the arguments. We have heard long lectures from the Labour Party about probity and trust and all this kind of thing, but now that we <Col N="1569" /> have the opportunity to improve our scrutiny of finance there is whitewashing.</P>
      <P>I feel that this is a power the Comptroller and Auditor General would want.  I do not want to personalise the issue but there is a direct conflict.  The Government is deliberately stopping something which it was not intended to do in Article 33 of the Constitution, which is quite clear.  I want to state quite strongly that the rights of Deputies should be very significantly taken into account in this debate because of the nature of the Comptroller and Auditor General's role in relationship to this House.  In other words, the rights of Members and, therefore, the public interest are at issue.</P>
      <P>I fail to see how the right of the Committee of Public Accounts to call someone before it, the right of the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an inspection &mdash; only an inspection &mdash; is unreasonable.  To take an example, a company in Tipperary has gone into liquidation; the accounting controls in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were not adequate.  These are matters of fact, not of opinion.  Obviously it is a matter for the Fraud Squad to see if there is any criminal involvement, but the system of checks and balances fell down abysmally.  This relates to the Leader programme and there may be many more instances.  Under this legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have the right to question people who got the money, who could have even been 100 per cent funded by the State.  No reasonable person would think that is fair or right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this on Report Stage.  In the case of the Leader programme the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies does not come into it.  It is a case of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has the power to examine that organisation.  Again, I have to conclude that that is perfectly reasonable.  I have never been an office-holder, but if I was I would certainly seek to exercise some sort of individual freedom of manoeuvre. I do not wish to delay the House on the matter.  I feel that there should be <Col N="1570" /> inspection rights into a subsidiary of a semi-State company such as Aer Lingus Holidays.</P>
    <P>Since we debated this before lunch I spoke to Members who are on the Oireachtas joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and they told me that what the Minister said does not hold up.  I do not know if the Minister has ever been a membere of that committee. I assume she has not.  I have never been, but I am told that the committee cannot control that £17 million, they cannot even ask questions about it.  If the Minister says she is satisfied with this, it is not a responsible attitude.  I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The State-sponsored Bodies are responsible and answerable, in the first instance, to their boards who are appointed by the relevant Minister for the Government and it is the board's responsibility, in the first instance, to supervise the operation of those companies.  It is through the exercise of procedures within each company, and by procedures in the sponsoring Department in regard to how those boards are run, that that supervision is exercised.  The individual State companies can be brought before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  If allegations have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Fraud Squad in relation to any company, obviously that puts a lid on discussion because nobody wants to prejudice court cases which may emerge from a particular investigation.  That is a separate issue from the general right of the semi-State bodies committee to be involved in the monitoring of the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 27, in the names of Deputies Cox and Cullen.  Amendment No. 28 is a related amendment.  It is therefore suggested that amendments Nos. 27 and 28 be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), line 41, after &ldquo;General&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for the purpose of ensuring economic, efficient and effective management of resources, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General may recommend systems, procedures and practices deemed to constitute best practice in respect of any matters examined under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The discussion relevant to these amendments was held earlier in relation to a different section.  The purpose of the amendment is to give weight to section 9 and it is my hope that the Minister will not have any difficulty with it.  Acceptance of the amendment would ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General had the authority and the opportunity to recommend value for money having regard to his or her experience gained in examination of alternative operations and systems and his or her having recognised an operation that worked extremely well in a cost-efficient way and proved less cumbersome and less expensive than an operation he or she had under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tabling this amendment, I recognise that care is needed in the area of policy. Because of the experience of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he or she should be able to recommend systems that are the best practice in a particular set of circumstances.  The thrust of the <Col N="1572" /> Bill goes very much in that direction.  It is my feeling that it is necessary to include a specific provision so that nobody is under a misunderstanding as to the extent of the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Examples provided, whether from the public sector or from the private sector, show that organisations learn from the experience of their competitors and their counterparts. Learning experiences have fundamentally changed the way in which operations take place in various organisations. The &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; system was originally developed in one company, it was recognised as working successfully and was adopted by other companies. The adoption of the system brought about phenomenal savings in companies' stock and resulted in tremendous efficiency for both the user and the supplier. Such improvements are welcome. In the role to be fulfilled by the Comptroller and Auditor General the opportunity exists for the Comptroller and Auditor General, without necessarily impinging on policy matters, to at the very least recommend systems, procedures and practices deemed to constitute the best practice in a particular area.  Amendment No. 27 strengthens section 9 in making specific the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made by Deputy Cullen.  Section 9 is the most important section of the Bill in that it goes very much into the area of value for money.  I am not happy with this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Bill allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the effectiveness of departmental management systems.  The Comptroller and Auditor General cannot examine the effectiveness <i>per se</i> of public expenditure programmes.  The White Paper on the Comptroller and Auditor General debates that issue at some length.  I do not accept the arguments put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appendix 2 to the White Paper, under the heading &ldquo;Some International <Col N="1573" /> Developments in National Auditing&rdquo;, provides information on the powers of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in other countries.  In Australia examination of effectiveness is permitted and the efficiency audit there includes cost-effectiveness as well as evaluations of the effectiveness of the administrative actions and decisions of management in achieving programme objectives.  In other words, in the case of a house repair scheme there is ability to examine whether the scheme actually deals with the problem and in the case of a TB eradication scheme there is ability to ask whether the scheme is resulting in eradication of the disease.  At present the Comptroller and Auditor General in Ireland does not have that ability.</P>
    <P>In a study of the number of jobs created by the business expansion scheme the Comptroller and Auditor General actually went beyond his legal remit.  Appendix 2 to the White Paper also advises that in Canada the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has the authority to call attention to anything considered to be of significance and of a nature that should be brought to the attention of the Legislature.  In New Zealand the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is empowered to carry out discretionary value for money audits and new legislation is promised in that country.  In Great Britain the National Audit Office is able to carry out examinations on any aspect other than policy &mdash; that office has the authority to state whether it is advisable to have a public housing scheme or a public health policy of a particular kind.  Throughout the analysis of the practice in other countries it seems that the authors of the White Paper have tried to justify the Department's view that authorities should be limited to examination of management systems.  It is stated that the experience of a particular country is not a good comparison for use in Ireland, for some reason or another.</P>
    <P>I was most interested in a paragraph found on the very last page of the White Paper which related to experience in the United States.  In the United States the <Col N="1574" /> Comptroller and Auditor General carries out effectiveness audits, which can include an assessment of the relative merits of alternative policies.  The White Paper, of course, goes on to make rubbish of that practice and say why it would not be suitable for adoption in Ireland.</P>
    <P>International experience shows that the way to proceed is to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the effectiveness as well as the economy, and that relates not only to management systems.  In the Department of the Marine, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to say whether or not there is a good superstructure.  The issue is not that there is the ability to say that the Department accounts well and watches where the money is spent; the issue is the number of harbours that should be built, the effectiveness of the number of ships served, the number of fishermen given assistance, the number of fishing jobs created and the increase in the capacity for landing fish catches.  Such examination is beyond the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Even if the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General unearthed the most earth-shattering of conclusive evidence, the Comptroller and Auditor General would be empowered only to examine the management systems.</P>
    <P>There is a major gap therefore in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as presently constituted and in other public administration offices.  I should like to provide the House with specific examples.  Investment in computerisation has been made in virtually every Department, yet there has been no analysis as to the number of jobs that have been saved or the opportunities that have been provided for redeployment into the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Universal experience in the past 15 years in clerical employment outside of the State sector has shown that computerisation has about halved employment requirements.  Computerisation could result in huge resources being freed up.</P>
    <P>If the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1575" /> were empowered to examine the effectiveness of expenditure programmes in computerisation he would be able to point to specific benefits of investment in computerisation, as opposed to being able to say that £400,000 was spent on an IBM computer that was placed in a particular office on St. Stephen's Green.  I do not see why the logic of the extensions proposed in amendments Nos. 27 and 28 do not appeal to the Department of Finance given that we evidenced on the last amendment that it is the Department of Finance who decide which amendments are rejected or accepted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am endeavouring to insert a new subsection to section 9, a most important section, whose whole purpose is to revamp and legally consolidate the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Here we are dealing with examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the economy, of efficiency in use of resources and of effectiveness of certain management systems.  One is giving on the one hand but the parameters are immediately laid out restricted <i>vis-à-vis</i> management systems. Another example would be public sector costings, a league table as between local authorities, vocational education committees and health boards, who are the most efficient or inefficient.  In the Department of the Environment there was a very time-consuming, heavy in administration, housing grants scheme. A former Minister, I think Deputy Flynn, decided on 31 March 1987 to abolish all house improvement grants, on which I think the expenditure in one year amounted to £120 million.  That begs the question as to whether there remains a grant section in Ballina, or what actually happened in that case.  Let me take the example of the Department of Defence. I am told reliably that virtually all the management and administrative functions to run the Army are undertaken by military personnel within the Army.  One must ask then what 300 people are doing in the Department of Defence?</P>
    <P>Under the present system all the Comptroller and Auditor General can <Col N="1576" /> say is that there are accounting officers; that there is in place a super structure which ensures that all the subheads of the departmental Votes are properly apportioned and spent in the way they are appropriated.  I have no doubt that the management systems in these Departments are fine, that there is no real problem with accountability.  There is no major allegation of fraud.  Therefore, there may well be a case in another area of public administration not only not to increase the pay of those in the public service but, regardless of the 300,000 unemployed, certainly not to recruit any more.  If we are to improve our public services what are the opportunities for redeployment?  What are the new areas of public service in which we could give people satisfaction while providing a better service?</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the taxpayer is not getting a good deal.  If one examines international experience, particularly in those countries which have recently revised their laws in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General, one will find they have all opted for the effectiveness of the programmes as opposed to the effectiveness of the management systems.  I do not believe the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General can be adapted in any way into meaningful lessons about future and current public expenditure unless we effect such change.  I would ask the Minister to give this very serious consideration because it is fundamental to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with what Deputy Cullen is endeavouring to achieve in his amendment but we must examine its wording where it reads:</P>
      <P>. . . the Comptroller and Auditor General may recommend systems, procedures and practices deemed to constitute best practice . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is the kind of terminology we should insert in legislation because there will be disagreements as to what constitutes &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.  I contend that the wording of the section, as drafted, gives the <Col N="1577" /> Comptroller and Auditor General flexibility to investigate and report on systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department, managers or whoever, to evaluate the effectiveness of their operations.  Without prejudice to saying whether something is the best, or a better system, that affords the Comptroller and Auditor General flexibility to do what I think Deputy Cullen intends without labelling one particular system which may turn out to be flawed.  For example, in six months or six year's time somebody may discover that the &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; system does not constitute the best method of control; there may be a better method discovered.  Again I contend the flexibility in the Bill affords the Comptroller and Auditor General an opportunity to investigate in a general way and report on practices, systems and procedures.  Out of that I contend there will be an interest in organisations in implementing the kind of suggestions made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, indeed other organisations picking up suggestions made arising out of his reports.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Yates' amendment it is important to draw a distinction between the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to audit, value for money, effectiveness of systems and the policy area which, properly is the responsibility of the Minister concerned. All the Members of this House, not only those serving on the Committee of Public Accounts, will have ample opportunity to question appropriate Ministers on the effectiveness of Government programmes and policies.  It is not the function of the auditor to comment on policies.  We need to draw that distinction. I know it can be difficult, that there are grey areas, but the provisions of section 9 attempt to draw that distinction so that Members of this House can properly question Ministers on policies being pursued within their areas of responsibility.  The function of the auditor is not to query policies drawn up properly under our Constitution by the responsible Ministers but rather to question <Col N="1578" /> the effectiveness of management systems.</P>
    <P>While I have great sympathy with the type of questioning of policy mentioned by Deputy Yates it comes down to: who does one question?  Does one question the Minister with regard to the effectiveness of a particular programme or does one question through the audit system?  We need to make the Minister responsible for the implementation of policy and the Accounting Officer, through the Comptroller and Auditor General, responsible for ensuring that there are effective, efficient value-for-money systems in place for implementing those Government policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister of State has just said.  I contend that our amendment introduces a wider and more specific aspect, that of effectiveness and value for money.  What is contained in the section, as drafted, is a more technical, abstract view of what may or may not happen.  I accept the point made by the Minister, that one can debate what is &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.  That does not necessarily mean that if the Comptroller and Auditor General makes a recommendation it must be taken on board.  The amendment has been carefully worded to say he may recommend such systems.  Obviously he would recommend such systems based on his experience of examining other areas.  That would not mean necessarily that if the system he recommended was partially or totally implemented this year it should remain in operation forever.  Any such system, could be changed and reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of the amendment was to specify clearly that the Comptroller and Auditor General has a role to play in evaluating, seeking to get value for money at the delivery end as well; not that the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; are dotted and the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; are crossed, in the way in which a structure should have evolved, rather that he should have a more circumspect role in evaluating and questioning value for money, the ability to make certain recommendations, based on his experience and knowledge of investigations <Col N="1579" /> and/or audits he would have undertaken in other areas.  I know there are aspects of work carried out within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, some of which are extremely good and efficient, which I contend could be applied to the delivery of services by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Within the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; auditing, ascertaining how a service is costed and delivered to the consumer, he should, at the end of the day, be in a position to go the whole hog in terms of value for money. It is not just a question of his operating in an abstract manner.  He should be involved in that process and those who deal with him should look on him as a person who is in a position to make sensible and logical recommendations based on the experience he has gained in carrying out other audits and investigations.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to think again about amendment No. 27 to section 9.  I do not think it contradicts the section, it seeks to beef up the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This does not necessarily mean that, following every investigation, the Comptroller and Auditor General would have to make a recommendation but it is quite obvious to us &mdash; I am sure it is also quite obvious to the Minister of State &mdash; that from time to time he would pick up ideas and knowledge that could be applied in other areas.  He should be in a position to discuss this with the Department or body concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister of State is sympathetic I do not think she understood the argument I was trying to make.  I would like to draw her attention to page 22 of the White Paper which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision means that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be required to satisfy himself as to the adequacy of management effectiveness i.e., the management systems, procedures and practices in Departments and other bodies for <Col N="1580" /> examining effectiveness.  This would include such matters as examining the organisation of the effectiveness, an evaluation function, the system of reporting, the methodology used in effectiveness examinations and the use made of effectiveness evaluation reports.</P>
    <P>As indicated above, the Comptroller and Auditor General will not be required to carry out effectiveness reviews himself.  This will be left to the Departments and other public bodies whose primary responsibility it remains.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that I am asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to get involved in policy matters but that is not the case.  The White Paper goes on to state that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be specifically excluded from expressing an opinion on the merits of policy.  That is not the issue; the issue is that he will deal only with management systems, procedures and practices and have an evaluation function.</P>
    <P>If, for example, the Government decide &mdash; this would be a noble gesture &mdash; that everybody, regardless of whether they are in private or public accommodation, should have a bathroom and toilet, this would be a policy decision and it would have nothing to do with the question of controlling public expenditure or the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be to ensure that every pound provided in this regard was spent for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As opposed to asking if the right people in, say, Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Corporation or Sligo County Council, supervised this activity and if the practice was evaluated to see that proper management systems were in place it should be asked if the cost per house was reasonable, if we had been ripped off in some parts of the country, if we got good value for money or, if the work was carried out under tender by the private sector, if the tenders were inflated.  The way to control public expenditure <Col N="1581" /> is to ensure that we get value for money.  This means that we should review the effectiveness of the programmes of expenditure.</P>
    <P>For example, last year the State spent £2 million on the special housing aids for the elderly scheme.  However, nobody knows if a particular health board was able to build more houses than another for the same amount of money and, if so, how they did it.  I am referring here to grant-in-aid, not grants, in other words, the Comptroller and Auditor General would have full powers in such a case.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should not say I am making the argument that the Comptroller and Auditor General should get involved in policy matters or sympathise with me; I want her to accept that he should review the effectiveness of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of another example by what Deputy Yates said and it also relates to the building programme carried out throughout the country.  At present in the Department of the Environment a certain sum of money &mdash; I cannot think of the figure offhand &mdash; is set aside for a programme under which bathrooms are provided in old houses. For instance, in Waterford &mdash; I am sure this is true in other parts of the country &mdash; if the council decided to provide a bathroom in one area and did the same in another part of the city the following week it would not be able to build the same number of bathrooms for the same amount of money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General would then be in a position to say that the council in Waterford was able to provide 40 bathrooms whereas the council in Limerick was able to provide only 25 for the same amount. He would also be able to review the effectiveness of the decision making process and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that this is a separate issue and that we would not be asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to get involved in policy matters; we would be asking him to review the way in which policy is implemented to ensure that we are getting value for <Col N="1582" /> money, not only from the point of view of the State but from the point of view of the taxpayer.  An enhanced service would be delivered if a sensible decision was taken in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 9 (1) (a) the Comptroller and Auditor General will have the power to carry out examinations, as he considers appropriate, of economy and efficiency.  This is what the Members opposite are addressing.  It is obvious that if one Authority is able to provide 50 bathrooms and another 40 for the same amount of money it is not using funds economically and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should read subsection (2) which states that, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), only the systems employed by management may be examined. As the Minister of State said, it is stated in section 9 (1) that the Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out an examination of economy and efficiency but subsection (2) states, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), that only the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Department or the manager of the fund concerned may be examined. Therefore, only the effectiveness of the manager's operations may be examined, not the programme itself.  It has deliberately been worded in such a way that the Government decision as contained in the White Paper will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has got it back to front; the general provision is contained in subsection (1) which states that the Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out an examination of economy and efficiency to see if resources were disposed of economically and efficiently.  These are new powers and represent an extension of the value for money audit procedure.  In addition, it is being proposed in subsection (2) that without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Comptroller and Auditor General should examine the systems employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> To return to Deputy Cullen's point, this section allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine, comment and make reports on systems, without indicating the best system.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General suggests that a system is not working and should be examined, that speaks for itself.  We have a strong watchdog in the form of the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with those points.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve but one cannot describe the best practice in legislation.  The general way it is worded in the section is a more effective and efficient means of addressing the Deputy's point.</P>
    <P>Ministers have a general responsibility in relation to the policies of their Departments and the systems organised in them. If a policy is ineffective Deputies can come into this House and question the Minister.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's role is to examine the value for money aspect of policies decided by the Executive.  While there are grey areas the Government has made a decision in the White Paper, followed through in this Bill, in relation to where the dividing line should be drawn.  Therefore, I do not accept Deputy Yates's amendment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the answer to my question is yes.  I only want to know where we stand.  This morning the Minister said her salary was paid by the Department of Finance, I assume she has some obligation to taxpayers to obtain value for money.  Does she believe that the accounting officers in the Department of Defence will be like turkeys voting for Christmas in proposing that their Department be totally diminished?  This matter could be examined by an independent person, I am just using it as an example. My proposal is that the Comptroller and Auditor General needs to identify areas of duplication of effort and expense and inefficiency.  Does the Minister believe that if there is not an independent watchdog to suggest changes in public administration it will happen in its own right?</P>

      <P>The concepts of economy and efficiency will be dealt with by the Comptroller and Auditor General under section 9 (1) and this will extend the value for money audit principle. There are two dimensions to effectiveness, one is the effectiveness of policy which is a matter for the Minister concerned and any Minister may be questioned in the House in relation to what may be considered an ineffective programme. Because it is accepted by the <Col N="1586" /> Government that the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be drawn into policy areas, the decision had been made that the effectiveness area of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit shall be in relation to the effectiveness of systems, that is provided for in section 9 (2).</P>

      <P>I wish to facilitate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in making progress, we have not only ploughed and harrowed but probably also irrigated the territory.  The parameters of this section are clear but I fundamentally disagree with this approach.  At the next general election I will be seeking a mandate for a new office, an adjunct of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; a controller of public expenditure &mdash; who will publish reports on the effectiveness of public expenditure, the efficiency of programmes and report to this House independently so that Members can be fully informed when there are debates on public expenditure.  At the end of the day politicians may make decisions but I fail to accept that in £10.5 billion of public expenditure there is not some waste.  We do not have assistance in this House in tracking down that waste and perhaps very valuable public services might be axed by the Department of Finance because of its failure to obtain the necessary expertise to eliminate duplication and bad management in the public sector. Therefore, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General needs an adjunct and instead of looking at the historical accuracy of accounting the Comptroller and Auditor General should look at current and future expenditure.  The only time we succeeded in pruning public expenditure effectively was between 1987 and 1989 when Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance.  He only achieved cuts in public expenditure because &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo; was established and outsiders came in to put some new thinking into the way we do our business.  Irrespective of policy, outside management consultants can highlight where there is waste and can cut through the layers of bureaucracy created by principal officers, Assistant <Col N="1587" /> Secretaries and Secretaries who are all justifying the <i>status quo</i>, that is blindingly clear.  Unless politicians instigate this change it will not be done.  I will return to some of these points on Report Stage. I am not happy that the Minister has grasped the concept of what I am saying but it is a political issue and I will let it rest for another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts may direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate any matter of public expenditure which it considers fit and the Comptroller and Auditor General shall carry out such examination by way of a Project Audit Report and shall present his report to that Committee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment in which I propose that the Committee of Public Accounts would be able to direct the Comptroller and Audit General to investigate any matter of public expenditure which it considers fit.  I do not see any reason that the Minister should not accept this.  I am mindful of the fact &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte is a member of this committee and I am not &mdash; that in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the 1991 report which I have here, the Comptroller and Auditor General states in the section dealing with project audit reports that he has dealt with only two areas.  I assume this was <Col N="1588" /> because of staff or resource limitations, but I am sure there are ten areas at least which he could have looked at.  The amendment deals with the situation where the Committee of Public Accounts were of unanimous view that he should examine the effectiveness, for example, of the long term illness scheme &mdash; that is where people, irrespective of income, are entitled to free drugs if they have one of the 12 prescribed illnesses &mdash; and decide whether this is a good scheme or whether the money should be targeted at those most in need.  Under this scheme if the wealthiest person in the country suffers from epilepsy or one of the prescribed illnesses he is entitled to free drugs.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I seek to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to respond to requests made by the Committee of Public Accounts to examine any such areas.  I am not saying there is conflict, as the man in question is most accommodating; but, given the limit of the number of areas that can be probed in depth, I think there is a need for more project audit reports.</P>
    <P>This is a very straightforward amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it. The Minister failed to accept any amendment I tabled to date, so perhaps she may accept this very modest one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will see that both Deputy Yates and I came to the same conclusion independently of each other and I cannot see any reason that the Minister will not accept it.  I believe the Committee of Public Accounts would welcome this.  I became a member of this committee in the recent past so I would not have the experience of those who have served for a long number of years. Without doubt this Bill will assist the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee in their work.  The committee for whatever reason should be able to specifically direct and request the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a specific audit.  This is in keeping not alone with letter but the spirit of the <Col N="1589" /> Bill.  I hope the Minister will not find reasons for rejecting these amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory and one does not have to go into it in detail.  I believe this amendment is an addition to the section.  I have no doubt that the requirement to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out in-depth examination will arise from time to time and I think it should be prescribed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There has been an excellent working relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Anybody who served on the committee can testify to that.  I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General in preparing his audit plans takes note of the concerns and suggestions of the committee. This has been a good and healthy relationship.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in accepting the amendments as tabled because constitutionally the Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer and is not therefore answerable to the committee.  The present system is working well and I am quite sure that whoever holds the office of Comptroller and Auditor General will continue in the best traditions of that office to have regard to the points being raised by the committee.  Because of the constitutional position I do not think it is appropriate to specify this in legislation. I ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit disappointed to see that the only reason advanced for not accepting the amendments is the constitutional position.  I think it ought to be possible for some arrangements to be arrived at, if the Minister is so minded, to encompass the essence of Deputy Yates' and Deputy Cullen's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister says, that a good working relationship exists between the Committee of Public Accounts and <Col N="1590" /> the current holder of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General; but this amendment puts the finger on a very important but underutilised dimension of the work that is capable of being carried out in his office &mdash; namely the question of project audit reports &mdash; which has been very seldom used.  I presume the Minister can confirm that the reason it has been seldom used is because of constraints on staff and resources of the office.</P>
    <P>Let us contemplate the significance of this in an era of scandal after scandal in the business arena and the alleged connections to politics and in the context of the cost of the various forms of inquiry that have been set up as a result of decisions taken in this House.  If it is the case &mdash; and I think it is &mdash; that the capacity of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General to engage in project audit would be limited, surely it would be a very cheap way of providing against interminable inquiries repeating themselves indefinitely into the future?</P>
    <P>An area that comes to mind &mdash; and I happen to have an interest in it for a very long time &mdash; is the question of section 84 based lending.  The former Taoiseach at another forum claimed that only about half a dozen people had any expertise to comment on it.  In that context he was not numbering himself among that group.  While he is right that only a small number know about section 84 loans, I think he is one of them.  It was a fascinating study conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General on what might be seen as a fairly arcane and obscure instrument of industrial policy &mdash; a policy that most Deputies in the nature of things had not found themselves in a position to examine.  When one considers major questions such as the reform of the tax system and its role in boosting job creation one has to look at the question of tax shelters.  Here was an instrument that was never designed as an instrument of industrial policy but evolved that way.</P>
    <P>As I said this morning, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted what some of us knew for quite a long time: that section 84 based lending was of tremendous benefit to the lending institutions <Col N="1591" /> but of significant cost to the taxpayer, averaging about £100 million per annum.  It must be remembered that £100 million is a very high proportion of the total IDA budget.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was able to run the figures for a number of years, and from memory I recall the sums ranged from £87 million to £113 million over the time span he took.  That is a very substantial amount of money, leaving out entirely the complex area of high coupon swap currency arrangements which have been entered into and which have other implications. This study was of immense value in terms of the work undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>There are, I presume, several other such areas that the Comptroller and Auditor General in this aspect of his work could very productively examine and it could be done a great deal more cheaply than by way of the alternatives open to us.  For example, the operation of the inspector system in the current Telecom affair will be an expensive matter for the taxpayer at the end of the day.  It will probably cost the equivalent of a year's budget for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have had the recent example of the former Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House being arraigned before the courts because he made comments about similar costs in the Greencore affair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts should have power, where it sees fit, to require the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct project audit reports.  That could be done at a great deal less cost to the taxpayer than is the case at present, and probably equally effectively.  I acknowledge that the circumstances could not exist whereby every member of the committee felt it would be a good idea to do a project audit on a certain aspect of public <Col N="1592" /> spending.  One has to operate in this business on the basis that there is a majority of reasonably minded people around the table.  As the Minister has said, the system has worked reasonably well and there is a good working relationship between the present occupant of the office and the committee.  I do not know how the point can be met about the independent constitutional status of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the amendment does nothing except make the argument for more resources to be allocated to that office to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General, in consultation with the committee, to do more project audit work, it will have well served its purpose.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies' comments in relation to project audits.  They are a fairly new development in this whole area and they have proved to be very valuable.  I would like to see this area of the Comptroller and Auditor General's work developed, as, I think, would the Deputies and the committee. The word I have a problem with in these amendments is &ldquo;direct&rdquo;.  It is not acceptable that a committee of this House direct an independent constitutional officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General be respected.  Perhaps this matter could be considered for Report Stage to see whether some of the suggestions could be taken on board &mdash; for example, that the Committee of Public Accounts may put ideas before the Comptroller and Auditor General for which he would have constitutional discretion.  That wording might meet the point made by the Deputy, while respecting the constitutional autonomy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said in good faith.  I have visions of some of the more wild-cat members of <Col N="1593" /> the Committee of Public Accounts requesting particular studies and the Comptroller and Auditor General being sent in six different directions at the one time.  However, this committee is a responsible one.  I would be happy to withdraw my amendment on the understanding that the Minister would consider some wording, such as &ldquo;may request&rdquo;, &ldquo;may seek&rdquo; or whatever, that would provide a legislative framework for the committee. The system works very well at present because there is a very understanding and responsive Comptroller and Auditor General in that office, but if a personality held that office who had contempt or a total disregard for politicians the position would be different. This legislation has to stand the test of time irrespective of personalities who serve in any office or on any committee. I will withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Minister will give the matter serious and positive consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the present relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General is excellent and the person in that office is held in high esteem.  The Minister has grasped the spirit of the amendments.  The section should include some reference to this matter and perhaps a proper formulation of words will be found on Report Stage, because one never knows what may occur in the future.  From my experience of serving on committees the members of committees have always had a tremendous working relationship and I have no reason to suspect that will change in the future.  One's political pesuasion seems to be left outside the door when people get down to work on committees and that is a welcome approach.  Therefore there is little danger of wild-cat action being taken.  The principle behind the amendments is a good one.  This very important legislation would be strengthened by the inclusion of acceptable wording on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Whenever the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts makes a report to Dáil Éireann following its consideration of a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the report of such Committee shall be considered by Dáil Éireann as soon as possible after it is laid before it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes that the annual report of the Committee of Public Accounts be debated in the House as soon as possible after it is laid in the Library.  The amendment is self-explanatory. On several occasions the former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Gay Mitchell, raised with a number of Taoisigh on the Order of Business the question as to when reports would be debated in the House. If we are to give a meaningful response to the work of the committee, of which I am not a member, it is appropriate that <Col N="1595" /> spokesperson of the parties respond to reports, especially in terms of particular areas of expenditure and potential improvement.  The Whip system has failed in its scrutiny of this area and for that reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is important that the reports be considered as soon as possible after being laid in the Library. I hope that with the new committee system it will be possible to find more Dáil time to debate these matters.  If such a committee system were in operation today other Government business could have been taken simultaneously with discussion of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The question of the regulation of Dáil business is a matter to be dealt with under Standing Orders rather than legislation as provided for in Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  The point being made is reasonable.  There will be revised terms of reference for the Committee of Public Accounts as soon as the Bill has been enacted.  At that stage the points being made could be taken on board in revised terms of reference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important.  Whether in the area of tax evasion or public expenditure control there is no doubt that people are capable of improving their concepts of review. We have a lot to gain from keeping in touch with overseas developments.  This <Col N="1596" /> is echoed in the White Paper by virtue of the fact that it has an appendix on what is happening in most of the western world in civilised democracies.  A small amount of the Comptroller and Auditor General's time should be taken up with comparative studies of mechanisms of control and audit existing in other member states of the European Communities. There is a degree of variation within Europe in relation to methods. In some continental countries there is a system of magistrates through the court of auditors.  In Europe we have a court of 12 auditors.  We may learn something, not from just aping the British as we usually do, but from taking a wider look at this.  The Principal Act which we are dealing with is the 1866 Act.  We rarely get the opportunity to legislate in this regard so it would be wise to accept this minor amendment.</P>

There is very extensive consultation through these bodies which carry out research at international level &mdash; research in which our Comptroller and Auditor General participates &mdash; on audit standards and practices and procedures in each country.  These bodies conduct research designed to establish the state of practice in each country and use such information establishing norms and standards which they promulgate for guidance of the State audit institutions.  In addition, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has bilateral contact with other supreme audit bodies and with the European Court of Auditors through a liaison office and through temporary secondments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's Office is involved in research and legislation.  Indeed, there was an advisory group on public financial accountability which is in the course of completing its work.  This included looking at the published reports of European <Col N="1597" /> and other audit institutions and visiting parliamentary bodies and national audit agencies in Sweden, West Germany and the US.</P>
      <P>There are already very extensive international contacts through the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the period leading up to the publication of the White Paper and the Bill extensive research was carried out into international audit practices.  It is not necessary to include an enabling provision, as proposed by the Deputy, because the Bill provides adequate scope for the Comptroller and Auditor General to refer to relevant international developments as he sees fit.  There are very structured arrangements in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office for liaising with international audit bodies and national audit bodies.  We could leave things in this case to the professional competence of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his Office.  The amendment is redundant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General prepared by him under this section or under any other section of this Act shall immediately upon being laid before Dáil Éireann be deemed, without the need for any further motion or act of that House to be available for consideration by the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report on the appropriation accounts.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee to allow for fast track procedures so that they can get on with their work.  It is <Col N="1598" /> proposed, without the need for a motion of the Dáil, to make available for consideration by the Public Accounts Committee any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is very important for the credibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Public Accounts Committee process that there is timely and urgent consideration of reports.  At the moment it is April before the accounts are done by the Department, the autumn before the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on the Appropriation Accounts and it is probably into the New Year before the Public Accounts Committee study his report. There is a huge time lag, and it can be extended further if there is a delay in this House in accepting a motion referring the matter to the Public Accounts Committee. This is the most appropriate place in the Bill for this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is merit in ensuring that when the Dáil is in recess, for example, the work of the Public Accounts Committee can continue.  There should not be a need for a Dáil motion referring reports to the committee.  In future there will be a large number of reports.  The Public Accounts Committee will be busier in the future than they are now.  There will be more reports and bigger reports and the whole procedure should not be obstructed by motions in this House being required.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy's point.  This issue will be best dealt with by incorporating it into the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts as soon as the Bill has been enacted.  A similar provision was put into the terms of reference of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I agree that we want a fast track way of looking at these reports.  That is a more effective way of dealing with it than by amending the legislation.  The draft terms of reference were set out in paragraph 4.11 of the White Paper.  They provide that upon the laying by the Public Accounts Committee of the report before Dáil Éireann the committee will print and publish such reports without need for any motion of <Col N="1599" /> the Dáil.  We do not need artificial delays. I agree with the point being made and suggest that we incorporate it in the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" />&ldquo;(1) (a)  The Minister shall, before determining a sum to be recommended to the Government for inclusion in an estimate to cover the charges which will come in course of payment in respect of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for any financial year, refer the draft estimate thereof to the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Committee may, after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General, recommend alterations in the provisions included in the draft estimate.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Minister shall after receiving the recommendations of the Committee submit those recommendations and his determination of the Estimate to the Government for consideration prior to their finalisation and approval.</P>
    <P>(d)  Where no alterations have been recommended by the Committee within a period of three weeks from the date of the referral to it by the Minister of the draft estimate the Minister may finalise his determination without further reference to the Committee.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section provides for an audit by outside accountants of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This amendment relates to the amount of money that should be given to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. While one would agree that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be audited by outside accountants he must be given an adequate budget to do his job.  As has been said repeatedly in this debate, he is an independent constitutional officer.  Therefore, he can be neutral in relation to the discharge of his functions if his budget is not commensurate with the demands of his office.</P>
    <P>This amendment, in the names of Deputies Gay and Jim Mitchell which should be supported, states that the draft <Col N="1601" /> Estimate of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be the subject of consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand this matter was referred to extensively in the White Paper which stated that no organ of the State, whether your office, a Cheann Comhairle, the Ombudsman's Office or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can be immune from public expenditure constraints.  It is accepted that we cannot independently segregate any activity.  However, a special case can be made in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General in view of the unique constitutional organ he provides.  As the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to report to the Dáil, the Dáil Members, through the Committee of Public Accounts, should have the power to make alterations to the draft Estimate and play an advisory role.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the need for consultation between the Comptroller and Auditor General and a member of the committee and Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the role of the Secretary of the Department of Finance and his willingness to act.  The best way to secure the independence of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to allow an independent means of securing his or her budget.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that before making a recommendation to the Government on the Estimate for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General the draft Estimate should be submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts for its recommendations.  Any such recommendations would be submitted to the Government by the Minister together with the Minister's own recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution the initiative in regard to financial matters is entrusted solely to the Government.  Article 17.2 and Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution make this absolutely clear.  It is the sole responsibility of the Government to prepare <Col N="1602" /> Estimates of the expenditure of the State for such financial year and to present them to Dáil Éireann for consideration. The involvement of a committee of the Dáil in the preparation of the Estimates would clearly anticipate the constitutional consideration by the Dáil of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As regards the referral of an Estimate for consideration after its presentation to the Dáil to a committee of the House, this is a matter for the Dáil under Standing Orders rather than for the Government. The issue of the referral of Estimates in general has been raised in the context of Oireachtas reform in the programme for Government.  The question of a role for the Committee of Public Accounts in that process is one which, if necessary, could be considered in that context having regard to the proposed changes in the committee's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that members of the Committee of Public Accounts, as Members of the Dáil, can participate in the Estimates debate.  The Estimates provision for the Comptroller and Auditor General is thus subject to public scrutiny and debate.  However, in this legislation it is not the Government's intention to stifle the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is the Government's intention that a reasonable amount of resources would be available to the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out the functions, including the new functions assigned to him under the legislation. Indeed, the section we are discussing provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General, no more than other officers of the State, would be subject to review and a value for money audit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the accuracy of what the Minister of State said in relation to the Constitution, the control of expenditure and the proposal for expenditure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer, as stated by Deputy Yates and others.  We have to find some means of ensuring that the intent of the Constitution under both headings is met. Additional responsibilities are being <Col N="1603" /> given in this Bill to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he has been given additional responsibilities in the Acts which established the regional technical colleges.  If he has these additional responsibilities and is not allowed to fill vacancies, the intention of the Constitution and this House can be easily frustrated by the Executive.  Under the Constitution, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts are established as watchdogs.</P>
      <P>There has been a delay in filling a number of vacancies in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Recently there was an improvement which brought the establishment up to 80 but the number of personnel required is in excess of 100 if the job is to be done expeditiously and properly.  It is conceivable that an Executive who was slipshod in the way money was expended might want to frustrate its exposure by not allowing the Comptroller and Auditor General sufficient staff to audit on time.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a case for a percentage of the budget earmarked for the Comptroller and Auditor General each year not being altered by the Government except by a vote of the House?  Does the Minister see merit in such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote the following from the White Paper:</P>
      <P>The Government would not accept nor has there been any evidence to suggest that the Executive's attitude towards providing resources for the Comptroller and Auditor General is in any way influenced by the fact that his role involves reporting on some aspects of the Executive's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise in times of difficulty with regard to public expenditure &mdash; I do not know when we did not have difficult times in regard to public expenditure &mdash; that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot <Col N="1604" /> be immune, no more than any other office, from scrutiny in terms of trying to keep a reasonable balance on public expenditure.  It is not the intention of the Government to frustrate the current legislation by denying reasonable resources to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In his reports it is open to the Comptoller and Auditor General to comment on the adequacy of the resources available to him.</P>
    <P>Section 17 proposes the transfer of staff from the local government audit service to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in order to bring new bodies into the audit system.  As I stated there are constitutional difficulties in the way the proposal is formulated.  However, the Government is examining the possibility of referring Estimates introduced in this House to committees for consideration. It is a matter for further review whether the Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate committee for referral of the Estimate by the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given various commitments to the House.  Will she now give a commitment on behalf of the Government that there will be ample expansion of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of resources and personnel to meet the requirements of this legislation and to ensure its constitutional independence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper the Government acknowledged the implications in regard to the level of resources required by the Comptroller and Auditor General and stated that, as the legislation is brought into effect, the Comptroller and Auditor General's requirements will be reviewed by the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I will give that commitment to the House.</P>

      <Col N="1605" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1)  The Government shall prior to the recommendations of a person to Dáil Éireann for nomination by it for appointment as Comptroller and Auditor General seek the views of the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine the report on the appropriation accounts.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Committee shall within one month deliver its opinion to the Minister for submission to the Government.</P>
      <P>(3)  After considering the opinion of the Committee or where no opinion has been received from it within the period specified in subsection (2) the Government may proceed to recommend the person for nomination by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that we insert this new section in the Bill.  The amendment proposes to give the Committee of Public Accounts a consultative role in nominating and appointing a new Comptroller and Auditor General when a vacancy occurs.  It does not propose that the committee should take the place of the Government in its nominating role but seeks to give it a consultative role.  In the case of constitutional offices, including that of the Comptroller and Auditor General and judges of the High Court, we should take the Constitution literally and allow the President to make such appointments, possibly with the advice and consent of this or the other House.  Those appointments should be taken out of the political system, particularly the appointment of High Court and Supreme Court judges. I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of this amendment which would not go that far, but would give the Committee <Col N="1606" /> of Public Accounts a consultative role in such appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 33.2 of the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.  To elaborate on this straightforward provision by statute would not be desirable.  Essentially, the nomination of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional prerogative of this House and the statutory preferment of a committee of this House to receive prior notice of proposals could be seen as interfering with the constitutional privilege of other Members and the right of every Member to participate in the process of such a nomination. Members of the Committee of Public Accounts, as members of this House and in common with other Deputies, have a right to participate in the nomination procedure and can express their views on any nomination. One would not like to create a situation whereby officers of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, who might be potential nominees, would be perceived as favoured because of their experience. That could create strains on the working relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.</P>
      <P>However, there is nothing to prevent formal contacts when the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office becomes vacant &mdash; or even before that &mdash; including the Public Accounts Commitee making its views known to the Government of the day.  It is better not to formalise something in legislation in this regard because, constitutionally, it is a function of all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister too naive to realise when it is stated that the Dáil will nominate a person to an office, effectively, it means the Government will nominate such a person because a majority in the Dáil comprises the Government.  A political hack could be put forward by the Government of the day who might indulge in nepotism. <Col N="1607" /> There could be a variety of options in that vein.  The Department of Finance could nominate a totally unsuitable person.  In other words, the Committee of Public Accounts might take the view that, for example, somebody with experience in the private sector should be appointed.  A certain standard is required in regard to the individual's curriculum vitae.  The people who have to work with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts who represent all parties in this House, would give a much more balanced view than the Government.  To say that all Members of the House have a view because it is a nominee of the Dáil is not the point.  The Taoiseach or Minister for Finance could propose a Deputy as Comptroller and Auditor General and, regardless of the views of the Opposition, that person would be appointed.  The appointment is political, a level of consultation would not entail a constitutional problem but would guarantee the independence of the office.</P>

      <P>I am determined to discharge the functions of that office for as long as I hold it.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would have been more open to accepting at least the basic idea contained in this amendment. It would improve the image of the Government if such appointments were taken out of the political realm.  I would be happy if there was a cross-party mechanism for agreement on this type of appointment in the future.  When the first Ombudsman was appointed there was informal but effective cross-party consultation. I recall that the Opposition front benches were consulted on that occasion.  That was a step in the right direction.  There is no guarantee that there will be consultation the next time a vacancy occurs in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office, the Ombudsman's Office or the Supreme Court or the High Court.  I am not aware of any consultation in regard to appointments in the past to the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General or to the courts.  These areas should be detached from Government.  If people have to ingratiate themselves with Government in order to get these jobs there are obvious dangers.  I do not think it is entirely implausible to think that people who want to become High Court judges, who want to go from the High Court to the Supreme Court or who want to become Ombudsman or Comptroller and Auditor General might ingratiate themselves with the Government.  There will be human failure in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be infinitely better if the Constitution <Col N="1609" /> was put into effect in these matters so that the President would make the appointments, that the Dáil and not the Government would make the nomination and that the initial forum for teasing out the Dáil's nomination would be the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think one can ignore the reality outlined by Deputy Yates &mdash; in this case the phrase &ldquo;on the nomination of Dáil Éireann&rdquo; means on the nomination of the Government of the day.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent in the exercise of his functions so that he will be dependent on the Government.  In view of this the Minister should take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I become weary when the Government in debates start to hide behind the Constitution.  We are making a simple straightforward request to the Minister.  It is nonsense to suggest that the Government of the day could not consult with the appropriate committee &mdash; in this case the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; on a matter of great importance. The Minister has more or less said that if it is suitable consultation will take place and if it is not suitable, for whatever reason, there will be no consultation.  The reality is that the Government will not consult because, as has been rightly said, it is a Government appointment and it is not going to consult with anybody; it will decide when and where the appointment will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the excellent relationship and tremendous track record between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, it would be beneficial to all concerned if the Government listened to the views of the committee.  This could be done in an informal way to get over the possibility of impinging on the Constitution.  This is a reasonable point.  I do not understand why the Government should operate in such a way that it would not take account of the views of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Perhaps the amendment could be altered in some way to ensure that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the opportunity to discuss with the <Col N="1610" /> Government of the day its views on any future appointment to the office of Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 39 in the name of the Minister. Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 39 and amendment No. 40 are related.  I suggest that we take amendment No. 39, amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 39 and amendment No. 40 together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, may designate for the purposes of transfer under this section such and so many officers of the Minister for the Environment whose duties, immediately before the designation, consisted of or included the audit of accounts or duties relating to such audits, as appear to him to be requisite to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to perform the functions conferred on him by this Act, and a person so designated shall, upon such date as may be specified in the designation, become <Col N="1612" /> and be an officer of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to provide for flexibility in the transfer of staff from the local government audit service to the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  The previous draft section 17 proposed that the people working on a particular audit would move <i>en bloc</i> with that audit.  This amendment provides for greater flexibility in terms of the movement of staff.  For example, staff working on a local authority audit who wish to move to the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office will under this amendment be able to make that transfer.  The section deals with the legal powers and other matters.  The transfer arrangements will be a matter for negotiation between the staff and office concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In the last line, after &ldquo;General&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but shall thereafter hold office and be employed by the Comptroller and Auditor General on terms relating to pay and conditions of employment not less favourable than those terms which applied to them prior to such transfer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is an improvement on the original section 17, but it still does not go far enough.  All the people in the local government audit service auditing the books of vocational education committees and health boards are scattered throughout the country.  At present the Comptroller and Auditor General's offices are located in Dublin.  I am specifically proposing in this amendment and in amendment No. 40 that regard should be had to the people working in an area &mdash; in other words, that it would be unreasonable to ask somebody living and working in Edenderry or Moville in Donegal to move to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested earlier in the debate that the two offices should be amalgamated and decentralised.  It is possible that people in these offices may be asked to move to other offices if there is a further <Col N="1613" /> diminution of the local government auditors' role in the future.  These workers, who are represented by IMPACT, have made representations about this matter. Notwithstanding the assurances given by the Minister, I ask her to give a commitment to the House that no one will be moved to a different area.  In other words, will the people in my constituency of Wexford be able to continue to work out of their existing offices?  I would imagine that for the Comptroller and Auditor General to hire new offices would put him to additional cost.  The existing leasing and property arrangements he has around the country should be retained and that, since there is a move from the Department of the Environment, there would be an absolute understanding that there would be no diminution of the status, rank, pay, conditions or location of the staff concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is no question of downgrading any existing officer.  That simply does not arise.  There is a number of factors which would support moves towards regionalisation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  Quite apart from the provisions of the Bill in bringing in some locally based bodies such as vocational education committees and health boards, there has been some decentralisation of Government offices to different areas &mdash; for example, the move of the Department of Social Welfare to Sligo and Letterkenny &mdash; which suggests that it might be sensible to locate some of the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff in the north-west where they could deal with ordering the offices concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office has been giving very serious consideration to the question of regionalisation and when the provisions of this Bill are enacted it is probably inevitable that we will see changes in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service in general is not an <Col N="1614" /> unreasonable employer and factors such as current location and family circumstances are generally taken on board by managements when making their staffing dispositions.  To date the decentralisation programme has been operated in the public service with a degree of humanity and flexibility.  I would envisage a similar level of humanity and flexibility being taken on board in making any of the changes.</P>
    <P>I myself met with the audit people from Wexford that Deputy Yates has expressed concern about.  Having listened to what they have to say, the changes have been made in section 17 in the amendment I have put down, amendment No. 39.  There is a need to balance the wishes of the staff and the requirements of the work and I do not think it is possible to give any absolute guarantee to the House.  However, the Deputy can be assured that, in accordance with normal, good industrial relations practices, the changes made as a result of the Bill will be discussed with the staff concerned and every effort will be made to mimimise disruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Under what circumstances would the Minister see an amendment being made to the Schedules?  A great deal of debate has taken place here in relation to the number of State companies that are excluded from inspection rights under the Second Schedule and the number of new groups that are to be <Col N="1616" /> audited.  If a new semi-State body is set up does this section empower the Minister to change it by order or can the Minister actually change the effect of sections 8 and 9 by ministerial Order?  For instance, if a scandal developed overnight in Bord na Móna could the Minister by order change the points we debated this morning? Would the removal of a company from the Schedule overcome our point of substance in relation to the Schedule, or would it require further legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with that point, let me say that the purpose is to insert a standard provision that would empower the Minister for Finance by order to add or remove bodies or agencies from the First, Second and Third Schedules.  This is likely to arise in general when new bodies are established, when bodies are abolished or renamed, or when the nature of a body is changed so that it is no longer appropriate to the Schedule concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with points that were raised in the House this morning on which I was not then fully briefed.  There was a point raised this morning about the Central Bank which I want to clarify.  The Central Bank is audited under its own legislation by the Comptroller and Auditor General, but the reports do not go to the Committee of Public Accounts. There will be a review in general of Central Bank legislation arising from the new European Central Bank which will be set up following the completion of the Maastricht Treaty process.  Therefore, that will be looked at again in that context. I just want to confirm that the Central Bank is one of the bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Central Bank Acts.  Similarly, Temple Bar Properties, which we discussed this morning, is audited under its own Statute by the Comptroller and Auditor General and this has moved to the Department of the Environment in recent weeks.  Temple Bar Properties is regarded as a commercial body.  If it is no longer audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General it will not then be subject to inspection.  Temple Bar <Col N="1617" /> Renewal &mdash; we are dealing with policy issues there &mdash; is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and it is not regarded as a commercial State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule lists bodies which are entrusted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by this Bill.  There are some 43 other bodies which the Comptroller and Auditor General audits, including the Temple Bar bodies and the Central Bank, by virtue of specific enactments under their own legislation.  The position of those is unchanged by the Bill, except that the value for money audit would now apply to them and to any subsidiaries they now have, and I can supply the Deputies with a list of those bodies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a point in relation to changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was in relation to changes.  If one wanted to investigate a semi-State company under section 8, could that be done by changing the Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, amend the Schedule.  In theory he could delete bodies from a particular Schedule which would change their status under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that allow inspection rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would allow inspection rights.  As I said this morning when we were dealing with the whole question of the commercial State-sponsored bodies, there is a general provision, which has never been exercised, for the House to call for a report in relation to any particular body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that if a scandal or a problem arose in relation to a company listed in the Second Schedule the Minister could make a deletion order, thereby requiring the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an inspection?  Is the procedure to be followed as simple as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two procedures open.  First, there is the provision that has not to date been used under which the Comptroller and Auditor General would prepared a report on behalf of the House.  The second possibility, technically, is for the Minister to make an amending order under the First, Second or Third Schedules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Under which legislation is the unused provision to be found?  As I understand it, I could, for example, put before the House a motion calling on the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate a certain impropriety in a particular semi-State company or Government Department.  For instance, if I were not satisfied with the operation of the Leader programme I have available to me the option of putting such a motion before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 23, subsection (3), line 9, after &ldquo;provision&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but, in any <Col N="1619" /> event, not later than 5 years after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to have moved my amendment, No. 46, first.  In it I suggested that the legislation shall come into effect not later than 1 July 1993.  Amendment No. 44, Deputy Mitchell's amendment, which is similar, provides that the legislation shall come into operation not later than five years after the passage of the Bill which is expected to occur in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>After the passage of the child care legislation, to which I tabled more than 200 amendments, I promised that I would not allow legislation in which I was involved to be passed without a specific date being set for its commencement. Some years ago I had a protracted debate on this issue with Deputy Noel Treacy, who was Minister of State at the Department and had responsibility for the child care legislation.  The Minister of State gave numerous commitments that provisions relating to care, to control and to supervision of children, among others, would be implemented without delay.  To this day, that has not happened.  I also was involved in the processing of the legislation on private nursing homes, for which Deputy O'Hanlon, as Minister, had responsibility.  The provisions of that legislation have still not been implemented.</P>
    <P>We have a hopeless record when it comes to implementing legislation.  We are great at passing legislation and then forgetting about it.  Once legislation goes beyond the scrutiny of the House it tends to sink into a hole and then be forgotten. If the Minister is taking the provisions of this Bill seriously, I advise her not to pay too much attention to assurances she might be given.  She might find that she is no longer a Member of the House, is retired and drawing the pension before the provisions are implemented.</P>
    <P>The timetable I suggested in amendment No. 46 is short and would result in the legislation being implemented.  The Minister may wish to set a different date, but I suggest that she decide on a date no <Col N="1620" /> later than 1 January 1994.  If the Minister were to decide on that date the accounts for the Estimates of 1994 would then be an issue and the legislation would not come into operation for some time.  Failure to set a date or to include a clause under which the Minister may later specify a date, would provide a facility to longfinger the provisions.  If the legislation is not implemented the House will have wasted its time.  I ask the Minister to come back on Report Stage with a suitable date.  It is important to set a specific date because with pressing political issues there is a tendency for legislation to lapse.  This is an important issue of substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's anxieties in relation to the implementation of this legislation.  I hope it will be operational quickly.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, and the Department of Finance, are as anxious as Deputies opposite to have the Bill enacted and implemented as soon as possible.  Certain aspects of the Bill require consultation with staff, and I am keen to have those consultations concluded before bringing under the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General the vocational education committees and health boards, for example.  I hope there will be no undue delay in bringing those negotiations to a reasonable conclusion. In that sense, the setting of a definite time limit would not be possible.  It may take a little time to bring into audit bodies such as Trinity College, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and certainly before I draw a pension.  The setting of a <Col N="1621" /> five year timespan would send the wrong signals.  The Bill was introduced early in the life of the present Government.  It was ready for debate about five weeks ago but had to give way to the emergency Bill in relation to the Office of Public Works.  It was then expected to hold the debate a fortnight later but for various reasons that was not possible &mdash; I seem to recall that some Opposition Deputies who were anxious to participate in the debate were not available at that time. The attention given to this Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to have this legislation enacted and operational as soon as possible.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General is very anxious to have the Bill enacted and has been examining how he will bring sections of it into operation.  He wishes to begin this work soon.</P>
      <P>Members on all sides share a desire to have the value for money audits and an upgraded late twentieth century auditing system brought into effect.  I can give the House that assurance without setting a specific date, for the reasons I have given. I realise that there is a huge price tag involved in the implementation of some legislation but that is not the case with this Bill and there is no reason that it should be held up.  The Government has this year set aside £4 million for the implementation of the private nursing homes' legislation.  I am happy that the new Government secured that change.  It is hoped that progress will be made on the implementation of various sections of the child care legislation.  Section 5 of that legislation is in operation but I am not sure which other sections have been implemented.  Implementation of those provisions carries a specific cost.  There is no huge cost involved in implementing this Bill and there should be no undue delay in making it operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Minister virtually agrees with me.  I agree it is necessary to have time for consultation, that five years is too long a period and could send out the wrong signals. However, the record shows that operation dates can be delayed.  The Minister <Col N="1622" /> on Report Stage should suggest a date that she considers feasible and would send the right signals.  The Minister can give no assurance to the House about an operation date if she is not in office.  We are all just passing through, the institutions will long outlive us.</P>
      <P>I must point out that there are other Bills on which the Minister could make that point about certain health legislation. There are other matters in which I have been involved which have been long-fingered.  I believe there are valid grounds for concern here.  I would ask the Minister to say whether she envisages this will be enacted, say, within a year, by January next or whenever.  I contend that some date should be laid down so that people will know we mean business.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw amendment No. 44.  I would ask the Minister to sit down with the Comptroller and Auditor General and her officials and agree some date for Report Stage.  Failure to do so will mean an ultimate lack of accountability.  There will be no use my meeting the Minister of State, say, shopping in Stillorgan in 1997 and talk to her about the Bill we discussed one day in the Dáil whose provisions still have not been implemented because there will be damn all she will be able to do about it then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I listened to part of the contribution of Deputy Gallagher when he strongly criticised the leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, for not specifying the costings of some of the proposals he advanced.  I smiled to myself on hearing a Labour Party Member wonder from where all of these proposals would be funded.  He must have a very short memory because I recall in the run up to the general election promises being given to semi-State bodies such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and others expecting the big pay out or golden handshake.  Unfortunately, they had not been costed, so that when the new Government assumed office they did not deliver the goods.  It was somewhat hypocritical of Deputy Gallagher to voice such criticisms when he could not see the beam in his own eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity of contributing to the budget debate.  The first budget of any new Coalition Government is particularly important in that it reflects the blend of ideologies and priorities of its partners.  However, the budget of 1993 was a non-event and very quickly dismissed by the national media as an item warranting little attention.  It would appear that the general public also found it a tremendous bore.  At a time of record unemployment levels it was disappointing that a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State did not take positive action to eliminate the greatest ill of our times, unemployment. Sadly, that did not happen. Discussions that have taken place since <Col N="1625" /> then have focused more on the appointment of advisers and family members within the Government rather than on the real issue of how our unemployment levels can be reduced.</P>
    <P>One positive provision of this budget was the increase in the carer's allowance, which is to be welcomed.  Carers are tremendous people who devote their time and energies to the care of someone less fortunate than themselves, those who are unable to look after themselves, perhaps an elderly relative, one of their children or even a neighbour unable to care for herself or himself.  These are the unsung heroes of our nation, thousands of whom perform this work of mercy daily without counting the cost on themselves.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this carer's allowance a number of years ago was a long overdue recognition of their tremendous work.  That recognition soon turned very sour when a stringent means testing system was implemented.  Applicants for this allowance are assessed by the Department of Social Welfare, who base their decision on the income of the people involved without any regard to the loss of income incurred in caring for those who cannot look after themselves.  It is disappointing that in this recent budget the Minister did not see fit to relax the qualifying conditions for such carer's allowance.  There is an assumption abroad that anybody who looks after an elderly relative is automatically in receipt of this allowance.  Sadly, only about 1,100 people nationwide are in receipt of the maximum allowance.  Therefore, I am very disappointed the Minister did not do something for the other thousands of carers who do not at present qualify for this.</P>
    <P>Another positive development in this budget has been the increase in child benefit, which generous improvement will be welcomed by many.  However, it should be noted that this is an increase across the board and does not take into account the circumstances of people receiving the allowance.  In other words, parents earning perhaps £40,000 per annum will receive the same increase in <Col N="1626" /> child benefit as others in receipt of a weekly dole allowance.  The cost of this increase in a full year will be of the order of £50 million.  Surely that £50 million could have been targeted more precisely at those most in need of help?</P>
    <P>In addition, the 3.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments is to be welcomed. Here I should like to quote from the response of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors' in their document on the budget:</P>
    <P>While we welcome the overall increases to social welfare recipients we regret that they are so low.  We doubt that these increases will keep pace with inflation since they would be eroded by increases in differential rents and VAT.  Also, we need to point out that these increased payments do not take effect until the end of July.</P>
    <P>Raising social welfare payments to the minimum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, that is £65 for a single person and £104 per week for a couple, would have cost £150 million and could have been done.  This would have the double effect of helping the vast majority of the poor and giving a valuable boost to the economy.</P>
    <P>Another positive aspect of the budget is the increase in the family income supplement. I welcome this increase as it is an excellent way of ensuring that payments are made to those in need.  We can ensure, through the family income supplement scheme, that it is worthwhile for a person with a family to continue working instead of going on the dole.</P>
    <P>The single most objectionable aspect of the budget is the 1 per cent tax on employment to be paid by employees in receipt of £9,000 and over per annum. This is supposed to be a temporary measure but, like all other temporary measures introduced by the Department of Finance, it will quickly become a permanent feature.  This is a straightforward tax on employment and will help to convince those already at work that perhaps they would be better off on the dole.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget which is particularly distasteful is the introduction <Col N="1627" /> of the 2 per cent probate tax.  The significance and magnitude of this tax has probably not yet been understood or appreciated by the public at large.  It represents the reintroduction of death duties.  Children inheriting from their parents will have to pay an additional £1,000 on every £50,000 worth of property inherited.  It will hit the business community particularly hard and will also be significant from the point of view of the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this probate tax, which flies in the face of a recent Government direction, is that it will be imposed on a spouse who inherits from his or her partner.  The Minister will allow the spouse to inherit the family home exempt from probate tax but any additional property, a business or farm, will be subject to this tax.  This is a callous form of additional taxation which will cause severe hardship and the Minister should revoke it.  I am sure many cases have already been brought to his notice to show that if this probate tax had to be paid it would have caused severe hardship for the spouse concerned.  This is, as I said, an objectionable form of taxation and should be revoked.</P>
    <P>The changes in the VAT rates represent a disincentive to job creation and will put many industries at risk.  The change in the VAT rate on food and accommodation has been condemned by the tourism industry in general.  It will help to reinforce the idea that Ireland is not competitive in the international tourism market and will result in many job losses.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent on newspapers represents a particular blow to the industry and will have a profound effect on our national newspapers.  Up to 50 per cent of daily newspapers sold are now imported from Britain where newspapers are zero rated.</P>
    <P>This new VAT rate represents a major blow to the smaller provincial newspapers which provide, particularly in my own area of County Westmeath, secure and pensionable employment.  They also <Col N="1628" /> provide a flow of information in their own catchment areas which is invaluable to the community.  Indeed, local newspapers fill a particular niche in that they record the history of their locality on a weekly basis, the local football match or a meeting of the local Fianna Fáil cumann, while some members may be lucky in having their speeches in this House published. The local newspaper has it all and records it for posterity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They distribute news on a local basis and record achievements and developments for posterity.  Their reward for this invaluable service is an increase in the VAT rate this year.  This follows the changes in the budget last year when it was stated that they would no longer be regarded as a manufacturing process despite the fact that the workers involved are skilled craftsmen having undertaken certified apprenticeship courses and examinations.  The newspaper industry finds this particularly annoying and it will have a major effect on their profitability and ability to plough profits back into the business.</P>
      <P>The lifting of the cap on RTE as well as competition from local radio has put existing jobs in this important sector at risk.  How could a Government which pretends to care about jobs and which pays lip service to the need to create more jobs be so vigorous and ruthless in taxing existing jobs?</P>
      <P>The change in the VAT rate imposed on the building industry is a source of major concern.  The VAT rate on housing has been increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent and this will add an additional £1,000 to a £40,000 house. This will be offset by the increase in the new house grant but it is not sufficient. Is this the incentive the building industry needs to get it off its knees?  Has the Government turned its back on the industry in its time of crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply sector to the building trade is concerned that the imposition of a 21 per cent VAT rate on readymix concrete <Col N="1629" /> and blocks will lead to an expansion of the black economy and pressure on jobs in the sector.  Recently a supplier of readymix concrete in my own area contacted me to inform me that he had given a quotation for a job last January of £1,200 plus VAT at 10 per cent.  The total cost to the customer was £1,320.  He felt that this was expensive and, as usual in rural areas, he sought to have the job done without VAT being imposed.  Following the budget when the VAT rate had been increased to 21 per cent the same job cost £1,452, an increase of £252. Needless to say the customer decided that he would not have the job done, that he would buy the material and do the work himself.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that he will be able to buy some of the material without paying VAT and will employ local labour.  There is a strong possibility that the job will be done by people on the dole with the result that the State will lose out.  This increase in the VAT rate will drive many of our small builders into the black economy, hence revenue will be lost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a retailer in the rag trade in my constituency.  I called to his shop on a Friday morning and in the course of conversation he pointed out that business was very poor.  His total sales for that week amounted to approximately £100.  When he became aware that the VAT rate on clothes would be almost doubled, I received an indignant telephone call from him.  It was increased in 1992 to 12.5 per cent and it has been further increased this year to 21 per cent. This will have an effect on sales in the clothing business and will lead to job losses.</P>
    <P>The farming community has expressed extreme disappointment at this budget. Faced with the repercussions of Common Agricultural Policy reform and the unfinished GATT negotiations the prospects for farming are disastrous.  The imposition of the 2 per cent probate tax is yet another nail in its coffin.  The day when the average family farm could support two families is long gone and for many farmers the light at the end of what had become a bleak tunnel was the proposed <Col N="1630" /> retirement scheme under the Common Agricultural Policy.  In spite of the fact that 75 per cent of the funding will be provided from Brussels the Government is delaying its introduction and only £1 million has been allocated in the budget. The budget shows the farming community that the opportunity of providing the impetus to install young farmers on viable units is low on the Government's agenda.  Indecision in regard to this scheme is depriving the agricultural industry of a much needed boost.</P>
    <P>To add to the insult in regard to the retirement scheme it has come as a disappointment that no money has been included in this year's budget to allow additional payments for farmers in areas which may be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme as a result of pending appeals.  This omission indicates clearly that the Government has no intention of completing the review and making payments in 1993.  This is very disappointing from the point of view of the agricultural sector in particular.</P>
    <P>In relation to education, one of the aspects of the budget that I welcome, and on which I seek further clarification, is the announcement that there will be an increase in the capitation allowance in respect of children in primary schools from £28 to £33 per head.  However, it is unclear whether this will be paid in respect of every pupil attending primary school.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>
    <P>Are schools expected to apply for the increase or will they be automatically included if they meet certain criteria? One of the major disappointments of the budget was the failure to appoint a sufficient number of remedial teachers.  In literature issued by the Labour Party before the election it identified a need for 1,000 extra remedial teachers in primary schools.  There must have been the democratic deficit when the Programme for Government was introduced because in it the Government promised 500 extra remedial teachers to be appointed over the next four or five years.  It is disappointing to note that very few of those will be appointed this year and that a very <Col N="1631" /> small amount has been provided for the appointment of these teachers at the beginning of the 1993 school year.</P>
    <P>There are very few remedial teachers around the country.  In the region of 2,000 primary schools have no remedial teacher service.  Approximately 1,400 primary schools have the services of a remedial teacher.  I was amazed at the result of a survey I conducted in my county and four neighbouring counties.  I found that approximately 72 schools in the five counties had the services of a remedial teacher and of those schools only 15 per cent were satisfied that the service of those teachers was adequate.  Many schools felt more pupils within the system required remedial help but who were not receiving it.  It was also amazing to find that of the children receiving remedial help, approximately 62 per cent were receiving help for one hour or less per week.  I am sure the new Minister for Education, who is a remedial teacher, would agree that one hour's remedial help per week in a primary school is totally inadequate.  We must improve that system dramatically.</P>
    <P>It was also interesting to note from that survey that about 8 per cent of children were receiving what I consider to be adequate time, that is, two hours per week or more.  The INTO, and educational specialists, agree that unless a child is receiving approximately 20 to 30 minutes remedial help per day during the school week, the service is inadequate. The Minister for Education should ensure that remedial help is available to all schools.  I appeal for a system that is equitable because our rural primary schools are discriminated against in the appointment of remedial teachers and this must be rectified as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address some of the points made by various speakers.  This budget covers the whole economic development of the country for the next 12 months.  It covers areas such as social welfare, tax bands, excise duties, education, health, the CAP, GATT reform, the disadvantaged areas and other issues <Col N="1632" /> which involve us.  For some reason the Opposition, in particular, want to know what input the Labour Party has had into the budget after 80 days in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping to give the correct answer but, obviously, Deputies opposite want to surrender some of their suggestions, which I accept.  I find it hard to understand the attitude of Fine Gael who criticised the Labour Party for wanting additional spending which may exceed the Maastricht guidelines for borrowing. In a debate on a motion taken in Private Members' Time, and in the budget debate, Fine Gael suggested that the Labour Party is too restrictive or has been involved in trying to balance some books. The Labour Party, at parliamentary party level in particular, realised that it was inevitable that the budget would be tough following the currency crisis and the collapse in the value of sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The framing of the budget was not easy but it had to be done in such a way as to get the economy moving. There is a responsibility on all of us &mdash; there will be a particular focus on the Labour Party in Government &mdash; to get the economy moving again and create jobs, not in 80 days, but during the life of the Government.  We entered into that commitment with the Fianna Fáil Party, our partners in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government indicated its intention to increase house building numbers to facilitate those on the housing list.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the housing programme admitted that after four and a half years of trying to meet the needs in our constituencies for more housing there are still up to 10,000 people on the housing list.  Although our housing programme is three to four times better than that produced last year it falls far short of the programme we would like <Col N="1633" /> to deliver.  I know the Fine Gael Party, and their Leader in particular, has reservations about building local authority houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that where local public authority houses are provided ghettos are created but he does not realise that we need to house people living in mobile homes in developed housing estates and provide sufficient green areas and other facilities for them. Spokespersons from various parties, and former Cabinet Ministers, indicated that we need to create jobs in productive sectors, like the construction industry, compete in the marketplace to provide necessary services and use EC moneys to the best advantage.  We need to create jobs in our constituencies.</P>
      <P>Realistically to create jobs we must keep interest rates down.  The Opposition parties have not commented on the lowering of interest rates.  The Government, rightly, did not claim any credit for the lowering of interest rates but it has, with some dynamism, created an economic environment which may lead to a further reduction in interest rates.  If interest rates remain high the Government, in the budget, undertook to indemnify people left in financial difficulty as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, in particular, when in Government had reservations about too much State involvement but in Opposition it wants dynamic State intervention in all areas.  The Labour Party would welcome this but the reality is that if we are to create a balance in the ordinary business of the State as generated by the Government the private sector also has a role to play.  In this budget the private sector has been given a stimulus to avail of the allowances being offered to take people off social welfare and provide them with work.  However, very few entrepreneurs are willing to do this unless they can be almost guaranteed profits.  In general they seek tax free profits.  It is essential that all of us, those in the PAYE sector, the farmers and so on, must also <Col N="1634" /> pay a share towards creating the environment where jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>The Progresive Democrats admitted last night that the influence of the Labour Party in this Government was created by its over emphasis on the disadvantaged. Let me tell the Progressive Democrats that we in the Labour Party owe no apology to anyone in Opposition for ensuring that the marginalised in our society, unrepresented in the past, will not be disadvantaged and that their needs will be met as a priority.  The increase of £500 million in the public capital programme will create jobs on the ground.  A series of projects have been identified by the Tánaiste on his return from Brussels and works on roads, rail, housing, sanitary services, communications, schools and hospitals will be included in the capital injection of £500 million.  We have made a start in housing with the construction of 3,500 houses in our first year in office and given a commitment over the four and a half year period to continue the building programme, in spite of Fine Gael's reservations.</P>
    <P>We want to see improvements in the system of apprenticeships and training. The social employment and the FÁS schemes were tottering from one year to another, with no commitment to specific projects, but we will ensure that the projects will maintain viable jobs in the future.  I hope the announcement of the revamped social employment scheme, which the State will generate itself, will have the support of the Opposition instead of the nit picking which is so popular.  Those people who are well heeled and not in need of State assistance can afford to nit pick.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit is another example of this partnership Government's commitment to improving an areas that can be targeted effectively. This increase in child benefit is a fulfilment of our commitment.  We, together with our partners in Government, will continue to ensure that child benefit will increase to the promised level over our period in Government.  The Combat Poverty Agency and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors have identified <Col N="1635" /> large families on low income as a priority area of need.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have been brought about in the social welfare code.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Ms. Burton, responded publicly on Sunday to some of the criticisms levelled at her on her input to the social welfare code.  We commend the Minister, Deputy Woods, for his knowledge and understanding of the subject. Already there have been significant changes in the area of entitlements.  Why should there not be improvements? Through the PRSI system people have contributed to insuring themselves against sickness, ill-health or lack of work.  Fine Gael sent out the call that a reduction in PRSI contributions would be the answer to everybody's problem. They fail to identify what would happen to the social insurance fund if there were no PRSI contributions going into it.</P>
    <P>When considering areas of disadvantage let us not forget the elderly, particularly in this Year of the Elderly. Fortunately, the elderly are living longer, but this is putting extra demands on the service which nobody has managed to meet properly.  People who should be accommodated in welfare homes or geriatric hospitals have to stay in private nursing homes without any subvention from the health boards.  For the first time since the legislation was prepared four years ago, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, has provided £4 million in subventions to medical card holders, in particular those in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>We have identified also other areas of health care need and we will discuss those in the next resolution.  I will have the opportunity at 7 p.m. to remind the high spending Fine Gael Party of their attitude to the cuts in the health services over the past number of years, because they seem to be anxious to try to finger what members of the Parliamentary Labour Party said on record over the years.  The only reason they do that is because they said nothing.  The Fine Gael Party said absolutely nothing and abstained from votes on the health services.</P>

      <P>I will now deal with education. There is now a programme to bring schools on stream after years in the doldrums.  The Minister has also made a commitment to increasing the capitation grants from next September.  This is part of a planned response to what is happening in the economy, particularly as it relates to people in disadvantaged areas. A tough job faces us, but we in the Labour Party have always been prepared to face tough decisions.  We have necks of steel.</P>
      <P>At times we reminisce on the period we were in Government with a different party.  The record speaks for itself.  We had eventually to walk out because our partner would not listen to what we said needed to be done.  In spite of their best efforts now, we have agreed a programme with our partners in Government and we have made a commitment to work together to ensure that this programme will work.  All the catchcries from across the floor will not divert the Government, and particularly the Labour Party, from what we want to do in the budget.  We are not ashamed to say that we have examined the area of social welfare, because who else will take responsibility for social welfare recipients? The Fine Gael Party cry for the abolition of PRSI, but this ignores the demands that may be made on the social insurance fund.  We want to ensure that the State plays a role in developing and creating jobs as well as ensuring that the economic environment is rich and ready to adapt to the needs of the private sector.  Furthermore, we are giving incentives to the private sector to do that. What more do the Fine Gael Party want us to do for the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a rural constituency which has many mountainous areas.  People are <Col N="1637" /> trying to survive on the land, but they are worried because of the review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the outcome of the GATT negotiations.  I was disappointed that the President of the IFA, for whom I have a great deal of respect, commended the fact that the right wing were going to win in the French elections, and that this would be the saviour of the Irish farmers.  He knows in his heart and soul that room for manoeuvre is limited and that the French right wing party cannot stop the changes that will take place.  We have to ensure that the changes touch lightly on the poverty in rural Ireland.  We must ensure that any liberalisation of the criteria for benefit under the disadvantaged areas scheme will be passed on and that the bureaucracy will not hinder it.  There are commitments from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that farmers' incomes will be protected and that the district veterinary offices will be more user friendly.  There should be incentives for small farmers to continue to develop their farms and to continue to produce food for the marketplace and not for intervention, and with a dynamic marketing agency to which the State has a commitment, Ireland's produce can be sold on the European market where it has a good reputation.  In spite of some of the things that happened in the beef industry and elsewhere, Ireland has a good image as a food producer.  We should ensure that farmers continue to produce products, which when processed increase in value, for export to the Community. The Taoiseach and others have called for dynamism in the agricultural community.  Farmers should not suddenly stop producing goods just because they receive an income supplement.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that half the world's population is hungry.  We can produce some of the best products available and our farmers would be happier if they were allowed to do so.  Basic incomes should be protected but there should not be disincentives to production. Otherwise there will be mass unemployment in the dairy and food processing industries.  The co-operative <Col N="1638" /> movement has shown in the past that it has been able to take on the challenges posed by membership of the Community &mdash; we must remember that the farming community were the strongest advocates of membership.  Inevitably changes had to be made and I have no doubt that rural areas will adjust to the further changes in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>We all hear complaints about the 1 per cent income levy, health charges and so on.  Of course charges must be imposed. If the Government could produce a machine to print money, it would be a wonderful resolution to the problem but if we are to live within the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty, to which the Government partners are committed, people must understand that they have a responsibility to make contributions.</P>
    <P>Much more can be said on the budget and more action can be taken by the Government.  This is the first of four or five budgets which will be introduced by it and we hope that the programmes initiated in the areas of housing, social welfare, health and so on are just a beginning. I am sure Fine Gael and particularly the Progressive Democrats will identify with what we are trying to do.  We are not asking them to abstain on these matters. They can troop through the voting lobbies but the public know there is a job to be done and that the people on that side of the House cannot do it.</P>

      <P>In regard to capital acquisitions tax, I welcome the increase from 55 to 75 per cent in the relief for eligible assets.  The increase in the exemption limit from £200,000 to £250,000 is also a welcome move.  Perhaps we can look forward to the day when the relief on agricultural holdings of eligible assets will be increased to 100 per cent.  I hope that will be done in the not too distant future.  Not only will the changes in capital acquisitions tax benefit the individuals involved, they will also benefit the whole agricultural community in the sense that they will encourage farmers to retire at an earlier age, thereby handing over the farms to younger men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has allocated £1 million <Col N="1639" /> this year to the introduction of a new retirement scheme, the terms of which have not yet been worked out.  When we became a member of the EC in the early seventies a retirement scheme was introduced for farmers but it turned out to be a complete and utter disaster.  I hope the powers that be will have learned from those mistakes and that the new scheme will be operated more effectively.  I had a particular interest in that scheme because I was involved in its operation. Fortunately, few people in my area took part in the scheme &mdash; anybody who did lived to regret it.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the new scheme is more beneficial to those who avail of it.  As was the case in the seventies, the farming community will be anxious to take part in the retirement scheme.  If the scheme is to be taken up in a meaningful way the £1 million allocated will not be sufficient. However, it is a beginning and I hope that if the scheme is successful the Minister will not let it fail through lack of funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has allocated an extra £1 million to Teagasc, the body which provides an advisory service to small farmers.  In 1992 a sum of £1 million was also allocated to this body and in the region of 7,000 farmers benefited, including farmers in my county.  In Roscomon &mdash; I am sure the position in other counties is similar &mdash; only farmers in the southern half of the county benefited from the scheme.  Those in the northern half did not benefit because there were not sufficient advisers to implement it.  Under this scheme farmers whose incomes are below a certain level are entitled to free advice.  Up to about five years ago advice was freely available to all farmers but some whiz-kids decided that the farming community should pay for it.</P>
    <P>In north Roscommon at present there are only three agricultural advisers, one of whom is involved full time in educational matters. There is no adviser with specific responsibility for the northern part of the county.  About 90 to 95 per cent of farmers in this area are eligible for the <Col N="1640" /> scheme but due to the insufficient number of advisers, they will not be able to avail of it.  I appeal to the Minister to allocate more money to Teagasc to employ more advisers to implement this very fine scheme.  There is no point in introducing a scheme if the manpower is not available to implement it.</P>
    <P>An agricultural environment scheme was introduced this year.  Too often we rely on farmers as the sole caretakers of the environment.  Farmers must accept some of the responsibility for pollution of wells and rivers.  These people depend on agricultural advisers for increased production, but once they increased production, unfortunately increase in pollution also followed.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Flanagan on Tuesday, 30 March 1993:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the hardship that will accrue as a result of the recent significant increase in health charges in respect of hospital accommodation and outpatients services and having regard to the likely consequent increase in Voluntary Health Insurance premia, hereby annuls the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, and the Health (Out-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, as such regulations represent an unwarranted and unacceptable attack on families, particularly those in the moderate income sector of the community.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in view of Government policy, not merely to maintain health services at their existing level, but also to ensure that the substantial developments <Col N="1641" /> provided for in this year's Budget, for example, to reduce waiting time for admission to hospital and to provide additional services and facilities for persons with mental and physical handicap, are implemented, Dáil Éireann approves the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993 and the Health (Out-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993 (S.I.

      <P>The Fine Gael motion to annual the regulations on revised charges for hospital services conveniently forgets one simple fact of life and that is the growing costs of health services in every country.  A motion on charges cannot be debated without some recognition by the Opposition of that reality which now faces all Governments of whatever persuasion. This year the health services here will consume an additional £183 million, increase over last year's figure. This £183 million represents no less than a 12 per cent rise over 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that background it surely cannot be expected of any Government that it can year after year make considerable levels of funding available to health services without looking at some degree of cost-sharing.  No Government can take that approach.  If it did, it would simply create serious problems for itself in managing its borrowing and spending requirements. We are continually having lectures from those right wing people across the floor about the need for discipline in the public finances but, when it comes to support for decisions which <Col N="1642" /> underpin discipline, the backing for such measures disappears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the context within which those decisions were taken. It was widely known that the Estimates for the public services this year would be difficult and would give no easy options. The demands on Government had never been greater and simply could not be met without unacceptable increases in taxation or borrowing.  The figure for the health services to finally emerge after detailed discussions at Government is £1.7 billion, an increase, of 12 per cent over last year.  However, in arriving at that figure, hard decisions had to be taken and were taken.  The Minister did not like to take those decisions but he has a statutory right to take decisions for the provision of health care.  The revised charges was one of those decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was a good decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to revise the charges effectively targeted about £7 million extra income for hospitals this year.  That is a considerable amount of money.  This must be compared with the increase of £183 million provided in the Health Votes.  Based on these figures additional funding by the Exchequer is greatly in excess of any income coming to hospitals from the charges and underlines this Government's determination to do what is necessary to provide a high quality service to the community.</P>
      <P>When the decisions were taken to revise the charges there was no underhand attempt to disguise this as was suggested in the House last night by Fine Gael.  A parliamentary question was tabled by Deputy Richard Bruton for 23 February and the Minister did not want to mislead the House so he gave the correct reply which was then considered to be sleight of hand by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority of the Government in deciding on the Estimate for health was to <Col N="1643" /> ensure that services are maintained this year at current levels and important developments are implemented.  To achieve that aim, it will be necessary for health agencies to achieve efficiencies in their programmes.  Where savings can be identified they must be implemented so that the maximum return is obtained from every pound spent.  There are already comprehensive value for money programmes in existence throughout the health services.  There is a detailed programme on the use of generic drugs by general practitioners.  Clonmel Chemicals in my constituency has launched a new programme as an incentive to doctors to prescribe generic drugs.  I am delighted that the Minister in his budget is giving an incentive to doctors to respond to the needs of the State in this area.</P>
    <P>Those programmes are continually seeking ways and means of getting better results whether it be on non-pay, hospitals procedures, purchasing and so on.  Nothing is being overlooked which might bring benefit to the services and free up resources for deployment to critical areas.  It is not the case that the revised charges are being introduced in an environment where potential efficiencies are being ignored or overlooked.  The reality is that the health agencies have responded to the challenge of seeking more value for money and will continue to do so this year and in the future.</P>
    <P>The revised charges are necessary, not only to maintain services but also to implement the important initiatives provided for in this year's budget.  They have not been introduced to deny access to services and this Government would not countenance any decision that would have such an effect.  Fine Gael has attacked the Government for doing nothing on waiting lists and neglecting other critical areas including services for the elderly and dental treatment.  I am very surprised that they believe what they say and have chosen to ignore the £20 million programme for reducing waiting times which will be implemented this year and which was provided for in this year's <Col N="1644" /> budget.  Already, guidelines have been sent to health boards.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have also mentioned other areas where resources are needed and I must point out that the Minister for Health has resolved to proceed with the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act on 1 May of this year and to provide £4 million for that purpose.  This was provided because people who hold medical cards are denied access to public health care either in geriatric hospitals or welfare homes.  These people are sitting in private nursing homes.  There is now a commitment to the tune of £4 million by the Minister in order to assist people to pay the additional charges over and above social welfare income.</P>
    <P>Dental services will also be provided with additional funds, for those with special needs such as children and the handicapped.  I attended a meeting for handicapped people in Limerick last weekend, I am involved with the handicap persons' association in my constituency and with all those who represent handicapped people.  We have identified a need for £25 million for services for the handicapped.  This year we have made the first instalment with a payment of £8 million for adult respite care accommodation for the handicapped. I prepared a Private Members Bill on this issue when we were in Opposition.  We have not forgotten the handicapped despite the fact that people in RTE will start programmes by saying &ldquo;so, Dick Spring has let you down&rdquo; in case people might forget to say it.  Of course they do not suggest that Fine Gael let people down in the past.  Did Fine Gael ever vote for the handicapped in relation to charges?  Did Fine Gael ever abstain?  Of course, they abstained when it came to the Tallaght strategy and other such programmes.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that there is a provision whereby the chief executive officers of health boards can waive charges if hardship is being created.  It is also a fact, and Fine Gael know it, that for £1 a month people can insure themselves against these charges. One can also claim against income tax or medical and dental charges.  If people are well off, like people in Fine Gael, to have VHI cover, that will cover the costs.  The Minister will not agree to any increase in VHI premiums unless such increase is justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be honest with ourselves. There is much flexibility in the system.  I have no doubt whatsoever that Fine Gael people on health boards will ensure that there will be flexibility in the implementation of these charges, which is a matter for the discretion of the health board and its executive officers.  Having been a member of a health board in the past, I am aware one can have negotiations in areas of difficulty.  In his contribution last night the Minister referred to the importance of VHI and said it provides inexpensive cover against hospital charges.  It cost about £1 a month for an adult and if family cover is required it can be even cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have alleged that the charges will have consequences for the VHI premia.  Such an assumption is wholly premature as the Minister has asked his Department and the VHI Board to consider what steps should be taken to prepare itself for the Single European Market in health insurance areas.  If the <Col N="1646" /> VHI is not able to compete in that area I am sure health insurance people in Europe would be prepared to give proper cover to people for an insurance premia rather than have the VHI continue to scream while they are making millions of pounds of profits.  When the Minister for Health talks about making the VHI pay for private health care, which ought to be available to people, then the VHI have the responsibility to fund that section.  I know many ordinary people in Ireland who cannot afford VHI cover and are glad to get a public health bed.  They are glad to know that for £1 per month they can cover themselves for any costs involved in the hospitals and any additional hospital cost can be reclaimed by means of a tax refund.  People on medical cards are exempt from the charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to deliver an essential service.  He has shown an understanding of the health brief, an understanding which he built up during his years as Opposition spokesperson on health.  This was despite the fact that the &ldquo;Tallaght strategy&rdquo; was in operation. That suited Deputy Dukes and the Minister and his colleagues at that time.  But the public never forgave them for it because at that time they failed to act as an Opposition.  Now they are opposing everything and I suppose we should commend them for that.  For the first time ever Fine Gael can afford to oppose in the knowledge that none of their votes can do anything to help the constituents who voted for them, unlike the Labour Party who managed to get into a position of influence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the regulations on revised hospital charges.  The reason for the introduction of the hospital charges was because people were abusing the system.  Rather than use the facilities of the general practitioner they used the hospital facility free of charge.  It was introduced to create the correct balance and to free up out-patients and emergency and accident departments.  I am concerned at the proposal on charges.  As a member of the Eastern Health Board it has been brought to my attention by the chief executive officer.  When presenting his budget he pointed out that the charge accruing in the Eastern Health Board area would be £446,000.  This was seen as an income source.  Initially, most people supported the introduction of the charge because of the abuse.  A person who would go to their general practitioner and pay whatever the charge may have been, £10 or £15, could have gone to the hospital free of charge, received the same attention and returned to the hospital for dressings and further attention free of charge.  Against that background the charge was introduced to prevent that blatant abuse.  Initially progress was made in reducing the long delays in accident and emergency and out-patient departments.  But the scenario has changed.  Previously, general practitioners encouraged visits; under the new capitation system general practitioners may be accused of not encouraging recurring visits from a patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to some of the Fine Gael statements in relation to the proposed new charges.  It is important to highlight the fact that there are a number of conditions and clauses that prevent hardship.  Can the Minister clarify whether the proposed charges are <Col N="1648" /> meant to prevent the long delays and the abuse of accident and emergency and out-patient services, or are they now seen as a source of income?  We all recognise that £6 is not too much to ask for every visit.  But if that £6 is to be increased at each annual budget, at what figure will the charge stop?  I appreciate those concerns. A number of people contacted me who were paying £10&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We in this House would be foolhardy if we did <Col N="1649" /> not give our support to the Minister for Health in recognising the urgent need to address the totally unacceptable waiting lists in some specialty areas, such as orthopaedic surgery, hip replacements operations, cataract and ear, nose and throat treatment and cardiac and plastic surgery.  The £20 million allocation by the Government should assist in the delivery of such services and thus reduce the waiting lists to an acceptable period of time. I would like the Minister to explain how he intends to utilise this £20 million in addressing those waiting lists, because throwing money at hospital services in this fashion will not meet the essence of what the Minister wants to do and I am sure he is aware of this.  What are his proposals in this regard?</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the additional allocation of £8 million for the mentally handicapped services, an area about which both the Minister and I are very concerned.  This £8 million will cover a broad spectrum of necessary services, including residential and extra day places, respite services, additional home support, improved sevices for the behaviourally disturbed and an extension of early intervention and child development services.</P>

      <P>Where did the Deputies get the evidence they referred to in relation to the hardship that is being inflicted because of the changes the Minister has introduced?  Approximately 40 per cent of the population have medical cards and many other groups, to which the Minister referred, will also be exempt from those charges.  Approximately 30 per cent of the population have some form of insurance policy which will exempt them from such charges.  There is a positive bias in favour of the patient in the charges the Minister proposes.  The outpatient's charge has been decreased from £10 to £6. He has put a cap of £60 per annum on the cost of outpatient services to a family and a maximum cost of £42 will apply to individuals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the real problems exist in <Col N="1651" /> regard to private beds.  We are all aware that there is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that a number of private and semi-private beds are available in our public hospitals.  Should we not improve our public hospital facilities to facilitate those who go to hospitals such as the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private? Should we not charge a reasonable sum of money to people who wish to avail of private and semi-private beds?  It is a disgrace that people should complain about the £120 per bed charge in public hospitals when one considers the £250 per day charged in private hospitals.  Such complaints should be directed at the private hospitals, which obviously are being subsidised in some form by the VHI.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a number of positive changes in the area of health. He has increased the budget by 12 per cent, which is no mean feat when one considers the inflation rate of 3 per cent. He has also done something very important for the people who have been on waiting lists for surgery for a number of years by allocating £20 million to those services.  In particular I welcome the special allocation to the services for the handicapped.  Those services require much more resources, but this is a start. I am sure that when this Government leaves office in four and a half years time people will say that the health services have never received such a great injection of capital.</P>

      <P>It is important to set in context these increases in health charges. When hospital charges were introduced in 1987 Deputy Howlin opposed them saying &ldquo;They are a crude and vicious instrument whose only effect will be to undermine the standard of health care&rdquo;. I have no doubt that his views then were genuine, but I am disappointed that he fails to follow through on those views and instead has lost his nerve.  The development of medical technology and the increasing complexity of health care have put strains on costs and necessitate a certain rationing of services.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1652" /> the health of the patient must always be central to the service and these increases negate that principle.  Providing for people's needs on an equitable basis does not necessarily mean costs going out of control and a comparative study of health costs between Great Britain and the United States shows this to be the case. In Great Britain health care is free and provided on the basis of need, yet less than 8 per cent of GDP is spent on health care, while in the United States, where the free market dominates health care, people are treated on the basis of their ability to pay and costs have soared out of control to the point that over 13 per cent of GDP is spent on health care.  That does not say much for the efficiencies of the market.</P>
      <P>The problem in our health services is not inefficiency but inequity and, in his first move as Minister for Health in increasing the burden of hospital charges, the Minister has simply made things worse.  Our general hospital services have many good features.  Their workforce is highly trained, dedicated and the quality of care for those who gain access to it is excellent.  However, access to those hospital services is extremely inequitable and reflects the class stratification of our society.</P>
      <P>There are medical cardholders for whom access is free, but who find it difficult to get many services.  There are those who are fortunate enough to have VHI cover and so obtain reasonable access to services for themselves and their families.  There are those in special VHI schemes which give them direct access to top class services in luxury hospitals such as the Blackrock Clinic, which is subsidised at the highest marginal rate of tax by the general taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there are the people who make up the group who are over the limit for a medical card and who are generally in work or dependent on people in work &mdash; PAYE taxpayers who are obliged to pay for their GP services and prescribed drugs.  These people will now be obliged to pay more in hospital charges.  They account for 30-35 per cent of the population. This is the group who, through <Col N="1653" /> PAYE, are subsidising those who can avail of care in luxury hospitals.  These are the workers and their families who the Minister is hitting by these increased charges.  Any attempt to disguise this fact by the Minister is pure blabber.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister insisting that these people should now pay for out-patient services, X-rays, laboratory tests, physiotherapy and other services?  Is it simply to raise finance?  If it is, I suggest that he should consider the tax relief given on VHI premia for luxury hospitals.  This is a separate matter, but there is a big question mark over the matter of subsidising super-luxury hospitals.  I do not believe that finance is the reason for these increases.  Rather, the agenda is to discourage the use of hospital services by this group, the one-third of our population who, in large measure through their taxes, finance those very services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite rightly not putting a financial obstacle in the way of medical card patients, the least well-off section of our community.  However, the VHI system which caters for approximately 30-35 per cent of our population is an incentive to over-use hospital services. This over-use of our hospitals is likely to increase with the liberalisation of medical insurance schemes under the Single Market.  There is a discriminatory set of charges or taxes on people with low or middle incomes who fall outside the guidelines for a medical card and who cannot afford the VHI.  With regard to Plan P, I have no doubt that people who take up the Minister's offer to pay into the VHI will quickly find those premia soaring.  I believe these increases are being introduced to encourage people to join the VHI.  As I said, they will find out very quickly that they are unable to pay their premia.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the underlying assumptions about our health services. One assumption is that the general hospital services are over-used and inefficient. Is this true?  A recent study carried out by the OECD which compared the health services in seven OECD countries in Western Europe found that while Ireland was somewhere in the middle <Col N="1654" /> range of the number of acute general hospital beds per 100,000 of population, it also had, on average, the shortest stay in hospital beds &mdash; it is seven days here in comparison to 12 days in Germany, a country which is often held up to us as a paragon of industrial and administrative efficiency.  Are people in Irish hospitals less ill than their German counterparts or could it be the Irish acute general hospitals are more efficient and effective in the use of their resources?  I suspect it is the latter.  I also suspect that the Government and Minister do not recognise just how efficient our system is.</P>
    <P>There is a chart in this week's edition of <i>The Economist</i> which compares the proportion of GDP spent on health in 24 OECD countries in 1961 and 1991.  There were only three countries where the amount declined &mdash; Turkey, Germany and Ireland.  In all other countries the percentage of GDP spent on health care had increased.  The decline in Turkey and Germany was marginal, but in Ireland it declined from 9.5 per cent to under 7 per cent during that period.  This is a massive decline in real terms.  The cutbacks of the last ten years have done their job. However, in doing so they have created massive inequities, one of which we are debating this evening; the other inequity is the appalling waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Our health services could be better and more equitable, and at the same time provide jobs for more of our highly trained young people.  Paradoxically, if the Minister wishes to make the hospital services more efficient and equitable he should start with community and GP services. The key to an even more efficient hospital service is the provision of access to GP services and investment in the other necessary community-based services which allow people where possible, to have their medical conditions investigated, managed and treated at home. There have been good developments in this direction in recent years, such as the spread of the daffodil nurse scheme for the terminally ill.  I should say I was rather shocked when my local daffodil nurse told me she is 100 per cent dependent on voluntary subscriptions from people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> There is also the pilot scheme of district care units for the elderly in some areas of the Eastern Health Board.  The scheme operated in my area is extremely effective. In addition the initiatives were also taken by the enlightened North-Western Health Board.  In order for this scheme to be developed further, there must be a national scheme of registration of people with GPs and free access for all to GP services.  If the Minister had introduced these hospital charges together with free access to GP services it would have made some financial sense.  If he had chosen to introduce a free GP service and let people pay for their drugs for the time being, it would have made some kind of sense and facilitated the rational development of the hospital service.  However, he has not done this.</P>
    <P>When the choice of doctor GMS scheme was set up during the early seventies to replace a very old, dilapidated and inequitable dispensary system the then Minister, Erskine Childers, in a very far-seeing and enlightened move insisted that the new contract for GPs would contain a clause which provided that a doctor could not distinguish between medical card patients and private patients in the provision of service.  By and large, that system has served us well.  It is now time for hospital consultants employed in public hospitals to be given a similar contract which will oblige them to treat all patients equally under the same conditions and from the same waiting list. They should not be able to distinguish or separate the treatment of private and public patients in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in this area is that much of the managements of public patients in hospitals is carried out by non-consultant hospital doctors and there is a certain distance between the patient and the consultant.  The recent report issued by the joint study group called for more consultant posts and a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctor posts.  This would help ensure that there was more hands-on management of patients by consultants in hospitals.  It would also provide a career structure for <Col N="1656" /> non-consultant hospital doctors.  The Minister has to tackle this issue.  It is a scandal that the taxpayer is paying for the expensive education of highly trained young doctors only to see them emigrate to well-off societies like the US which benefit from their skills.  In the meantime approximately 35 per cent of the non-consultant hospital doctors which provide a service in our hospitals come from non-EC countries.  A career structure must be set up for young doctors if our society is to benefit from the investment made by taxpayers in their education and training.</P>
    <P>The Minister should instruct Comhairle na nOspidéal to undertake to make as many hospital consultant posts as is practicable &mdash; obviously there are practical problems in this respect &mdash; job-sharing posts.  The NHS in England has already made a move in this direction. Job-sharing appears to lead to a better and more wide-ranging service.  Over half of our young medical graduates are women, and while job-sharing may not be exclusively used by women it would realise a return from the investment in their education and make it more cost-effective.</P>
    <P>To summarise, consultants must be given a new contract which will ensure that they treat all patients equally, there must be more consultant posts with a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in non-consultant hospital doctor posts and job-sharing should be introduced in order to lead to the more efficient use of expensive technology. Many people find it hard to understand why expensive technology in which we have invested is not used on a 24-hour basis.  If doctors worked eight hour shifts, as happens in manufacturing industry, there would be a much greater return on this horrendously expensive technology.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 60,000 people employed in the health services. More Irish people could be given jobs in the highly rewarding area of service while at the same time providing greater efficiency.  This could be done by way of investment in people rather than in institutions.  I accept, in saying that, that there are limits in spending in health, <Col N="1657" /> although people generally want to see money spent on health care and they see it as an important investment by the State.  I challenge the Minister's statement yesterday that 7 per cent of GDP is the ideal.  The Irish percentage is low among industrial countries and we do have special needs.  We have a higher dependent population at both ends of the spectrum where more health services are consumed, children and old people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we have a large dependent population and I know we will very soon have a fairly elderly population.  I am not speaking about today or tomorrow, I prefer to speak in a larger framework than some Deputies perhaps do.  I ask the Minister to take on board what I am saying.  I do not expect miracles overnight, but I expect solid, overall planning for the short term as well as the long term.</P>
      <P>The question of the investment and the percentage that should be spent on health care averages around 8 per cent and that would be a reasonable figure.  The average is the least we should be looking for.  There are inherent inequities in the system and, rather than tackling those inequities and inefficiencies the Minister is making them worse by increasing the hospital charges.  The fact that somehow the chief executive officer of the health board is there to listen to the case of someone who cannot afford health or hospital charges is not the point.  That is degrading and is adding a whole new layer onto the clientelism which, as somebody who is looking forward, I feel we should be actually reducing.  People have a right to expect certain services.  They should not have to plead, they should not have to beg for concessions via, inevitably, their local Deputy or Senator.  That is not the way people should view the hospital services.  They should view them as services that have been paid for by us as taxpayers for the community at large, and particularly for those who most need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> The last point I wish to make is in relation to the whole area of health care. There is not sufficient concentration on the efficacy of those vast amounts of money we are spending.  Who are those who are most sick in our society?  Why are they sick?  What areas are we looking at when we look at health spending?  Are we looking to see if we can reduce the impact of serious deprivation of unernploymnt, of children suffering from poor diet, of people suffering from the complex social conditions that lead to ill health, and serious ill health, in our community? We need to focus the resources we have and make it a fairer system.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the approach of the Minister so far.  It seems to amount to more of the same.  There will always be some pressure group demanding money and there will always be some Minister who will cave in and hand over some money.  It is welcome, but it means that we are not looking at our health services in total.  We are not focusing on or prioritising those people who most need health care services or making them efficient by ensuring that those who want to have coordinated furnishings in their hospital bedroom and to have menus and choices from three dishes, pay for it.  I have no problem with private hospitals &mdash; let people pay for private hospital care if that is what they want, but let not one penny of public money or tax subsidy go towards that particular luxury.  That is an inefficiency in the health care service and it needs to be taken out so that our scarce resources are spent on those who need care most.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Howlin was appointed Minister for Health I expected he would be a reforming Minister because he had such good and enlightened ideas when in Opposition.  To say that I am disappointed is an under-statement. The first act of the Deputy as a Minister was to impose further hospital charges on a public who are already overtaxed and who are now expected to pay more and more for reduced services.  The <Col N="1659" /> promises made prior to the election have been shamefully reneged on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have seen is the greatest U-turn, the greatest confidence trick on the Irish electorate since the 1977 Manifesto.  It is a shame that a Labour Party has imposed further burdens on an already oppressed public who have to pay more for less service.</P>
      <P>It seems to be par for the course now that when a Minister gets inside a mercedes the atmosphere of that car changes his perspective on the services he is supposed to administer.  Is it the insignia on the mercedes that changes his perspective?</P>
      <P>People are paying more and more for a reduced service.  Deputy Flanagan went through a list of people who were waiting for gynaecological services, surgery and so on.  The list is as long as my arm. Behind those statistics is a saga of human suffering.  One example is a man in Cork in his late seventies who has been told he will have to wait two years for an initial appointment with a consultant, and that person's general practitioner told me that that man was in danger of having his leg amputated because of neglect by the health services.  But for a special pleading by the doctor, and me, that man would not have been seen.  As the Democratic Left spokesman said, this continues the dependency on politicians for the delivery of services.  I know that Fianna Fáil are dab hands at it but I am amazed that the Minister would continue that dependency factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a two-tier system here and nothing the Minister has done so far has sought to change that.  The quality of service offered to people is in direct ratio to the size of their bank account.  If one is a medical card holder or is dependent on the public health services one must wait at least two years.  It may <Col N="1660" /> be up to four years before one can get an appointment at an orthopaedic out-patient clinic.  People of 70 and 80 years of age are being told they must wait two years before they will be seen at an out-patient clinic in my health board region. Many of those people will be dead before they get an appointment.  Maybe that is a way of reducing the waiting lists.  If that is the best the Minister can do, God help us in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>What will that do?  I put it to the Minister that in six months' time the services will still be in crisis.  What is needed is real reform and the Minister should have got involved in reform rather than in the imposition of charges and the cutting of services.</P>

      <P>We have a two-tier system and the Minister had better start working on that.  The patients' charter is worth very little unless the key elements are added &mdash; the right of immediate access to an out-patient clinic, the right of immediate access to treatment and immediate access to a bed when it is required.  To give another example, two weeks go in Cork a constituent of mine was choking to death from emphysema and his family was told that there was no bed available because the Cork Regional Hospital closed a ward during the week in which St. Patrick's Day fell.  People get sick irrespective of the occasion and public suffering is the direct result of the cost-cutting service of closing wards during holidy periods.</P>
      <P>I have a short time available to me this evening, but I should have said earlier that I shall be giving Deputy Cullen two minutes of my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been spoken tonight about private Bills and the need for public hospitals to generate revenue.  The concept of designating private beds is fine in theory, with the proviso that there is an increase in the overall number of beds in <Col N="1661" /> a hospital.  What has happened, however, is that the designation of private beds brought about a reduction in the number of beds available to public patients.  The Minister should not shake his head at that comment, it is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I could provide figures from the Southern Health Board area that demonstrate the truth of what I have said.</P>
      <P>It is expected that £4 million will be lost to the VHI this year and the projection for next year is a loss of £8 million. I ask the Minister to come to grips with the absolute scandal of overly high professional fees.  People go into hospital at a time of great stress, expecting to have adequate health insurance cover for the treatment received and then, when on the road to recovery, are inundated with bills from different consultants.  It seems that consultants' fees increase by the month, if not by the week.  Does the Minister consider that the time has come for the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise and Employment to get together to examine and control professionals' fees?  People are being taken for a ride, with professionals' fees escalating almost every week.  If that matter is not examined, the VHI will suffer more and more.  There has been a suggestion that the door should be opened to competition.  I am all in favour of competition, but it should be competition on a level playingfield.  It would be wrong to allow foreign companies to cream off the most lucrative parts of the market, leaving the most vulnerable parts to the VHI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that health boards will show compassion to their patients.  It is my experience that the health boards are not great in the compassion stakes.  Health boards throughout the country now employ solicitors and debt collection agencies, bodies that terrorise the people at a vulnerable time when they are recovering from an illness. Former patients receive letters demanding payment of hefty bills and when the <Col N="1662" /> bills are not paid the debt collection agencies go into action.  People are frightened by that practice.  I ask for a real sign of compassion for the patient.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister's first action after taking office was to impose charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made no attempt to bring about the reform so badly needed.  Until such time as the inefficiencies, the abuses and the overly bureaucratic nature of the service are tackled, it is possible that more and more money will be poured in without the service becoming more efficient.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris spoke very critically about my party for its stand on this matter.  Some of the greatest political somersaults witnessed in my 12 years in the House have occurred in the past two months.  Everything that was said by Labour Party spokesmen when in Opposition has been the subject of a U-turn. It seems that one's perspective changes once one gets into the back of a Mercedes, one's viewpoint is different and the promises and pledges given when in Opposition are not put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for giving me some time to speak on this motion.  Because my time is so limited I shall not waste valuable minutes by bringing to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the various comments he made when speaking as an Opposition Deputy in the past five, six or seven years. I have two or three points that I should like to raise, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously question the role of the health boards, something upon which the Minister has commented.  I do not believe that value is being obtained from the health service.  The administrative and other costs associated with the organisation and operation of the health boards are very unsatisfactory.  I ask the Minister to examine one way of beginning to reduce the role of the health boards, for it is impossible to remove them overnight. In the development of the regional <Col N="1663" /> hospitals and the major hospitals strategically placed throughout this country, a leaf should be taken from the book of the Department of Education, which oversaw the transition of regional colleges from the control of vocational education committees to the Department.  It is my belief that the regional hospitals should deal directly with the Department. Regional hospitals should be directly accountable for what they do, how they spend their money and develop their services.  That would be preferable to the practice by which regional hospitals are locked into the overall health board structure, which is outmoded and cumbersome.  Vast savings could be made not only in terms of cash but also in terms of efficiency, if the health boards were removed.  I am absolutely convinced that a better and more direct relationship with the Department would be one way of moving forward.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister considering legislation to allow the VHI to own, operate and run private hospitals?  This is a measure the VHI has sought for a long time. Hospitals owned and operated by the VHI would be run much more efficiently. The changes and cost controls implemented by the VHI in past years are evidence of that board's efficiency. The VHI should at least be allowed the opportunity to examine the possibility of running hospitals itself.  That ability is allowed to BUPA and other agencies in other parts of the world and the VHI should be allowed to do the same.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the health service provided by our hospitals is as bad as it apparently is.  For instance, in the new regional hospital in my area the wards are closed and nothing happens. In the new hospital, people are still in beds in the corridors during the weekends. In the past two weeks I had to take my child to that hospital and I realised the seriousness of what is happening.  Millions of pounds have been spent, yet the new facilities provided are locked up. Are we telling people that they can get sick only during the week, not in the weekends?  It is ridiculous to pretend that <Col N="1664" /> people do not need specific, serious and urgent medical care during the weekends. Surely there is something seriously wrong in the system when such vast sums of money are provided for capital expenditure but there is no provision of resources to utilise the capital assets.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to the three points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to correct some of the statements made on the other side of the House.  I must remind the House that the amendment to the motion tabled by the <Col N="1665" /> Minister for Health seeks approval by the Dáil of the regulations on revised hospital charges in order to allow services to be maintained at their existing level and improved in certain key areas.  It would be useful for the House to be reminded of the important developments that will be introduced this year in the overall health services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke at length last evening about waiting lists in the health services.  I share his concern that waiting lists be reduced.  I am delighted that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme in 1993 aimed at reducing waiting times in public hospitals, specifically in the areas of orthopaedic surgery, including hip replacements, ophthalmology &mdash; cataracts &mdash; ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery, vascular and plastic surgery. I am confident that the provision of these additional resources will help the Government to meet its objective of reducing waiting lists in excess of 12 months in all of these specialties and to set a maximum waiting period of six months for children awaiting treatment for ear, nose, throat or eye conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health is to be congratulated on securing this additional funding which will help to address one of the Government's main priorities in 1993.  The provision of this additional money represents a significant start in dealing with some of the problems facing our public hospital services.  The Minister is adopting a planned approach to ensure that these additional resources are used to reward those hospitals performing efficiently and not those inefficient ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind Deputy Flanagan of some of the other significant service developments being funded this year.  For example, special additional funding of £8 million has been provided to improve services for people with disabilities.  I am aware, as is Deputy Noonan of Limerick East, that we have particular problems in the mid-west.  Nevertheless, Deputy Flanagan might take note of some of the additional services which will be put in place for persons with a mental handicap <Col N="1666" /> and their families, within these resources. They are as follows: 70 extra residential places; 200 extra day places; an extension of respite services to support families; additional home support services for 800 to 900 families; improved services for those who are behaviourally disturbed; further transfers of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements within the mental handicap services and an extension of early intervention and child development services.  The House will agree that these additional services will constitute a major contribution to the development of the potential of each person with a mental handicap to live as full and independent a life as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also putting in place additional services this year for persons with a physical or sensory disability including the following: the opening of additional independent living/residential units and appropriate support services; the extension of support services to people with disabilities living at home; respite services for families and relatives caring for persons with disabilities; additional day care places and extra community-based therapists.  In addition, capital support has been provided for these initiatives and to lay the ground for further service development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advised the House that he intends to proceed with the implementation of the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, by I May next, on which he is to be commended. I should point out that £4 million have been made available for this purpose in 1993.  The Programme for a Partnership Government places much emphasis on the vulnerable in our society.  The dependent elderly are among the most vulnerable.  I am pleased their needs are being addressed and I welcome the Minister's commitment to implement the provisions of the nursing homes Act as a matter of priority.  I had a number of inquiries about it today.</P>
    <P>The matter of dental care has also been addressed.  I am pleased to note that the Government is providing a sum of £2 million in 1993 towards the implementation <Col N="1667" /> of the provisions contained in the Programme for Government.  I welcome particularly the Minister's proposal to extend eligibility to school children up to age 14 years with effect from 1 December 1993 and to extend such eligibility up to 16 years over the course of the programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan voiced his opposition to hospital charges, conveniently ignoring a number of facts.  I should point out that medical card holders and their dependants are exempt from payment of public hospital charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the relevant health boards have power to waive charges in cases where they consider that payment would result in undue hardship for the individual concerned.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in requesting the chief executive officers to be mindful of these hardship provisions, particularly in cases where a number of members of the same family may be subject to the charges within the same 12-month period.  I can assure the House that the Minister and his Department will be closely monitoring the implications of the charges to <Col N="1668" /> ensure that the hardship provisions are satisfactorily implemented.</P>
      <P>In view of the need to fund the new developments and maintain services, and given the safeguards against hardship to which I and others have referred, I ask the House to approve the regulations on the revised charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government commitment to maintain and improve our health services.  I welcome also the increased expenditure of 12 per cent which should reduce waiting lists somewhat while improving the services.</P>
      <P>I note that Deputy Flanagan referred yesterday to the dark days of Fianna Fáil, contending that the Minister had not moved from those dark days.  I might remind Deputy Flanagan that over £500 million were spent during those dark days.  If he contends they were dark days I might ask him how much money he wants any Government to expend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I criticised the manner in which it was spent, not the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many increases effected in services over the lifetime of two successive Governments, that is when the Fianna Fáil Party were in Government alone and in Coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  A huge amount of extra money was expended on our health services, effecting massive reductions in some waiting lists and a huge increase in the numbers of operations carried out.  For example, in Cappagh Hospital alone there was a 40 per cent increase in the number of hip replacement operations.</P>
      <P>I contend that politicians on all sides of the House are guilty on this issue.  We have tended to kick this issue around, taking advantage of people when sick. We spend 20 per cent of our overall budget on the health services and if we are not reaping the service we want, we should endeavour to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new Minister improved that service rather than just throwing money at it he and his Minister of State would go down in history as having been very <Col N="1669" /> successful.  Yesterday the Minister said he had worked extremely hard at the Cabinet table to obtain as much money as possible and, that while he and his colleagues had not received all they wanted, they were reasonably happy.  I have no doubt that former Ministers, such as Deputies O'Hanlon, O'Rourke and Dr. O'Connell would say the same. That is part and parcel of their task which will be realised by the new Minister as he progresses.</P>
    <P>These extra charges will yield approximately £7 million, a very small amount of money when one looks at the total budget of £1.7 billion.  We should endeavour to eliminate inefficiencies in the health services and I agree with the points made by Deputy Cullen.  I have grave doubts about the necessity for so many health boards, particularly when one thinks that the area in and around Birmingham, with approximately the same population as our nation as a whole, has one health board.</P>
    <P>Whenever cutbacks are effected they affect nursing staff and lead toward closures, they are never implemented anywhere else or, if so, we do not hear about them.  Ward closures tend to be an emotional issue.  By no stretch of the imagination are nurses paid well.  They do a fantastic job but are not well paid. There is insufficient recognition of their work and contribution.  All of us politicians are guilty in this respect.  It is time we ceased kicking this issue around like a political football and really endeavoured to improve the badly needed services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen spoke about the reduction in waiting lists.  In his speech the Minister mentioned in particular that he has set aside £20 million to reduce the waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery, hip replacements, ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.  In addition, this money will be used to improve services for the mentally handicapped.  An extra 700 residential places and an extra 200 day places will be provided; respite care services will be extended to support families; additional home support services <Col N="1670" /> will be provided for between 800 and 900; family services for those who are behaviourly disturbed will be improved; more persons with a mental handicap will be transferred from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements within the mental handicap service; early intervention and child development services will be extended and services for those with sensory or physical handicaps will be improved.  Furthermore, services for the elderly are to be improved through, as has already been mentioned, the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act, while a sum of £2 million is to be provided for the dental services.</P>
    <P>Each of these services has been raised by various politicians, including myself, who have argued that they need to be improved.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, has announced that we will have a new Film Board, and we all welcome this.  On the Order of Business this morning the question was asked: where is the money?  Not only is the Minister, Deputy Howlin, saying that services will be improved but that the money will be provided.  This should be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined in detail the categories who will be exempt from paying these charges and I welcome these exemptions.  In regard to the hardship provision, I agree with Deputy McManus that the Minister should make it clear who will be included. I have no doubt that people will knock on my door and on the door of every single Member of this House and the Seanad and of local councillors to argue that they should be included.  It is important <Col N="1671" /> therefore that it is spelled out clearly who will be included.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's statement that his Department intends to have discussions with the VHI on its future and on how it intends to respond to competition in the Single Market.  I hope its position will not be undermined by the influx of foreign companies which will offer the same services.  As a member of the VHI, I may complain about the fees charged, but these compare very favourably with the fees charged in many other countries, in particular the United States, where medical charges are enormous.  I do not like to see increases as I will have to pay them myself, but in many ways the VHI has provided a good service and I hope the Minister will ensure that it will continue to provide this service and that any increases will be kept to the minimum in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on this Fine Gael motion and compliment Deputy Flanagan for bringing it before the House.  The Minister chose to introduce these increased health charges on the day the budget was introduced in this House. I wonder if this date was chosen at random by the Department of Health, or was it a well thought out strategy to lessen the impact of the announcement of these increased charges to the general public. The reaction that has been generated by the public to these charges is not hidden and they are very aware of them when they visit outpatient Departments or become inpatients in our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is only a short time in his new Ministry and that is will take him some time to accomplish all of what he wishes to do.  However, in the short time <Col N="1672" /> he has been in the Department it is incredible that he should do a U-turn in relation to health charges.  I refer the House to the debate that took place during Private Members' Business on 28 April 1987 when the Minister, Deputy Howlin, then in Opposition, brought forward a motion to annul the health charges which were introduced by the then Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>

      <P>Taken all together, I would classify these charges as immoral and no amount of exemptions or exceptions will make them moral.  They are a crude and vicious instrument whose only effect will be to undermine the standard of health care.</P>

      <P>That was the statement the Minister made in 1987.  While I appreciate that six years have passed, it does not seem logical that charges which were immoral on that occasion should be increased by him and suddenly become moral.  Is it that the action the Minister then condemned as being immoral has changed, or is it that the position of the person deciding on the morality of the case has changed?</P>

      <P>&lsquo;I firmly believe that patients will want to get the treatment they need in the environment that is most appropriate for them and that the £6 charge at out-patients departments will not change patients&rsquo; attitudes one way or another.</P>
      <P>Let me again refer the Minister back to the debate that took place on 28 April 1987 because on that occasion he said:</P>
      <P>There will be even worse effects.  It is all too easy to envisage situations where necessary treatments will be foregone because of the fear of these charges, where children will simply not get the X-rays, where old people will try to nurse themselves at home rather than face the humiliation of going to a hospital with an empty purse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already met people who are in terror of the prospect of facing an illness and simply not having the means to cover the charge proposed by the Minister.  I know and every Member of this House knows that hospitals will not turn people away because they have no money with them.  I have total confidence in the ethics and standards of our medical profession, but I know <Col N="1674" /> that people have their pride even when they have little else and that there are many situations where they would simply be unwilling to expose themselves to the fear of humiliation which these charges would visit upon them.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister how he can reconcile the statements he made in 1987 with his present statements.  How is it that people who would have been afraid of charges then and who would have gone without treatment because of their pride are now suddenly going to be able to avail of the services without any fear of humiliation?</P>
      <P>Is the about turn which the Minister appears to have made not leading towards cynicism and the sceptical attitude with which the public view us as politicians?  Is it not pronouncements such as those the Minister made when in Opposition and his ability to do the opposite when in Government that is the cause of such disillusionment, especially among our young people?</P>

In Opposition Deputy Howlin was a man who knew his brief very well and gave the impression that he cared about the health service.  Because he was a negotiator in the partnership negotiations I felt he would have provided the finance to make improvements.</P>

      <P>His very first action of any significance in my area, the North-Western Health Board area, and in the rest of the country was to increase hospital outpatient charges from £10 to £42 and inpatient charges from £15 to £20 &mdash; this from the man we have been just told described the outpatient charge of £5 introduced by one of his predecessors as immoral and who then went on to call for the resignation of that Minister.  If Deputy Howlin, as he then was, said that a £5 hike was immoral and a resigning matter for the then Minister, I wonder how he would describe his own mini-budget if he were still in Opposition?

At their meeting last <Col N="1676" /> week the board members were told there would be cutbacks of almost £700,000 in pay and £500,000 in non-pay, in addition to extra charges imposed by the Minister amounting to £700,000.  How will that improve the health services in my area? How will that reduce the waiting lists where people have to wait two, three or four years for hip operations?  Would the Minister confirm to the House that it will mean, for example, the loss in job equivalent of 20 nurses in Sligo General Hospital alone?  This is what the Minister is doing in the health board area which by common consent has been extremely well administered and is the best in the country.</P>

I thought that being in office would not have changed a man so quickly, but unfortunately, I was disappointed.  All we have heard from him so far is a passing comment that he had asked the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health to ensure that the outpatient charges are phased out in the next budget if not earlier.  There was no question of him seeking an immediate withdrawal, no suggestion that the charges were immoral &mdash; as the Minister said on an earlier occasion &mdash; and of course no <Col N="1677" /> demand that the Minister should resign. The Deputy has no need now to wait until the next budget.  Thanks to my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, he will now be afforded the opportunity to have these charges scrapped by voting against them in about ten minutes' time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister last night one could only wonder if anyone at all will be adversely affected by these charges.  The Government line is that these charges are of little consequence and a matter of minor concern.  We hear tonight from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, that a mechanism has been set in place that will allow the chief executive officer of the health board become the final board of appeal.  We heard the Minister when in Opposition talk about the bureaucratic nature of the health services and the need to reduce the level of bureaucracy in the health services.  The Minister is now introducing a new layer of bureaucracy. On the one hand he is increasing the charges by ministerial regulation and on the other he is saying that while the charges are being imposed, the chief <Col N="1678" /> executive officer has the power to waive them.  Is that not bureaucracy?  If it is not I would like to know what it is.</P>
    <P>I wish to tell the Minister that those in society who will be burdened most with the increased charges are those families most heavily taxed over a wide range of schemes.  Families in modest and middle income brackets, mainly PAYE taxpayers, have been asked to foot the bill yet again.  The people who are paying PRSI at too high a rate, those who are paying income tax at too high a rate, those who must under Labour and Fianna Fáil pay an extra 1 per cent income levy, a tax on falling ill and now a tax on death since the most recent budget &mdash; those are the people charged yet again with the responsibility of meeting higher charges imposed by the Labour Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>This Government has specifically targeted workers in the modest income sector in a most callous and indiscriminate manner by hiking up the hospital charges that were so vehemently opposed by the Minister when in Opposition. The Minister not only has eaten all his words but has displayed last night a very high standard in the art of the somersault.  I regret that the Minister was unable to provide the House last night with details of the action programme on waiting lists with which even Fianna Fáil Deputies are now familiar.</P>
    <P>As well as the suffering endured by the tens of thousands of people awaiting treatment, the cost of waiting lists must not be ignored in the overall context of health funding.  A GP in my constituency recently carried out a survey on those on waiting lists.  According to that survey, it is fair to assume that a 70 year old person waiting four years for a hip replacement operation will consume drugs to the value of £2,500.  Assuming that a person on the waiting list will consume drugs to that value, that figure when multiplied by 7,000, which represents the number on waiting lists, reveals the hidden cost of leaving people on waiting lists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An undeniable effect of those charges, in spite of the Minister's comments, will be a significant increase in VHI costs forcing many families to opt out of health insurance cover.  Since medical card cover is no longer an option families face Russian roulette in regard to their health. The Minister has denied that the VHI is seeking an increase or that he will allow it increase its charges as reported in a Sunday newspaper.  I put it to the Minister that the increase in VHI insurance premiums will be at least 6 per cent and that increase will be a direct consequence of the charges he imposed on 23 February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your permission to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment.  It is alarming that the orthodontic service in South Tipperary is now almost at a standstill.  This position has pertained since September 1992 and no treatment can be provided due to the lack of essential X-ray equipment.  As a result, the waiting lists get longer and the length of time for which people have to wait for this service is extending into the distant future.  That this should be allowed to happen is disgraceful.  Even before this emergency arose there was much dissatisfaction with the service, and rightly so, but this feeling of dissatisfaction is now replaced with anger and frustration.  At present 230 people are waiting for orthodontic service in South Tipperary and a further 150 are awaiting assessment.  A total of 380 people are suffering as a result of the disgraceful delay in providing this X-ray facility.</P>
      <P>I must at this stage compliment all the staff of the dental department of the county clinic in Clonmel who are trying to cope with this problem with an amazing degree of pleasantness despite their unsatisfactory working conditions.  On a daily basis they have to deal with distraught parents who are annoyed with the lack of service and with young adults who are fed up waiting for the service, the lack of which in many cases causes embarrassment and distress.</P>
      <P>The entire national orthondoctic service is in a shambles.  Pressure on the State service will continue while private orthodontic treatment is so expensive.  It is essential that an improved service be provided because the majority of parents cannot afford to pay for private treatment.</P>
      <P>I must seriously question the delay &mdash; since September last &mdash; in the provision of this equipment in South Tipperary. Surely, so essential a resource should have been given priority.  I now understand that an order was placed for the X-ray unit in December, yet three months later there is still no X-ray unit in place. This is just not good enough and indeed it saved the Minister and his Department from much embarrassment and angry comment in that the general public were unaware of the reasons for the worsening delay for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> The Programme for a Partnership Government states:</P>
    <P>we will implement a series of major improvements in the dental service.</P>
    <P>I hope that commitment will be honoured but the service is in such an appalling state at the moment that I do not know if they can cope with the demand. The Government should not have allowed even the first two months in office to pass without taking immediate action.</P>
    <P>Problems arose in Clonmel in regard to the accommodation for the X-ray unit and who will operate it.  This caused further delay and but for the co-operation of the staff, the hope of this X-ray unit for South Tipperary could indeed have been extinguished.  I am asking the Minister to take immediate action to ensure that this equipment is placed in South Tipperary immediately and that sufficient staff will be provided to cope with the demand for orthodontic service and now to cope with the enormous backlog that has arisen.</P>
    <P>Daily, I am contacted by distraught and anxious parents who are totally disillusioned with the service and see no hope of their children ever being called for treatment.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to come to their aid, to allow the dental staff in South Tipperary to do their work and provide a proper service to which our children and teenagers are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for bringing my attention to this matter.  I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that the treatment of new orthodontic cases from the South Tipperary area has been deferred pending the installation in Clonmel clinic of new dental X-ray apparatus. There have been no cancellations of existing treatments for which X-ray procedures continue to be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the board intends to install in Clonmel clinic a specialised piece of dental X-ray equipment which is necessary for the provision of secondary care orthodontic treatment.  Its purpose is to provide standardised and identical <Col N="1686" /> X-rays over the period of treatment of orthodontic cases in order to detect and monitor changes in the patient's orthodontic condition.</P>
    <P>The apparatus has, in fact, already been purchased by the board but it has not yet been installed pending the finalisation of the arrangements arising from its location in the clinic.  This includes the structural alterations to the premises and the provision of radiation protection which is currently in train.</P>
    <P>The board hopes to have the equipment installed and operational within the next four weeks, at which stage the treatment of new orthodontic cases will recommence.</P>
    <P>I might mention that over the past few years additional moneys have been made available by my Department to the South Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of its orthodontic services. These additional moneys enabled the board to re-advertise the post of consultant orthodontist and the board was successful in filling the post.  The consultant took up duty in October 1992 and immediately undertook a review of the boards orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the consultant's review and proposals made to my Department by the South Eastern Health Board, my Department approved funding for the setting up of a number of surgeries for the consultant in Ardkeen Hospital.  In addition a capital grant of £100,000 has been approved for the orthodontic developments proposed by the board within the community care programme.</P>
    <P>A primary task of the new consultant is the organisation of orthodontic training for the board's dental staff.  This will enable the board to make further improvements in service levels.</P>
    <P>I might mention that despite the temporary cessation in new cases being taken on for orthodontic treatment from the South Tipperary area the board is currently providing such treatment for 264 children from the area.  This compares very favourably with the throughput of cases in previous years when fewer than 100 persons commenced treatment and the waiting list was over 1,000.  The current <Col N="1687" /> waiting list is 224 and the availability of the new X-ray apparatus, together with the service improvements I indicated, will enable the health board to provide a much enhanced orthodontic service for the areas in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising this issue which concerns a slightly retarded 15 year old boy in Cork.  When I raised the matter on a previous occasion the boy was 13 years old.  The boy has not been to school in the meantime.  Because of his poor attendance record at school, his parents were brought before the Cork District Court.  They were convicted and the boy was ordered to be taken to the Bridewell in Cork and subsequently to Saint Michael's in Dublin for assessment.  Following which the boy was returned to Cork.  That was an alarming outcome but I understand that safeguards were put in place to ensure that a case of that kind would not be dealt with in that way again.</P>
      <P>The boy still does not have a school to go to.  A number of public bodies have a statutory obligation to this young lad. The Minister's Department has a major responsibility but has failed to find a place for him.  The Southern Health Board also has a role but except for an occasional visit from a sympathetic social worker no action has been taken by it.  It suggested that the boy be sent to a residential home in Cork but that was rejected by the parents as being totally unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was raised by me, in a newspaper recently, without mentioning the name of the boy, the local school attendance officer took umbrage and said it was his statutory obligation, and his alone, to deal with the case.  If that is so, why did he not deal with it in the past two years?  The voluntary organisations were asked to help, but they, being starved of funding for some years now, are ill-equipped to deal with such problems. It is shameful that we can speak so highly <Col N="1688" /> of the rights of children and yet leave a 15 year old boy languishing at home for such a long time, abandoned by the State and by a system that is seen to be ineffective. I would ask the Minister to come to the help of this young person.  I know there is a broader issue involved but something must be done to deal with this case.  The Minister should give some sign of hope to the family in her reply.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy had to return to the House two years later to raise this matter again.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case in question and the difficulties which have been encountered to date in securing a suitable educational placement which will meet the boy's needs.  The essential problem is that, according to psychiatric and psychological reports, the boy in question is severely emotionally disturbed and has been so since birth.  This is borne out by the pattern of his attendance and behaviour in an educational context.</P>
      <P>Since he started pre-school at three years of age he has displayed disturbed and disruptive behaviour and his teachers found him very difficult to control.  At four years of age, he was enrolled in the Christian Brothers National School in Blarney Street, Cork.  However, his behaviour again created management difficulties for the school authorities and in 1984, he was referred for assessment to the then existing Southern Health Board's Unit for emotionally disturbed children in Sarsfield's Court Hospital where he was seen by the unit's psychologist at two-monthly intervals for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of his inability to cope with the primary school curriculum and because of difficult behaviour, non-compliance and refusal to attend school, he was referred for assessment in 1988 to Cope Foundation and in 1990 to the Brothers of Charity Child and Family Clinic. These assessments indicated that his intellectual functioning was in the range between mild mental handicap and dull normal intelligence.  After discussion <Col N="1689" /> between the Brothers' of Charity Services, the Cope Foundation and the Christian Brothers, he was referred for placement to St. Mary's Special School, Rochestown, Cork, a school for children with mild mental handicap.  He attended St. Mary's from November 1990 to July 1991.  However, during that school year, his attendance was very irregular and the school reported that he was disruptive and aggressive in class.  He refused to return to school after the summer holidays. Subsequently, he was referred to the Cope Foundation for possible placement in Scoil Bernadette a special school for mildly mentally handicapped children run by Cope Foundation.  However, following various assessments and a case conference it was decided that placement in that school would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>In March 1992 the boy was referred to St. Michael's Assessment Unit, Finglas Children's Centre, for a three-week assessment period.  The various psychological and psychiatric reports concluded that he should return home and be placed in a special schools and that he and his parents be provided with counselling.  It was further recommended that if this approach did not succeed, he should be placed in a residential school where both his educational needs and his psychiatric problems could be addressed.  Such placement would be the responsibility of the health authorities.</P>
    <P>The fact that the boy is now at home and not attending school is a cause for serious concern.  I can appreciate that his very challenging behaviour has placed heavy demands on the educational and health authorities, as well as on his parents. Nevertheless, I share the Deputy's concern that satisfactory provision be made as a matter of urgency.  To this end, I have arranged for my Department to enter into urgent discussions with school and health authorities with a view to securing an appropriate educational placement for him as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will inform the Deputy of the outcome of this investigation as soon as possible. I thank Deputy Allen for drawing this matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>The difficulties being experienced by parents in the Kilcoole-Newtownmountkennedy-Delgany areas of County Wicklow arise out of a serious lack of forward planning by the Department of Education.  In 1985, following the major campaign by local parents, the then Minister agreed to provide a second level school in Kilcoole.  Wicklow County Council at that time required a 50-acre site as a suitable location for the school which was to be developed by the County Wicklow vocational education committee. Following the change in Government, the decision to locate a school in Kilcoole was overturned and the problems now relate to children who are unable to get places in their local schools.</P>
      <P>The expansion in the population of north Wicklow has been very rapid and is likely to continue in the future with the opening up of the Bray by-pass and in particular with the development of a multi-million pound sewage plant in Greystones.  The matter of school placement came to a head this year when St. David's school in Greystones &mdash; a very good school &mdash; was unable to meet the need and the demands on it coming from parents in the catchment area.  Up until a few months before Christmas, St. David's, because of the greatly increased numbers that had built up in the locality, were unable to take in many of the children who had applied to them for second level education.  The principal of this school and principals in other schools in the area are in the invidious position of having to turn away children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logical solution to this problem is the provision of a new second level school in Kilcoole.  The land is available and the <Col N="1691" /> commitment is there from the County Wicklow vocational education committee &mdash; and, indeed, from the Department of Education in the past.  If anything, the need is now greater than it was before.  The children who would expect to be able to go to school in their own area now have to go to Wicklow town which is a considerable distance away.  In future years there may be a restriction on places there because of demand in Wicklow town.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is compounded by the fact that there is no school transport available for these children.  The school bus which travels from Newcastle would not be able to accommodate the extra children and it does not stop in Kilcoole where most of the children live.  The anomaly is that children going to the Protestant second level school in Wicklow town can avail of a school bus which travels through Kilcoole and takes some of the children from the locality.</P>
    <P>The lack of a resolution to these difficulties is causing much concern and many parents are anxious about the future of their children's education.  The difficulty in getting bus facilities for them is critical and the Minister for Education has a responsibility to sort out this problem. We are coming into the summer term and there is still this terrible anxiety hanging over the parents of Kilcoole and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>In the longer term I urge the Minister to provide the school that was promised and was so cruelly cancelled with the change of Government.  It would be a good investment and one which would recognise the rapid development and future expansion of the area.  In the short term the critical problem of school transport must be resolved.  It is bad enough for children to be taken out of their local communities and have to travel long distances without an additional financial burden being placed on parents.  Nowadays we are all conscious of the dangers of busing children long distances.  It is certainly not the ideal solution but as a short term measure it is the one which must be provided urgently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> I would ask the Minister to put in place an extra bus service which will meet the needs of the parents of Kilcoole and which stops in the village of Kilcoole. Also, can she give a commitment here and now that a new school will be provided for Kilcoole and the surrounding areas of Newtownmountkennedy and Delgany so that we can meet the needs of the most rapidly growing population area in the country.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity of outlining the present position with regard to second level education places in the Kilcoole-north Wicklow area.  This area is in the Bray-Greystones catchment area of County Wicklow.  At present pupils in the Kilcoole-north Wicklow area get their education in Greystones, Bray and Wicklow town.</P>
      <P>Excluding St. Gerard's Thornhill, which is fee paying, and the recently established all-Irish post-primary school, Coláiste Raithin, there are five second level schools, three secondary, one vocational school and one community school, in Bray.</P>
      <P>The current enrolment in these schools is 3,367 pupils.  Overall accommodation is tight in the Bray schools, with the exception of St. Thomas's vocational school and Ballywaltrim community school where places are available.</P>
      <P>St. David's secondary school is the only second level school in Greystones.  It is co-educational and has an enrolment of 730 pupils this year.  Traditionally this school caters for approximately one-third of the output of pupils from the Kilcoole Newtownmountkennedy primary schools.  The management authorities of St. David's have recently indicated to the Department that they will be unable to accommodate all the pupils seeking places there next September.  Unfortunately, because of the restricted nature of the St. David's school site the option of the provision of extra accommodation to meet the demand for places there cannot be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the growing accommodation <Col N="1693" /> problem in the area, the Department is examining as a matter of urgency the question of what arrangements can be made to meet the immediate and short term post-primary needs of the Kilcoole-north Wicklow area.  The possibility of providing transport for pupils in the areas in question to adjacent post-primary centres, for example, Wicklow town, where pupil places are available would be considered by the school transport section in conjunction with the transport liaison officer for County Wicklow.  Indeed, in a reply to a recent Dáil question, the Deputy was asked to provide particulars of the children who wish to attend post-primary schools in other catchment areas in order that their needs may be investigated. The particulars of the children in question are still awaited.  Applications for catchment boundary transport to Wicklow for the 1993-94 school year will, on receipt of the appropriate application form, be considered by the County Wicklow transport liaison officer, after all fully eligible children have been accommodated.</P>
    <P>The longer term needs of the Kilcoole-north Wicklow area are also being examined in the Department in the context of the increased demand for post-primary places in the area and in the light of an application by County Wicklow Vocational Education Committee for a new second level school in Kilcoole.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the Deputy I am to meet, at the invitation of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Jacob, the chairman of the vocational education committee and my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh with the vocational education committee to discuss that issue.  I note that some of the facts I gave in my reply raised some eyebrows from the Deputy.  I wish to assure her that we can continue this conversation after my time has expired.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. There are 25 fishing vessels operating out of the port of Kinsale and 65 fishermen employed.  I request the Minister for the Marine to give favourable consideration to the application by Kinsale Harbour Board for the development of the port to facilitate fishing and cargo vessels that operate out of the harbour.  The Minister should give urgent attention to the board's request.  It is of paramount importance that this matter gets favourable consideration from him in view of its importance to the livelihood of the people involved.  This is not a major request and only involves the development of Adam's Quay in Kinsale by extending it 40 metres as a landing berth for boats to take on diesel and ice and facilitate the landing of fish catches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of this quay is vital to the 25 fishing vessels and 65 personnel operating out of the port as the main pier in Kinsale is too small to accommodate both fishing and cargo boats.  The estimated cost of the proposed development is approximately £400,000 and the harbour board is willing to meet its portion of the cost of the work provided the <Col N="1695" /> Department agree to pay its part of the cost.</P>
    <P>It is important that the onshore facilities are improved rapidly to enable the fishing industry, which is vital to the future livelihood of the town of Kinsale and its hinterland, to expand.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State, as a Cork man, to accede to my request on this important issue and thereby play his part in retaining this valuable industry in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently implementing the final year of its fishery harbour development programme for the period 1989 to 1993.  No provision was made under this programme for development works at Kinsale Harbour and in view of this, it will not be possible to carry out any works at the harbour during 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently drawing up a new fishery harbour development plan covering the period 1994 to 1997.  To this end the various maritime local authorities and harbour authorities, including Kinsale Harbour Commissioners, were invited to make formal proposals for development works in the fisheries interests and for which they would be prepared to make funds available.  Kinsale Harbour Commissioners submitted their proposal in July 1992.  The commissioners proposed two possible development options for the harbour.  These were (a) to extend the existing quay or (b) to construct a new quay.  Both options were estimated to cost approximately £800,000.  The commissioners also indicated their wish to provide an ice plant on the fish landing quay, the construction of an auction hall <Col N="1696" /> and the provision of washing and showering facilities.</P>
    <P>The commissioners wrote to the Department of the Marine on 16 March outlining proposals to construct a new fishery quay at Adam's Quay, Kinsale, at an estimated cost of £400,000.  The commissioners have also indicated a willingness to make a contribution to the costs of the work.  The Department of the Marine and I are conscious of the limited facilities at this harbour and the conflict between commercial and fishing activities. The Department is examining the proposal with a view to its possible inclusion in the new development plan. However, pending finalisation of the plan and clarification of its funding, I am not in a position, at this stage, to say if it will be possible to undertake the work in question.  The Deputy can be assured that I will be sympathetic towards the needs of Kinsale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter.  Coastal erosion is one of the most serious environmental problems affecting our coastal regions in the past number of years.  The problem is particularly pernicious along the western seaboard.  In Donegal alone there are in excess of 70 areas seriously affected, stretching from Rossnowlagh in the south of the county along Murvagh, Portnoo, Arranmore Island, Gweedore, Magheraroarty and to Dunfanaghy in the north, to mention but a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thousands of acres of agricultural land are regularly flooded in Rossnowlagh due to serious breaches in protective banks erected many years ago.  Portnoo is particularly hard hit with a golf course, a road and a caravan park being seriously undermined and endangered.  There is great concern on Arranmore Island at the serious extent of erosion there with fields, farms and houses being regularly <Col N="1697" /> flooded.  Gweedore, Magheraroarty and Dunfanaghy have been similarly affected.</P>
    <P>With successive winter storms the situation is becoming more serious and more dangerous for people living adjacent to these coastal crisis points.  There has been complete neglect by successive Governments in providing coastal protective measures.  One could justly say that the only serious attempt to curtail the stormy ravages of the western Atlantic was almost a century ago by the congested district boards.</P>
    <P>In recent years funding has been completely inadequate.  Representations were often passed from one Department to another, from the local authority to the Department of the Environment, to the Office of Public Works, to the Department of the Gaeltacht or the Department of the Marine &mdash; passing the buck from one to the other.  Will the Minister give coastal protection the utmost priority particularly in the areas of Donegal I specified?  An immediate survey should be commissioned to identify the worst areas and a priority list established without delay.</P>
    <P>I realise that national resources are limited, but funding for the prevention and arrest of further damage to our coastal environment and communities should be sought as part of our submission to Europe for regional and cohesion funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has limited funds at its disposal for coast protection schemes.  The Department's coast protection allocation for 1993 is £200,000.  The bulk of this will be spent on the ongoing development at Rosslare, County Wexford, and on a grant to Wicklow County Council for works completed last year at the Murrough in Wicklow town.  I should add however that the Department spent £20,000 in 1992 on the maintenance of the coast protection scheme at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to formulate a programme of coast protection works for the next few years, the Department of the Marine wrote to all maritime local authorities in <Col N="1698" /> 1991 requesting them to submit a list of priorities for coast protection projects which they consider would be warranted and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.  Donegal County Council made a comprehensive submission on the coast protection needs of the county.  Included in the 30 sites identified by the authority as needing attention are Rossnowlagh, Portnoo, Arranmore and Maghery.</P>
    <P>Drawing, <i>inter alia,</i> on the submissions received from the various coastal authorities, plans for a comprehensive coast protection programme have been drawn up in the context of the allocation of the next round of Structural Funds. Decisions have yet to be made by the Government on the priority and funding to be attached to this programme.  I have given coastal protection priority in my submission for structural funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As a native of Foynes, and a member of Foynes Harbour Board &mdash; my late father worked with that harbour board &mdash; I have more than a passing interest in getting additional funding for the harbour.  Foynes Harbour is a prestige port along the west coast and up to 31 March last it took in 1,250,000 tonnes of cargo.  Taking into account that volume of business, and what has happened in Foynes over the years, this is a tremendous success story which has been achieved without substantial funding from the Department of the Marine.  That port has always tried to invest and reinvest its own savings.</P>
      <P>The port is restricted at present because it can cope with only 36,000 tonne ships and in the work horse of the Atlantic there are Panama registered ships weighing up to 70,000 tonnes.  We have made a comprehensive submission to the Department of the Marine for cohesion funding.</P>
      <P>I compliment the officials on the tremendous work they put into the preparation of that submission, which has been costed, qualified and assessed.  The linchpin of the plan is an increase in capacity to cater for these 70,000 ton ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> There has been much rhetoric in past years about expansion of facilities in the Shannon estuary.  Foynes should be the linchpin for such developments, which should be assisted by the allocation of Cohesion Funding.  We have submitted a comprehensive submission but funding is vital.  The development of Foynes harbour will lead to the development of further industries in the area and make Foynes a greater success than it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Marine invited submissions from commercial harbour authorities and private companies for projects to be considered for funding under the Cohesion Fund and a further round of European Regional Development Fund funding. Foynes Harbour Trustees have presented a £19.6 million development plan for consideration.</P>
      <P>The development plan consists of the construction of a new deepwater west berth some 230 metres long which will be able to accommodate ships of up to 70,000 tons deadweight, capital dredging of the channels entering the harbour and the central harbour area to allow passage of these very large ships and the development of a road system and warehousing facility in the port area.</P>
      <P>My Department is evaluating all submissions received in order to develop an integrated and strategic programme of investment in harbour facilities.  This programme will be assisted by the EC Cohesion and Structural Funds and will enable our key commercial ports to cater for increasing demand and new designs of ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government has indicated that port investment will be concentrated in key commercial freight and passenger ports, including the Shannon Estuary.  A project team is currently examining all proposals for the development of the Shannon Estuary as a major European economic trading bridgehead, and the proposals put forward by the <Col N="1700" /> Foynes Harbour Trustees are being examined.</P>
    <P>All submissions received in the Department of the Marine are being evaluated on an equal basis to ensure that the country has the portal infrastructure and handling equipment necessary to cater for our needs into the next century. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department has received a very large number of proposals for the development of both national and regional ports.  On the basis of these demands, a comprehensive port development programme has been submitted by my Department for consideration in the context of the preparation of the national plan for the utilisation of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Pending the settling of the ports allocation in the national plan, I am not in a position to indicate the extent to which it will be possible to include the Foynes proposals.  I pay tribute to the Foynes Harbour Trustees for their magnificent achievements over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>I rise to bring to the Minister's attention once again the disadvantaged areas saga.  I can say with some certainty that if &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo; was the name of a record it would be at number one in the pop charts &mdash; it has been raised in this House more often than any other topic in recent times.</P>
      <P>The concern expressed by Deputies about this matter arises as a direct result of what we have been told by our rural constituents on an almost daily basis.  The saga of the long-sought extension of the scheme, followed by the possibility of a review and an appeals process has been with us for some considerable time.  The farmers concerned, their families and the local communities are most perturbed that there has been no positive news to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister give me an indication as to when the appeals panels will finally present their reports to his Department <Col N="1701" /> and when action will be taken?  Can he give an assurance that those farmers who, as a result of the appeals process, will be declared to be eligible for disadvantaged status will receive funding from Europe in 1993?</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the crisis in agriculture, the need to keep people on the land and retain the maximum number of people possible in rural areas. The disadvantaged areas scheme will play an integral part in this process, but action must be taken and a decision made now.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for raising this matter.  Unfortunately I have to tell him at the outset that this long playing record will be in the charts for some time.</P>
      <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel is currently analysing data from the survey of areas which appealed their non-inclusion in the disadvantaged areas. Because of the size and complexity of the task it is not possible to predict when it will be completed and, while it is in everyone's interest to have the job done quickly, it is equally important that the panel should carry out a thorough analysis as a prerequisite to having acceptable recommendations for submission to the Commission in Brussels for ratification. I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that there will be no delay in finalising the issue here and, once the submission is ratified, there will be no delay in making payments available to successful applicants.  I am as concerned as everyone else to ensure that rural areas benefit to the maximum possible extent, both in terms of extension and reclassification, from the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise with the Minister a very serious matter which has been raised in <Col N="1702" /> the House on many previous occasions, that is, the non-payment of the various cattle and sheep grants to farmers.  It is with a certain degree of frustration that I raise the matter this evening.  I have to say &mdash; I do not know if it is the fault of the Minister, his heart is in the right place &mdash; that someone along the line is not performing his duties properly.  I cannot understand why the officials in the Department have stated publicly that farmers receive approximately 50 per cent of their gross income via the postman. Several farmers who have made representations to me and many more in other areas have been waiting for their cheques for four months.  Do the officials in Agriculture House have any idea of the anxiety and frustration this delay is causing to farmers?  I am sure the Minister will agree that if he, I, a journalist or doctor had to wait four months for our salaries there would rightly be an outcry. Why is it in the age of technology that those cheques cannot be issued in the same way as social welfare cheques are issued every week?  What is the reason for the delay?</P>
      <P>One farmer in south Galway who has a 45-acre farm received no payment for his cattle in 1992.  He is owed £1,500, which is a sizeable sum of money.  He has been waiting for this cheque every day since the middle of last December.  To make the matter worse, he has been unable to buy fertiliser or pay for his cattle feed.  He has reached his borrowing limit in the bank.  His entire farming system has been put out of kilter because the Department has not paid him EC money it received before last Christmas. This is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in statements about the improved payments position on the preceding year.  I assume this is what the Minister will tell me.  Such a reply is no good to a farmer who has not received his money.  It is a civil right that people should receive their money on time. These farmers are entitled to up-to-date information on their files.  Once files leave the local district office it is almost impossible for applicants to get information on them &mdash; a sort of KGB attitude is adopted.  Can the Minister do anything <Col N="1703" /> to help those farmers who have not, as yet, received their cheques?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for bringing this matter to my attention and to the attention of the House generally.</P>
      <P>At present 99 per cent of applicants due payments under the 1992 cattle headage, beef cow, sheep headage, goat headage and equines headage schemes have received their payments.  Over 99 per cent of applicants due payments under the 1992 ewe premium scheme have been paid and approximately 97 per cent of suckler cow premium scheme applicants have been paid.</P>
      <P>The percentage of June/July 1992 applicants under the special beef premium scheme who have not yet been paid is approximately 8 per cent.  The vast majority of the unpaid cases are the subject of queries.  It is generally accepted that there was a substantial improvement in 1992 in dealing with claims under the livestock aid schemes.  For example, payments in respect of applications submitted in 1992 had issued to 284,000 applicants by the end of 1992 compared with a corresponding figure of 217,000 applicants in 1991.  In addition, my Department paid out £340 million in premium and headage grants in 1992 compared with £280 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>My Department has already put into place an warning system which identifies errors on special beef premium applications and this system does speed up the clearance of these errors.  There are some errors, however, which cannot be detected by the early screening system because the errors do not become apparent until field inspections are carried out or cross-checks are done with other applications and other information available within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the vast increase in the number of applications that my Department will have to handle in 1993 for the headage and premium schemes following the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy it will be essential that farmers pay greater attention to detail in completing their applications.  To assist them in doing <Col N="1704" /> this I arranged a series of meetings throughout the country earlier this year to explain the requirements arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the introduction of the EC integrated control system.  I was very pleased with the very large numbers of farmers who turned up to those meetings and I hope that will improve the situation for the coming year.</P>
    <P>At my request, Teagasc has put in place a package of measure to assist farmers in dealing with the complexity of the new Common Agricultural Policy arrangements, while also advising them how to secure optimum income under the various schemes.  The extra £1 million which has been provided in the budget to enable Teagasc to extend its small farm development service should contribute significantly to this effort.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the procedures for claiming the premium and headage grants are largely dictated by EC regulations and audit requirements which are designed to ensure that grants are not improperly paid.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, my Department simplified the application procedures in 1992 following consultation with the farm organisations.  We intend to keep the procedures as simple as possible in the future, while at the same time meeting the control requirements of EC regulations and auditors.</P>
      <P>I believe that significant advances have been made in dealing with 1992 applications. Every effort will be made to build on these improvements in 1993.</P>
      <P>In regard to the farmer in the Deputy's south Galway area, I would very much like to have the details because I do not want to preside over a scheme that causes hardship.  When 100 per cent of the funding comes from Brussels it would be quite wrong if we could not implement a scheme that would allow payments due to farmers to be made in full and on time.

      <P>Both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have been the cornerstones of economic and social progress over the past six years.  They have produced steady growth, a competitive economy and a good climate for business, while protecting those receiving social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>In respect of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the programme remains on course in respect of the main objectives agreed with the social partners. The Minister for Finance is in ongoing discussions with the ICTU in relation to certain public service pay issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The currency crisis, devaluation and the unfavourable external economic environment have meant continuing difficult times and it is essential that the considerable progress which has been achieved is not lost.  It is a key objective of my Department and of the Government that the partnership approach should be built-upon and that a further programme should be negotiated to succeed the <i>Programme <Col N="1494" /> for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Negotiations on a further agreement will not be easy, but I believe that given goodwill and commitment on all sides it can be achieved.  This will be an important element in the creation of the right environment for sustaining and creating viable employment &mdash; the number one national priority.  The difficult external environment means that more than ever it is up to ourselves here at home to solve our problems and I believe we have that capacity.  For the sake of 300,000 people, employment sectoral interests must be sacrificed for the overall good.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The £50 million made available by the previous Government on 6 October 1992 was acknowledged by industry to be an effective and an imaginative response to help firms adapt over a period to the massive and rapid devaluations of currencies which had been part of the ERM until September, 1992.  To date it has been possible to assist some 650 firms with almost 30,000 employees under the Market Development Fund.  That assistance has enabled all but three of those companies to continue in business and to take steps to adapt to the changed conditions of competition as a result of the instability of currencies in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance from the Market Development <Col N="1495" /> Fund will continue to be available to firms until the end of March, so long as the pound sterling remains above parity the job survey undertaken by the IDA and</P>
    <P>In addition to the Market Development Fund, the State development agencies have, as part of their normal remit, a function in assisting the adaptation of firms to changing market circumstances arising from currency or other factors and adequate resources have been made available in 1992 and 1993 to enable them to do that.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures which have been taken will greatly assist firms under pressure because of the currency crisis.  It must also be remembered that the currency crisis of recent months was only one factor affecting the performance of manufacturing industry.  There has been a sharp downturn in the international economy in recent years which has affected Irish firms and it is not possible to separate the impact of the different factors on performance including employment.  The preliminary results of the job survey undertaken by IDA and SFADCo in November last, however, indicate that employment numbers in 1992 held up well in a difficult year with a net loss of less than 500 jobs over the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that every effort will be made to ensure that firms can make adaptations so as to return to the high level of competitiveness that had been achieved prior to September last, without job losses, where that is at all possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The system provided by the 1991 Competition Act is one of prohibition of anti-competitive practices and agreements, with the possibility of obtaining exemption by way of a certificate or licence from the Competition Authority, and, the prohibition of an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
      <P>A remedy for anti-competitive practices is available to all aggrieved parties, whether large or small, through action in the courts.  Remedy can be by way of declaration, injunction or damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
      <P>An action in the case of an abuse of a dominant position can, since November 1992, be taken in the Circuit Court.  I am aware of actions initiated by small and medium sized businesses and traders.</P>
      <P>The system of public inquiries by the Fair Trade Commission which was in place under the restrictive practices Acts has been replaced by the new system of prohibition under the 1991 Act.  Under the Act the Competition Authority has received notifications seeking a licence or certificate for certain anti-competitive activities where the beneficial consequences outweigh the restrictive effects.  Between the coming into effect of the Act on 1 October 1991 and 25 March 1993 the authority received 1,150 notifications seeking a certificate or a licence.  The bulk of these notifications were made towards the end of September 1992.</P>
      <P>With regard to mergers, one proposed merger was referred to the authority since the Act came into effect and its report was published on 30 March 1992. On the same day the Minister made an order prohibiting the proposed merger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date no requests have been made by the Minister to the authority to carry <Col N="1497" /> out any study or analysis under section 11 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I should add I keep all legislation under review.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Social Employment Scheme is continuing with around 15,500 participating at the moment of whom some 2,300 were recruited from the beginning of January up to the end of February, 1993.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer funding available for the scheme this year is £83.811 million which allows for average participation of around 13,500 participants as against 12,000 last year.</P>
      <P>There was a large intake to the scheme towards the end of 1992 bringing the total on the scheme at the end of last year to 15,558.  As a result some disruption of projects is inevitable due to the need for FÁS to manage the scheme so that expenditure does not exceed the available funding.</P>
      <P>I am, however, looking at the overall resources available to my Department to see if there is scope for a reallocation of additional resources to the Social Employment Scheme so that the numbers on the scheme could continue at around 15,000.</P>

      <P>The level of Exchequer and EC funding available this year will enable FÁS to provide training and retraining for about 14,500 people, the majority of whom will be drawn from the ranks of the unemployed including the long term unemployed.  The Deputy will, however, be aware that the primary manpower intervention to help persons who are long term unemployed is the Social Employment Scheme/Community Employment Development Programme. The Government has made £83.811 million available for the SES/CEDP this year which will provide an average participation level of about 13,500, as against the corresponding 1992 figure of 12,000. Subject to the scheme being eligible for European Community funding under the Community Support Framework for 1994-1999 and to the general budgetary position, it may prove possible to increase the participation levels still further from next year.  In addition, the <Col N="1500" /> Deputy will be aware that the area based strategy to combat long term unemployment is operating in 12 designated areas.  The operation of the strategy will be evaluated to assess its effectiveness in assisting persons who are long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>Under our system of industrial relations, terms and conditions of employment of workers are generally determined by the process of free collective bargaining.  However, statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment are established through Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) which operate in areas where collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low.  The JLC system covers some 65,000 workers and this will be increased to about 100,000 when an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) is made under the recently established JLC for catering employees in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 contains measures to improve the functioning of existing Committees and speed up the establishment of new ones.  The Act also makes a number of technical changes which improve the enforcement of the terms of EROs.  In particular, fines for breaches of EROs have been increased substantially.  Overall, the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 are designed to ensure that the Joint Labour Committee system functions efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>The position of low paid workers was recognised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which were specifically weighted in their favour. Minimum pay increases, combined with improvements in the Family Income Supplement and income tax reductions, have resulted in an appreciable improvement in the position of the low paid.  Among the income tax priorities set out in the Programme for Government is the removal of the low-paid, especially families, from the tax net.  An estimated 13,500 low-paid workers will be removed from the income tax net as a result of the increase in exemption limits announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>During my visit I announced that two of the companies I met, Microsoft and Informix, which are among the world's leaders in software, have agreed proposals with the Industrial Development Authority which will create over 270 new high calibre jobs in Dublin.  Several other companies indicated either further expansion in Ireland or setting up possible operations here at an early date.</P>
      <P>I also announced that four other software projects agreed with the IDA and involving a total of 150 jobs, are also setting up in and around Dublin.</P>

      <P>The ranking in question derives from the world competitiveness report which is prepared by a private organisation based in Switzerland.  The ranking derives from the particular combination of criteria selected and, at least in part, from value judgment applied to them with which one may or may not agree.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know, however, that the ranking is an improvement of five places on a report from the same organisation in respect of 1990 which suggests that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Our policy response, which is determined by our own assessment of the requirements of the country rather than this particular report, is fully contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  In particular, in conformity with a recommendation in the Culliton report, it is intended to provide more training for those in employment.  In addition, a White Paper on Education is being prepared.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies to parliamentary questions on 23 and 24 March 1993 regarding the local enterprise promotion activities of the <i>Programme for Economic <Col N="1505" /> and Social Progress</i> area partnership companies.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer funding provided for the area based response to long term unemployment is used for staffing and administrative expenses incurred by the partnerships.  The local partnership companies regulate their own affairs in the context of highly focused action plans which have been formulated to reflect the needs and resources of their local areas.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the development of local enterprise promotion activities, including decisions on whether to provide small scale grants or to offer loan facilities, comes within the day-to-day responsibility of the partnership companies and is not a matter for which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has any direct function.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to the special social welfare measures available in the twelve partnership areas, I understand that a total of 240 self-employed people are now in receipt of the Area Enterprise Allowance, which is available to persons who sign off the live register to start up their own business, subject to the approval of the enterprise by the local Area Partnership Company.</P>
      <P>I am at present engaged in a review of the various aspects of the establishment procedures, structure, staffing, and funding of the County Enterprise Partnership Boards.  In the context of this review, I will be exploring, in consultation with the social partners, and in liaison with the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the best means of ensuring the ongoing development of the work of the area partnership companies.</P>

      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions wrote to the Taoiseach on 26 February, 1993 suggesting that a task force should be set up for Galway.  On the same day, I was already announcing the establishment of the Galway Task Force to tackle the impending employment situation there.  The task force, under the chairmanship of the Galway City and County Manager, Mr. Séamus Keating, held its inaugural meeting on 4 March, 1993 and is now fully operational.</P>
      <P>When establishing the task force I emphasised that a priority must be to put in place replacement industries.  I asked the task force to focus in particular on expanding employment opportunities by means of capitalising on the existing Digital facilities together with the skills and infrastructure already available.  The chairman and the task force secretariat is now working from the Digital plant.  The Industrial Development Authority are also maintaining a presence in the plant so as to service employee queries and proposals.  A first review of proposals from the employees and the community is underway.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach announced new measures on 30 April 1992 aimed at reducing long term unemployment in the 12 areas established under the area based strategy of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These measures focus on eliminating the disincentive caused by the removal of secondary benefits, such as Christmas bonus, fuel allowance, etc., for persons who are long term unemployed and who sign off the live register to take up either paid employment and/or training and development schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures include the Community Employment Development Programme, CEDP, and the area based enterprise allowance.  The CEDP was introduced on 1 October 1992.  It is an enhanced employment programme for the long term unemployed similar to the social employment scheme but involves the retention of existing secondary social welfare payments by participants, improved training and development opportunities, exemption from PAYE, and, for voluntary sponsors, exemption from the employer's contribution of PRSI.  The area based enterprise allowance involves the payment for a period of 12 months to a person who is starting a business of an allowance equivalent to the social welfare payments the person would have been entitled to while on the live register.  The person will also retain the secondary benefits associated with the payment.  The approval of the proposed <Col N="1510" /> enterprise project by the local area based partnership company is necessary before payment is allowed.</P>
    <P>At present 2,200 people are engaged in the CEDP, and 240 people are in receipt of the area enterprise allowance. These measures are being implemented in the 12 partnership areas on a pilot basis, and are subject to an evaluation to assess their effectiveness in assisting persons who are long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I attach particular importance to evaluating the impact of this scheme on long term unemployment.  A comprehensive evaluation of the area based response to long term unemployment was commissioned by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> An interim report covering the period June, 1991 to December, 1992 has been completed and is being examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>I would like to advise the House that the Government is studying the feasibility of replacing the current system of insurance premiums for third party liability motor insurance by means of a levy on motor fuels.  As the implications of such a levy are wide-ranging, involving economic, social and legal issues, I cannot at this stage give a firm indication of the completion date of this exercise.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being pursued without undue delay.</P>
      <P>I would add that I am aware of the views expressed by the Irish Insurance Federation and I note that the insurers have stated that something has to be done to reduce motor premiums, and that they would be very happy to explore with Government representatives various ways of achieving this.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to improving the cost environment for insurance is not confined to the consideration of a levy on motor fuels.  The Inter Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance is also being re-activated to provide a focus for the identification and consideration of initiatives having the objective of reducing insurance costs.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must stress that the primary ministerial responsibility of the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  In order to meet these requirements and operate on a viable basis insurers must be free to make their own underwriting decisions particularly in terms of the acceptance or rejection of risks and the charging of insurance premiums.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to parliamentary questions on 11 March 1993 by the Minister for Finance about the jobs fund under the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>Clearly, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I will be making an input to decision-making at Government level on the approval of projects which will arise for consideration in the context of both the Public Capital Programme and the environmental and transport infrastructure developments to be assisted under the Cohesion Fund.  Primary responsibility for the assessment of such projects will obviously be a matter for the Minister in whose areas of competence the projects will arise.</P>
      <P>In relation to access to funding support for community groups, this will arise primarily in the context of the allocation within the overall jobs fund provision in 1993 which has been made in respect of the establishment of the county enterprise partnership boards.  Arising from the transfer of responsibility for county enterprise partnership boards to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, an allocation of £25 million for spending via the CEPBs this year is being included in my Department's Vote to be published in the 1993 Revised Estimate Volume.  As a voted expenditure item, all the resources released in support of community enterprise projects will be subject to standard Government statutory and accounting procedures.</P>

      <P>Euroform, Horizon and Now are European Community Initiatives which aim to support the piloting of innovative training projects on a transnational basis.  Euroform focuses on innvoation in training, Horizon funds projects to develop training for the disadvantaged and the disabled, while Now concerns new kinds of training for women.  The EC funding applies to the period 1992 to 1994 and the total allocation for the three programmes amounts to IR£30.4 million.  Projects receive up to 65 per cent of their funding from the Structural Funds, mainly the European Social Fund and they must themselves source the required matching funds.  The total investment will therefore amount to IR£47.4 million.</P>
      <P>Under Euroform, Horizon and Now, 187 projects are being supported to develop new kinds of training for various target groups.  At the end of 1992, 286 full and part time jobs had been created in terms of people employed to manage and deliver the training projects.</P>
      <P>On these projects by the end of 1992, 4,763 people had received training at 160 locations throughout the country.  Since many projects are still at the start up phase, this figure can be expected to rise significantly during 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Human Resource Community Initiatives, Euroform, Horizon and Now, are a particularly innovatory form of Structural Fund investment.  They have an important role to play in the development of vocational training interventions in Ireland and the rest of the European Community.  Under these initiatives, a wider group of organisations are in receipt of European Social Fund money than has traditionally been the case.  They include voluntary organisations, trade <Col N="1516" /> unions, professional institutes as well as statutory education and training agencies.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has not yet decided on the future of Euroform, Horizon and Now.  From a national perspective, I consider that these programmes represent a significant and welcome development.  They direct Community funds to the local level and allow for the piloting of new approaches to training across a very wide spectrum. Accordingly, I have strongly made the case to the European Commission for the continuation of these three initiatives and for the provision of necessary funding in the next Community Support Framework for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time was discussed by the Social Affairs Council for the first time in December 1991 and was again discussed by the Council in April, June and December 1992.</P>
      <P>The June Council had a lengthy discussion on the proposal and concluded that there was broad agreement on the Directive except for some problems of a technical nature.  The Council decided to establish a Technical Working Party with a view to resolving these issues as soon as possible.  The Technical Working Party held several meetings and work is continuing at official level in an effort to resolve outstanding issues.  The Danish Presidency has now scheduled the Directive for consideration at the Social Affairs Council on 6 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the scope of the Directive is very broad, it will be possible, in a number of <Col N="1517" /> specific areas of employment to derogate from the provisions of the Directive in legislation, provided that equivalent compensatory rest is provided for the workers concerned.  It will also be possible to derogate from the Directive by means of collective agreements provided that equivalent compensatory rest is provided. This provision will permit sectors or employments experiencing difficulties in complying with the provisions of the Directive to conclude agreements allowing for the operation of working time patterns which are more appropriate to that sector or employment, while ensuring, through the provision of equivalent compensatory rest, that the health and safety of workers is protected.</P>
    <P>Even in employments where full compliance is required, the impact of provisions will depend on how individual employers decide to react in order to meet their obligations e.g. by the introduction of new technology, reorganisation of working schedules, recruitment of new workers, rationalisation etc.  It would not be possible to predict the outcome of the decisions by so many employers collectively and individually, particularly as the definitive provisions of the Directive remain to be settled.</P>
    <P>The Directive, when adopted, will provide a wide-ranging regulatory framework covering the full range of working time issues which, at present, are largely regulated through the collective bargaining process.</P>
    <P>When a common position is adopted on the proposal at the Social Affairs Council, the draft Directive will, under the co-operation procedure, then be forwarded to the European Parliament for consideration and referred back to the Council for final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of motor and motorcycle insurance is substantially determined by the cost of claims.  Unless and until claims costs in Ireland reduce to the levels in other member states of the EC it is unrealistic to expect that the cost of motor insurance in this country will match that obtaining in other member states.  I am not at all certain, therefore, that the establishment of a national motor and motorcycle insurance scheme as referred to by the Deputy would necessarily result in bringing insurance costs in Ireland into line with other EC countries.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware that many Irish drivers regard the premiums they are charged for motor, or motorcycle, insurance as high and is committed to doing what it can in relation to improving the cost environment for such insurance. Thus, the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance is being re-activated to provide a focus for the identification and consideration of further measures, including initiatives by the Government itself, having the objective of reducing insurance costs.  The Deputy will be aware that the costs of insurance are influenced by a number of areas of Government concern such as the responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment in relation to road traffic legislation and the Minister for Justice concerning the operation of the courts.</P>
      <P>I must add that the statutory Ministerial function of the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that authorised insurers meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.</P>

      <P>Confronting unemployment and the creation of employment is the first priority of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a wide range of measures across the broad spectrum of the economy which will address this problem, and of course many of these are outside the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>In particular, to encourage a spirit of enterprise in this country it is essential that we see a significant fall in real and nominal interest rates and I am encouraged that the macro-economic measures taken by this Government in its short period in office are already having positive results in this regard.  It is our intention at both macro-economic and firm level to ensure that this country and its policies and administration are business-friendly.</P>
      <P>Of primary importance in regard to enterprise is the role of education and I am in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Education to ensure that this is reflected in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>Within the remit of my own Department, the importance I attach to the jobs crisis is reflected in the fact that my two main priorities are the implementation of the Culliton report and the establishment of the County Enterprise Partnership Boards.</P>
      <P>In relation to the former, as indicated in reply to a separate question, and contrary to certain recent suggestions that the Culliton report has been shelved, I will shortly be publishing the Moriarty Task Force report with details of its implementation by the Government.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Enterprise Partnership Boards, their very name indicates the anticipated nature of their activities. Again, as indicated in replies to other questions, following transfer of responsibility for them to my Department, I am currently engaged in a review of their structures and activities, but will clearly be looking to them to act as focal points for the generation of enterprise at local level.</P>

In these circumstances, there are no competitiveness <Col N="1525" /> implications for State mobile crane operators since both UK and State operators are placed on equal terms under the law.  As regards the competitiveness of Irish industry generally, costs paid to mobile crane operators would only be one of the factors which would have to be taken into account when considering this subject.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the administrative concessions referred to by the Deputy were withdrawn by the Revenue Commissioners, so as to prevent erosion of revenue to the Exchequer, were outlined in the reply to the earlier Parliamentary Questions Nos. 150, 151 and 152 on 23 March 1993.</P>
    <P>Sales of marked gas oil within the State take place through authorised distributors, but there is no breakdown as to the particular uses within the categories permitted by the law to which the oil is put by final users.  It is for this reason that the figures which were requested by the Deputy in the earlier parliamentary questions are not available.  To obtain them would entail the formulation of an elaborate bureacratic system of controls at considerable cost, both to the administration and to the businesses concerned, which is considered neither warranted nor justified.  As regards the wider question of administrative changes effected, it would be impractical to catalogue each and every instance of this kind.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing the involvement of civil servants in political activity are as follows: (a) civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly &mdash; this restriction applies to all categories of staff; (b) civil servants in the industrial categories and in the manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political <Col N="1527" /> activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections &mdash; civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections; (c) members of the clerical grades in the Civil Service and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the Clerical Officer maximum may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b) but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused; (d) all civil servants above clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.  However, at a meeting of the Government held on 11 July 1985, it was decided that Personal Assistants and Special Advisers in Ministers' Offices are to be exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>

      <P>The remit of the Ombudsman extends to the Civil Service, the local authorities, the health boards, An Post and Telecom Eireann.  The inclusion of the latter within the Ombudsman's remit in December 1984 is largely explicable by the services which they provided having previously come within the Ombudsman's purview when carried out by the Department of Post and Telegraphs and an exceptional public demand for the Ombudsman's services in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not, however, as a general rule envisage the Ombudsman's remit extending to State-sponsored bodies which have an essentially commercial mandate; and I would require evidence of substantial consumer discontent with the customer redress mechanisms provided by any such <Col N="1528" /> body before adopting a different approach.  In the case of the ESB, notwithstanding its monopoly position, I am not aware of any such discontent.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 95 to 97, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department uses voice and data telecommunications facilities extensively in its day to day operations.  The Department has built a telecommunications network serving all its offices nationwide. The network includes 1,500 telephone extensions, 800 direct lines, 50 telephone systems of varying sizes and 45 FAX machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this age of rapid communication it <Col N="1529" /> has, for some years, been normal practice for Ministers, Ministers of State and their advisers to use modern means of communication. This equipment is part of my Department's business-like communications network.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's question, the telecommunications equipment provided is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Four FAX machines</P>
    <P>&mdash;Three mobile phones, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Two telephone answering machines.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of providing these services is made up of their purchase price, rental and the cost of calls.  Purchase price of this equipment, which is part of my Department's stock, was approximately £9,000.  Ongoing charges include rental and total cost in a full year will depend on the level of usage and are estimated to be of the order of £5,000.</P>
    <P>No additional telecommunications equipment was purchased in 1992 for use by the Minister or advisers; there was no Minister of State at my Department in 1992.</P>

      <P>Payment by pension book at post offices is the main payment method for Social Welfare pensioners.  My Department has been developing alternative payment methods which are modern, flexible and convenient for its customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the new methods on offer is direct payment of pension into a bank account or a new An Post Pension Savings Account.  Many customers may find that direct payment of pension via a bank or An Post is more suited to their needs. <Col N="1530" /> This option, which is entirely voluntary, is being offered now to most old age contributory and retirement pensioners.</P>
    <P>So far 5,000 contributory old age and retirement pensioners have opted for direct payment facility.  Many of them find the security aspects of this method of payment particularly attractive.  Pensioners not opting for direct payment will continue to receive payment by pension book at post offices as always.</P>
    <P>One of the necessary features of this direct payment facility is that payment will be made every four weeks in arrears. This is the normal payment procedure for salaries before retirement.  This also ensures that my Department has adequate time to respond to any change in pensioner circumstances before the next payment is made.  The first direct payment will be made five weeks after the last payment by way of pension book. This is a consequence of moving from a system of payment one week in advance to four weeks in arrears.  All subsequent direct payments will be made every four weeks.</P>
    <P>As a once-off incentive in 1993 to both existing and new contributory old age and retirement pensioners, my Department is offering £50 in Prize Bonds to those who opt for the new payment method during 1993.</P>
    <P>Pensioners opting for direct payment of pension have been fully advised that payment is four weekly in arrears.</P>

      <P>The significant developments in international currency exchange markets in recent times have had a major impact on many aspects of our economy, including prices.</P>
      <P>Since the dismantling of statutory price controls generally in 1986, the general thrust of policy by successive Governments has been to refrain from direct interference in business and to avoid employing any controls, measures and bureaucratic structures that would impose unnecessary burdens on business or consume scarce public funds.  Currently there are no statutory price controls in force.  The emphasis is on the development of competition in every sector of enterprise and encouraging further consumer awareness of prices.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, sets down the legal framework which is necessary to protect the market and to promote the principles of free and fair competition on which the market operates.  It is vital for economic development and for keener prices for the consumer.  I would advise consumers to vigorously enforce their rights in this crucial area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the onset of currency turbulence last autumn, and the weakening of the pound sterling, there were many indications of price reductions for imported <Col N="1534" /> goods and much evidence of strong marketing campaigns built on falling costs for importers, distributors and retailers.  The most recent figures reported for the Consumer Price Index here are particularly encouraging in this respect.  I have been concerned to see that importers, distributors and retailers are encouraged by market pressures to convey to consumers the benefits of the greater purchasing power of the Irish currency and continue to be concerned that any upward price movements following the recent re-alignment within the EMS and renewed strengthening of sterling should be appropriate.  I am asking the Director of Consumer Affairs to continue to monitor developments.</P>
    <P>As regards any effects on inflation here of the recent realignment of our currency within the EMS, I would expect inflation for 1993 to be under 3 per cent.  Finally, I would stress again that consumers should be prepared to vigorously exercise their right of choice by being sensitive to the range of prices on offer and purchase accordingly.  Sellers in a competitive market respond to buying patterns.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of the ongoing difficulties which the clothing and footwear sectors are experiencing.</P>
      <P>The difficulties facing these sectors include currency, high interest charges until recently and difficult trading conditions due to the international recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to alleviate the problems experienced by manufacturers due to currency problems, the Government established a £50 million Market Development Fund to assist firms whose employment and output were under threat.  The clothing <Col N="1536" /> and footwear sectors have availed themselves of this to a significant extent.</P>
    <P>My Department has had regular contact with the State agencies to address the problems facing these industries on an ongoing basis, taking account of their specific needs.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that concern has been expressed about the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT on clothing and footwear announced in the budget. This is primarily a matter for my colleague Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Finance, who has already informed the House as to the reasons for this on a number of occasions.  In that context, I would point out that the financially responsible and balanced nature of overall budgetary policy has already contributed significantly to the downward movement in interest rates.  This movement will be a major benefit, not just to the clothing and footwear industry, but to the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>Road accident statistics for 1991 show that the accident rate for motor cyclists is over 12 times the rate for cars. The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 to 1993, restrict the granting of driving licences for high-powered motorcycles to persons who are either 25 years of age or over, or who have had a full driving licence for lower-powered cycles for at least two years. This restriction was introduced as a road safety measure.</P>
      <P>A new edition of the <i>Rules of the Road</i>, published last year, sets out the legal position concerning motorcyclists and advises on good road user behaviour.  The National Safety Council, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has responsibility for road safety promotion generally and publishes a booklet &ldquo;This is Your Bike&rdquo; which deals among other things, with motorcycle safety and good road behaviour.  Compulsory motorcycle training is not a requirement of the EC Directive on the driving licence, and I have no proposals to introduce it here.</P>

      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): Under Article 4 of the Directive, a person who considers his request for information has been unreasonably refused or ignored, or has been inadequately answered by a public authority, may seek a judicial or administrative review of the decision in accordance with the relevant national legal system.  It is not intended to vary this provision when transposing the directive into Irish law. For example, an administrative review could be carried out by the Ombudsman in relation to public authorities coming under his jurisdiction, or a judicial review could be sought in the courts.</P>

    <P>Programme managers, ministerial advisers, assistants and special advisers <Col N="1549" /> have use of all the Department's telecommunications equipment and no fax machines, telephone lines or other such equipment have been specifically provided by my Department for them.</P>

As no additional telecommunications equipment was provided in 1992 for myself, my Ministers of State, special advisers and other such persons, the cost for the year ending 31 December 1992 was nil.</P>

Completed applications to the National Heritage Council are considered in the first instance by a committee of the Council and then by the full Council.

      <P>I understand that, shortly after it was established in 1988, the National Heritage Council received an application for grant assistance in respect of the development of a genealogy research centre at Corofin, Co.

However, the <Col N="1556" /> Deputy should be aware that the Department of the Taoiseach facilitated the genealogy centre in receiving funding from EC Structural Funds through Bord Fáilte and from the International Fund for Ireland.  My Department is now responsible for the Irish Genealogical Project.</P>
      <P>On foot of a further request from the Clare Heritage Centre an application form was sent to the Manager of the Centre in October 1991, but this has not been returned.

This figure reflects a 20 per cent decrease in the rental charges from 1st July next but does not include call charges as it is not possible to quantify the amount at this stage.</P>

      <P>The value and beneficial effects the pharmaceutical and health industry contribute to the Irish economy is a matter for my colleague, Mr. Ruairí Quinn TD, Minister for Enterprise and Employment. However, I understand that the sector provides direct employment for approximately 12,000 people with an output of £2,500 million.  Its expenditure of approximately £600 million on Irish materials and services support a further significant number of jobs in these supplier firms.</P>
      <P>The Medical Preparations (Advertising) Regulations, 1993 introduce new controls on the advertising and promotion of medicines to health professionals and the general public.  These regulations give effect to the 1992 EC Directive on the advertising and promotion of medicinal products for human use.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in discussion with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries regarding a code of practice, with a view to providing guidelines in respect of the requirements of the Regulations.</P>
      <P>The industry has flexibility to promote its products within the context of the Regulations mentioned above.</P>
