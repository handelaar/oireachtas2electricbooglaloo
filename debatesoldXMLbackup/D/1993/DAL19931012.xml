      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government proposes to commence discussions with the social partners on a new national programme later this month.  As a preliminary step the Government has agreed to meet ICTU tomorrow, 13 October, at its request to discuss the issues of &ldquo;the removal of the 1 per cent Income Levy and the full reversal of the social welfare cuts within an agreed timespan as well as the full implementation of the current Programme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government's position is that the key objectives of a new national programme should be increasing and maintaining employment, reducing unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment, and eliminating the social exclusion and marginalisation caused by long-term unemployment and poverty.  It believes all issues arising should be dealt with as contributing, or not, to those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares the concern <Col N="607" /> about unemployment expressed by Archbishop Connell during his address on the occasion of the public launch of Crosscare, the Catholic Social Service Conference, on 6 September 1993.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> stated that: &ldquo;long term unemployment must be tackled as the first priority, not only of Government, but of the social partners and the entire community.&rdquo;  The programme also recognised that: &ldquo;the costs of long term unemployment go far beyond the financial burdens, and include a major element of social isolation and family stress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government has placed primary emphasis on jobs and employment in the National Development Plan submitted to the European Commission in support of Ireland's case for EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period up to 1999.  A key feature of the plan will be a specially focused local development programme targeted at areas where unemployment is most acute and where significant social exclusion exists.  The programme will build on the experiences of the pilot projects in the area-based response to long-term unemployment, established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of the Catholic Social Service Conference and of the other voluntary organisations who do so much to address the needs of communities particularly affected by long-term unemployment.  The contribution of these organisations to the area-based initiative and the local development programme is essential if we are to successfully tackle the problems created by unemployment.</P>
    <P>I understand that the National Economic and Social Council will shortly finalise its recommendations on the strategy to be pursued in economic and social policy over the next few years.  As in the case of previous reports from the council prior to the negotiation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the council's forthcoming <Col N="608" /> report will provide a framework in which discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new programme will be conducted.</P>
    <P>The recently established National Economic and Social Forum provides an opportunity for representatives of groups traditionally outside the consultative process, including women's groups, the unemployed, the disadvantaged, people with a disability, the elderly, youth and environmental interests, to put forward views in relation to a new programme.  I understand the forum has, as a key part of its intended work programme, a critical view of existing schemes for the unemployed including an assessment of non-market work opportunities.  I will be happy to ask that the forum considers the Conference of Major Religious Superiors' proposal in this context.  The Programme for a Partnership Government stated specifically that the social partners and the Government will take account, in their deliberations and in negotiating future programmes, of the views expressed and positions agreed upon by the forum.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Task Force on Employment, I replied in some detail on 3 June 1992 to a parliamentary question from Deputy De Rossa.  At that stage, the task force had met on 33 occasions since its establishment in June 1991 and submitted 15 reports to Government. The task force met on seven occasions between June and October 1992, submitted a further report on the provision of childcare facilities and reviewed progress in relation to the implementation of its earlier reports.  At the beginning of this year, the Central Review Committee agreed that the task force had completed the tasks which it had been established to undertake.  I am circulating a note on progress in implementing the recommendations of the task force for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>

      <i>First Report on the Production of Components and Products for Multinational Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's Awards for Business Linkages were initiated last year to encourage linkages between small sub-supplier companies and larger companies in both the private and public sectors at home and abroad.  The awards are part of the on-going development of the National Linkage Programme.  Just last week I launched the second year's awards.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made in the area of building linkages between Irish industry and the electronics sector.  In the construction sector, the IDA continues to promote the use of Irish-sourced products in all industrial projects.</P>

      <i>Second Report on Extra Third Level Places in Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>A total of 5,193 places have been created under the undergraduate expansion programme.  The University of Limerick and Thomond College were amalgamated in July 1991 &mdash; this provided an extra 600 places in the university. Arising from the purchase of Carysfort College by UCD, 800 undergraduate places became available on the Belfield campus.  Carysfort will have a capacity of 1,700 when fully operational. Institutional linkages agreed between Mary Immaculate College and the University of Limerick has made an extra 600 places available.  Institutional linkages agreed between St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and Dublin City University should yield an extra 600 places.  Tallaght Regional Technical College commenced operating in September 1992 and will have a capacity of 1,200 when fully operational. The Foundation Building recently opened at the University of Limerick will in due course provide a further 1,000 places.  This is being funded for the greater part by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Certain courses in private noncommercial institutions have been approved for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme and these include: (i) a degree in Accounting and Human Resource Management at the <Col N="610" /> National College of Industrial Relations; (ii) a Bachelor of Religious Science degree at the Mater Dei Institute of Education; and (iii) a Baccalaureate in Theology and Arts from the Pontifical University at St. Patrick's, Maynooth.</P>
    <P>A number of private commercial institutions have recently been accepted as designated institutions.  These include: (i) Accounting and Business College, (ii) LSB International, (iii) Institute of Education, (iv) Griffith College and (v) Newman College.  Applications for validation of courses in these institutions are being considered by the NCEA.</P>

      <i>Fourth Report on Stamp Duty on New Houses</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1993 Finance Act gave effect to the budget proposal to base the stamp duty charge for all new houses over 125 square metres on the site value only but subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the total house value.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fifth Report on Planning Procedures</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, requires An Bord Pleanála to determine most appeals and other matters which come before it for decision within a period of four months.  The number of appeals at end August was 495, an all-time low.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sixth Report on Special Trading Houses Scheme</i>

      <i>Thirteenth Report on Telecommunications Tariffs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on 18 May 1993, approved a package of telephone tariffs which had the aim of applying cost-based tariffs to all telephone traffic.  This has resulted in the cessation of cross subsidisation of one type of call for another.</P>

      <i>Other measures developed by Task Force.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The measures developed by the task force, aimed at helping to get long-term unemployed persons back to work in the 12 Area Partnerships, which I announced on 30 April 1992, are now in operation. One of these measures &mdash; the Area Allowance (Enterprise) proved so successful that it has been extended to a second year at a rate of 75 per cent of the applicants underlying unemployment assistance entitlement.  At the end-September 1993, there were some 4,000 participating in the new community employment development programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that 287,000 people do not have work and that 98,000 people emigrated during the period of the last plan?  What level would unemployment need to reach for the Taoiseach to conclude that his policies were not working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out in detail the steps the Government is taking in relation to this problem.  The National Development Plan published by the Government contains details of the largest ever investment programme in this country, historically or otherwise.  This plan covers the period up to 1999 and sets out job targets.  There are many aspects to unemployment and, as was stated clearly at the launch of the plan yesterday, this is one part of Government strategy; other parts of Government strategy include budgetary measures and possible opportunities which can be identified and which will create even a single job.  We have included local development initiatives in the plan in an effort to get enterprise going on the ground and we are constantly working with the social partners on recommendations made by the task forces to which I referred in my reply.  I would welcome any constructive suggestions from Deputy Bruton, members of his party or members of other parties on ways of tackling our unemployment problem.  Deputy Bruton knows as well as I do that unemployment is due to a combination of factors, not merely the increase in our labour force numbers arising from our demographic position.  Unemployment is a very serious problem throughout Europe and the western world.  That is why I hope much time will be devoted at the December Summit to producing a concerted programme and policy on ways of tackling unemployment on a European-wide basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, I am sure, will be the first to admit that the solution to unemployment does not lie solely in our hands, that we are at the mercy of what happens internationally, because we are such an open economy.  However, he and the House can be assured that every possible <Col N="614" /> action in relation to the relief of unemployment will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not use that word.  The Deputy may take it from somebody else if he cares to use it but it is not a word that I have used to describe unemployment.  I have described unemployment as a human tragedy and indeed any level of unemployment is unacceptable. The Government is taking every possible initiative it can regarding the solution of the problem and I hope Deputy Bruton might address that particular issue.</P>

What are the specifics on the agreement as to the steps that may be taken to deal with unemployment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Launching the National Development Plan yesterday I said quite clearly that the central objective of that plan was tackling the problem of unemployment and creating employment. I also said, and I repeat here today, that the central objective of the talks with the social partners should be directed at relieving unemployment in whatever ways possible and ensuring that the maximum number of jobs can be created. In this regard I indicated quite clearly &mdash; and I am sure everybody agrees &mdash; that competitiveness has a major role in creating and maintaining jobs in the economy and that every 1 per cent sustained improvement in wage cost competitiveness can produce 4,000 net jobs. Therefore, the discussions that will take place can make their own contribution in relation to the objectives I have set for the talks and for the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe, therefore, that if people work for nothing the unemployment problem will be solved because the net effect of arguing that the only aspect of competition is wage rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said one or the other.  Deputy De Rossa knows quite well that nobody in his House subscribes to the idea of people working for nothing, it is naive of the Deputy to suggest such a thing.  Furthermore, I am not in favour of creating a low wage economy, for many reasons, social and commercial. When we sit down to discuss paying ourselves we should consider what we have to compete with in the international market place because we must sell abroad 70 per cent of what we produce at home. <Col N="616" /> Quite clearly, what stood to us in the most recent recession, which we are not out of yet, was the element of competitiveness that had entered the Irish economy because of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the earlier years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We have lost a certain edge in that regard but if that competitiveness did not exist I can assure the Deputy we would be talking about completely different numbers because it enabled Irish exporters to not alone hold their market share abroad but to increase it in a decreasing market.  Of course there are many other factors to competitiveness, the quality of the goods, consistency of supply and delivering on time.  A range of areas keeps one in business with one's customers but wage cost competitiveness cannot be ignored.</P>

      <P>In respect of Question No. 6, the authors of this booklet would want me to point out that they are the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, not the Catholic Social Services Council.

      <P>What is the Taoiseach's response to the proposal in this publication that up to 100,000 people could be more usefully, socially and productively, involved in employment by shifting that amount of the social welfare budget to pay them at the equivalent rate of what they would earn on the dole with the facility to earn whatever they could in addition on a voluntary basis while retaining their other ancillary social welfare benefits such as fuel vouchers, medical card, differential rent assessment and so on?</P>

      <P>I have already said that can be referred to the Economic and Social Forum for evaluation at that level. I met representatives, Fr. Healy and the <Col N="617" /> Reverend Sister, who presented those proposals to me, we said they would be examined and evaluated and whatever contribution they can make taken on board.  I would point out that much work in this regard had been carried out by a committee of the previous Dáil on unemployment and identification of capacity in various areas of the public service had been carried out by that committee.  We will continue to evaluate those proposals and whatever contribution that can be made will be taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much talk from time to time about the cost of PRSI and social contributions but I see no evidence to suggest that this is a problem. On the contrary there is evidence from the pilot schemes implemented by this and a previous Government that where we allowed employers to be free of PRSI contributions for a two year period to employ people a very small contribution was made.  If we accept the argument that our PRSI social contributions are high and uncompetitive and a barrier to employing people, we should have seen a better result.  We did not see a better result and I believe in testing an idea and not operating on theory.  I prefer to operate the practice and that is what the practice has shown.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of taxation, of course we are committed to reducing taxation as resources become available. People must make up their minds whether they want lower taxation levels and increased services, or full maintenance of services.  That question must be answered by everybody, including the Deputy.</P>

That is a group, in the fifties, sixties and seventies, not represented by any of the social partners.  I know their interests are represented by the Government.  Will the Taoiseach agree to place a specific item on the agenda for the men and women who, having served this country well, find themselves, through no fault of theirs, in voluntary redundancy circumstances in <Col N="619" /> their declining years, without proper representation?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that all interests and groups should have an input to the consideration that will take place.  I have no doubt that they will.  The Economic and Social Forum has a wide representation of interests and will be making an input to Government in relation to interests and groups which will include the types of people to whom Deputy Burke has referred.  Unquestionably their interests should be taken into consideration.  Anybody who is unlucky or unfortunate enough to have to accept voluntary or compulsory redundancy will know quite well that it constitutes a tragedy for them and their family.  The Government will help by making support systems available to them in an endeavour to ensure a new role in life for them.  These and the older sections of the community will be taken care of, not merely by the Government and trade unions in some instances but also in the wider representation that is part of the Economic and Social Forum.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's dismissal of the idea of cutting the level of PRSI, how can he argue that cutting that level would not be effective when he argued yesterday that a 1 per cent cut in wages would produce 4,000 jobs?  Surely a 1 per cent cut in PRSI would produce 4,000 jobs.  Does he not recognise the distinction between representation at the Economic and Social Forum &mdash; which does not involve itself in any negotiation of either pay or non-pay &mdash; and participation in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> where the deal is cut and those unemployed are left out when the real decisions about the deal are made?</P>

      <P>In relation to PRSI, I have said on a number of occasions, and repeat, that the overall level of PRSI contributions on the part of employers has been advanced time and time again as their excuse for not employing people. That is what I label it, an excuse, because once we have tested the argument advanced &mdash; and we have tested not just once but twice &mdash; we see the results in their response.  Clearly, it is not the problem it is made out to be.  I should say that we are examining the possibility of a tiered system that can cater for certain <Col N="621" /> areas of very tight margins in an industrial environment, such as that in the clothing or footwear industry &mdash; those are the areas we will examine from the point of view of competitiveness.  When I talk about the cost of PRSI I should say I am talking in general terms.  Nonetheless there are specifics for which we will endeavour to cater.</P>

What the Taoiseach is doing is endeavouring to mislead the people, preparing the ground for wage freezes and cuts. Will he state in this House that that does not constitute the way forward for job creation?  Furthermore, will he indicate whether he intends to agree to the abolition of the 1 per cent levy on PAYE income and, to use the current jargon, say whether he will rebalance the income tax burden on PAYE workers, thereby ensuring that other sectors of the community, such as the self-employed and farmers, pay their fair share of tax, which might result in a greater degree of equity within our society?</P>

Deputy John Bruton knows as well as I do that employers do not employ people just because it may cost £1 or £2 less to employ them this week or last week.  The Deputy knows as well as I do, but is not prepared to admit it, that one employs people to produce goods or services one can sell at home or abroad.  That is why one employs people, not because the PRSI contribution may be 1 per cent less or more.  Indeed, if one had not a market for either, one would not produce them even if one could do so at no expense. We have put that argument to the test over a two year period.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for a general review of the Constitution.  The Government is committed to holding a referendum on divorce, as indicated in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The proposal in that regard is being prepared by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>It was also indicated in the programme that the referendum would be taken by 1994, as the culmination of a major programme of family law reform.  We are on target to achieve that aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the Constitution is well over 50 years old and that there is a strong case for modernising it?  Will he also accept that his reply suggests he has a closed mind in regard to modernising the Constitution?  Does he see any merit in an examination by an Oireachtas committee of specific issues such as bail, the problem in relation to Cabinet confidentiality as it arose in the tribunal or other such issues or, alternatively, an Oireachtas committee reviewing the Constitution?  Does he see <Col N="628" /> any merit in that approach or can he not see further than the divorce referendum?</P>

      <P>As I said, I have no plans for a general review of the Constitution as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe.  The Constitution reflects many deeply held values and views of society and has stood the test of time. There have been many new departures and decisions have been interpreted by the Supreme Court and the High Court. Specific aspects of the Constitution are reviewed and new provisions proposed as the need arises.  As I said, we will have a constitutional referendum on divorce, I hope in the autumn of 1994, but I have no other proposals at present for any changes.</P>

      <P>Surely, given that the Oireachtas in 1968 saw fit to review the Constitution and, indeed, made recommendations with regard to Article 2 specifically, 25 years later it would be in order to have a further review of the Constitution, particularly in view of the many court decisions with regard to abortion, the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions and the increasing problems in relation to property, etc?  It is time that the fundamental values, to which the Taoiseach referred, were reviewed in the light of a modern understanding of those values it would be appropriate for an Oireachtas Committee to undertake that review.  Will he confirm that he gave this House a commitment last week to propose a change in Articles 2 and 3 in the context of an agreement in relation to Northern Ireland?  I presume that commitment stands as well as the commitment in regard to divorce.</P>

I would have thought the Taoiseach was aware of that.  On the question of reform of the Constitution, is it the position that there will be no general reform or all party committee?  Will a referendum on divorce be held next year and a referendum on amending Articles 2 and 3 in the event of a settlement of the Northern Ireland problem?

      <Quest>if, in view of his address to the meeting of the European Democratic Alliance in Killarney, County Kerry, on 9 September 1993, in which he expressed opposition to suggestions that EC structures should be changed to diminish the role of smaller states, he will outline the steps, if any, he has taken to convey these views to other member states, and in particular to Germany; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I have taken the opportunity as appropriate in bilateral discussions with EC Heads of Government to articulate the views on this matter as set out in my speech of 9 September last.  In addition I arranged to have copies of my speech in Killarney on 9 September last circulated to embassies of all EC member states.  It received prominent coverage in the Brussels-based media that specialise in EC affairs and which have a wide, high-level circulation in EC capitals.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the Lisbon European Council in June 1992 stated that the prospective enlargement of the Community to include EFTA countries was possible on the basis of the existing institutional arrangements.  This was confirmed by the Copenhagen European Council last June.  Ireland adheres firmly to the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions. It is our view that the current institutional structures can be modified as necessary to take account of the increase in numbers arising from enlargement and of the need to maintain efficiency in Community procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from bilateral discussions which I had at the recent Council of Europe Summit in Vienna, I am confident <Col N="633" /> that the Special European Council likely to be held in Brussels on 29 October will confirm the agreement reached in Lisbon and reiterated in Copenhagen that the enlargement now being negotiated can take place on the basis of the existing institutional arrangements in the Community.</P>

Will he undertake to oppose any such change in direction at the special European Council Summit on 29 October?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy De Rossa in this regard and I signalled my opposition quite clearly in my speech in Killarney.  Last weekend I took the opportunity to talk to the majority of EC Heads of State on this point.  I said this suggestion ran counter to the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions and on 29 October I will be calling for the upholding of these decisions.  Second, I discussed with the Heads of State the unfortunate debate that started at a time when other countries are struggling with the problems of trying to have referenda passed to allow them to join the Community. The Community is showing bad example by trying to change the rules after the countries started the process of negotiations.  These countries applied for membership on the basis of the existing rules and were told clearly in Lisbon and in Copenhagen that these rules applied but now there are suggestions that they should be changed.  I said that I totally reject that approach.  I expect we will dispose of that matter at the Summit on 29 October and that decisions already taken will be upheld as we believe there can be institutional changes to reflect the increasing number and that the workings of the Community can be carried out <Col N="634" /> efficiently and effectively by the institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 31, 47 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>On 2 August, EC Finance Ministers decided to widen to 15 per cent both the 2.25 per cent narrow band and the 6 per cent wide band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System.  They did not abandon the ERM, which remains in place.</P>
      <P>Ireland's exchange rate policy is based on membership of the ERM and that will continue to be the position.  Within that framework, the aim of our exchange rate policy continues to be price stability, that is the maintenance of low inflation in the economy.  This has been the objective of our exchange rate policy over many years and has been greatly helped by our membership of the ERM.</P>
      <P>Policy is not designed to target a specific rate against any particular currency or basket of currencies.  However, in pursuing price stability, our aim is that the Irish pound will trade against the Deutsche Mark and Dutch Guilder at least as well as the rest of the former ERM narrow band currencies.  I would add that the other former ERM narrow band countries have also indicated that they will continue to work for exchange rate stability within the ERM.</P>
      <P>The best way to underpin the value of our exchange rate is of course to ensure that our economy is well managed.  Sound fiscal and economic policies have been the hallmark of our management of the Irish economy over recent years and they will continue to be so.  In this context the Government will of course be anxious to do its best to increase employment and to contain unemployment and reduce it as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains committed <Col N="637" /> to the ideal of Economic and Monetary Union, including a single currency. Ireland's objective is to be part of European Monetary Union as soon as it begins and our policies are, and will continue to be, geared to the achievement of that objective.</P>

Will he clarify the uncertainty that exists at present in relation to exchange rate policy by telling us exactly what future policy will be prior to our becoming part of the European Monetary Union?</P>

      <P>There is no confusion here or elsewhere in respect of this matter.  As I stated in my reply, we will trade against the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch Guilder at the same level as other narrow band countries.  Since the beginning of August we have continued to watch and move in conjunction with the former narrow band countries and we will continue to do so.  For a number of years our policy has been based on price stability and the maintenance of low inflation and we will continue to underpin that by adopting sound fiscal policies. That policy is understood clearly by the markets and it is the policy which has been followed by the former ERM narrow band countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is saying that, in effect, we are tracking the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch Guilder. What would happen if there was a divergence between those currencies and Sterling, for example, if Sterling was to depreciate substantially, as was the case in 1986 and last year when the Minister vainly tried to hold the line?  Are we waiting for a further crisis to occur?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting that we should link our currency to Sterling.  I acknowledged publicly <Col N="638" /> on many occasions that Sterling movements are important to us and will influence our position at any time in the new system, as was the case in the old system.  However, I do not envisage any fluctuations that will create major problems. At present the Irish pound is worth 95p against Sterling.  It has ranged from 92p to £1.04 during the past year and I do not believe there will be any major change in that position.</P>

We have had remarkable stability with no increases in interest rates such as those in other ERM narrow band countries. We continue to have record levels of reserves and have held a position of just under 7 per cent for the past ten weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25, 26, 33 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Construction Industry Federation have decided to enter into discussions on a new national programme.  The Government welcomes these decisions and would hope that discussions would get under way fairly soon.</P>
      <P>I hope that the issues raised by Congress in relation to the income levy and social welfare can be addressed in a manner which will enable the programme discussions to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the level of pay increases which might be the subject of discussion with the social partners, I have nothing <Col N="640" /> to add to my reply to Question No. 8 tabled by Deputy Yates on 11 May 1993. Speculation on such issues would be wholly inappropriate at this juncture.</P>
    <P>As regards the 1 per cent income levy, this measure was introduced in the 1993 budget to enable the Government maintain budgetary discipline, as an essential element in overall employment strategy, against the difficult background of the international recession and particularly high unemployment.</P>
    <P>The levy was announced as a temporary measure.  Despite the serious budgetary constraints facing the Government, it was decided not to increase tax rates as this would have involved reversing some of the major progress made in the income tax area in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism of the levy has ignored the substantial exemptions from the levy and also the other general improvements in the income tax code announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Government is anxious to remove the levy at the earliest possible date, subject to the overall budgetary position.  The future of the levy is, as I mentioned, one of the important issues to be addressed in the context of the discussions on the renewal of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the 1 per cent income levy, will the Minister drop the ambiguity and give us a yes or no answer as to whether it will be abolished in 1994? Will he not agree that it is arbitrary, the fifth tax on employment, it adds to the tax wedge and is equivalent to a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of tax for those who have to pay it?  It is penal and unfair.  Will the Minister give a commitment to the House, in order to commence discussions, that he will get rid of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give such a commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was all dressed up with nowhere to go today, I thought I might come into the House and talk to the <Col N="641" /> Minister.  From reports in the newspapers it appears that, in effect, the trade union movement made it a precondition of entering discussions on the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the income levy would be abandoned.  Since ICTU, IBEC, CIF and so on are now prepared to enter such discussions, it would appear that they must have some tacit understanding with the Minister or his advisers, who are good at emitting signals even if they do not speak with the clarity we are seeking in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the first meeting to discuss the pre-conditions outlined by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to seek clarification on the items they have tabled will take place tomorrow morning.  At that meeting I will point out the Government's position.  It would be nice to be able to say that we will drop the 1 per cent levy in early October at a cost of £150 million to the Exchequer, but I will not be in a position to do that either this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  The 1 per cent levy is a means of seeking a contribution from all income earners who are in a position to bear such a burden and its introduction must be viewed against the background of our position last January. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has brought about a significant improvement in people's real take-home pay.  During the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> take-home pay has increased by approximately 10 to 14 per cent, although it differs depending on marital status. Unemployment increased by 30,000 in the 1992-93 period and the Government believed that the 1 per cent levy was a fair means of clawing back money to maintain the sound budgetary stance that is necessary in all countries.  I am sure Deputy Cox will acknowledge that I have stated I will consider the matter of the 1 per cent temporary levy in the context of the 1994 budget, but I am not in a position to do so now.</P>

Has the National Treasury Management Agency confirmed that the saving resulting from the lowering of interest rates internationally is between £80 million and £100 million, that measures that arose from the currency crisis, such as the market development fund, no longer apply and, within that ambit, there is scope for abolishing the levy?</P>

      <P>The money provided was spent.  The National Treasury Management Agency is performing well.  Its good performance is based on deals it concluded on maturing debts, the taking on of new debt and not only on lower interest rates internationally.  The agency has brought extraordinary ingenuity to its work practices.  I understand Deputy Yates called to the agency during the summer break and that was welcome. The agency is now beseiged by international treasury agencies who wish to learn about its work practices.  I am hopeful that the figure will be in the order of £80 million to £100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he is not in a position to abandon the levy in early October and he has given a signal that he will consider abandoning the levy in 1994.  Does he accept that a nod is as good as a wink and that he has decided to abandon the levy next year because he will not get anywhere with the social partners if he does not do away with what was a folly and a disastrous decision in the first place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the levies introduced in 1984 and 1986 that still apply I would like to remove the levy introduced in 1993 during the life of the Government. The earlier levies did not include thresholds or exemptions.  While the 1993 levy included a £9,000 exemption limit and excluded medical card holders and employer's liability for medical card holders.  It is a matter for phasing it out. I am sure Deputies Yates and Cox will acknowledge that the opportunity for a Government to obtain income of between £145 million and £150 million in one fell swoop, which is approximately 1.5 per cent on the standard rate and higher tax rate is difficult to achieve in one year.  It is a great deal of money to take out of the system and that will not be easy to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, in view of the Minister's exhortations about pay moderation and competitiveness, would he consider reverting to the provisions of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and integrate pay and tax?  In order to secure a moderate pay deal we should focus on net pay by integrating tax reform into pay increases so that the take-home pay would be the critical factor.  The Minister, given that the public sector pay bill is the largest element, is in the unique position to review the mistakes of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the benefits of the <i>Programme <Col N="644" /> for National Recovery</i> and integrate the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was involved in negotiating both programmes.  I preferred the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but it was not possible in the last negotiations to follow the provisions in that programme. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was more useful for many reasons. Apart from what is paid under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we seem to have built into our system a 2 per cent wage drift in our economy.  If the increase is 3 per cent we appear to pay 5 per cent and that appears to be the case across the private sector. Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the rate was fixed at 2.5 per cent for a fixed period and was non-index rated.  The resources freed during that period were used to widen the standard band over a short period and to reduce corporation tax from 50 per cent to 40 per cent.  It would be wiser to go that way because otherwise the available resources are eaten up for other purposes leaving no room to manoeuvre.  If I give £150 million as a once off next year it will take away my ability to give cuts next year.  That is the point I was making during the summer.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether national indicators other than GDP and GNP are needed to reflect social and environmental welfare in view of the fact that GDP increased in real terms by 2.5 per cent in 1991 and 2.75 per cent in 1992 and unemployment, crime and environmental degradation has continued to increase.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>GNP and GDP are compiled in Ireland by the Central Statistics Office using the standard international methodology.  They are internationally accepted measures of national economic activity.  They are important indicators of overall economic performance.  The <Col N="645" /> Exchequer borrowing requirement and the national debt are expressed as ratios of GNP and GDP and hence both are important indicators for short and medium term macroeconomic policy management.  The Maastricht criteria for budgetary and debt convergency are expressed as percentages of GDP.  GNP is used for determining our EC budget contribution and GDP <i>per capita</i> is used in determining eligibility for EC Structural and Cohesion Funds.  In so far as the functions of the Minister for Finance are concerned, they are therefore important indicators of national economic activity.</P>
      <P>While it would be desirable to also have measures of national welfare incorporating wider social and environmental concerns, there is as yet no agreed international methodology for including such concerns in a national accounts framework.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that GDP growth in real terms for 1991 and 1992 was 1.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively according to the 1992 national accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the key issues in the economy are ecological sustainability and human well-being of which employment and the other factors to which he referred are a part? Will he accept that at present there is no single or collection of indicators for these since economic growth measures activity and is an extremely crude form of measurement?  Will he agree that under the present system an increase in the number of road accidents could mean increased economic growth?  There may not be an agreed indicator internationally to reflect social and environmental welfare but other countries have taken the brave step of looking at social and environmental indicators.  In his next budget the Minister should take account of indicators such as literacy, homelessness and carbon dioxide emissions so the social and environmental audits can be produced as well as a cash audit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At ECOFIN meetings <Col N="646" /> during the past year the points raised by the Deputy were debated.  I supported the idea of a carbon tax.  Environmental economists, and some international environmentalists, are concerned that the manner in which GNP is compiled does not reflect environmental considerations. If crime and other areas are considered it would be difficult to compile a set of national accounts.  There is a theory that if we use what they are calling in Europe, satellite accounts, rather than compiling these figures in GDP and GNP, people will be able to see, for example, the cost of a polluted river, how it would damage the tourist industry, and, consequently GNP.  I would not have any difficulty with such theory but if we took it as a model for crime, welfare and other matters, we would never have the national accounts. It is difficult enough to prepare them at the moment.  There is considerable debate in Europe about using the proposed model for environmental matters. Our traditional position has been to use the UN Convention which is the European model of GNP-GDP.  This can only be changed collectively, otherwise it would not be possible to base our criteria on the Maastricht guidelines and on what international markets seek.  I do not see a great difficulty in trying to move in the direction suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that GDP and GNP do not have a place, I am just asking the Minister to take into account that the relevance of GDP and GNP to our overall well-being is becoming thinner as unemployment soars and the problems associated with it increase.  Will the Minister take into account countries such as Sweden and America where they have looked at other factors and where they have environmental and social audits in line with GDP and GNP to give a broader picture of the Government's performance? Will the Minister also take the brave step of following some of the more progressive countries rather than waiting for the whole world to come together which seems an impossibility?</P>

An féidir leis an Aire a rá nach dtarlóidh sé arís agus go gcuirfidh an Rialtas foilseachán le chéile trí Bhéarla agus trí Ghaeilge leis na ceannteideal agus na teachtarachtaí ginearálta dátheangach? Nílim ag rá gur chóir gach ceannteideal a aistriú mar is teidil foilseacháin iad siad.  Ach táim ag caint faoi na habhairtí i mBéarla amháin.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will ensure that a census of the various species of wildlife will be undertaken so that special measures can be taken to see that those species which are endangered can be protected.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to census all species of wildlife.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service assesses the conservation status of each species and, where it is necessary, special surveys are undertaken as resources permit.  If any species is endangered, measures are undertaken to protect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is highly unsatisfactory.  He said initially that it is not possible to tell if some species are in danger because the census cannot be carried out, he then said that there is no need to do it.  Surely we can do as they do in Britain and have a very precise census of each species of wildlife.  During the summer I discovered that at least ten species of birds in this country are in <Col N="649" /> danger of extinction.  We do not seem to be capable of doing anything about it. I heard recently that the common song thrush is in danger, not just rare species like the corncrake and the kingfisher.  The Department does not seem to have the ability to discern what is in danger. Would it be possible to give the job of carrying out a census in order to protect wildlife to some other Department which has the interest and the resources to do the job?  This question is out of place among questions on the World Bank, the IMF and third banking institutions but, unfortunately, it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I do not expect the Minister to supervise the carrying out of a census of all the wildlife species in the country but something practical must be done to protect endangered species. It is vital to protect our wildlife because of our dependency on agriculture and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is not possible here.  The question was addressed to the Minister for Finance who has delegated the functions of the Office of Public Works to me as Minister of State and we are responsible for conservation.  I reject any implication that the Office of Public Works is lax in its conservation role.  It has a great interest in preserving wildlife. The conducting of a census does not protect wildlife.  The Office of Public Works undertakes specific measures to protect wildlife.  It undertakes habitat conservation and has initiated various researches. Under the Wildlife Act, 1976, wild birds are protected by rangers. There are special protection areas for wild birds and more will be designated. A variety of steps have been taken in that area so I would not like anybody to think that, because we do not undertake to conduct a survey of all species of wildlife, we are unconcerned about their survival and conversation.  One could argue that <Col N="650" /> to use up scarce and valuable resources to carry out such a survey would take vital people away from the protection duties which the Deputy sincerely wants in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to wildlife rangers.  Does he realise that there is one ranger in County Dublin and none in many counties? While we have programme managers, the Civil Service and the Cabinet to look after one species we have one person to look after the rest.  It comes as no surprise to hear the Minister of State say what Deputy Deasy has requested cannot be done.  I suggest to the Minister of State <Col N="652" /> that the solution to the problem lies in habitat conservation rather than in trying to save each species in a cage or by any other method.  Does the Minister of State intend to increase the number of wildlife rangers, bearing in mind the difficulties he has identified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, wildlife rangers are appointed on a regional rather than on a county basis.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that habitat conservation is one of the most important functions of the national parks and wildlife service.  Under that heading statutory protection has been given to a number of representative eco-systems which include 72 nature reserves, five refuges for fauna, 68 wildfowl sanctuaries and five national parks.  In addition, 20 special protection areas for wild birds and 21 important wetlands have been designated under international obligations. If I understand the Deputy correctly, he agrees with me that it is important to conserve habitats and that this is the best way to protect the various species that are under threat.  This will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister of State considers a constructive question to be a criticism of the Office of Public Works.  It is the responsibility of the wildlife rangers to enforce the legislation. As the Minister of State said, they are employed on a regional basis.  In my county we have one wildlife ranger who could be called the Lone Ranger.  Is the Minister of State aware that concern has been expressed that the proper equipment has not been provided to wildlife rangers to allow them carry out their task effectively?  Is the Minister of State also aware that there is widespread use of what is known as a bird line within which song birds are being trapped and exported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>A thorough assessment has been conducted within my Department of the options open to the Government to give effect to the commitment to develop a third banking force.  Deputies will appreciate that this is a complex issue and the consequences of the various possible scenarios have to be teased out comprehensively. It would be unwise to rush prematurely into an arrangement which might not maximise the benefit to the economy.</P>
      <P>For this reason no deadline has been set for the implementation of the programme commitment.  Deputies may nonetheless be assured that a decision will be taken by the Government as soon as it is prudent to do so.</P>
      <P>I met with the board of ACC Bank and also, at their request, with representatives of Crédit Agricole.  I also met, again at their request, with the chief executive of the National Irish Bank and the managing director of the National Australia Bank.  I should make it clear to the House that at all of these meetings I made it clear that a decision on the future of the State banks is a matter for the Government, and that I would not give any commitment or assurance in relation to any hypothetical development.</P>
      <P>I also met with representatives of the ATGWU, SIPTU and MSF, representing ACC staff interests.  I will shortly be meeting an MSF union delegation representing ICC staff interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials met with the managements of the four State banking institutions named in the Programme for Government: ICC Bank, ACC Bank, the Trustee <Col N="655" /> Savings Bank and An Post. Three of these bodies, ICC Bank, ACC Bank and An Post, also made formal submissions.  My officials also met with representatives of Crédit Agricole and with the chief executive of the National Irish Bank, again at the request of the institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand that the management of the ACC subsequently circulated to their staff a summary of the document they submitted to me.  I appreciate the concern of the bank to ensure that it develops in the most dynamic and productive way, and it is probably reasonable to observe that their reaction to the programme proposals has received an unusual level of publicity.  The chairman of ACC Bank has assured me that the board and management of the bank are fully conscious that it is entirely a matter for the Government to decide on the future of ACC Bank, and that whatever decision the Government takes will have their full co-operation and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a long list of the people he met in connection with the pledge contained in the Programme for Government.  Has he met any representatives of the commercial banks or been lobbied by anybody representing the commercial banks?  Is he aware that, so far as the commercial banks are concerned, the notion of a third banking force is a dead duck?  Can he confirm that the Labour Party programme managers are currently fighting a rearguard action to keep the idea alive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not met anyone from the commercial banks on this issue. Although I meet people from the commercial banks practically every day, I have not been lobbied by them.  I do not know where Deputy Rabbitte got the notion that programme managers or anybody else are fighting a rearguard action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Department of Finance has decided that an end ought to be put to the notion of a <Col N="656" /> third banking force, that that is the formal position of his Department and that it arises from direct discussions with and representations from the high street banks who are, effectively, operating a cartel?  I believe most consumers would welcome the competition that would result from the emergence of a third banking force, not to mention the developmental role it might have in industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what view the commercial banks take of the idea of a third banking force.  I suppose everyone fears competition but I am sure they would be concerned about the structure the Government might come up with. Some of the banks that the Deputy would consider to be high street banks would be very interested in the proposal in the Programme for Government.  I have continue during the year to outline that to anyone who is seriously interested in putting forward views on how the proposal might best be implemented and on how we can best enhance competition, which is needed in the banking system.  In the interests of improving the performance of the economy and preserving and creating employment I have listened to their views and will continue to do so.  It is my job to bring a memorandum to Government in due course laying out the options and recommending what is best for the economy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not come clean with his Labour Party colleagues? Will he stop playing ducks and drakes with them and tell them that this is a non-runner and should not have been included in the Programme for Government, that the ACC and the Trustee Savings Bank have said that they will not participate in a super State bank and that if any commercial rationale could be made for a third bank it need not be in the State sector but could involve one of the growing building societies or an international bank with a holding in Ireland and that there is no need for us to pursue this ideological agenda?  Will <Col N="657" /> the Minister not come clean and kindly but definitely drop the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal as outlined in the Programme for Government can be interpreted in many ways.  The bottom line is to get a more competitive banking system.  ACC has put forward proposals on how we can do that.  Trustee Savings Bank has been more reluctant to do so.  ICC has put forward proposals, as have other banking institutions both inside and outside the State.  The Government will ultimately make a decision based on the options that come to the fore in the course of those discussions.</P>

      <P>It is crucial that the Minister recognises and says clearly today that there is no competition in the banking sector, for the reasons that Deputy Rabbitte has given.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I was one of the negotiators of the programme.  I believe that the banking system in this State could well do with competition.  That is a view held by some of the major banks and by some of the State banks and most of the business public in the country. How best to implement that is a matter for discussion.  Deputy Rabbitte would know better than most that the reason the staff interests in ICC and ACC are against the proposal as outlined in the Programme for Government is that if just those two banks move together it could create massive redundancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 56 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain at the outset that the Irish Stock Exchange is part of a wider entity know as the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited.</P>
      <P>The investigation into the Greencore placing has, as a result, involved both the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges. The Irish Stock Exchange announced on 6 May 1993 that it had commenced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the placing of the Government stake in Greencore plc.  This particular investigation was carried out by staff of the surveillance division of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited and staff of the Irish Stock Exchange.  In accordance with Stock Exchange rules, a report on this investigation was, I understand, considered by the committee of the Irish Stock Exchange on 2 July last and this was then submitted for consideration by the Professional Standards Panel in London which is the next stage in the process.  It is the function of the Professional Standards Panel to determine whether or not, on the basis of the facts disclosed by investigations and subject to the availability of sufficient evidence, the bringing of charges under disciplinary rules is appropriate to uphold proper professional standards.  The report was not made available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures to be followed by the Professional Standards Panel and related bodies of the Stock Exchange are laid down in Stock Exchange rules.  Under these rules, the proceedings of the panel and other Stock Exchange bodies in disciplinary matters are confidential and are not disclosable by the Exchange unless and until a decision is taken to censure, suspend or expel a member firm or the firm consents to disclosure.  I understand <Col N="660" /> that this is to avoid prejudicing the position of a party under investigation.</P>
    <P>As to the length of time which the investigation has taken, I would emphasise that the decision to carry out the investigation was made independently by the Stock Exchange.  It would not be appropriate, nor is it open to me, to question the duration of the investigation. As I have indicated, a report was in the hands of the Irish Stock Exchange less than two months after it was initiated.  The decision on whether or not to take any further step is entirely a matter for the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>The separate investigation by the Attorney General was conducted by him, in his capacity as legal adviser to the Government, to review the factual circumstances of the placing from a legal point of view and to advise me.  The Attorney General has furnished me with his report and advice.  Such advice is confidential of its very nature and I do not wish to prejudice the ongoing Stock Exchange investigation by making any comment on matters touching upon the Attorney General's advice.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would remind the Deputies that the Exchequer suffered no loss whatsoever in the placing and that the full proceeds of £69,872,460, based on the sale of all 25.4 million shares at 275p per share, were lodged with the Exchequer on 17 May.  In addition, fees amounting to £725,000 in connection with the placing were waived by Davy Stockbrokers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify a number of issues?  He has already responded to questions in this House on the matter.  He has told us that having received this report he intends to present its key findings to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were policy recommendations outlined in this report or did the Government arrive at any decisions?  If so, what are they?  The Dáil was clearly led to believe the matter would be presented to Government and that, presumably, some action would be taken.  Will the Minister say what action was taken?  In relation to the International Stock Exchange the <Col N="661" /> Minister said the report has not been made available to him and that it is confidential while the due process takes place.  Does the Minister intend to ask for the report to be made available and has he any indication as to when the process will reach its ultimate conclusion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General report which was prepared at the request of the Government results from an inquiry into the legal handling of the placing of shares on the day in question. There are no recommendations in that report but the required action was taken by the Department.  I originally thought we would receive a report from the Stock Exchange but that would involve a long international procedure involving three bodies: the surveillance division to which I referred in my reply, the professional standards and the disciplinary committee. All stages must go through due process before a matter is publicised.  The Stock Exchange indicated that if a firm is censured, suspended or expelled, with or without a fine, publication is mandatory. It there is a lesser fine the matter does not necessarily have to be made public except at the request of the firm concerned who may wish the proceedings to be made public.  If the board of the Stock Exchange considers it necessary to warn members of some matter this procedure would not apply because everyone would know who is under investigation. In the normal way a finding might be issued regarding practice without mentioning names.</P>
      <P>There was much comment during the summer that the investigation was not continuing.  On the contrary, the investigation continued throughout the summer and my officials and others were questioned at length by the Stock Exchange surveillance division.  It examined the data and questioned everybody involved and I am sure it has done the same with the other partners concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a report was dispatched to a journalist who writes for a Sunday newspaper <Col N="662" /> which, conveniently and unsurprisingly, absolves the Department of Finance from blame in this affair but suggests that the brokers concerned may have broken a number of Stock Exchange rules and may have been guilty of breach of confidence and trust in the dealings of the Minister? Will the Minister comment on that matter?  Will he say whether, when the official Stock Exchange inquiry is complete, the report of the Attorney General will be published and made available to the Members of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much comment and speculation regarding this matter during the summer months.  I read many articles on the matter, none of which fully reflects the contents of the Attorney General's report, the only report I have seen on the matter.  The report contains the legal advice of the Attorney General to Government, and normally, such advice is not made public. It will be a matter for the Government to decide whether to publish the report when the inquiry is finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not unsatisfactory that five months after this affair the House is still unable on the basis of any official investigation to comment on the issues concerned, which were the subject of a special debate in this House?  Why are we still waiting for the conclusion of the inquiry of the Stock Exchange?  Does the Minister accept it is time to brush aside some of the mystery surrounding its workings?  Is he contemplating the introduction of legislation for the independent monitoring and control of this area since, manifestly, the controls that exist for self-regulation are inadequate, as exposed in the Greencore affair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not criticise a procedure that is internationally practised by the Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange is taking this investigation very seriously and a great amount of time was devoted to it throughout the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about taking <Col N="663" /> the matter seriously the Stock Exchange is taking a very long time to conclude its inquiry.  It left the Minister holding the baby and now he comes in here five months later and defends it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte knows better than most people in the House, tribunals and inquiries take a long time to complete their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe there is need for transparency in this area in view of the legislation he mentioned which will separate Dublin from London in terms of a future Stock Exchange control authority?  There must be the utmost credibility in this regard.  In view of the fact that the shares concerned were owned by the taxpayer and that the Minister said in the special debate referred to by Deputy Rabbitte there would be the fullest level of disclosure as to what happened with Warburg and so on, is the Minister now saying there will be no report and no disclosure?  Finally, does the Minister not feel as sick as a parrot in that he could not sell the shares at £2.75 while some weeks later the Bank of Ireland could sell seven million shares at £3 each?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the matter again with Deputy Yates.  I would be very happy if I could take the easy option and publish the report but there is practice and precedent in these matters. I will shortly bring forward the Stock Exchange legislation and the House will then have an opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the substance, if not the <Col N="664" /> full content of the Attorney General's report, been made available through him or his officials to the International Stock Exchange inquiry?  In view of the grave embarrassment to the Minister personally and his Department in the selling of the residual Greencore shares, has the Minister concluded any policy in relation to future dealings with the firm in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined earlier the policy decisions taken by me and the Department of Finance.  The report was not made available.  In fairness to the Stock Exchange, which has emphasised it is treating the investigation with the utmost seriousness, it would be unacceptable to publish what is an internal Government report by the Attorney General.  The inquiry has twice examined all papers and relevant matters.  Most of the data available to the Attorney General and his colleagues in their examination have also been examined by the International Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he proposes to introduce legislation to regulate the Stock Exchange.  Is he aware that on 8 July 1992 he promised the Dáil he would introduce this legislation in autumn 1992?  What is the reason for the delay in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The system used in breaking the link with the UK Stock Exchange, in which vast amounts of money were invested, went off the rails during 1992.  The system and format now being used is very different from that used then.  From a UK point of view, this meant that much of the work done over many years had to be effectively disregarded. It also meant a change of track for us.  Having regard to this and other matters, I will continue to try to bring forward the legislation as soon as possible.</P>

On 10 February 1993 the Government promised it would introduce legislation to govern consumer credit.  At present people are being ripped off by moneylenders and there is no control.  The Government has been in breach of EC legislation since the beginning of this year due to the failure of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to enact this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Fourth Additional Protocol to the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union and other Acts signed by the Irish delegation at the Twentieth Congress of the Universal Postal Union at Washington on 14th December, 1989, copies of which were</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> laid before Dáil Éireann on 27th August, 1993.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The subject matter of this resolution is quite technical, but I am advised that Dáil approval is necessary.</P>
    <P>Following the approval of the Dáil, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will arrange for ratification by Ireland of the Additional Protocol and other Acts.</P>
    <P>The Universal Postal Union (UPU) was founded in 1874 as a result of the Treaty of Berne, which established the first collective convention covering the international postal service.  It came into being as a result of the inability of the existing bilateral agreements to cope with the increasing social, business and administrative demands being placed on the international postal service.  The UPU became a specialised agency of the United Nations in 1948 and there are now 185 members.  Ireland became a member in 1923.</P>
    <P>The basic rules of the UPU provide for (a) the formation among all member countries of a single postal territory for the reciprocal exchange of letter-post items; (b) guaranteed freedom of transit within the territory of the union; (c) standardisation of the charges to be collected by each country for letter-post items addressed to any part of the union's territory; (d) arrangements for intra-administration payments for the handling of letter-post items; (e) the institution of an arbitration procedure to settle disputes between administrations; (f) the creation of a central office, called the international bureau, the cost of which is borne by all member countries and (g) periodic meetings of a congress of plenipotentiaries of the member countries, with a view to revising the Acts of the union and discussing questions of common interest.</P>
    <P>The basic Act of the UPU is its constitution, adopted in 1964.  This can be amended only at the congress (the supreme organ of the UPU), by means of additional Protocols.</P>
    <P>These Additional Protocols were adopted in 1969, 1974 and 1978, and the Fourth Additional Protocol, which is the <Col N="766" /> subject of the present resolution, was adopted in Washington in 1989.</P>
    <P>In addition to the constitution, other basic Acts of the UPU are binding on all its members.  These are, the general regulations to which are annexed, the various internal rules of procedure etc. and the Universal Postal Convention.  In practice, these are re-issued in an amended form by each congress.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Acts, to which all UPU members subscribe, there are several optional Acts governing services, other than the letter post service, for example, on giros or on parcels.  Ireland has subscribed to the Postal Parcels Agreement.  This too was amended by the Washington Congress in 1989 by issuing a modified text to replace the previous text.</P>
    <P>The full texts of the constitution and general regulations, the Convention and the Postal Parcels Agreement, as revised by the Washington Congress, have been placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>Congresses are held every five years. The complexity of international postal operations is reflected in the fact that the published texts of the Acts of the Congress run to more than 1,400 pages, mostly of a technical or administrative character.  Although bulky and complex, the texts contain mainly revisions of existing Acts, according to procedures set out in the constitution and other Acts in force.</P>
    <P>The principal amendments to the UPU constitution contained in the Fourth Additional Protocol are as follows: replacement of the gold franc by the International Monetary Fund, Special Drawing Right (SDR) as the official currency of the UPU, and as the monetary unit for settlement of international postal accounts; deposit of instruments of accession or admission to the UPU with the Director General of the union's international bureau, rather than with the Swiss Government, as heretofore and deposit of instruments of ratification of the constitution, the Additional Protocols thereto and of approval of the other Acts of the union, with the director general of the international bureau rather <Col N="767" /> than with the Swiss Government as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Other Acts adopted at the Washington Congress in 1989 are: amendments to the general regulations of the UPU; amendments to the Universal Postal Convention and amendments to the Postal Parcels Agreement.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the details of these amendments may be found in the documents presented to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Irish postal service is governed by the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Acts, 1983 and 1984 and earlier legislation. The 1983 Act established An Post and section 12 thereof gave the company statutory responsibility for the provision of a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State.  Implementation of the obligations of the UPU Acts does not present any problems and is on-going in nature under the provisions of existing legislation or by administrative measures.  We are satisfied that An Post is fully aware of the obligations imposed by the UPU Acts and that the company is complying with these obligations.</P>
    <P>So far as financial aspects of our membership of the UPU are concerned, under the UPU Constitution and General Regulations, the UPU expenses are borne by the member countries.</P>
    <P>Each member country may choose the contribution class in which it wishes to be included, with the exception of the lowest class, which is reserved for the least developed nations.  A member country may reduce its contribution class by one step only at a time and must notify the International Bureau of the UPU, before the opening of Congress.  It takes effect on the entry into force of the financial provisions drawn up by Congress.</P>
    <P>Ireland notified its wish to move from the 10-unit class to the 5-unit class, which seems more in keeping with Ireland's size and scale of operations.  As a result of this, Ireland's contribution to the UPU budget was reduced from 249,000 Swiss Francs for 1990, to 155,300 Swiss Francs, approximately IR£75,000, for 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Payment of Ireland's contribution does not fall on the Exchequer as payment has been delegated to An Post.  This delegation is in line with the practice whereby financial obligations in terms of payments to other postal administrations in respect of international postal traffic operations are discharged from the revenues of An Post.  Likewise, financial benefits, in terms of receipts from other postal administrations for international operations, are brought to account in the revenues of An Post.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Resolution to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not know whether the Minister was fortunate enough to have attended on the previous occasion but I am sure he will have another opportunity to do so and wish him well in is travels.  I do not think the time of the House need be delayed unduly with this motion.  While there were claims made in the course of the Minister's introductory remarks as to the great work conducted by the Universal Postal Union at their five-yearly congresses &mdash; to show the significance the Minister metioned something like 1,400 decisions having been taken at the last one and gave us a sample of those decisions in the text of his remarks &mdash; I must say that the world would still have spun round and the cocks crowed in the morning had none of those decisions been taken.  Indeed the replacement of the gold franc, which I presume was Swiss, by settlements by the International Monetary Fund as the present method <Col N="769" /> for regularising monetary transactions between members, while very interesting for them, I do not consider to be of much relevance.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is obliged to bring these matters before the House but, while thanking him, I do not think it has a lot of relevance to the conduct of business, the delivery of letters, the delivery of parcels, indeed to the kind of counter services provided daily in our post offices.  I should like either the Minister or the Minister of State to return to this House at an early date so that we can have a debate on An Post.  The Minister's Department is a high profile one.  Over the past six months we have been concerned with An Post's sister company, Telecom Éireann, and the question of telephone charges.  Another section of the Minister's Department has been rivited by the various to-ings and fro-ings in Aer Lingus.  While there are a number of State bodies responsible to the Minister and his Minister of State, An Post seems to have escaped public scrutiny in recent times.  I cannot recall an occasion within the past six months when there was a serious debate in this House on An Post. Neither can I recall an occasion when either the Minister or his Minister of State issued a statement of policy in relation to An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister &mdash; he may reply now or at a later date &mdash; where An Post stands now?  Is it commercially viable?  Does the Minister believe it is fulfilling its functions in accordance with the provisions of the 1983 and 1984 Acts to the fullest of its ability?  Is the level of service being provided by An Post as good as it was when removed from the Department of Communications in 1983 and converted into a semi-State body? Many of the complaints crossing my desk would suggest that it is not.  I receive many complaints about delays in delivery of letters.  When we think of An Post we think of it in the first instance as the organisation which delivers the mail. Indeed the delivery of the mail is not as efficient as it was in that letters posted in Dublin do not always arrive in country areas the following day.  I have had <Col N="770" /> experience when letters were posted in this House in bulk &mdash; a Deputy might post 150 or 200 letters &mdash; of a percentage having arrived the following day, a percentage the day after and some not arriving for a week or so.  The Minister must at an early date give us accurate information on the efficiency levels of An Post.  The conventional wisdom among consumers is that their efficiency levels are slipping. I should like the Minister to refer to parcel post.  There is a widespread belief that An Post cannot compete with private courier services, that their market is being eroded daily, that very little action is being taken by An Post to rectify that or compete in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Very often we think of An Post as the agency that runs the national lottery.  I do not want to talk about the national lottery today.  I should like to ask whether it is still considered in Government that An Post should participate in some kind of third banking force.  Is there a suggestion that An Post will form the cutting edge in the High Street outlets for a third banking force.  Have discussions been carried out in that respect?  Is it simply political gossip for which there is no basis?  Many of the Minister's colleagues in Government suggest that they would be an appropriate third partner in such a force.  It is not clear where An Post stands.</P>
    <P>What is the position of workers in An Post?  Are their jobs secure?  Are there continuing plans for removing 2,000 or 3,000 workers?  What is the position of rural post offices, 2,000 of them sentenced by the former Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan?  He half withdrew from that proposal.  It was then reinstated on the agenda.  At present small post offices are being closed surreptitiously without any announcement.  What is the plan? What is the policy?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will not have an opportunity today to reply in detail to the points I make.  While agreeing to the motion in respect of the Universal Postal Union, there are far more relevant matters in connection with the postal services we should be discussing in this House.  I would ask the Minister to give <Col N="771" /> us an opportunity to discuss these matters at a very early date.  Initially I am seeking a statement of policy on the part of the Minister explaining where he thinks An Post is at present and where he thinks it is going in terms of commercial viability and providing services for its customers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this motion to approve the terms of the Fourth Additional Protocol to the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union signed by Ireland in Washington on 14 December 1989.  What is contained in the Protocol and the various other amendments is not of much importance.  It is a fairly obvious development that might take place to reflect changing circumstances in the world as a whole.</P>
      <P>This motion affords us a brief opportunity to pose a number of questions in regard to postal services and their future. The situation has changed very dramatically in the past ten or 15 years and, indeed, has changed since the Act of 1983, which governs our postal system. It is an opportune time to ask where we go from now in regard to postal services. They are much less important than they would have been in the past and this trend will continue as fewer communications of any significance pass through the post.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has spent time in the US will be aware that about 90 per cent of what goes through the postal system there is junk mail, that is unsolicited nuisance as far as the receipients are concerned, plus non-urgent communications of one kind or another.  Does the United States, Ireland or any other country in the Universal Postal Union have to provide a structure or a service that will facilitate the delivery of unsolicited and unwanted junk mail?  It is time to ask whether that is really necessary.  Virtually all communications of importance is sent by fax or by electronic mail.  That is likely to be used to an even greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where particular services can be provided from private sources which are of a satisfactory nature, it should not be necessary for the State to provide them. That applies to parcels etc. both here and <Col N="772" /> internationally.  The vast majority of the more important international parcels and packages are sent by private transport companies and couriers.  It strikes me as particularly odd that at least two State bodies are in direct competition with one another in providing exactly the same service, in relation to the dispatch of packages and parcels, An Post and Iarnród Éireann.  It would appear that both are losing money partly by virtue of being in competition with one another. Is that not competition at the expense of the taxpayer or the user of postal services? We should remind ourselves that even though the efficiency of the postal service is decreasing its cost is one of the highest in the world.  It is a pity that our postal services are so much more expensive than in the neighbouring jurisdiction and certainly they are not any more efficient than there.</P>
    <P>Because the post office has existed for a long time we assume it will continue to exist for all time in that form.  I have not seen any rethinking in relation to the Post Office Savings Bank which in the past provided a useful service, especially for people in rural areas.  With the proliferation of banking outlets, the ease of transmission of money and the fact that cash is used to a far lesser extent one wonders whether the way things were done 50 years ago is necessarily the best way to operate now.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that the time is opportune for a major debate on the future of the postal services.  Ireland has no problems in terms of its international relations in regard to postal services and the Universal Postal Union.  I am intrigued to find that Ireland removed itself from what is called the ten-unit class to the five-unit class in 1989.  I am sure that is the only time we have voluntarily demoted ourselves in any sphere.  If it does not make any difference, perhaps the Minister would consider demoting us further to the one-unit class so that we might have to pay even less Swiss francs. This must be the only international organisation on record where our contribution goes down rather than up.  I congratulate the Universal Postal Union <Col N="773" /> on being in such a unique situation.  I am glad we do not have notions of grandeur beyond our station, so far as the Universal Postal Union is concerned.  Perhaps we should demote ourselves from the Waldorf Astoria class to some one star or two star class in respect of some of our other international relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputies Noonan and O'Malley who have contributed so positively to this motion on the Universal Postal Union.  I also take this opportunity to wish Deputy O'Malley well in his future life, political and otherwise.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the outset the Fourth Additional Protocol to the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union &mdash; the UPU &mdash; and other Acts which were signed by the Irish delegation at the Twentieth Congress of the union held at Washington in 1989 are largely of a technical and detailed revisory character and in accordance with normal practice the acts are already in operation in all UPU member countries.  There are no staffing or financial implications for Ireland arising from these Acts other than Ireland's financial contribution of approximately £75,000 to the annual budget of the UPU which is paid on an ongoing basis by An Post.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that An Post is fully aware of the obligations imposed by the UPU Acts and that the company is complying with these obligations.  In reference to what Deputy O'Malley said about relegating ourselves into a particular class, the reason was our demographic situation and the volume of business handled in Ireland in comparison with larger countries.  Obviously we had to enter the league most suitable to our size.  If it is possible to reduce our contribution further I am sure An Post will see to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the issues raised in this debate by both Deputies are of a general nature <Col N="774" /> relating to An Post.  I will respond to them and if Deputies are not satisfied there is no need for me to advise them as to how they can deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>An Post's level of performance is one of the best in the European Community with delivery of 93 per cent to 95 per cent of letters on the next day following posting.  To improve further on the quality of service offered to its customers, An Post is introducing a number of operational and organisational changes, including counter services.  An Post is in the process of providing modern computerised counter equipment in 600 of its large post offices nationwide at a cost of £36 million.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's national plan included an allocation of funding to assist with that. The introduction of these systems will be phased over the next four years, 1993 to 1996, at approximately 150 offices per year.  When completed they will cater for over 80 per cent of all customers.  The offices will be connected by a telecommunications network to An Post's central system and also to those of the Department of Social Welfare and other utilities.  Initially, the system will cater for a limited range of products, namely social welfare payments, Savings Bank and savings and investments products, money transmission and bill payment. Through its &ldquo;Transcash&rdquo; product, An Post provides bill payment services for Telecom Éireann, Cablelink, Gas Companies, Thorn EMI, Mercantile Credit, UDT, Woodchester, Concern and Trócaire. Over time, the system will be extended to cover all products and services provided at post offices counters.</P>
    <P>In determining its strategy for counter business in the nineties, An Post clearly saw that rising costs and antiquated methods of handling transactions were putting its business under threat and preventing it from attracting new products and services.  Competitors were using modern technology to provide better customer service at lower costs and were systematically eroding the business base.  In deciding to make a radical overhaul of the way in which the company provided counter services, it was supported <Col N="775" /> by its two main agency customers, the Department of Social Welfare and the National Management Treasure Agency which negotiated commercial contracts with the company which partly funded the cost of this major computerisation project.</P>
    <P>Currently the systems operate in 20 post offices and this number will be extended to over 100 by the end of this year.  The new systems, which are of the most modern design, have attracted considerable interest, particularly in the United Kingdom, where post offices systems are being examined.  An Post have had visits already from UK Department of Social Security officials and from senior managers of UK Post Office Counters Limited.  Everybody was very impressed with the quality of our system and the excellent working relationship between An Post and major agency customers.</P>
    <P>The second change to be made is in Dublin's Mail Centre, where An Post has built a modern letter mail sorting centre, adjacent to the Western Parkway in Dublin to replace the existing outdated central sorting office in Sheriff Street. The project involved expenditure of £15 million.  The Dublin Mail Centre is scheduled to commence operation on 24 October 1993.  It will provide automation and computerisation of letter sorting through the use of optical character readers and video encoding techniques.  By adopting one of the most advanced sorting systems in the world, An Post's objective is to contain costs and pass on the benefit to customers by minimising prices and maintaining high standards of service now and in the future.</P>
    <P>There are developments in international services.  An Post is also active in taking action to improve quality of service in the cross-Border areas, particularly as cross-Border letter mail accounts for 28 per cent of the total letter mail handled, compared to an EC average of 7 per cent.  The company has concluded quality of service agreements for that purpose with its major trading partners, <Col N="776" /> for example, the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and the US. In addition, An Post is participating with three other European Community postal administrations, the UK, France and Germany in the European Communities assisted CAPE project involving the development of an electronic track and trace facility for international letter mail dispatches.</P>
    <P>I hope this information is of assistance to the Deputies in putting in context the commitment by An Post management, our Department and the Government to ensuring that An Post perform as a very efficient State agency, comparable to any other similar agency in the European Community and deliver the service to which we all aspire and to which the consumer is entitled.</P>
    <P>Finally let me thank the Deputies for their positive contribution and for agreeing to this motion.</P>

The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and others who were members of that committee will recall we had a very good and long discussion on Committee Stage and that many of the difficulties we had with the Bill were ironed out on that occasion.  The Minister was very forthcoming in facilitating us about any worries we expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now resubmit this amendment on Report Stage because despite, assurances from the Minister on Committee Stage, which he also gave to representatives of the Irish Meteorological Service, there is still great unease in the met service about the implications of this Bill.  The amendment proposes that nothing in this Bill or in any Order or other instrument under the Bill when enacted will prejudice or affect the functions of the Irish Meteorological Service as they stood at the time of its enactment.  When I moved this before, the Minister said that such an amendment was superfluous because it was not his intention to take any steps that would affect the functions of the Irish Meteorological Service.  He told us also on Committee Stage that he had met members of the staff association, which represents the officers of that service, and had given them similar assurances which they had accepted.  Unfortunately, things have since changed.  Air Traffic Control at <Col N="778" /> Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports have purchased meteorological equipment, which has no function other than use for meteorological purposes.  They have purchased barometric equipment made in Finland to measure pressure at airports but this work has been carried out since 1937 by the Irish Meteorological Service. It must be more than a coincidence that as this Bill proceeds through Committee to Report Stage that Air Traffic Control at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports have invested in equipment which they never needed previously and whose only function is to give pressure readings for landings and takeoffs, a service which was always provided by the Irish Meteorological Service.</P>
    <P>It seems that the assurances given by the Minister are no longer extant and that the assurances given to the staff association involved are not worth very much. It is very unfair that Members of this House should have been given solemn assurances, written into the record, and a staff association given similar guarantees but, as soon as Committee Stage is over, another agency, the ATC, which will be involved with the Irish Aviation Authority, will take steps to move into the professional area of another service.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to put the issue beyond doubt and, rather than asking people who feel let down by him to rely on his assurances, to accept my amendment and put it into the text of the Bill so that there is no possibility of functions which have been traditionally carried out by the met service being carried out by ATC.</P>
    <P>This is one of their profitable functions. I understand the met service costs about £10 million but they recover approximately £4 million by providing this service at airports.  Other services provided by the Irish Meteorological Service cannot show a profit.  In any country the meteorological service must provide an early warning system to alert the public about storms and bad weather.  They must provide a service at harvest time to farmers, to those who want to take a weekend break or to visiting tourists.  It seems to be an extraordinarily bad service <Col N="779" /> if what is profitable is removed from its remit while at the same time it will continue to provide a full meteorological service in the lost making areas which are still part of its mandate.  I am very surprised that this has happened and I appeal to the Minister to allay the fears of the workers in the Irish Meteorological Service by accepting this amendment and putting the issue beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Even if it is unnecessary that the Bill be amended in this way, acceptance of the amendment would do no harm as it represents the Minister's intent.  Because of the purchaase of barometric equipment by Air Traffic Control at three of our airports, those who serve in the met service no longer believe the Minister's assurances.  The Minister will have to go further and amend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Noonan and, as he stated, we debated this matter at great length on Committee Stage.  We are all moved by the concern of the Meteorological Service about such barometers and I have investigated the matter in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of barometers, I must put the technical position in context. Every aircraft must have an altimeter which tells the pilot the height at which he or she is flying.  Altimeters are set on barometric pressure which varies constantly with the weather.  It is the responsibility of the Meteorological Service to inform air traffic control of the barometric pressure and air traffic controllers then pass the information to pilots.  There were industrial relations problems in the Meteorological Service last year during which time officials of the service did not supply barometric pressure readings to air traffic control. Failure to supply barometric pressure readings for aircraft in flight is a highly dangerous and irresponsible action.  In the circumstances ANSO devised a stopgap measure whereby Aer Lingis pilots sat on aircraft in Dublin Airport and advised air traffic controllers of the values on the aircraft barometer.  To avoid a recurrence of that action, ANSO purchased <Col N="780" /> barometers which can be used if the Meteorological Service cannot, or refuses to, supply such essential barometric readings.</P>
    <P>Under the Chicago Convention each state undertakes, as far as practicable, to provide meteorological services and other air navigation facilities.  Annex III to that convention sets out the State's obligation in respect of meteorological services.  Under the convention each State must designate the meteorological authority which will provide meteorological services for international air navigation. In Ireland that authority is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and authority is exercised on his behalf by the Irish Meteorological Service.  The Irish Aviation Authority Bill excludes the authority from responsibility from meteorological services and places such responsibility with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Aviation Authority will transmit meteorological service information to aircraft and will require such information to carry out its own air traffic control responsibilities.  However, the Irish Aviation Authority cannot operate an independent meteorological service.  Neither can it buy in such services from abroad. If it tries to do so the Minister has the power to prevent this and I have no doubt he would do so.  While I appreciate the concerns of those employed in the meteorological service, this Bill focuses on the authority, what it will be, what it will do, the powers it will have and the general framework of ministerial authority under which it will operate.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, the proposed amendment is a redundant provision that would confuse rather than clarify the position.  This matter has been discussed with the Attorney General and I have taken the best advice possible.  I am satisfied with the way the Bill is framed.  The fact that Annex III of the Chicago Convention is not part of the schedule to this Bill means that the Irish Meteorological Service will remain under the control of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Under the provisions of the Bill the Minister will <Col N="781" /> have the power to direct the Irish Aviation Authority at any time to carry out specific functions or to avail of specific services.  By placing the responsibility with the Minister, the power rests with him to protect the interests of the Irish Meteorological Service, Irish and international passengers travelling to and from this country and the taxpayer who, at the end of the day, funds the meteorological service and, initially, the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Noonan's interest in this matter, but I have had exhaustive discussions and I am satisfied this is the proper procedure.  I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill will protect the Irish Meteorological Service to a greater extent by the exclusion of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do something uncharacteristic on this occasion and support Deputy Noonan on this matter.  I met a deputation from the Irish Meteorological Service at Shannon Airport and assured them that their fears were groundless because of the Minister's reply on Committee Stage.  I told them that there was no necessity for them to meet me again in regard to the matter.  I raised the issue with my parliamentary party and spoke to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, on the matter. When I met the deputation from the meteorological service at Shannon Airport I told them that there was no need to be concerned because I was satisfied the Minister would take on board the comments made on Committee Stage.  I met another deputation yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan has not exaggerated workers' concerns in this matter.  Those are not fledgling workers, but workers who have given a long service to the Irish Meteorological Service.  They comprise people from all grades in the service and they would not seek a meeting with me to discuss immature or unreasonable concerns. They are responsible and respectable people and are very concerned about this matter.  The point made by Deputy Noonan reflects the concerns of those <Col N="782" /> people.  I have been put in an awkward position because I told them their fears were groundless following the Committee Stage debate.  I did not wish to mislead them, but I believed I was reflecting the consensus expressed on Committee Stage.  I believed the Minister understood the concerns expressed.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to reflect on what is contained in Deputy Noonan's amendment because those concerns have not been expressed for emotional purposes or to indulge in histrionics.  People have worked in the meteorological service for many years. They believe their position is threatened by the provisions of this Bill.  I am sure that was not the intention of the Minister or his colleagues in framing the legislation. The Minister must have regard for people who have given a loyal service to the State and contributed their intelligence and skills to the meteorological service.  We should have regard for those who have made a substantial contribution to our society and economy.  I do not always agree with Deputy Noonan, but what he said reflects the feelings of the deputation I met yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Kemmy for his support on this matter.  We all accepted the assurances of the Minister on Committee Stage and I communicated those assurances to the delegation I met from the meteorological service, many of whom are my constituents. Those people now feel let down because the Minister's assurances no longer stand.  At Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports air traffic control officers have purchased barometric equipment to give pressure readings, an essential service provided at present by the meteorological service at airports and a service which is absolutely necessary for the safe landing and take-off of aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister assured us on Committee Stage that none of the professional functions carried out by officers of the meteorological service would be affected by the introduction of this Bill.  He expects us to believe now that it is merely a coincidence &mdash; a downstream effect &mdash;<Col N="783" /> of an industrial dispute last year which resulted in air traffic controllers purchasing equipment to conduct pressure readings, the main reason for which meteorological officers are employed at airports in the first place.  I note the Minister's official is shaking his head.  We all realise that pilots will wish to know weather forecasts before take off, but that service does not have to be provided at Shannon.  Such a service can be provided by fax from Dublin.  They can locate in Dublin and give weather projections for the North Atlantic as aircraft take off.  The service which requires them to be on the spot is pressure readings at airports.  There are 31 people who provide a service in Shannon airport and when this function is removed they will not be needed in Shannon; they could be located in Limerick, Dublin or other cities and provide other services for civil aviation.  It is not good enough on Report Stage to say this is nothing more than a coincidence.  The Minister changed his explanation.  He assured us on Committee Stage that the functions carried out by the meteorological service would continue to be carried out by it.  He now says that matters such as the safety of aircrafts are vested in the Minister, not in the new Aviation Authority, and that he may decide as he sees fit to ask air traffic control to carry out pressure readings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that as a safety net in times of an industrial dispute, functions carried out by the meteorological service traditionally since 1937 may in future be carried out by officers at air traffic control through the use of the barometric equipment they recently purchased.  On Committee Stage the Minister said there was no possibility of functions being transferred but now he has changed his position and said that in certain circumstances functions can be transferred at the discretion of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  That is not the assurance he gave the House on Committee Stage.  I am disappointed we were misled.  We co-operated with the Minister on Committee Stage and relayed his <Col N="784" /> assurances to the people we represent but today he gave an equally strong assurance, in different terms, that the Minister has the power to transfer functions but will not exercise it.  The barometric equipment which reads pressure at the airports must be individually calibrated for each airport.  It is not a case of buying the box and plugging it in and if the equipment in Shannon breaks down one can send to Dublin or Finland for equipment. The Minister's explanation does not provide the fail safe mechanism he purports it gives.  If the equipment is lying idle for years, is only used in the case of an industrial dispute in the meteorological service and does not function, it is not a case of replacing it with other equipment, it must be calibrated again. I understand the only people who can calibrate equipment are officers of the meteorological service.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  He says it is a redundant amendment which adds nothing to the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to give the assurance requestd by the people in the meteorological service because intentionally or not his explanation has misled them.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Before making an order or regulation, or giving a direction (other than a direction to the company),&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> This is a drafting amendment.  The intention is to make the subsection clearer and simpler; it does not change the sense of the section in any way.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Before making an order under section 15 or 58 (2) or an order amending or revoking such an order, the Minister shall cause a draft of the order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill sets the framework within which orders and regulations may be made by the Minister and the company. Originally it was intended that all orders made by the Minister and the company would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and would come into effect unless they were annulled.  On Committee Stage various Deputies expressed concern that orders, particularly those requiring the exercise of political judgment, should be subject to active rather than passive parliamentary scrutiny.  They put the case that such orders should require an affirmative resolution of each House of the Oireachtas. I have carefully considered the views put forward and I agree there are circumstances in which it would be proper to seek the specific approval of the Oireachtas.  If it is intended to give the company new powers or responsibilities, that should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I have proposed provides that when the Minister makes an order conferring additional functions on the Authority or adding to the number of annexes to the Chicago Convention for which the Authority has responsibility, that order must be <Col N="788" /> approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Orders for either of these purposes will represent substantial change and expression in the remit we are giving to the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>Other orders made by the Minister and the Authority under this Bill will be of a technical and administrative nature and do not need to be debated by the Oireachtas.  Such orders cover highly technical matters such as the air-worthiness of aircraft.  It is not intended that these technical orders should be debated or require affirmative action by the Oireachtas.  Thus these technical orders will be laid before each House and will have effect unless they are annulled within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>We must look at the bigger picture. A major development for the Authority would be if it were to be assigned some new functions or given responsibility for annexes to the Chicago Convention which are not listed in the Schedule to the Bill.  These are substantial changes and ones I believe should be subject to affirmation by the Oireachtas.  I am, accordingly, putting forward this amendment to meet the requests made on Committee Stage by various Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. The Minister of State is adopting the right approach.  If we had more provisions of this kind it would be an improvement.  Some significant orders could be made under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we did not get the amendments until this morning and for most of the day I have been otherwise engaged.  Therefore I have not had an opportunity to study them.  Will the Minister of State briefly outline again the orders that are covered under sections 15 and 58?  Perhaps it should not be confined to sections 15 and 58 only; there may be other significant orders.  Perhaps it is too late to consider it now but it could be considered in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be prudent to leave responsibility for certain annexes to the Chicago Convention with various Ministers.  For example, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication will retain responsibility for the Meteorological Service.  If Annex III were to be included we would hand the responsibility to the Authority.</P>
      <P>Annex IX &mdash; facilitation &mdash; has also been left out.  This annex sets out the standards and procedures that states have agreed to apply in authorising the entry and departure of aircraft from their territory and dealing with passengers, air baggage and cargo.  These procedures cover such matters as aircraft documents, passports and customs checks and health requirements.  We feel this is a matter for the State rather than the Authority.</P>
      <P>In regard to Annex XII &mdash; search and rescue &mdash; the Minister will retain responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services.  These services involve co-ordinated action by a number of Government Departments, the Garda, Defence Forces, local authorities and health services and also require liaison with the relevant services in neighbouring countries.  The operation of air traffic control for search and rescue operations will be assigned to the Irish Aviation Authority but responsibility for the annex as a whole will remain with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annex XIII &mdash; aircraft accident investigations &mdash; has also been left out.  Since the services provided by the Aviation Authority might be implicated in an accident it would be entirely inappropriate for the Authority to have responsibility <Col N="790" /> for this annex.  The Minister may use his own staff to carry out an investigation or may appoint an indepedent outside organisation, possibly from abroad, to carry out the investigation.  He might, if he considered it appropriate, nominate the Authority to carry out the investigation on his behalf but that would purely be a matter for the Minister.  The Bill empowers the Authority to investigate incidents which the Minister is not investigating.  This is necessary for it to carry out its functions of regulating aviation safety.</P>
    <P>Annex XVII &mdash; security &mdash; has also been left out.  Securing civil aviation against unlawful interference is a matter for Government and will therefore remain with the Minister.  It would not be appropriate to give the Authority this policy responsibility.  By leaving these annexes out of the Bill responsibility will rest with the State.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Headquarters of the company shall be located in such place where the majority of its staff are situate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My much heralded retirement which was due to begin today has not begun as yet; it seems I have drawn the short straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar but not the same as the one I moved on Committee Stage.  It is slightly different.  That amendment <Col N="791" /> was negatived on Committee Stage and I wanted the opportunity to move it again.  I move it in different circumstances because if Members of the House read the record of the debate that took place on Committee Stage they will see that I was opposed by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Flaherty, who said that as I was the leader of a national party I was not entitled to move an amendment of that kind.  Happily, that impediment has been moved out of Deputy Flaherty's way in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy was very upset and said that little green apples would grow again, that the wheel would turn full circle.  I hope Deputy Kemmy will support this amendment as he voted against the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  Twenty minutes ago, speaking eloquently in favour of Deputy Noonan's amendment, he said he agreed with it without reservations.  A vote was duly called.  I noted that the last Member going through the &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; lobby was my old friend Deputy Kemmy.  How will he vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>The arguments advanced now are the same as those voiced on Committee Stage.  I do not think that I, or any Member, need repeat them.  The situation in Shannon Airport is causing great concern.  It caused great concern in mid-July when the Committee Stage was being taken.  Unfortunately, the position has deteriorated further and people are worried as a result of the decisions by the Government.  Within the past 24 hours the industry that received the largest investment ever, more than $1,000 million, let go more than 25 per cent of its staff who worked within a few miles of Shannon Airport.  The longest established industrial company in Shannon, De Beers, established in 1959 and manufacturing since 1960, made many of its staff redundant.  Translift has been forced to curtail its activities through Shannon due to its failure to get rights into other airports even though neither Aer Lingus or any other Irish airline is flying into those airports or even into those countries. Aeroflot is in active negotiation <Col N="792" /> with the British Government, and the British Aviation Authority, with a view to transferring some of its flights across the Atlantic from Shannon to Prestwick which, as we know, has not been a busy airport in recent years.  That is a very frightening spectacle for the people of Shannon.</P>
    <P>The arguments I advanced others on Committee Stage are even more valid in the light of the events that have since taken place in Shannon.  It is ominous that Aughinish Alumina, in which more than $1 billion was invested should have had to reduce its workforce.  De Beers is regarded as one of the strongest companies in the world and I had hoped, now that its parent companies in South Africa are in a better position to trade worldwide, that it would have been able to avoid taking the action it did.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was good enough to give us details of the number of people who will be affected by this Bill.  The majority of them are in County Clare, at Shannon Airport and at Ballygireen which is only a couple of miles from the airport.  Most of the others are in Dublin with a small number in Cork city and west Cork.</P>
    <P>I have never apologised for supporting the decentralisation programmes.  They have been implemented to a limited extent and that has been a cause of great regret to me.  Frequently, the implementation of the programmes has been much slower than one would have hoped.  In Limerick, for example, the decentralisation of a section of the Revenue Commissioners was to be completed in 1989.  It was, in fact, only completed in the past couple of months.  There has been limited decentralisation to various part of the country.  However, with the exception of Limerick and one or two other cities it usually involved about 100 officials not of the most senior rank.</P>
    <P>We are one of the most if not the most centralised country in Europe.  In the United Kingdom and France entire Departments have been decentralised away from the capital.  In Newcastle-on-Tyne alone there are between 10,000 and 15,000 officials of one Department.  A <Col N="793" /> huge number of officials from more than one Department are based in Cardiff. Even institutions like the Bank of England have decentralised many of their functions to relatively small cities and towns in the UK.  That is regarded as the norm and nobody sees anything wrong with it, and when the decision is taken it is usually implemented reasonably quickly.</P>
    <P>However, in Ireland we have a fixation about Dublin.  We have only to look around to see that Dublin is slowly choking to death.  Why we should seek to continue to concentrate more and more people into one city &mdash; more than 30 per cent of the population live in the Dublin area &mdash; I do not know.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport, and the Shannon region, are in a very vulnerable situation. There is great concern and a lack of confidence there.  The Government should make some gesture to show it has a commitment to that area.  The day after the news about Aughinish Alumina broke, and one month after we heard about De Beers, would be a suitable time to make such a gesture.  I am not suggesting &mdash; this is supposed to be the greatest horror of all &mdash; that senior civil servants in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should go to Shannon or the Shannon region.  Those who advise the Minister and who hold senior positions will have to remain in Dublin as was the case in other decentralisation programmes.  However, those on the administrative and executive side could be transferred.</P>
    <P>Of the new State bodies set up here over the years, and there were scores of them, only three &mdash; they are by no means the most important &mdash; have their headquarters outside the city of Dublin. That is wrong and it is not replicated in any other country that I am aware of.  We should avail of the opportunity presented by this Bill to try to ensure that the headquarters of a semi-State body is transferred outside of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The west of Ireland has always had to face problems.  The one ray of hope, the one light shining in the darkness that was successful over a long period was <Col N="794" /> Shannon Airport which is at a turning point.  Some would say it has gone beyond that as a result of the Government decision on last June or July which superseded the Government announcement of last October.  It is a very serious matter and people are deeply concerned.  This is an opportunity for the Government and the Dáil to give some reassurance to those who are deeply worried.  There is no technical or other reason that this amendment cannot be accepted.  There are not many people involved.  Relatively few people would be transferred but at least there would be some guarantee of continuity for those already working there and for the Clare area.  There are more than 300 people there at present. On Committee Stage we discussed the nature of the work carried out by these people, which previously had to be done <i>in situ</i> but does not always have to be done <i>in situ</i> now due to advances in telecommunications and so on.</P>
    <P>There is great fear that many people will be transferred.  Acceptance of this amendment, is the way to prevent that. I ask the Minister of State who represents a west of Ireland constituency to realise the concern of people on the western seaboard.  This is a very simple way of giving some reassurance to the people who are so deeply worried.  It is especially necessary and appropriate in view of two serious developments in regard to industrial employment, one in the oldest factory in Shannon which has been manufacturing for 33 years and is situated a couple of hundred yards from the main runway and the other only two or three miles across the river from the airport at Aughinish.  I hope the Labour Party on this occasion, instead of just making speeches in favour of an amendment such as this, will vote for the amendment and will intercede with the Minister of State to ensure that it is carried.</P>
    <P>I could make a speech that would be a great deal more embarrassing for people than anything I have said, but I decline to do so in the hope that my words will be acted upon.  It is the least the Government and the House owe the people who are very distressed today, not because <Col N="795" /> some world economic conditions went against them but because the Government made a particular decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the benefit of participating on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I am not certain as to the numbers involved but my understanding is that in the region of 100 employees will be transferred from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to the Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity of wishing Deputy O'Malley well following his retirement as Leader of the Progressive Democrats.  I respect the fact that he is making a pitch for his constituency and the Shannon region.  In the past when people moved from the Civil Service to State companies such as An Post and Telecom Éireann the minimum disruption to the existing staff was ensured.</P>
      <P>I do not wish the impression to be given that Dublin is booming.  The unemployment rate in Dublin is extremely high.  Even in a so-called wealthy part of Dublin, in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire there are 8,000 people on the live register.  There is a very serious unemployment problem in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make representations on behalf of the staff who are deeply concerned that they may be forced to leave Dublin, people with commitments in terms of educating their children, mortgages and so on.  These people joined the Civil Service, were involved in the Department and are now co-operating with the setting up of this Authority.  I ask the Minister to take into account that some people may not wish to move from Dublin.  If there is to be movement it should be on a voluntary basis.  I am not completely <i>au fait</i> with the new structure but there are a number of people currently in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications who are deeply concerned that they may be forced to move from Dublin and it is only right and proper that their fears should be expressed.  If these people are prepared to move on a voluntary basis so be it, but <Col N="796" /> they should not be forced to do so.  The Minister may argue that people's rights will be protected in the movement from the Civil Service to the new Authority, but to have to make such a move would be a culture shock.</P>
    <P>The state of the economy in Dublin is not rosy.  Other regions may experience difficulties but it is not reasonable to say that more will be done to assist other regions at the further expense of the Dublin region.  Considering the serious unemployment problem in Dublin, we cannot afford to lose employment to different regions.  Perhaps the impression has been given to the Minister that everything is rosy in Dublin but that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Malley who has elaborated very forcefully the strong and cogent reasons that the new Authority should be established in the Shannon area.  The first reason is based on the manpower resources already in the aviation industry in the area.  In addition the Shannon area has suffered many significant blows in recent times and rumour and innuendo are still rife in the area.  I do not wish to repeat the points elaborated by Deputy O'Malley.  He mentioned the concern in relation to Translift and Aeroflot.  A task force was established in Shannon with the objective of seeking extra business for the area.  Many people found it a contradiction that Shannon Development, whose objective it was to market Shannon Airport, was asked to market another airport in Farranfore.  While we do not begrudge the activity of regional airports it may not be possible to serve two masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the Shannon area suffered a great blow in industrial terms in recent times and that position was reinforced yesterday with the announcement of lay-offs at Aughinish Alumina in my constituency of west Limerick.  As a person who worked in the construction of Aughinish I saw tremendous momentum at that time which gave a new lease of life to the area.  It helped many people financially and created much employment in the area.  Regrettably, <Col N="797" /> changes on the international scene, particularly in Russia and Eastern Europe, have resulted in a downturn in business at Aughinish Alumina.  It is unfortunate that this has led to 140 job losses.  The company wants to save the remaining 400 jobs and knows it will have to reduce the cost of alumina.  I compliment the company on its initiative in providing £500,000 in seed capital for redundant workers who may wish to set up businesses.  This initiative, in conjunction with the county enterprise boards, will probably give many people the necessary kick-start to set up their own industries.</P>
    <P>There is a mood of depression and gloom in the mid-west region at present. Regardless of the Department involved, regionalisation of services can give rise to concern and resistance.  Departments have always been sympathetic to their employees and I hope that the headquarters of the Irish Aviation Authority will be located in Shannon.  This would be a major boost to the area.  I support this amendment and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that this matter has been raised on Report Stage &mdash; I thought it has been debated fully on Committee Stage.  The Air Navigation Services Office is already highly decentralised with more than 80 per cent of its staff located outside Dublin city.  The general Shannon Airport region is, and will continue to be, our main base of operations for the control of the upper air space and our North Atlantic area. As I said in the House on a number of occasions, the new Authority intends to grasp the commercial opportunities already arising in the training and consultancy areas.  Moreover, we foresee that it will use the highly sophisticated air traffic control centre in Shannon as the focal point around which new development and expansion will take place.</P>
      <P>All that being said, it would be inappropriate, as a matter of principle, to provide in legislation for the location of the headquarters or any part of the organisation in any particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We have already heard the Minister's views on this point.  The commitments he gave in other areas on Committee Stage are not being fulfilled and this does not inspire confidence about the acceptance of this amendment.  As the Minister is fully aware, there is a concept known as geographic inertia which, in simple terms, means that when the conditions which led to the establishment of a particular industry or service in a region change there is always a time lapse between the transfer of the service or industry to a new area even though the conditions no longer exist in the first area.  For example, in the United States most cotton manufacture was in the north east and the general Boston area even though no cotton was grown within 1,000 miles of the area.  That remained the case right up to modern times.</P>
      <P>I make that point because a similar example arises in the case of Shannon area which feels under siege at present as a result of adverse announcements; for example, GPA has been taken over by General Electric, with one third of the staff made redundant, the other flagship of the airport, De Beers &mdash; the highest payer in the region &mdash; is suffering major redundancies and the Aughinish Alumina plant in the estuary is also suffering redundancies.  The people from that area are afraid they will no longer have political clout at the Cabinet table.  There has been a tradition in the region that a senior Minister represented the region at Cabinet.  This happened when Deputy O'Malley, I and some of the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues were in Government. The mid-west region is now without political clout &mdash; it is not represented by anybody at the Cabinet table.  Even though there were redundancies in the past there was always enough clout at the Cabinet table to ensure that a replacement industry was put into the area.  This is not happening any more &mdash; it is all one way traffic and bad news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me back to my point about geographic inertia.  The Minister referred to the North Atlantic area and control of the upper air space.  When Shannon was <Col N="799" /> the first landfall for flights crossing the Atlantic it was geographically necessary to place air traffic control in Shannon. This was not necessary simply for the aircraft flying into and out of Shannon; it was, as the Minister explained on a number of occasions on Committee Stage, to hand over control for the aircraft flying into our airspace to European control.  That happened on the Shannon-Prestwick line &mdash; I think the acronym was &ldquo;Shanwick&rdquo;.  This is no longer the case, people based in Dublin, Prestwick or Liverpool could easily carry out this task. Therefore, the geographic necessity of having the facilities in Shannon for the general activity carried out &mdash; passing over control for aircraft flying into our space to European control &mdash; no longer applies.  We are afraid that the Minister or one of his successors will yield to pressure and that, systematically and slowly over the years, staff will be transferred from the outposts, where most of them are now located, to the headquarters in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would not name the location of the headquarters in the Bill.  That is code for saying that everyone knows the headquarters will be in Dublin and that, therefore, one does not need to write it into the Bill.  The only time one names the location of the headquarters in a Bill is when one is trying to move it out of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has never been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Of course, it has not been done.  As a countryman representing a constituency west of the Shannon it is about time the Minister looked at the precedents and decided to break with them.  When one does not name the location of the headquarters in a Bill it automatically follows it will be Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind a small group of experts in the Irish Aviation Authority having a headquarters in Dublin where their expertise can be used to advise the Minister and where they can act as a kind <Col N="800" /> of management group for the country. However, because there is no geographic necessity to base services in the regions except to control flights in and out of the airport, which is a very small modicum of the activity of air traffic control, I am afraid that the push will be towards Dublin in a few years.  We are a very centralised country; our public service has a centralised mentality; it is very difficult to get anyone above middle management grade in the Civil Service to move out of Dublin.  We have seen evidence of this decentralisation programmes in the past where recruitment within a Department had to be extended to the entire public service and where, in the final analysis, promotion had to be offered before people would move to regional locations.  This was because of the social advantages of living in Dublin &mdash; the easy access to third level education and the different living standards. Regardless of how black a picture one paints of Dublin, when it comes to the crunch by and large people in the public service want to stay in it.  Those public servants who willingly relocate to the country are usually single and, quite frequently, single women at the lower levels of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>We are afraid the people based in our area will be brought back to Dublin over a period of time, that there will be no major announcement by the Minister that ten staff will be moved back to Dublin the first year, 20 the next year and 30 the year after.  People are afraid there will only be a small holding operation in Shannon Airport and that the main operation will be centralised in Dublin.  The Minister can banish that fear by accepting Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to express my profound disappointment at the attitude of the Minister of State and the Government. The Minister of State stood up and read in a dismissive manner a few lines of script handed to him which said that the amendment could not be accepted and we could take it or leave it.  He did not attempt to make any argument for <Col N="801" /> not accepting the amendment or contradict any argument in support of this amendment by Deputy Finucane or me. It is very regrettable that the Minister should have adopted this attitude and that the Government should arrogantly say: &ldquo;We do not care whether you are right or wrong, we will have our way, because we have a majority of 35 we will pass this amendment irrespective of the arguments made and we will not even attempt to reply to them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my opening contribution what Deputy Kemmy had to say on the last occasion.  I invite Deputies Killen and de Valera, who have made the ultimate sacrifice in Fainna Fáil terms, who have lost the Whip and acquired that very unusual freedom of movement that being an Independent in this House affords, to support this amendment tonight.  There is no reason, political or otherwise, that they should not.  I am sure both of them know perfectly well that what I, Deputy Finucane and Deputy Noonan have said is right.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned whether anybody is transferred to the mid-west region as a result of this measure but, like Deputy Noonan, my concern is to prevent everybody being transferred out.  The great concern is that in the nineties and in the 21st century all the work that is done in Shannon could be done from Dublin, or for that matter from Warsaw, because of the improvements in telecommunications and so on.  The inexorable pressure will be that if it can be done in Dublin let us do it in Dublin.  When all these services were established in and around Shannon there was no option at that time but there is an option now. Even if nobody is transferred from Dublin to the Shannon region, I want at least to guarantee that those who are there will remain and that they will not be forced against their will to come to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the extraordinary double standard that to ask someone to move from Dublin to the western half of Ireland is tantamount to depriving a man or woman of their liberty, but to ask someone to move to Dublin is to confer <Col N="802" /> a benefit on them.  I have done a little commuting in my day and I do not regard being forced against my will to move to Dublin as any more palatable than to move in the other direction.  People who have spent most of their lives outside Dublin would prefer if at all possible to remain there.  The assumption that people can be asked to go to Dublin but cannot be asked to leave it is something I find very hard to accept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy said at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on 13 July:</P>
    <P>There is more to this than meets the eye.  Deputy O'Malley is attempting to extract the maximum embarrassment from a Labour Deputy such as I from the mid-west, who is supporting the Government.  I would remind him that the pendulum of politics swings back and forth and little apples will grow again, beidh lá eile ag an bpaorach. Two can play that game and I am a fairly dab hand at it; I am resourceful and can give an uppercut when necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes intervened at that point to say, not unreasonably, &ldquo;We would never believe that the Deputy is so sanctimonious&rdquo;. Deputy Kemmy ignored that observation and went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am very resourceful.  I am just reminding Deputy O'Malley that some of his remarks were made tongue in cheek.  There are two sides to every story and we will have another day.</P>
    <P>Today is the other day.  Deputy Kemmy has his opportunity to put his money where his mouth is or to demonstrate to this House and to this country that he is nothing but a windbag.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical amendment.  As the <Col N="804" /> House will be aware, for the purposes of the Companies Acts, single shares in semi-State companies are held in trust by certain nominees, usually civil servants, in the parent Department.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 32, to delete &ldquo;£80 million&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£25 million&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to an amendment I moved on Committee Stage.  It relates to the guarantee of borrowings by the company given by the Minister for Finance.  The Aviation Authority is not primarily a commercial company but it is providing certain services that have to be provided for aircraft using this country's airports or Irish airspace.  They have to avail of the services whether they want to or not.  It seems to me remarkable that the company, which has a monopoly and a guaranteed substantial income, could run up borrowings of the size envisaged here.  If they do run up borrowings that should be a matter for the company and there should not be an automatic guarantee of those borrowings by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being empowered to guarantee borrowings up to £80 million. We were informed on Committee Stage by the Minister of State that much of the borrowings would not be guaranteed.  I think that was meant to reassure the committee, but it had the opposite effect on me because it frightened me.  That suggests there would be borrowings in excess of £80 million by a State company and I do not see the need or the point of that. Irrespective of borrowings there should be no need for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance, but if there is a guarantee it should be kept to some reasonable <Col N="806" /> figure.  I think £25 million is more than reasonable and more than adequate for the Minister for Finance to guarantee whatever borrowings may be made by the company.</P>
    <P>If I were a banker I might be loath to lend to many people, but the Irish Aviation Authority, as set up under this Bill, would be a relatively risk free authority to whom to lend provided they kept their borrowings within reasonable limits, because they have a monopoly and they have a guaranteed substantial annual income.</P>
    <P>We have had many experiences down through the years of borrowings being called in, some of examples of which I gave on Committee Stage.  We are aware of the exposure under the State Guarantees Acts of the Minister for Finance and thereby the Exchequer and the taxpayer. The taxpayer is very heavily exposed to a variety of borrowings by a myriad of State companies.  The amounts in question will be called in from the Minister for Finance or in a great many cases he will have to write off what is due to him on paper by the company or agency concerned. An example of where there is a very definite prospect of the amounts being called in &mdash; we had recent legislation relating to it &mdash; is NET; that seems a virtual certainty.  Another company which springs to mind immediately in this context is Irish Steel and, of course, there are many more.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in principle that State companies should borrow such excessive sums of money and that they should do so under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance and that the banks run no risk whatever.  Is it any wonder that so much of the money lent in the State is lent to the State in one form or another and that there is consequent pressure from time to time on liquidity?  If you look back over the past ten or 20 years you will see there was pressure on liquidity here during the great bulk of that time.  Pressure on liquidity was caused by the excessive demand of the State for credit.  I would have thought we had learned our lesson, because it drove up interest rates and that in turn affected <Col N="807" /> inflation and, of course, it affects employment very seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may wish to see this only in the context of this single company and as an isolated once off case. It is not an isolated once off case.  This is another example of an area where we are, as a State, plunging deeper and deeper into areas into which we do not need to go.</P>
    <P>It was not demonstrated on Committee Stage that there was any need to borrow these sums of money.  It was not demonstrated that the money could not be borrowed without the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  It was suggested that because there was a guarantee the money could be borrowed at 1 per cent less or .5 per cent less than if there were not a guarantee and that since we were in a competitive world it would be better if an Irish State company could borrow at .5 per cent less because it was suggested that if the charges of this company were too high people would not use Irish airspace or Irish airports.  They will use Irish airspace and Irish airports if they have to and they will not be put off by a .5 per cent interest difference in interest rates.  Somebody who is flying across Ireland &mdash; about 25 times more planes fly across Ireland than land in Ireland &mdash; will not go 400 or 500 miles to the north or to the south simply because of a minor difference in charges, because the cost of travelling 400 or 500 miles to the north or to the south would be hundreds of time greater than any slight adjustment in cost.  It seemed to me that the argument made by the Minister of State on Committee Stage did not, with the greatest of respect, have any merit.  It had no cogency whatever.</P>
    <P>I am tabling an amendment that is different in the amount specified but not in principle from the one I tabled on Committee Stage.  I am now suggesting a figure of £25 million instead of £20 million. I am giving the Minister and the company the benefit of another £5 million of guaranteed borrowings if they so desire.  What I am principally concerned about here is the message this subsection <Col N="808" /> gives that automatically, whether it needs it or not, every State company, either existing companies or new companies as is the case here, should have huge guarantees from the Minister for Finance. We will not solve our problems, our underlying structural problems or our fiscal problems, if we continue to follow this route.</P>
    <P>To say that it has been this way for 20 or 30 years is not an answer to this argument; it only strengthens my argument. It is because it has been this way for 20 or 30 years that we are wrong, that we should stop and avail of the opportunity now in this Bill to draw a line and say we will not continue on that route.  If a company such as the Irish Aviation Authority has to operate in a way that will not be a drag on the taxpayer let it not start with a guarantee of £80 million that it or its bankers need never worry about.  For a change let them live in the real world that everybody else, other than State companies in Ireland, has to live in and let them get on with running their affairs in that way.  The people who run such companies are capable in a great many cases of running the business properly and competing in the real world. They do not need these kinds of guarantees and they should not be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The effect of Deputy O'Malley's amendment is to reduce the company's borrowings, which the Minister for Finance could guarantee, from £80 million to £25 million.  The maximum the company can borrow for capital purposes is fixed at £100 million, and this includes working capital.  The Bill therefore allows the Minister for Finance to guarantee up to 80 per cent of this borrowing limit.  I must emphasise that these are maximum limits.  The company's borrowing might never reach the limit and the Minister for Finance may never consider it necessary to guarantee the entire £80 million of their borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is reasonable to provide for this scale of borrowing by the company rather than have to come back to the House at a later date to increase it. <Col N="809" /> Providing an air traffic control service to the highest international standards requires considerable and continuing capital investment.  In the next five to seven years, the company's capital expenditure will be in the region of £60 million.  The company will also need working capital commensurate with its turnover, which is currently approximately £40 million a year.  Allowing for even modest inflation, the limits in the Bill are very reasonable.</P>
    <P>Finally a £100 million borrowing facility against a guaranteed limit of £25 million would send a wrong message to the financial institutions and indeed to the users.  Deputy O'Malley, as an experienced parliamentarian who has held various ministerial portfolios, knows that it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to decide how much he will guarantee and how much of the borrowing will be his liability in the event of difficulties. The Department of Finance, in advising the Minister, will ensure that any decision taken is prudent and reasonable.  We are putting in these maximum limits, but that does not make it mandatory or automatic that the Minister for Finance will guarantee total borrowing up to the maximum limits.  This is a matter between the company and the Minister and his advisers.  I have given the financial latitude that is needed for the company to operate in the prevailing financial environment and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that I have had ministerial experience and should have realised that the Minister for Finance will not necessarily guarantee up to the limit of his statutory powers in respect of a company.  I know he will not but <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks who may be lenders, the Minister for Finance only has leverage against them when he has reached the statutory limit.  If the guarantees are below the limit and the Minister for Finance does not want to give any further guarantee, the banks will force him to do it by threatening to pull the plug on the company.  The only time in my experience that the Minister for Finance has <Col N="810" /> leverage with banks is when the limit is reached.  The Minister of State's argument is equally valid if it is made the other way round.  I find it very disappointing that we should be expected again to write in a guarantee for a huge amount of money.  If the Minister of State is right that the capital expenditure over the next seven years is expected to be £60 million, that is fair enough.  There is nothing abnormal about that as the company's annual income will be very substantial.  The figures were given on Committee Stage and I do not see a major difficulty in arranging to have a bank finance the company from their cashflow. The company, a monopoly, has a substantial annual guaranteed income and it is not too difficult to arrange finance for whatever capital investment has to be made over the next seven years.  It also presupposes that none of the capital investment would have been paid by the seventh year when it was necessary to borow the last tranche of the £60 million. I do not accept that.  In the normal way the money would and should have been paid because of the company's substantial cashflow and their monopoly.</P>
      <P>I regret, in particular, the Minister's reluctance to deal with the main point I make, that this country should get away from constant reliance on the State at all times.  State companies instead of being forced to operate as independent commercial entities are allowed to have recourse to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer at all times and are given that right of recourse by statute.  That colours all their thinking and their outlook and this is what has us as a country in the difficulties we are in.</P>

      <Col N="811" /> This amendment arises from the Committee Stage debate.  Deputies at that time observed that although the Authority was required to submit its annual report to the Minister within six months of the end of the year the Minister was not obliged to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a particular time limit.  I have considered this point and have decided that the Bill should require the Minister to lay the report before the Oireachtas within three months.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) A director or member of the staff of the company shall not be appointed under paragraph (a) and a person standing appointed under paragraph (a) shall be disqualified for appointment as a director or member of the staff of the company,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the innovative features in the Bill is the provision that the company should be subject to regular safety audits.  We had always intended that the safety audit would be conducted by an independent outside interest such as the American Federal Aviation Authority or comparable organisation.  During the Committee Stage debate when Deputies expressed their anxiety that the Authority might be involved in auditing themselves I decided the Bill should be amended to make it absolutely certain that the audits would be conducted independently. The Minister will have a totally independent safety audit done at least every three years to ensure the Authority continues to maintain the highest possible safety standards.  The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the person the Minister appoints to conduct the safety audit of the Authority <Col N="812" /> is absolutely independent of the Authority.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment as an improvement on the Bill as it stands.  However, this amendment touches on one of the central difficulties of this Bill &mdash; I found it difficult to table an amendment that would cover it adequately &mdash; that is, that the proposed company will be both an operating company and a supervisory Authority.  They will in many instances be the Authority that has to make the decision as to whether they themselves are acting properly and reasonably.  It is a very serious matter where something like air safety is concerned that there should be an overlap of functions in the one company between the part that is the operating company providing services for reward, and the part of the company that is an authority which is supposed to supervise the activities of themselves and other companies.</P>

      <P>I move that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In view of</P>
      <P>&mdash; the large increase in serious crime;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the fact that drug abuse on our streets is now an everyday occurrence;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the level of fear generated among the most vulnerable members of our community, including children and old people, in urban and rural areas alike;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the increasing necessity for shop, car and home alarms;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the number of street ramps in cities <Col N="813" /> and the number of requests for further ramps to deal with stolen cars speeding around neighbourhoods;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the increase in muggings, burglaries, vandalism and car theft; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the increasing incidence of violent crime, especially crimes against women, organised crime and the proliferation of weapons being used in crime; and</P>
    <P>given that Garda numbers are greatly below authorised establishment levels and the need for penal reform and the reform of our courts, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to publish forthwith a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan of action to deal with the current crime, vandalism and law and order problems facing the community, such plan to incorporate quarterly reports to Dáil Éireann on its implementation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Garda crime statistics published last week show an increase in indictable crime, that is serious crime, from 86,574 in 1986 to 95,391 in 1992.  Despite this garda recruitment remains almost 500 below the authorised strength.  Unfortunately, I am unable to give the accurate numbers because, despite having telephoned the Department of Justice on three occasions, I did not receive the courtesy of a return call.  Yet, alarming though the Garda crime statistics may be, they understate the position. They do not reflect the true level of crime, but merely the level of reported crime.  I have been making that point for a number of years and I know it irritates some people, but I will continue to make it because I believe it to be true and, furthermore, it is the starting point in any fight against crime.  I published the National Bureau of Crime Statistics Bill during the summer recess and I hope the Minister will accept that Fine Gael Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to accurately measuring crime and the increases and decreases from period to period, in order to gear up the fight against crime it is necessary <Col N="814" /> to reform sentencing policy so that judges and legislators know which sentences have the greatest effect, a point which has been referred to in both the Whitaker report of 1985 and the Law Reform Commission report of 1993.  Furthermore, it is shameful that no prison statistics have been published since the 1989 prison report was surreptitiously placed in the Oireachtas Library during the recess without informing anybody.  Is that any way to plan a fight against crime?  I suggest that we have not even started in the correct place.</P>
    <P>According to an <i>Irish Independent</i> IMS survey published last Saturday, only 82 per cent of people report burglaries, 91 per cent report theft of property from cars, 79 per cent report vandalism, 62 per cent report theft generally and a mere 56 per cent of assault cases are reported and an average of 78 per cent of people contact the Garda when they become victims of crime.  That is why I believe the crime statistics are understated and the response is similarly understated. What has happened to people's confidence in the criminal justice system when they do not bother to report crimes?  That survey revealed also that six out of ten Dubliners are afraid to walk alone at night and nearly three-quarters of the capital's citizens believe the number of gardaí in their area is inadequate to provide a reasonable level of security for themselves and their families. There has been enough pussyfooting; it is time to call a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>There are two categories of prisoners &mdash; those who have been brought before the courts and sentenced because of their crimes and those old, frail and nervous members of our community who are prisoners in their homes, who are afraid to go past their doorsteps after dark and on many occasions to open their doors during the day.  Yet the gurriers who prey on them are free to walk the streets. When I was 11 years old I travelled on my own from my home in Inchicore to Áras an Uachtaráin to see the late President Kennedy.  My daughter is now 11½ years old and I would not dream of allowing her to travel any distance in this city <Col N="815" /> on her own.  Such has been the decline over a few decades.  We have retreated too far behind car, shop and house alarms, shutters on shops and ramps on our roads, not only to prevent cars from being stolen but to prevent people from driving at high speed and knocking down others.  A child was killed a few nights ago by a person driving a stolen car. Many people in Dublin and elsewhere are seeking to have more ramps put in place.  In Dublin alone applications have been made to have ramps put in place on approximately 200 roads to prevent cars being stolen and driven around with impunity on our streets.  This is not the same city or country in which I grew up and this is not what is happening in other capital cities around the world.  For example, in Vienna it is commonplace to see women walking on their own at night and there are no shutters on windows there.  That used to be the case here, but what went wrong?  At one time people went window shopping in O'Connell Street on Sunday afternoons, but that is no longer the case because there is nothing to be seen but shutters on shop windows.  There is something seriously wrong and we have retreated much too far.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the need to improve the various arms of the criminal justice system, there are two points I want to raise &mdash; unemployment and housing and how they are releated to crime. There are now almost 300,000 people unemployed.  That is a record number and there is no indication that it will be substantially reduced this side of the turn of the century.  That is an appalling reflection on this House and on the Government who preside over such outrageous levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired listening to people talking about improvements in the economy. We have had a sustainable growth rate for the past number of years, twice the European average.  The debt-GNP ratio has been decreasing for some time and, with the exception of a short period of European-wide disruption of interest rates, our rates have been low and our <Col N="816" /> inflation rate has been under control for a number of years.  But where are the jobs?  It is time we realised we are not running an economy, but a country. There is far too much talk about the economic value of a job, what about the therapeutic value?  When the Conference of Major Religious Superiors made a fair and just proposal to create jobs, because it understands the problems created by unemployment, we were told the proposal would cause economic blips.  What sort of blips is the crime rate causing? The devil is finding work for idle hands. It is natural that a young, vulnerable and unsupervised unemployed person will be open to temptation.  All of us would be open to temptation in those circumstances. Is what Seán Lemass said correct?  He stated that a country that measures its success in economic terms alone is a country that has lost its soul. We are running a country and the therapeutic value of a job is just as important as its economic value.</P>
    <P>In parts of the country the unemployment rate is 70 per cent.  People in their mid-twenties have never worked and have no prospect of working.  Yet the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are reported to have been a great success.  What national recovery or economic and social progress has taken place when 300,000 people are unemployed? Surely those people should be represented directly in some form in the negotiations for <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> mark II so that we can deal with the position before it boils over into something uncontrollable with all the consequences that would involve for public order, security, crime, vandalism and other related matters.</P>
    <P>Poor housing in urban areas is another matter directly related to the crime problem. The Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing which I set up and which is chaired by Dr. Garret FitzGerald produced probably the best report on housing in Dublin since 1914.  Those who served on that commission held a cross section of political opinions.  The commission pointed out that there are 9,600 <Col N="817" /> local authority flats along the canals in Dublin which are in need of major refurbishment, and that the same problem pertains in many urban areas around the country, for example in Cork and Athlone.  The 9,600 families who live in those flats in Dublin are neglected by the legislators.  Nobody in this House would aspire to live in such conditions.  I am sure the money can be found to finance the refurbishment of the flats.  The environment of those flats is that of dark, dank stairways, broken sewers, public lights that are broken; it is ripe for the criminal, the vandal and the drug pusher.  It is no wonder that we have very high crime levels in parts of the inner city when people are living in those conditions. Elected councillors and the Comptroller and Auditor General have pointed to the outlandish waste in the maintenance budgets of local authorities, particularly that of Dublin Corporation.  Such budgets could provide for financing major refurbishment of local authority accommodation and maintain a living city for its citizens and not allow the city to be one that closes at night, one in which people are afraid to go into certain blocks of flats where drugs are being taken on the stairs and where people are vomiting after taking drug overdoses.  The environmental question is central to the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The question is often asked, does crime pay?  A prominent businessman recently told a national newspaper that he had to close one of his premises, even though it earned between £75,000 and £80,000 annually for the Government in taxes, because it had been robbed at least six times annually for the past four years. There are barriers on the windows of convents in my constituency and despite such safety measures nuns have woken up at night to find intruders in their rooms.  I grew up in an area which was quiet and rustic, but the local post office in that area was held up twice in two weeks and a betting shop three times during the same period.  In a south Dublin suburb a businessman had been held up so many times that he is now inquiring about a licence for a hand gun to defend himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The incidence of criminal acts, particularly stealing, has almost quadrupled since the seventies.  This is understandable when the rate of detection is only 34 per cent and the revolving door syndrome still operates in our prisons. Criminals know the criminal justice system is under-resourced, falling apart and works to serve their interest, that is, they have higher than a two out of three chance of never being brought to justice. This means that two-thirds of those who reported crime will never see justice done and 22 per cent of people never report crimes because they know there is a very slim chance that justice will be served. We need law but we also need order. In the Minister's county of Galway, I stopped on my way to a wedding in a remote part of the county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ask directions of an elderly couple who were terrified to answer the door.  Crime is rampant in rural and urban areas.  That elderly couple and many others throughout the country are preyed on by criminals, some on an excursion from nearby urban areas. Many younger people have emigrated, while elderly people in rural areas are under threat from criminals.  That was not allowed happen in any earlier period of history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the crime problem is drug related.  Feeding a drug habit may cost hundreds of pounds daily.  Drugs are being sold openly on our streets.  The Minister stated some time ago that there was no indication of an increase in heroin on the streets but her statement is not supported by Garda statistics.  Drug seizures in 1992 increased to 4,262 from 3,500 the previous year, an increase of 20 per cent.  While cannabis resin accounted for 77 per cent of all drugs analysed at the forensic science laboratory there were notable increases in amounts of other drugs seized.  These included cocaine, LSD, heroin and ecstasy.  The Garda report stated that the amount of heroin seized is the highest since 1986.  Surely the Minister owes the House an explanation <Col N="819" /> in regard to her recent statement that there was no evidence of an increase, when those 1992 statistics show otherwise.</P>
    <P>Burglaries, theft, muggings and larcenies are commonplace and often fund drug addiction.  Action has been overtaken by public relations in pretending to deal with this problem.  Every time drugs are found on a boat, the Minister is photographed stocktaking the catch, yet 95 per cent of illegal drugs get on to the streets.  Drugs and alcohol crazed kids are now carrying knives.  During the last two months two youths were stabbed to death by other youths carrying knives in my constituency.</P>
    <P>A plan of action is needed to deal with the high level of crime, one which will be vigorously implemented and reported on quarterly to this House.  A ten-point plan would include: measuring the true level of crime and basing the response on need, reform of the prisons, reform of the courts, the creation of a drugs enforcement agency, greater accountability in given circumstances to the DPP, greater care that we get value for the £500 million spent annually on the justice system, the confiscation of assets of criminals, more gardaí on the beat, parental accountability for regular juvenille offenders and restriction on the sale of hunting knives.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the level of crime be accurately measured and that judges and legislators know which sentences are effective and which crimes are of most concern to the community.  I urge the Minister to accept the Private Members Bill to set up the national bureau of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>Only those people who need to be in prison should be there.  A recent press report which stated that I am seeking more jails is inaccurate and presumably should have been attributed to someone else.  Imprisonment is a costly remedy, if it is a remedy at all.  For those who refuse to pay fines or are involved in non-violent crimes, other penalties should be considered before imprisonment.  For example, non-payment of a fine for not having a TV licence should result in the <Col N="820" /> confiscation of a TV or a similar asset. Community work orders, deduction from social welfare or wages at source and similar penalties should be applied for such crimes.  It is an essential part of this policy that any person who goes to prison will be detained there for the duration of the sentence.</P>
    <P>We must end the revolving door policy and if a judge requires a person to be detained there must be a place for that person.  It is nonsensical that 12 per cent of all committals continue to be for non-payment of fines.  When a fine is applied there should be provision for its collection either by taking assets or by an attachment order to social welfare payments or wages.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report has been with us since 1985.  It sets out what needs to be done in reforming the prisons.  There is no point in building more prisons without a policy about their objective.  Prisons on their own will fill up at a cost of £250,000 a cell and up to £30,000 running costs per year and they will become crime factories turning out recidivists in greater numbers unless we have a policy to reform the prison system.  If the Department of Justice has neither the competence nor the desire to do what Whitaker recommended in 1985 it should step aside and appoint a prison board and an inspector of prisons to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>Juvenile recidivism is of particular concern. I am grateful to Young Fine Gael, who researched this problem.  I am informed that most juvenile crime is committed by persons aged from 14 to 17 years, that in 1990 one in every six juvenile crimes committed was committed by a person under 14 years and that one-third of the juveniles in detention have problems with drugs or alcohol.  Recidivism of juveniles is in the 50 per cent to 80 per cent range.  The Young Fine Gael research shows that on a given day 9.9 per cent of Dublin pupils will play truant from school, many falling into bad company. It is time to invest in crime prevention among juveniles and in rehabilitating juvenile criminals.  To incarcerate a juvenile for three months for stealing £500 costs £5,000.  It was <Col N="821" /> revealed in reply to a parliamentary question in my name that there were 695 juvenile offenders in prisons or places of detention, constituting 31 per cent of the total prison population and costing the Exchequer £26 million to maintain. Surely if recidivism could be reduced, it would pay a handsome dividend to the State.</P>
    <P>In combatting crime we need to control the supply of alcohol.  Licensed people are giving alcohol to juveniles.  The Minister should seek ways of penalising those who break the law.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Minister's recent announcement of 200 additional prison spaces at Wheatfield was accepted in silence by certain members of the Labour Party.  If Labour was truly in Government, such an announcement would have been received by some Labour Members with howls of indignation.  The provision of these places is not an attempt to deal with the problem, which is that our penal system is not geared towards assisting the fight against crime.  Rather is it a contributory factor as recidivists continue to be churned out by the system.</P>
    <P>We should make greater use of the probation and welfare service in the fight against crime.  It is little short of disgraceful that over the past seven or eight years the probation service has never operated at full strength.  I note that provisions are made in the current Estimate for an increase of seven or eight in the number of probation and welfare officers when it would seem that an increase of 40 or 50 would be more in line with needs. We can supply programme managers to beat the band but we cannot get essential workers to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>Because of the absence of adequate statistics we are not in a position to assess the current use of the community service orders or to judge their success as an alternative to imprisonment.  We do not have enough details about the rate of recidivism of offenders who are required to provide a service to the community rather than go to prison.  We know that an increase in community service orders would help, but their has not been an <Col N="822" /> increase in community service orders to match the increase in crime.</P>
    <P>I note the success of the training workshops and hostels run by the probation service in conjunction with voluntary bodies.  Why is consideration not given to the provision of extra workshops throughout the country as such workshops would provide another option for the Judiciary to steer offenders, especially juvenile offenders, away from crime towards rehabilitation?</P>
    <P>We need to reform the administration of justice.  The reform of the administration of the courts accompanied by a fair and equitable complaints system concerning the legal profession, along the lines of the Reform of the Courts' Administration Bill, 1986, the provision of sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary, a modern system of appointment and training of the Judiciary and the provision of modern court facilities conducive to the administration of justice are a prerequisite to a smooth running courts system.  This would probably cost about £1 million per year which could be recovered through increased fines and commercial enterprises being required to make a contribution to the costs of arbitration in the courts.  A more efficient collection of fines would also assist in this area.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider not merely applying fines which when collected go into the coffers of the State.  The courts, as part of a range of sentences, should be able to impose fines, some of which would be paid to the State and some to the victim of the crime.  Restitution to those who have suffered from crime should come more to the centre stage.  At the moment victims are no more than witnesses summoned to attend court as outsiders while the State gets on with the business of dealing with the offence.  We need to take much more account of the victim and we should legislate accordingly.</P>
    <P>The joint submission of the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council on the reform of the administration of the courts is a welcome document.  It shows that those organisations are endeavouring to look afresh at the situation. <Col N="823" /> The <i>Irish Independent</i> survey shows that the majority of people are not happy with the role of the Judiciary.  I admire the independence and fairness of the Judiciary and they have a part to play in reforming the courts.  In difficult financial times it is not sufficient for judges to think that we can proceed endlessly with the appointment of more and more judges.  The Judiciary must take some responsibility for reforming themselves and they might well take a leaf from the book of the British Lord Chancellor in this regard.</P>
    <P>We need to create a drugs enforcement agency including, if necessary, a European drugs enforcement agency.  In some countries GNP from illegal drugs is greater than the total GNP from all other normal products.  These illegal drugs flood the world and it is essential to tackle this internationally.  I seek the creation of a drugs enforcement agency here to coordinate the role of the Garda, customs officers and the health services to combat crime on the ground.  This should not involve additional cost as the agencies are already there.  We need a European agency to combat crime on a Community basis and carry out a diplomatic offensive against countries which continue to manufacture and distribute illegal drugs with impunity.  I am aghast at the weakness of the European Community response to date and even Europol is a meagre response to the need.  Using the freed up facility caused by the scaling down of NATO, would a European coastguard be out of the question?</P>
    <P>There should be a system of accountability in given circumstances for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Director has done a good job down through the years and has shown independence in his work, but being independent and accountable are two different things.  In Britain the Attorney General is a member of Parliament and must account to Parliament, but that is not the case here.  We do not have a system whereby anybody can account to Parliament for the work of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the past there <Col N="824" /> have been multiple deaths where explanations have not been given to the next of kin and where there have been no prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am flabbergasted to read in the most recent report of the Garda Commissioner on crime statistics, under the heading &ldquo;Crimes for which the perpetrators were detected but for which no proceedings are shown&rdquo; that the following categories appear: unnatural offences, nine; rape, 37; indecent assault on females, 80; defilement of girls under 15 years of age, 17; defilement of girls between 15 and 17 year, three; incest, six; abduction, one; false imprisonment, four; possession of firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, three; carrying firearms with criminal intent, one; burglary, 1,164; aggravated burglary, 11; robbery, 30; robbery with arms, one; arson, 30; killing and maiming cattle, one; malicious damage to schools, 47; other malicious damage to property, 415; interfering with railway, one; unlawful possession of housebreaking implements, 19.  This amounts to a total of 1,719 serious indictable offences for which the perpetrators were detected but for which no proceedings are shown.  The Director of Public Prosecutions should be held accountable to this House and these statistics should be explained.  This is a serious weakness in the criminal justice accountability system.  I am aware of the possible difficulties that could arise for the Director of Public Prosecutions but a system could be found in consultation with him.</P>
    <P>We should ensure we get value for money for the £500 million that is paid out annually by the taxpayer for our defective justice system.  We should consider the possibility of giving the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to carry out regular value for money audits of the law enforcement system and to report to the House on this expenditure.  We can do this by changing the law and we should confer this responsibility on him.</P>
    <P>The next point is that we should confiscate the assets of criminals where these were acquired through crime.  I give <Col N="825" /> notice to the House that if the Minister does not introduce a Bill within a month I will intorduce one myself.  It is time that those who acquire assets through criminal activities are made to feel the pain.</P>
    <P>The eighth point is that there should be more gardaí on the beat.  The Minister accepts this point and has made provision for it in the Estimates.  It forms part of the Programme for Government.  It is outrageous, given the level of crime, that the number of gardaí is approximately 500 short of the authorised level of 11,400.  I do not have the exact figure, for the reason I have stated.  Not only should we have the full complement, we should consider the possibility of providing an auxiliary force to complement the gardaí in areas such as Dublin.  We need more gardaí on the beat not only to detect crime but to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The ninth point is that there is a clear need to make parents accountable for the actions of their juvenile children where they constantly offend.  Those of us with children know that even in the best of homes a child can wander.  The children I am talking about are juvenile children who constantly offend, whose parents have abdicated their responsibility.  In some circumstances there is a reasonable suspicion that the parents may be sending them out to commit crime.  In these circumstances, in deciding on the sentence to be imposed, the courts should have the power to take the role played by parents into account.  I ask the House to note this point.  It is not unusual for the courts to impose a curfew whereby juvenile offenders must return home by a certain time.  If they fail to do so the gardaí may remove them from the street.</P>
    <P>If the parents of juvenile children who constantly offend abdicate their responsibility by going to the pub, the courts should have the power not only to impose a curfew on their children but to impose a curfew on them whereby for a certain number of weeks they must remain at home on certain nights between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight.  I am not suggesting that the courts should apply this provision in every case, but they should <Col N="826" /> have the right to apply it in certain cases. It is time we considered the possibility of allowing the courts to take the role played by parents into account in deciding what penalty should be applied against juvenile children who regularly offend.</P>
    <P>The final point is that there should be a requirement, before hunting knives can be sold over the counter, to obtain authorisation from a Garda station stating the suitability of the applicant to acquire such an implement.  These knives should not be sold over the counter to persons irrespective of age or intention.</P>
    <P>That is my ten-point plan and it is not perfect.  It was devised by me without any resources.  I would like the Minister to outline her plan to the House.  Like her Minister of State, the administrators in her Department, senior gardai and others, the Minister is paid a substantial salary.  I wonder if the public feel that we earn our keep.  I would have to say that if that charge was put to the jury it would take them a long time to acquit.  We need a plan of action with regular reports to this House.  I ask the Minister to accept the motion and implement it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé an-bhuíoch de Gay Mitchell gur thug sé cead dom labhairt anseo anocht.  Déarfainn go bhfuil sé thar am againn athrú nó feabhas a dhéanamh ar dhlithe na tíre seo i dtreo is go mbeidh gnáth-dhaoine macánta in ann dul timpeall de ló nó d'oíche gan eagla a bheith orthu go gcuirfidh duine éigin isteach orthu.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the crime problem I often wonder if we are trying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  It is difficult to define the causes of crime but I often wonder if children have been set on the wrong road.  Nowadays people decry the use of the words &ldquo;corporal punishment&rdquo; but very often the threat of corporal punishment in schools had the same effect as any punishment that might have been administered.  Some time ago I heard a parent representing a parents' group decry the intervention of a bishop but was that parent really expressing the views of the parents of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many parents are anxious that their <Col N="827" /> children do well and do not want them to be harassed or bullied in school.  It is my experience that the vast majority of parents trust teachers to deal with any problems that may arise and give them their full backing.  This does not mean, on the question of corporal punishment, that we should condone abuse but are we reaching the stage where we will not be able to retain control, given that children are not subject to serious discipline? Unfortunately this is the case in many homes.  Given the high rate of unemployment, many parents find it difficult to adhere to the old role played by parents where they put manners on children. Nevertheless parents have a right to expect that discipline will be imposed inside and outside of school.  Nowadays children can learn new tricks on television within a matter of days or nights.</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance in the system having regard to the way in which judges treat those charged with technical offences.  I do not want to encourage anyone to break the speed limits but many a decent citizen has been caught speeding and treated as if they were a criminal, whereas those who have used guns and injured people have got away with it because they can afford, with the proceeds of crime, to employ top solicitors and barristers to defend them in court.  As I said, there is an imbalance in the system.  Those who use guns in perpetrating crime should be shown no mercy and receive a long sentence, having regard to the fact that their victims, ordinary citizens, will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to put an end to gangsters from the city being able to drive down in fast cars, maybe stolen cars, to a place like Carlow to smash windows and &mdash; something I could never understand &mdash; make their way back to the city in a car laden with property without being stopped by the Garda within that distance of 50 miles.  Has overtime been cut back so much that there are no gardaí?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I formally move an amendment to the motion before the House in the following terms:</P>
      <P>To delete all words and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann commends the efforts of the Government, the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána and the prison service in the fight against all crime and in coping with the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody and on various alternatives to custody and looks forward to the implementation of the special law and order package which the Minister intends to introduce to enhance further the capacity of the law enforcement agencies in the fight aginst crime.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Mitchell's motion, let me say first of all I do not for one moment doubt the sincerity with which he has advanced it, nor do I wish to suggest in proposing the amendment I have outlined that in so far as crime is concerned it is a case of &ldquo;all is well&rdquo;.  Nobody doubts that there are problems.  The Government acknowledges this and I will inform the House in the course of my statement what the Government has been doing and will be doing about the problem.</P>
      <P>What concerns me about the motion put down by the Deputy is that it gives the impression that we are now in the position where everybody, or most people, in this country are in a state of virtual siege because of the activities of criminals and where the Government simply stands by and does nothing about it.  The Deputy is not alone in putting this message about. But I have to say to him and to others who put across the same message that the message is misleading, it is a message which signals nothing but despair and that what we want now, and what I am pursuing, are solutions and not simply a further recitation of the list of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all else I would ask the House not to support the creation of further reporting obligations which seems to be one of the <Col N="829" /> principal purposes of the motion.  The preparation of such reports imposes enormous demands on limited staff resources &mdash; anybody who has held ministerial office will vouch for this.  We need to ensure that we do not add further reporting requirements at the expense of actual achievement in the fight against crime.  I simply do not have the resources to meet the reporting requirements envisaged in this motion.  I am in no doubt that the staff concerned are already much more beneficially engaged in trying to cope with the tasks already on hands.  I am not suggesting that this House should not be kept informed of developments on this extremely important subject. What I am saying is that existing reporting mechanisms are adequate and we cannot afford to further stretch our very limited and valuable resources in preparing further reports.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most misleading proposition which tends to be advanced concerning crime &mdash; and it is advanced time and again in debates on the subject &mdash; is that it is simply a matter of pouring more and more resources into the law and order system. Other western countries have experienced an unprecedented growth in crime in recent years &mdash; many of them far worse than ours &mdash; but none, I believe, would go along with the idea that extra resources for the law and order system will on its own, provide all the answers.  The problem is a complex one which demands a multifaceted response.  This was one of the core conclusions which emerged from the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder, the implementation of which is part of the <i>Programme for Government 1993-1997.</i></P>
    <P>Before I go on to say what has been done and what will be done, it is worth expanding briefly on another point I made.  That is on the danger of putting across a message which signals something close to total despair.  While not suggesting that Deputies on any side could reasonably set out to argue that the crime situation warrants some sort of general euphoria, we do have a responsibility to be objective.  We must acknowledge that much has been done; that the battle against crime absorbs hundreds of millions <Col N="830" /> of pounds per year; that this Government, like Governments that went before it, accords top priority to law and order expenditure, that measures have been taken to combat crime and more are planned in the very near future and, finally, and most important, that we have in this country now, as we have always had, the capacity and the will to demonstrate that the activities of the selfish, criminal minority among us can be and will be contained and that each of us will provide the crucial co-operation which the Garda needs to ensure that that minority is contained.</P>
    <P>Let me proceed now to what has been done and will be done to deal with the crime situation.  The <i>Programme for Government 1993-1997</i> commits the Government to introduce a radical set of measures and provide the resources to fight crime, including white-collar crime, and vandalism.  A new broad-based approach to crime prevention will be adopted in urban areas where particular law and order problems are being experienced. A five-year corporate strategy for the Garda to enhance their capacity to fight crime in present day conditions will be drawn up and implemented.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am currently engaged in a comprehensive review of prisons policy and strategy and I plan to publish a document on that subject in the future.  It will be the first document of its kind published by a Minister for Justice.  It is a document on which I shall look forward to constructive comment and criticism because the whole question of imprisonment and custody alternatives is now seen by many people &mdash; rightly, I believe &mdash; as an area deserving of priority attention.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Programme for Government, and in order to set the crime problem in a broader context, there is of course the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999,</i> which was launched yesterday by the Taoiseach.  Among the core aims of this plan are a significant growth in jobs and &ldquo;an attack on the social exclusion and marginalisation caused by long term unemployment and by poverty&rdquo;.  It is of course a gross slur on those who are unemployed or below the poverty line to <Col N="831" /> point the finger at them and say that it is they who are responsible for the crime situation.  The vast majority of people in that unfortunate situation are as law abiding as everybody else.  Having said that, however, there is no doubt that unemployment, especially among young people, is a factor which contributes significantly to crime growth.  The reversal of the unemployment trend, through the implementation of the national plan and by other means, will undoubtedly make a significant contribution towards the control of crime.</P>
    <P>What I am now doing &mdash; and I am glad to note that Deputy Mitchell agrees with me on this &mdash; is preparing a co-ordinated plan of action which will embrace all of the elements I have mentioned in relation to the Garda, Prison Service, urban crime and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specifics, it is impossible in the course of a brief contribution on the very substantial topic of crime to deal with all the facts, to deal with the responses already made and deal also with all the plans for further action. I shall therefore concentrate on the following matters: The available statistical evidence, the Garda Commissioner's Corporate Strategy Policy Document, Garda strength and deployment, the drugs situation, which is mentioned in Deputy Mitchell's motion and which I agree is an extremely important issue, the position in the courts and what is planned in that regard, prisons and custody alternatives, the implementation of the urban crime strategy and criminal law reform.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facts about crime and specifically the statistical evidence, the first point is that while the overall crime level grew by 1 per cent in 1990 by 7.7 per cent in 1991 and 1 per cent in 1992, the latest figure is still 6.8 per cent below the 1983 peak figures.  In making this point I am not suggesting that we therefore have grounds for complacency; I am simply stating a fact and I am doing so in the interest of balance.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies &mdash; certainly Deputy Mitchell &mdash; believes that Garda <Col N="832" /> statistics do not reflect the true picture, but I do not believe that the reporting of crime has fallen off to such an extent since 1986 that the trend evident from the published figures cannot be relied on, even as a broad indication of what has been happening, which is that overall crime levels have actually fallen in that period.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that gross figures, even if they are totally accurate, may not succeed in reflecting the seriousness of individual criminal incidents &mdash; for example, the level of viciousness which has become a feature of criminal activity &mdash; but neither do I consider it reasonable to dismiss the statistical evidence produced by the Garda Commissioner as being without substance.  Crime statistics in other European countries have been climbing at a very significant rate in the same period and it seems extremely unlikely that the only explanation for the drop in figures here is that Irish people, unlike their fellow Europeans, have simply abandoned the practice of calling the Garda when they need them.  The Garda are called to intervene in many situations which are far from serious and it seems odd therefore that people generally would fail to alert the Garda when they fall victim to criminal activity.  If we are going to tackle the problem of crime we need to begin by adopting a rational and realistic approach towards the evidence on hands and I cannot agree that it is either rational or realistic to begin by setting aside the evidence produced by the Garda Commissioner as to the actual crime situation.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Garda Commissioner's Corporate Strategy Policy Document which was presented to me last April.  Members of the House will be aware, I am sure, that a five year Corporate Strategy for the Garda forms part of the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Two of the key features of the plan are identification of key policing priorities, including countering terrorism, violent crime, drug dealing and domestic violence and emphasis on the service ethic. This is highlighted in the plan's mission statement and is a fundamentally important <Col N="833" /> feature of the whole plan.  Another feature underlines the key role of the Garda on the beat.  The plan reinforces the crucial contribution and role of the Garda at street level in preventing and detecting crime.  Computerisation and civilianisation are other features.  The report maps out ambitious plans for the further development of information technology in the force with a view to enhancing Garda operations efficiency and expanding the prospects for civilisation of the force.  The final feature is assessment of resource implication.  While observing that certain staff and financial resources are required to enable the gardaí to meet their obligations to our society in the short to medium terms, the plan lays emphasis on the need to ensure that all resources are used in the most cost efficient and cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The plan has been the subject of an intensive examination by an interdepartmental review group.  I am currently studying that group's first report in the context of proposals to Government for implementation of the plan.  Needless to say there are important policy and fiancial considerations to be taken account of in this regard and decisions will have to be taken on matters which will affect the quality of policing in this State well into the next millennium.  I shall be placing my proposals before the Government in the matter shortly in the context of the action plan I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As regards Garda strength, the highest ever strength of 11,396, including 144 recruits in training, was in 1985.  The total fell back to around 10,500 in 1989 but rose to just under 11,000 at the end of 1992.  The present strength is 11,373 including 513 student gardaí at various stages of training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of Garda recruitment the position is that 1,000 gardaí have been taken on since 1989 and recruitment is ongoing from the current competition following a specific Government decision in 1991.  In line with previous policy 1,000 gardaí are <Col N="834" /> being recruited in the period 1992 to 1995.  Already, 269 gardaí have been taken on in 1992, and to date this year 294 have commenced training with a further 30 or so to be recruited later this year, though the figure may be higher.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme also contains a commitment to increase the number of gardaí through accelerated recruitment.  What is in mind here is a telescoping of the present four year recruitment plan to three years.  That is a matter which I have under active consideration at the moment and I hope to bring my proposals before the Government very soon.</P>
      <P>While it is my intention to maintain Garda numbers at this level I also want to increase Garda operational strength. That is the crucial matter.  I do not want to be recruiting young and highly motivated men and women to the ranks of the gardaí and giving them expensive training just to have them desk bound under mountains of paper and hidebound by bureaucracy. That is why I am committed to the principle of civilianisation in the Garda Síochána which is also a commitment in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years police forces all over the world have been recruiting more and more civilian staff for non-policing duties, especially in the clerical area.  At present, almost 700 civilian staff are employed on work in Garda offices which would otherwise have to be done by gardaí.  Apart altogether from savings in cost, the practical benefits of having gardaí doing the work they were recruited to do on the streets in our cities and towns are enormous.  However, I also think that the process of civilianisation should not stop at the level of clerical positions.  I see no reason civilians cannot be assimilated into the Garda structure at higher management levels.  A start has already been made in this connection for example, the fleet manager, the radio engineer and the head of research, soon to be appointed, are civilians and I see it as part of my brief to develop this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons charged in connection with drug offences and the <Col N="835" /> number of drug seizures showed an upward trend during 1992 &mdash; 13 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.  Although these increases show a major reduction in the rate of increase for the previous two years, they remain nevertheless very significant.  In this regard I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner on all aspects of drug-related crime. Indeed these meetings have resulted in changes in strategies to tackle the drugs problem including the allocation of manpower and resources.  In addition, discussions are held on a regular basis between officers of the Department of Justice, Revenue Commissioners and the Garda and Customs authorities to build on the co-operation that exists between the gardaí and customs officers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed about aspects of the co-operation effort at local level between the Garda and Customs service in the battle against drugs.  I have specifically directed an assistant secretary in my Department to examine that issue and report to me as a matter of urgency on it.  Extensive consultations have taken place and I expect a report in the near future.  I should of course emphasise that it is a question of improving co-operation not creating it for the first time.  The co-operation between both services is already quite extensive.  As evidence of this interagency co-operation, more than £26 million worth of cannabis resin has been seized by the Garda Síochána and the Customs authorities over the past two years and so far this year.  Discussions have also taken place between officers of the Departments of Justice and Defence in relation to the possibility of more extensive use of the Naval Service and the Air Corps service.</P>
    <P>Intelligence based strategies are central in combating the importation of drugs and the closest international co-operation is an essential prerequisite if such strategies are to prove effective.  A significant development in this respect was the decision by the European Council at its meeting in December 1991 that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established <Col N="836" /> as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.  I am confident that the Europol Drugs Unit will prove extremely effective in combating drug-related crime and will enhance the co-operation that has been taking place among EC member states for many years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the courts, specifically the subject of disposal of criminal business in our courts, I can assure this House that delays in the hearing of criminal cases are minimal and that priority is given in all our courts to the criminal business and, in particular, to cases where the defendant is in custody.  There are delays in the disposal of civil cases but it is not strictly relevant to today's motion and I am dealing with it separately.</P>
    <P>Deputies will of course be aware that procedures have been put in place to facilitate victims appearing in our courts and to emphasise the impact of crime on the victim.  The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, provides for an audio visual system in certain cases, including sexual offences, to enable witnesses under 17 years to give evidence and be cross-examined outside of the courtroom setting.  I recently signed regulations to bring into effect provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, allowing a witness to give evidence through a live television link at a preliminary examination of cases involving physicial or sexual abuse before a District Court and to allow for the transfer of proceedings to district courts which have the necessary technical facilities.  This development has been widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Facilities in courthouses are also being made available on request to the Irish Association for Victim Support, an organisation which also receives and deserves State financial support.  I intend, at the very minimum to maintain that support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context <Col N="837" /> of sentencing, I am glad to know that more judges are seeking reports on the impact of crimes on victims before imposing sentence.  This is a very welcome development.</P>
      <P>Another important initiative on the the courts side which is in the course of preparation is a system for the service of summonses by post by means of recorded delivery which will have many advantages including for other policing duties. My Department is also watching with interest pilot multi-media systems in other jurisdictions such as developments in court stenography and the use of closed circuit television linking courthouses, prisons and hospitals which may contribute to the more efficient use of court time and has the potential for considerable savings also in prisons and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>More generally, on the subject of courts the Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish an independent judicial commission to examine and make recommendations to the Government on the review and reform of court practices and the streamlining of court services.  Arrangements for establishing the commission are well advanced.</P>
      <P>With regard to prisons, as I mentioned I am currently carrying out a major review of official policy on the operation of prisons and the treatment of offenders generally.  I am aiming for a draft corporate strategy for the prisons which will clarify aims and objectives.  Finding the right balance between calls for more and tighter sentences and the operation of a humane criminal justice system which holds out the prospect of individual self-improvement by way of the prisons and the probation system is, as most Deputies will appreciate, a daunting task.  The task is made no easier by the fact that the generality of crime is so diverse, ranging as it does from petty property offences to the most serious offences against the person.  Among the options being considered are the provision of more cell places, and also the expansion of custody alternatives.  I will make a further statement in this regard when my review is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> As I mentioned the Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement the report of the Inter-departmental group which was set up by my predecessor in the wake of public disturbances in the Ronanstown area of County Dublin.  The group prepared a detailed report some of which is in course of implementation.  This task involves a co-ordinated intervention by Government Departments and State agencies to promote employment and improve education and environmental facilities and to provide the necessary level of social services, tailored to meet the actual needs of each area.  I hope to make a further statement in due course concerning progress on the implementation of this report.</P>
    <P>As well as providing the necessary resources to the various agencies within our criminal justice system it is clearly vital that our criminal law should be kept under continuous review and reformed where this is needed to adapt to &mdash; and cope effectively with &mdash; the modern realities of crime.  In this context the House will already be aware that since becoming Minister for Justice I have initiated a comprehensive programme of reform in this area.  For example, the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, contains a series of very important measures designed to make our system of justice place more emphasis on the plight of victims of crime.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill was debated in great detail for over 21 hours by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security Committee during the summer.  It is only right to acknowledge the generally constructive approach taken by Members from all sides of the House in dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to introduce two further pieces of major criminal justice reform later in this session.  The confiscation of proceeds Bill will, as its title suggests, deal with the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, the creation of an offence of money laundering, and give effect to a number of international agreements on international <Col N="839" /> co-operation in the areas of drug trafficking, money laundering and mutual assistance in criminal justice measures.  I will save Deputy Mitchell the bother of introducing a Bill within a month.  The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which I will also introduce, is intended to achieve improvements in the operation of the criminal justice system generally.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of other criminal law measures I have introduced since I became Minister for Justice, including the Criminal Procedure Bill which provides for new procedures to deal with cases of alleged miscarriages of justice. At present I am awaiting two important Law Reform Commission reports, one of which deals with the law on offences against the person and the other with sentencing policy.  As I assured the Select Committee on Legislation and Security during the summer, those reports will be acted upon as soon as they are received in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised a specific point in relation to hunting knives.  I am informed that the carrying of hunting knives is outlawed under the Fire Arms and Offensive Weapons Act but there is some vagueness in relation to the selling of such implements.  I will look at this point in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The entire area of juvenile justice is a priority in my Department and, as Deputy Mitchell was informed by me during the past few months, a juvenile justice Bill is in course of advanced preparation in my Department.  This Bill contains more than 150 sections.  Those sections have been sent by my Department to the Department of Education which has a crucial role to play in parental responsibility and juvenile justice generally.</P>
    <P>Some further areas of criminal justice legislation are also being given attention in my Department at present, including juvenile justice, fraud and dishonesty, offences against the person &mdash; I am awaiting a report from the Law Reform Commission on this issue &mdash; and the indexation of fines.  I intend to bring forward <Col N="840" /> proposals in all of those areas as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in relation to crime is one of realism and achievement. While much has been achieved, we are all acutely aware that more is required.  We are determined to press ahead with the task and to provide the resources necessary.  Molaim an rún seo don Teach.</P>

      <P>One of the striking things about a debate of this kind is that we end up with a case being presented that there is a problem and the Minister, in responding to that case trying &mdash; if she is not trying to convince us that there is no problem &mdash; to minimise the extent of the problem.  In the course of her contribution the Minister relied very heavily on the statistics presented in the recent Garda Síochána report on crime.  She referred to a 1 per cent increase here and a 1 per cent decrease elsewhere, comparing the statistics with those for the past few years and, more dramatically, with the high level of crime which existed in 1983.  With respect, that is missing the entire point because if one looks at the statistics on crime for the past 20-30 years one can clearly see what has been happening. The level of crime in Ireland at present is five times the level it was 30 years ago and the nature of crime has changed very dramatically.  Crimes which were virtually unheard of 20 years ago are now quite commonplace.  For example, the use of fire arms and weapons in robberies, burglaries and attacks on people is now very much part of the crime scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no consolation to the victim of a crime, a person who has been attacked, a person whose house has been burgled or a person who has had their car broken into or stolen, to be told that the crime <Col N="841" /> statistics do not show a significant increase in the level of crime.  Many people in our community are living in fear, are afraid to leave their homes, are afraid to open the doors of their homes and are afraid to go about their ordinary business, particularly at night.  The basic freedoms we should be defending are the freedoms of those people to go about their normal business; that is what the battle against crime is all about.  The battle against crime, put positively, is a battle to enable people to go about their normal business without living in fear, without being molested, without being intimidated and without being subjected to attack or vandalism.</P>
    <P>Like any problem we have to address, it is important that we go to the source. It is remarkable that the concentration in much of the public commentary about crime over the past few years has been on what one does when a vandal is caught.  The usual kind of answer is trotted out &mdash; build more prisons, provide more places in jails, impose stiffer sentences, ensure tougher application of the law by judges, etc.  To a certain extent, I would go along with much of that thinking. However, the thinking is defective because it addresses the problem after it has occurred; it addresses the problem of crime after the crime has been committed, for example, after a victim has been very badly injured.  We need to focus our attention much more acutely on the prevention of crime.  Prevention is not just about putting more gardaí on the street.  We could cover our streets with gardaí but we still would not necessarily prevent all of the crime which takes place.</P>
    <P>The survey carried out by the <i>Irish Independent</i> at the weekend has been referred to by a number of speakers.  The most remarkable finding in that survey was the extent to which the public understands the causes of crime and the circumstances which give rise to crime.  It seems that the public understanding is way ahead of that of Members of this House and many commentators on crime.  I was struck by the fact that almost half the people asked to give their views <Col N="842" /> on the single factor contributing most to the rise in the level of crime identified unemployment as that factor.</P>
    <P>Significantly, many people identified associated causes, poverty and the social circumstances which high unemployment produces, as contributing to creating the climate in which crime breeds.  That, of course, never justifies crime nor does it explain it away.  The vast majority of unemployed people do not become involved in crime.  In fact, very often the people who are living in the poorest communities are the first victims of crime, the first victims of the drug pushing and physical crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, in his contribution, described the physical environment in those communities, the dilapidation and the neglect which, coupled with the levels of unemployment, give rise inevitably to a climate where crime is prevalent.  I agree it is easier for criminals to commit crime in an estate or a block of flats where there is no public lighting and a general state of dereliction but often in those communities, which people are quick to identify as areas with high levels of crime, there are people trying to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>In trying to prevent crime, money would be better spent assisting the community organisations, residents' associations, sports clubs, youth clubs and voluntary bodies who are trying to keep their communities together, to keep youngsters off the street and to create recreational facilities for young people in their immediate areas.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that the national lottery funds have been virtually hijacked by successive Governments for purely political gain.  They have been doled out at strategic times, before an election and so on, in order to give the impression that there is support for local communities. National lottery funds should be used to support voluntary organisations in their battle against crime.  We should help the sports clubs who are required to raise funds to keep their clubs in operation. Regularly members of sports clubs tell me that because whatever discretionary spending in the community is being used <Col N="843" /> to buy national lottery tickets and so on, they are not in a position to raise the money needed to keep their teams going. It would be better to spend £1,000 on a local club &mdash; virtually what it will cost to keep somebody in prison for a little more than a week &mdash; than to spend money after the crime has been committed and the damage has been done.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has put the juvenile justice Bill before the Department of Education but there is a need for more than a purely legislative response to the problem.  There is a need for a greater degree of co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Education and the Environment to make facilities and resources available to local communities to help them address the problem and build communities in which crime will not thrive.</P>
    <P>Many of the contributions on this motion have concentrated on the question of policing and addressing the crime problem.  Of course, when one is addressing the crime problem one has to consider what is happening.  We must examine two areas.  The first is the level of crime attributed to juveniles.  The figures are known to all Members.  It is remarkable that although almost half the crime here is attributed to juveniles we have only a little more than 80 juvenile liaison officers.  Second, it is remarkable that although 55 per cent of all crime committed here occurs in the greater Dublin area, only approximately one-third of the country's police force is based in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Mitchell I did not have access to the most recent figure for the number of gardaí as quoted by the Minister this evening.  That figure included the number of students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Once upon a time they were regarded as gardaí on the day they were recruited.  Now they are recruits earning a very small pay.  To include them in the statistics is totally misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not including them <Col N="844" /> in my statistics because my statistics show a figure 10,984 gardaí in the State, of whom 3,988 were based in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The Minister told us on a previous occasion that that works out at a ratio of one garda per 260 people in Dublin as against a national average of one garda per 320 people.  That distorts the picture somewhat because the Dublin Garda figure includes those gardaí engaged in special duties within the Dublin area, those engaged in this House, the policing of major events, special duties associated with the courts, embassies, guarding VIPs and so on.  The real picture is that the number of gardaí available for normal policing duties in Dublin is much less than the 3,988 quoted.</P>
      <P>Dublin would be under policed even if the level of crime was similar to that in the rest of the country but the remarkable statistic in the Garda report on crime, which was published last week, is that the crime rate in Dublin is three times the rate outside the city.  The crime rate given in the Garda report is 49 crimes per 1,000 population in Dublin and 17.8 crimes per 1,000 people outside of the Dublin area. The number of drug related crimes was 3,494 and 2,154 of them &mdash; almost two-thirds &mdash; occurred in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>Of the 12,000 crimes including motor vehicles 8,500 occurred in the Dublin area.  Of the 1,497 missing persons 1,137 cases were in the Dublin area.  Of &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls 165,313 out of a total of 206,985 nationwide occurred in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>It will be quite clear to anybody that the crisis points, the areas in which the largest amount of crimes committed, are those in which there is the lowest level of policing.  It is not unreasonable to state that there is a &ldquo;cause and effect&rdquo; situation prevailing.  Major social problems contribute to the climate in which crime grows.  Where the levels of policing are inadequate, there are the highest levels of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in her approach to the provision of gardaí must devote particular attention to the Dublin area.  Of <Col N="845" /> course, it would be difficult to make the case that remote areas of the country should be denuded of gardaí and that they should be sent to Dublin.  I am not making that case, but I am making the case that newly recruited gardaí should be deployed in the Dublin area where the crime problem is out of proportion to that in the remainder of the country.  On the question of recruitment, I would have to dispute what the Minister said in the course of her contribution.  It was interesting that she referred to the Garda five-year plan and her support for it.  She talked about the numbers of recruits, about 1,000 gardaí being recruited between 1992 and 1995.  My understanding of the Garda corporate plan presented to the Minister was that they spoke about a recruitment over the same period which was about twice what is actually taking place, that they spoke about an annual recruitment, in order to stand still, I think in the region of 510 gardaí per annum over that precise period.  It appears that the level of recruitment to the Garda is significantly behind the levels envisaged in the corporate plan.</P>

      <P>This has been a very important week in Irish politics with the launch of the National Development Plan which was most welcome.  In that plan the Government sets out its proposals for job creation and for economic development and prosperity over the forthcoming six years.  I hope those Government objectives will be realised for the good of the nation.</P>
      <P>Prosperity without security will be of little use to our people if they live in fear of their lives and property, of danger to their families.  This has become very evident in several cities in America, especially in Washington, where law and order have broken down.  We do not want this to occur here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being my party's spokesperson on tourism I might refer specifically to the problem of crime committed against tourists.  Much attention is devoted to the development of tourism in the National Development Plan and much emphasis is <Col N="846" /> placed on tourism as a sector that will deliver extra jobs.  It is alarming when one observes how little has been done to combat crime against tourists, especially in this city.</P>
    <P>According to recent figures furnished to me, in 1992 2,841 crimes were committed against tourists, 2,239 of which occurred in the greater Dublin area and 609 in the remainder of the country.  That represents approximately 2.97 per cent of the overall crime rate which, while appearing to be insignificant, when measured by its potential impact on our tourist industry, gives rise to concern, if not alarm, in some circles.</P>
    <P>I understand that to date in 1993 2,552 offences have been reported.  No doubt when the figures are available for the full year they will be more or less the same as those for 1992 showing that there has been no decrease in the overall trend. This gives rise to much concern.  This problem has been identified in this House, the Minister has proposed various solutions, there has been much contact between Bord Fáilte, the Minister and the Garda, yet the problem remains.</P>
    <P>The alarming aspect is that in 1992 112 offenders were convicted by our courts but, to date in 1993, 25 offenders only have been convicted.  This is quite alarming and demonstrates a major deficiency within our overall judicial system.</P>
    <P>Tourists are regarded by criminals as soft targets.  Usually they arrive in a very relaxed frame of mind expecting to find this country as it is sold to them on holiday brochures, a green, peaceful island. They can become totally disillusioned if they become the victims of crime.  We must maintain that good image of our country to which I have referred.  Generally tourists carry quite an amount of cash on their persons &mdash; in the case of women, in their handbags.  They wear jewellery most of the time, a very marketable commodity.  They bring cameras, including video cameras, binoculars and so on, which are rich pickings for the criminals.</P>
    <P>Some of the crimes committed against tourists may not be of a very serious type. <Col N="847" /> Over 50 per cent involve thefts of or from motor vehicles, while most others relate to offences by pickpockets and so on. Nonetheless approximately 6 per cent involve the use of violence.  That aspect in the course of this summer became even more alarming in that it involved a more intensified type of violence.  We heard of cases of tourists having been threatened at knife point, with needles and, in several cases, being physically assaulted.  I must warn the Minister that the international media are beginning to take an interest in what is happening to some tourists who come to Ireland.  For example, when on holiday in August last I read an article in the <i>London Times,</i> the caption of which was &ldquo;Mugging of Dublin Tourists Increases&rdquo;.  This followed on the injuries sustained by a student priest when he had gone to the assistance of a Swiss holidaymaker who was being robbed.  There has been reference also in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> to attacks on tourists in Dublin.  The Minister will agree that we can do without such publicity.  We have observed the drop in tourism that has taken place in Florida because of the spate of attacks on tourists there.  We do not want this to happen in Dublin.</P>
    <P>While I would be the first to contend we should not be alarmist or exaggerate the effect on tourism, it is something we must face up to and not allow to continue. There is no point in pretending it should be ignored or should not be highlighted.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals to counter these problems have been advanced.  The problem arises because of lack of prison places.  The revolving door principle obtains in our prisons, in that prisoners appear to enter by one door and leave by another.  Apart from tourists swearing affidavits before leaving the country, giving evidence on camera in court, or whatever, we must provide the requisite number of prison places for offenders.  It is alarming to note that many crimes are committed by people who are either on bail or on temporary release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak this evening about the anxieties and frustrations felt by several small communities who live along the N63 route in Counties Galway, Roscommon and Longford.  The N63 originates at Laghtgeorge about ten miles north of Galway city and continues through Turloughmore, Knockmoy Abbey, Moylough, Mount Bellew, Newbridge, Ballygar, Athleague, Roscommon, Lanesboro and into Longford &mdash; a total distance of about 60 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This national primary road is a disgrace for the thousands of people who have to use it every day of their lives.  It is also a very important road in that it connects Galway city with Roscommon and Longford &mdash; all very busy commercial towns. The volume of traffic is increasing at a dramatic rate but the structural condition is deteriorating at an even greater pace. Cyclists and school children are taking their lives in their hands on this crooked, hilly and dangerous road.  In order to highlight the dangers and the lack of action on this route many of the town development associations and other groups in the small towns and villages have co-ordinated their efforts recently to try to obtain funding to get a meaningful start on the road.  The preferred choice of the local groups is to get the N63 <Col N="849" /> road upgraded in status from a national secondary to a national primary road. Taking into account the level of traffic and the important routes serviced by the N63, a very good case can be made for such a proposal.  However, these groups will be shattered this evening with the news that the much publicised National Development Plan has actually earmarked certain EC funds for some national secondary routes, which, I understand, is the first time this has happened. The following is an extract from the National Development Plan 1994-1999, Chapter 9, page 100:</P>
    <P>National secondary routes are also part of the strategic road network, accounting for 2.8% of the total road mileage and 11% of traffic.  They perform an important economic function as medium-distance through-routes connecting important towns, serving medium-sized to large geographical areas and providing links to the national primary routes...  There will also be investment in a number of other routes of very significant importance such as the N70 (Ring of Kerry), N56 to Killybegs, N71 (Cork-Killarney), N59 (Galway-Clifden), N61 (Athlone-Boyle) and the N76 (Kilkenny-Clonmel). Investment of £115 million is planned for the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
    <P>Why leave out the N63?  Given that funding has been obtained for the secondary routes, why has the N63 been omitted?  I consider it an insult to every family from Laghtgeorge to Longford.  It is a shameless decision and I do not know who is behind it.  I would like the Minister to answer the charge by the thousands of people who use that road every day.  They will be extremely disappointed that it is not included for upgrading.  Do we take it that there will be no EC funding for the next five years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me.  I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words in support of the upgrading of the N63 road.  I should like to convey to the Minister of State that this is the main <Col N="850" /> Galway, Roscommon, Longford road and it is a very busy route.  I spoke at a public meeting on 14 June 1993 at which a gentleman said he surveyed traffic passing his house and found that 311 cars passed in a half hour one afternoon.  That gives an indication of how busy this road is.  I am aware that all the communities along that stretch of road wish to have it upgraded.  Over the years they have seen that most of the money is spent on the national primary routes and the required amount is not spent on the national secondary roads.  For example, in 1992 Galway County Council received a total road grant of £8.847 million but only £500,000 was allocated to the national secondary roads.  It is time this road, which is very busy, was given the higher status.  I would like if the Minister's officials would investigate the very bad stretches along the N63 route.  The Minister is coming to Galway on 29 October. I would be glad if he would drive on that stretch of road and hopefully meet with some of the communities who wish to have it upgraded.  People along this route, particularly in Moylough and Brierfield, prefer to go into the town of Tuam and take the primary route into Galway rather than travel on this very dangerous road.  There is also a problem with flooding which makes it dangerous and the whole structure is bad.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I understand from the National Development Plan that £1,250 million is to be spent on the main national road network, which includes primary and secondary routes.  We are told in the plan that these routes carry a quarter of all road traffic.  I hope some of those funds can be spent and that a start can be made immediately on the N63.  The preferred option is to have the road upgraded to national primary status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: I thank Deputies Connaughton and Kitt for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is at present reviewing the national road classifications following the recent enactment of the Roads Act, 1993.  The review will be completed <Col N="851" /> before responsibility for these roads is transferred to the National Roads Authority from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>I have to say, however, that I do not anticipate any major changes arising from this review, for two main reasons. Firstly, the existing network is more than adequate for our present and future traffic needs and was decided upon after a lengthy consideration and consultation with local authorities.  Secondly, additions to the network only serve to dilute the funds available for the national primary network by spreading the same level of finance over a longer mileage of roads.  I also have to say that reclassification of a national secondary road to national primary status does not in itself guarantee extra funding since expenditure priorities have to be determined on the basis of established need.</P>
    <P>My Department has looked again at the N63 and has concluded that it does not meet the criteria for reclassification to national primary status.  The N63 Galway/Roscommon/Longford road is a typical national secondary road, linking a number of urban centres and forming an extension to the national primary road network.  This road carries relatively light levels of traffic and even if it were reclassified it would simply join the bottom of a long queue of national primary roads which require investment.</P>
    <P>As a national secondary road the N63 is fully funded by my Department.  Over the last two years more than £750,000 has been invested in it between Longford town and Galway and I hope to continue the improvement of this road in the coming years.  This investment will, however, be targeted in the areas of greatest need, eliminating deficiencies in the most heavily trafficked sections of the road.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan, which was launched yesterday, acknowledges the significant development needs of the national secondary road network amounting to £370 million.  In recognition of this need it is planned to provide a total investment of £115 million in the network in the period 1994-99.  This is <Col N="852" /> almost double the actual expenditure on national secondary roads under the current programme.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies Kitt and Connaughton that if they make representations to the Minister, who is a very reasonable man, I am sure he will be only too glad to inspect the roadway when he is in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter and I also thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is undoubtedly aware, during last week Macroom Urban District Council was obliged to notify residents in Macroom who avail of the town's public water supply that the water quality was such as to render it unsuitable for human consumption.  That was the latest and most serious development in the sorry saga which has been going on for a number of years.  I would like to pay tribute to the staff and members of Macroom Urban District Council for the manner in which they handled the most recent incident.  By and large, they have been the unfair targets of much of the local public odium which should be directly refocused on the Department of the Environment for its failure to sanction the improvement scheme which has been with the Department for more than two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week's incident aside, the reality is that for each of the past two years <Col N="853" /> the town council has had to notify the Department of the Environment of its failure to meet an EC directive on the quality of drinking water and at the same time the Department failed to sanction approval for the Macroom water supply improvement scheme.  As I stated already, proposals for the scheme have been awaiting approval by the Department for more than two years while the health and welfare of residents in Macroom are being put in jeopardy.  On my behalf, on behalf of Macroom Urban District Council and, more importantly, on behalf of all those forced to accept a substandard water supply &mdash; many of whom, at considerable inconvenience, have stopped using their domestic supply in favour of alternative sources &mdash; I appeal to the Minister to give immediate approval to the council to proceed with the new scheme.</P>
    <P>In making this case I would like to refer to the continuing cost which Macroom Urban District Council is forced to carry due to the failure of the Department to give immediate sanction for the scheme. Stop-gap measures to hold together the antiquated system is costing the urban council approximately £20,000 per annum.  Also, significant costs were incurred in the planning of the new water supply scheme which overall results in a total cost to Macroom Urban District Council of approximately £250,000.  It is about time the Department recognised that a small urban district council such as Macroom can no longer afford to carry such overheads.  Major efforts have been made, spearheaded by and large by Macroom Urban District Council, to improve its public image in order to attract new industry and an inadequate water supply is a shortcoming we can do without.  The solution to the problem rests solely with the officials of the Department of the Environment who must answer to the people in the locality of Macroom.</P>
    <P>I understand that my constituency colleague, Deputy Moynihan and members of the urban district council, for the third time, sought a meeting with the Minister <Col N="854" /> in regard to this matter.  We have waited long enough.  Macroom Urban District Council have been waiting for some time for a bypass of the town and for improvements in our urban road grant.  We feel a much forgotten urban district council when it comes to financial allocations from the Department of the Environment. The launch of the National Development Plan, which was announced to the sound of great trumpets in the past 24 hours, rings very hollow in Macroom when for years we have failed to get a brown penny from the Department for an urban water supply scheme. We do not want any quick fixes in respect of this matter.  We want approval for the scheme, the proposals of which have been with the Minister's Department for the last two years, and nothing less will be acceptable to my constituency colleagues, members of the urban district council or myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am aware of the recent urgent problem affecting the Macroom public water supply.  Drinking water quality is a major priority of the Government's environment action programme. We are committed to achieving compliance with stringent EC drinking water standards in all areas of the country and we have intensified a programme of capital investment and of environmental monitoring to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the emergency measures recently taken by Macroom Urban District Council were on a precautionary basis to ensure that the public would not consume water which might be bacteriologically unsound.  I have been assured that immediate steps were taken at local level to alleviate and remedy the situation in line with the procedures set out in the Guidelines for the Protection of Drinking Water Supplies, which were issued to sanitary authorities by my Department in December 1992.  Householders were notified to boil all water before use; alternative water supplies were made available to those affected; <Col N="855" /> monitoring and analysis of the supply was intensified and is being continued; and public notices were issued to the media to alert householders about what action they should take.</P>
    <P>I understand that following on from the actions of the sanitary authority in implementing remedial measures at the water intake, an improvement in the quality of the water being made available to consumers was achieved.  This resulted in the &ldquo;Notice to Boil&rdquo; being withdrawn on Friday last and the local authority consider that water quality has continued to be satisfactory since then.  The Deputy will appreciate that immediate responsibility for managing last week's urgent situation rests with the local authority and that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on details of that situation at this stage.</P>
    <P>Tender proposals for the Macroom water supply improvement scheme are with my Department.  Water supply and sewerage schemes are now being prioritized for inclusion in the post 1993 operational programme in the context of the next round of Structural Funds.  In relation to water supply schemes, priority in the shorter-term has to be given to schemes to alleviate significant and constant quality problems.  The requirements of Macroom will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am conscious that any scheme that might be approved will take some time to implement.  Accordingly, officials in my Department have been in contact with the local authority with a view to exploring any short-term measures that might help in ensuring that the recent problems do not recur.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that efforts will continue to achieve a solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch díot as ucht cead a thabhirt dom an cheist seo tharraingt anuas anseo anocht.  Tá coiste na Gaelscoile seo ag iarraidh aitheantas a fháil don Ghaelscoil ón Roinn agus aitheantas do cheapachán an Phríomhoide.</P>
      <P>Tá Cnoc na Cathrach ar imeall chathair na Gaillimhe agus tá sé ar imeal Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe.  Tá 1,700 tithe tógtha sa cheantar seo le 10 mbliana anuas.  Cé gur tógadh an méid sin tithe agus cé go bhfuil clanna éagsúla ina gcónaí ann, níor tógadh aon bhunscoil speisialta don cheantar.  Tá formhór na bpáistí ag freastal ar scoileanna éagsúla atá idir, leathmhíle agus trí mhíle uathu &mdash; sé sin na scoileanna i mBearna, i Móna Beag, i mBóthar na Trá agus scoileanna éagsúla atá lonnaithe ar fud cathair na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>Tháinig roinnt de na tuismitheoirí le chéile chun na Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa cheantar agus shocraíodar Gaelscoil a bhunú &mdash; deis iontach í seo chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú, a fhorbairt agus a fheabhsú sa cheantar sin.  Thabharfadh sé deis dá bpáistí chomh maith eolas, líofacht agus ábaltacht a bheith acu ina dteanga náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>Tá tacaíocht ag an gcoiste ó Easpag na Gaillimhe, Séamas Mac Lochlainn, agus cheana féin tá 21 dalta ag freastal ar an scoil atá bunaithe acu agus atá ar shuíomh sealadach atá faighte acu ó cheann de na conraitheoirí a thóg na tithe sa cheantar. Tá múinteoir an-chumasach ar fad acu ón fíor-Ghaeltacht agus go dtí seo tá an-dul chun cinn déanta sa scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an dea-shampla agus an dea-mhéin don Ghaeilge léirithe ag an gcoiste sealadach seo &mdash; sé sin an coiste a bhunaigh an scoil.  An rud is mó atá ag teastáil anois ná aitheantas oifigiúil ón Roinn don scoil <Col N="857" /> mar Ghaelscoil agus don mhúinteoir atá ceapaithe.  Is cinnte go mbeidh fás mór ar líon na ndaltaí nuair a bheidh fios dearfa ag na tuismitheoirí go bhfuil aitheantas ag an scoil mar Ghaelscoil.</P>
    <P>Níl an scoil seo ag freastal ar pháistí ón fíor-Ghaeltacht.  Is í an Béarla teanga labharta beagnach gach teach i gCnoc na Cathrach &mdash; suas le 95 faoin gcéad díobh ar aon nós.</P>
    <P>Ach tá bá i measc na dtuismitheoirí ansin don Ghaeilge agus teastaíonn uathu go mbéadh ábaltacht, eolas agus líofacht sa teanga ag a bpáistí.  Tá siad den tuairim gurb é an tslí is fearr chun sin a bhaint amach ná go mbeadh na páistí ag freastal ar Ghaelscoil, sé sin scoil ina mbeadh gach ábhar á mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge agus gurb í an Ghaeilge a bheadh fite fuaite trí clár na scoile.</P>
    <P>Tá na tuismitheoirí agus an coiste sealadach ag iarraidh aitheantas a fháil don scoil mar fhíor-Ghaelscoil agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann sin a chur in iúl dúinn.  Muna bhfuil sé in ann sin a chur in iúl dúinn anocht tá súil agam ar a laghad go ndéanfaidh sé an cheist seo a scrúdú go géar agus go mbeidh sé bá úil don iarratas agus go mbeidh deascéal uaidh go luath.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Donegal South West)</i>: Sa gcéad dul síos gabhaim buíochas leis an dTeachta Molloy de bharr gur luaigh se an cheist thábhachtach seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfidh me a chur in iúl don Teach agus don Teachta i dtosach gurb é polasaí na Roinne aitheantas a thabhairt, faoi réir coinníollacha áirithe, do bhunscoileanna lánGhaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Bíonn an Roinn sásta an t-aitheantas sin a thabhairt nuair a theastaíonn ó thuismitheoirí go bhfaigheadh a gcuid páistí oideachais trí Ghaeilge, nuair a chuirtear tairiscint réasúnta faoi bhráid le scoil nua a bhunú, nuair nach mbíonn scoil lánGhaeilge cheana féin san aichearracht agus nuair is dóigh go bhfreastalódh <Col N="858" /> dóthain páistí ar an scoil, sé sin fiche daltaí, ar a laghad, sa chéad scoil-bhliain.</P>
    <P>Aitheantas coinníollach amháin a thugtar do scoil nua lánGhaeilge i dtús báire go dtí go mbítear sásta go n-éireoidh leí.  Le linn na tréimhse sin is cúram é d'údaráis na scoile cóiriocht shealadach a chur ar fáil.  Bíonn an Roinn sásta deontas a íoc i leith costais cíosa, áfach.</P>
    <P>Seoladh an t-iarrtas iomlán chun bunscoil lánGhaeilge nua a bhunú &mdash; Scoil Mhic Amhlaigh &mdash; i gCnoc na Cathrach, cathair na Gaillimhe, chuig an Roinn i Mí lúil seo chaite.  Is cosúil, áfach, nach raibh fiche páiste ionrollaithe ag an scoil ag an bpointe sin.</P>
    <P>Gan aitheantas na Roinne a bheith gafa ag an scoil, thóg an Bord Bainistíochta sealadach orthú féin príomhoide a cheapadh, cóiriocht a fháil ar chíos agus an scoil a oscailt ag tús Mí Meán Fómhair.</P>
    <P>I lár Mí Meán Fómhair cuireadh in iúl don Roinn go raibh an scoil tar éis an sprioc fiche páiste a bhaint amach.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta tá 21 phaiste ansin anois.  De thoradh sin, thug Cigire na Roinne cuairt ar an scoil agus tá sé tar eis an tuairisc cuí a chur ar fáil don Roinn.</P>
    <P>Is cosúil ón scrúdú atá déanta ar an iarratas seo go bhfuil an ceantar atá i gceist, Cnoc na Cathrach, <i>suite sa Ghaeltacht.</i> Ach, mar a dúras cheana, séard atá i 'nGaelscoil' ná scoil lánGhaeilge suite lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Idir an dá linn tá an Roinn chun an scéal a chíoradh a thuilleadh féachaint conus is fearr freastal ar riachtanaisaí oideachasúla na bpáistí sa cheantar.</P>
    <P>Tá an Roinn Oideachais ag rá ag an bpointe seo nach bhfuil siadsan in ann an t-aitheantas cuí mar Ghaelscoil a thabhairt don scoil seo &mdash; Scoil Mhic Amhlaigh.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis na pointí atá déanta ag an Teachta Molloy.  Ós rud é go bhfuil an ceantar seo taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht, tá an-fhorbairt déanta ansin thar na blianta.  Ach ag an am chéanna cé go bhfuil cuid de taobh istigh de theorainn na Gaeltachta tá na páistí ansin imeallach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím i gcónaí roimh Ghaelscoileanna <Col N="859" /> i gceantar ar bith sa tír agus tugaim an-bhuíochas do na daoine go léir atá taobh thiar de seo.  Tá a lántacáiochta faighte acu, mar adúirt an Teachta, ó Easpag na Gaillimhe chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil coinníoll ag an Roinn Oideachais i láthair na huaire maidir le scoileanna taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht, glacaim leis an pointe ag an Teachta <Col N="860" /> Molloy nach bhfuil an ceantar go léir taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá curaimí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ormsa agus tá mé sásta dul i dteangbháil chomh uath agus is féidir leis an Aire Oideachais chun an scéal seo a réiteach.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Ireland has the second highest unemployment rate in the Community, the highest being for Spain. While all EC member states experienced increases in unemployment because of the downturn in the world economy, Ireland has also been subject to exceptional demographic pressure which is a major contributor to the increases here over the past three years or so.</P>
      <P>With regard to plans to improve the employment situation in the coming year, I intend to continue to maintain the macroeconomic and fiscal strategy of recent years.  This, together with ongoing structural reforms, is crucial for investment and long-term growth which in turn is essential for sustainable employment growth.  As in my previous budgets, this was the central element in this year's budget and developments in the economy since the end of February have vindicated my budgetary strategy.  In contrast to most EC member states where employment is falling, employment in Ireland is holding up well.  A clear indication of this is that employment-related revenues for the first three quarters of this year were well up on the outturn for the comparable period in 1992.  Furthermore, the trend in unemployment has slowed considerably with the end-September seasonally adjusted total only 1,000 higher than at end-November 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations for a successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will shortly get under way.  If we are to make serious inroads into unemployment it is essential that the pay terms of the new Programme &mdash; for both the public and private sectors &mdash; enable the economy to make gains in competitiveness in 1994 and in the following <Col N="669" /> two years.  Accordingly, over the coming months, I will make every effort to obtain the agreement of the social partners to pay increases consistent with this goal.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan which was launched yesterday will also have an impact on unemployment over the coming 12 months.  The plan has long-term sustainable growth in output and employment in the Irish economy as its primary objective.  Specific projects designated to impact rapidly on unemployment, and particulary to benefit the long-term unemployed, form an integral part of the plan.  Simultaneously, programmes for infrastructural and sectoral development designed to enhance the productive potential of the economy over the long-term are being put in place.  Just as the problem of unemployment is multifaceted, so also is the National Development Plan, consisting as it does of measures to increase infrastructural investment, improve competitiveness, harness local initiative and develop human resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 48, 50 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there has been a <Col N="672" /> much higher level of inquiries than normal about amounts of tax outstanding as well as a considerable volume of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the amnesty scheme.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that the scheme is still very much at a preliminary stage of implementation.  In the case of the 15 per cent incentive amnesty taxpayers have until 30 November, 1993 to submit declarations of income and gains for the purposes of the amnesty, and have until 14 January, 1994 to make actual payments.  Similarly in the case of the general amnesty for interest and penalties, payment can be made up to 14 January next.  Going by the experience of the 1988 amnesty the bulk of payments are likely to emerge only very close to the cut-off date.  Therefor the overall results will not be available until after that date.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, special confidentiality arrangements apply to the 15 per cent incentive amnesty which is administered by the Office of the Chief Special Collector.  Consistent with the guarantees of confidentiality the legislation provides that I may obtain certain information only and this is in the form of aggregates only.  This information relates to the total amount of the declared amounts, the total amount of settlement amounts, the total amount of value-added tax remitted to the Chief Special Collector and the total numbers of individuals who remitted amounts to the Chief Special Collector.  I will be seeking the information on declarations provided for by the legislation after the cut-off date of 30 November and the other information mentioned at the appropriate juncture.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am not in a position to provide the specific information requested by Deputies.  If Deputies wish to put down a question after 30 November of course, I will, then be happy to supply them with the information available on declared amounts under the incentive amnesty.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there is no reliable basis which would enable a forecast of the possible overall yield under the amnesty to be made at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> As regards the Office of the Chief Special Collector, nine special collectors have been nominated to date under the legislation, one of whom has been designated as the Chief Special Collector.</P>

      <P>In 1992 the European Investment Bank EIB provided loans totalling 16.9 billion ECU &mdash; IR£13.5 billion &mdash; within the European Community of which nearly half went to the private sector.  This is a sizeable proportion of EIB's lending activities and represents a valuable contribution to the balanced development of the Community as over 70 per cent of it went to the underdeveloped regions.</P>
      <P>Since 1973 EIB lending to the Irish private sector has totalled approximately IR£255 million, made up mainly of loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. In recent years, however, the take-up of EIB loans by the Irish private sector has been relatively low at some IR£21.2 million since 1991.</P>
      <P>A number of reasons could be put forward for this, such as the availability of competitive alternative domestic sources of finance, EIB's strict financial and security conditions and a reluctance on the part of Irish investors to take on the exchange risk which would be involved in borrowing foreign currencies or to lock into long-term fixed interest loans at times when interest rates were perceived to be high.  EIB lending is, of course, available only for long-term, economically viable, capital investment projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that EIB does not lend on the basis of geographical or sectoral quotas or proportions.  There is no specific proportion of EIB moneys allocated to Ireland.  Therefore, Irish borrowers have access to EIB loans on <Col N="674" /> the same terms as those elsewhere in the Community.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that EIB loans are provided on strictly commercial terms and, although they can be very competitive, are not soft loans or subsidised by the bank in any way.  The sourcing of finance is ultimately determined by each individual borrower exercising his/her right to obtain the most suitable and competitive loan finance from whatever source is available.</P>
    <P>I am constantly seeking to maximise, as far as possible, EIB lending to all sectors in Ireland, both public and private.  My Department, in conjunction with the EIB, will continue to examine ways in which the current situation might be improved.</P>

There are certain expenditure pressures emerging, particularly in the health area where additional expenditure of the order of £30-35 million may be required on demand-led schemes and on the implementation of the Child Care Act.  Additional costs may also arise in the agriculture area as a result of costs associated with the realignment of the punt.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in relation to payment of the probate tax are such that, where there are sufficient liquid assets in the deceased's estate to meet tax liability, the tax is required to be paid on delivery of the Inland Revenue Affidavit prior to the granting of probate or letters of administration. Interest on unpaid tax does not begin to accrue until nine months after the date of death and, where payment is made before this nine month period has elapsed, a discount of 1¼ per cent per month, or part of a month, is allowed.</P>
      <P>Where the estate is predominantly made up of illiquid assets, or hardship arises, payment of the tax may be deferred by arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners until after probate or administration of the estate is granted. The terms of deferred payment will be determined by agreement with Revenue having regard to the particular circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners process the Inland Revenue Affidavit within a matter of a few days. This allows the process of extracting a grant of probate to proceed quickly and thereby helps to keep to a minimum the cost of any short-term bridging finance required to pay the tax.  Moreover, the early payment discount &mdash; which, for example, would amount to 7½ per cent of tax due where payment is made three and a half months after the date of death &mdash; should in most cases adequately compensate for the small interest cost of any such bridging finance.</P>
    <P>While the operation of the probate tax will be kept under review, I do not have any plans to introduce changes in so far as the provisions relating to payment are concerned.  I am satisfied that, having regard to the low rate of tax and the reliefs available, these provisions take due account of ability to pay and are reasonable in the circumstances.  At the same time the payment provisions will facilitate efficient collection of the tax and will protect Exchequer yield.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that the farmers are not the only group or people in this country who can be said to work extraordinarily long hours throughout the year.  Many groups within the self-employed and the PAYE sectors work long hours, while others have to work unsociable hours.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of encouraging an improvement in production among the farming community, the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy in Ireland together with spending in the agricultural sector under the National Development Plan provide various supports to Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of allocating more generous tax allowances to farmers, I might point out that the farming community is already in receipt of several tax reliefs that would not be available to other sectors of the community.  For example, farmers can claim stock relief which allows 25 per cent of the cost of increases in the value of stock to be written off against trading profits.  There is no clawback of the relief if stock levels <Col N="680" /> drop.  Farming is the only trade to which stock relief applies.  Farmers can also claim capital allowances in respect of expenditure on the construction of farm buildings (excluding a building or part of a building used as a dwelling), fences, roadways, holding yards, drains or land reclamation.  These can be written off at 10 per cent per annum, which is a higher level of relief than that available in respect of industrial buildings, for example, where the capital cost can be written off at 4 per cent per annum over 25 years.  In addition, a farmer may also choose to avail of income averaging, where the income for tax purposes is assumed to be the average annual income for the past three years.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should point out that any additional tax reliefs accorded to any particular sector or group would have to be met by increased taxation in other areas or by cuts in public expenditure or both.  By curtailing various allowances and concessions over recent years, the Government has successfully reduced rates of income tax, an achievement which has benefited the whole community. In view of the current level of allowances available to farmers which are not available to other sectors, and the various supports for Irish farmers provided by the Common Agricultural Policy and the National Development Plan, there does not appear to be a case for more generous tax allowances for farmers to encourage production.</P>

      <P>The Government has no programme for sales of shares in State companies.  The Government's policy in this matter is that any change in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest and in the best interest of the company and its <Col N="681" /> employees and following consultation with the social partners.  The Government guarantees that the main strategic utilities and enterprises will remain in the ownership of the Irish people.  There are no plans at present for the disposal of all or part of the State's shareholding in any State-owned companies.  Other state assets, such as State property which is surplus to requirements, are disposed of on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to the proceeds of sales of State assets is that they will be used to reduce borrowing and, thus, to help ease the burden of the national debt and of debt servicing costs.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the widespread interest expressed by Government and Opposition Deputies during the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1993, he will use his powers under the Value-Added Tax Act to make refund orders in respect of equipment provided for schools by parents, parents associations or other benefactors, where such equipment is wholly and exclusively for use by the school, is duly vouched for by the school authorities and is certified by the Minister for Education.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 20, subsection 3, of the VAT Act empowers me to make refund orders in respect of VAT borne which does not qualify for deduction in the normal way, subject to whatever conditions are considered necessary.  Some existing refund schemes operate for social and philanthropic purposes, for example, the scheme for certain medical equipment purchased by voluntary subscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the question of making a refund order in relation to gifts or donations of equipment for schools very careful consideration following the extensive debate on this issue during Committee Stage of the 1993 Finance Act, but I have not yet reached a final <Col N="682" /> conclusion in the matter.  I am particularly appreciative of the sterling work on fund raising done by parents committees and others for schools, which is, I believe, acknowledged by all.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general question of the appropriateness of using the tax system in the way proposed, it may be that such a scheme would not be of any significant benefit to the schools which are most in need.  On the contrary, indeed, it could be the children of the better-off who would be likely to benefit most.  It is in the area of meeting the basic needs of schools that the State must direct its scarce resources and, arguably, this is best done through the capitation grant system.  Deputies will be aware that the capitation grants were increased significantly this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, the cost implications of any concession will have to be assessed carefully. Deputies will appreciate that once such a concession was granted, it would, in equity, be very difficult to confine it to particular areas of education or, indeed, to education alone; charitable bodies generally would undoutedly press their claims for similar treatment.</P>

      <P>While no explicit reference has been made to the report referred to by the Deputy, the potential impact of fiscal measures on the environment has been a factor in determining policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of taxation, the primary reason for levying impositions &mdash; to raise revenue &mdash; often reinforces environmental policy objectives; taxes on fuels and on motoring come to mind in this regard.  As regard some of the positive tax measures designed to benefit the environment directly, I would point to the lower rate of excise duty charged on unleaded petrol compared with the leaded product, the very favourable tax <Col N="684" /> treatment for Liquified Petroleum Gas, for both automotive and heating purposes, and the VAT reduction on garage services in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>In a wider context, the Programme for a Partnership Government states that environmental considerations will be integrated in all key policy areas including industry, transport, energy, tourism and agriculture.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has made an agreement with the Economic and Social Research Institute to set up an Environment Policy Research Centre in order to promote a more systematic study of the economic aspects of environmental policy.</P>
    <P>One of the two principal objectives of the EC Cohesion Fund is to facilitate implementation of EC Community environmental requirements.  Irish projects including sanitary, water supply and waste disposal services which are assisted under the Fund will, accordingly, benefit the environment.</P>

      <P>Twelve partnership areas were selected to be the pilot areas for the Area Based Response to Long Term Unemployed initiative introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative included the introduction of a range of additional measures such as the area allowances for enterprise, employment and education/ <Col N="685" /> training (detailed in the following table) in the selected areas which, on the basis of successful pilot experience could be applied to other areas.</P>
    <P>The individual schemes chosen were recommended to Government by the Task Force on Employment and specifically designed to discriminate in favour of the long-term unemployed.  They focused on eliminating the disincentives faced by the long-term unemployed when moving from welfare dependency when a training or education opportunity arose.</P>
    <P>As part of the Local Development Programme in the National Plan, 1994-1999, which I launched yesterday it is proposed to extend the number of areas based partnerships to new areas with high concentrations of long-term unemployed, and social exclusion.  Details of the specific measures to be applied in the programme will be a matter for discussion with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 to 79, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 4,981 certificates were issued by them to the sheriff for Kildare in respect of County Kildare in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available. The breakdown of these by tax was 300 for income tax, 2,899 for VAT, 1,712 for PAYE/PRSI, and 70 in respect of other taxes.</P>
      <P>No certificates were withdrawn on the grounds that they had been issued in error.  However, in some cases tax was paid direct to the Collector-General after the certificate had issued to the sheriff and this resulted in the withdrawal of 2,832 certificates in 1992; some of the certificates withdrawn in 1992 had been issued in 1991.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to establish how many visits to business premises were made by the sheriff and his staff in the course of their duties in 1992.  The sheriff mounted 65 seizures of goods in 1992, but found it necessary to complete seizure in only three cases.  Court action by the sheriff in regard to certificates issued by the Commissioners does not arise.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to an earlier question on this matter, the Irish Association of Pension Funds, following discussions with myself and my officials, endorsed the principle of the initiative announced in my budget speech to encourage increased investment by pension funds in Irish venture and development capital projects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, as a result of these discussions, it was agreed that a detailed study should be carried out under the auspices of the Irish Association of Pensions Funds and supported by other interested parties including my Department to assess, among other things, the opportunities for investment in this area and its suitability having regard to the prudential requirements of pension fund trustees.  This study is expected to be completed shortly.  During my Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill I indicated that the Government proposed that pension funds should work towards a target investment of £100 million in this area over and above their existing level of investments in unquoted companies, to be phased in over a five year period. This target figure will be subject to the outcome of this study and to sufficient suitable projects being brought forward.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 108 together.  As regards the prospective budget outturn, I would refer the Deputies to the press statement which I issued on 4 October last in association with the release of the Exchequer returns for the first three quarters of 1993.  As indicated in that statement, I view the returns as supportive of the budget targets for the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  There is, indeed, a reasonable prospect of securing some overall savings which could contribute towards any potential equity injection in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>As regards the tax amnesty, this scheme is still very much at a preliminary stage of implementation.  In addition, special confidentiality arrangements apply to the incentive amnesty scheme under which I may obtain only certain information and this only in the form of aggregates.  In these circumstances there is no realistic basis which would enable me to forecast the possible overall yield under the amnesty at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under the National Treasury Mangement <Col N="694" /> Agency Act, 1990, the borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance have been delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency subject to general directions and guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance. The guidelines given to the agency provide it with considerable flexibility concerning the choice of currencies.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the agency that over the past decade, interest rates in Sterling have tended to be much higher than rates in most other major currencies.  For instance, over the period 1987-91, short-term Sterling rates exceeded short-term Deutsche Mark rates by some 5 per cent. In addition, the Sterling exchange rate tended to fluctuate much more against the Irish pound than did the exchange rates of narrow-band ERM currencies. Accordingly, the agency did not consider it appropriate to concentrate borrowings in Sterling.</P>
      <P>In the past year or so, Sterling interest rates have fallen significantly so that short-term rates are now below corresponding rates in Deutsche Marks.  This has increased the relative attractiveness of Sterling.  The National Treasury Management Agency has increased the amount of debt in Sterling by £750 million since the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the National Treasury Management Agency will continue to keep the currency composition of the foreign debt under constant review in order to ensure that the overall mix of currencies reflects market conditions.</P>

    <P>In my statement on the Exchequer returns for the end-September quarter, I indicated that there would be some excess on non-capital supply services over and above the Supplementary Estimates listed.  Despite the excess, the 1993 Exchequer borrowing requirement is likely to meet the target set in the budget, in particular as tax revenue has remained strong.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate the precise extent of the spending over-run at this stage of the year.  My Department is still considering the issues in consultation with the relevant Departments. However, it is clear that health expenditure &mdash; mainly on demand-led schemes and on the implementation of the Child Care Act &mdash; may overshoot by some £30-35 million, while additional costs will arise on the Agriculture Vote as a result of costs associated with the £IR realignment. On the other hand, savings will arise on the Social Welfare Vote following the lower than anticipated live register average in 1993.  The saving should allow payment of the annual Christmas bonus without increasing the general excess.</P>

      <P>It is estimated at this stage that the changes in interest rates since the budget will contribute to savings on debt service costs in 1993 of the order of £100 million. However, the eventual outturn for expenditure on debt service costs could also be influenced by interest and exchange rate developments during the remainder of this year.</P>
      <P>The budget for the cost of servicing the national debt in 1994 has not yet been finalised and accordingly it is not possible to quantify what savings might arise. the level of new borrowing in 1994 and the particular currencies and types of debt instruments used to fund that new borrowing and to refinance maturing debt would be important factors in any such exercise.  None of these items will be determined until the 1994 budgetary figures are being finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals, at present, to change the VAT treatment of golfing facilities. Commercial golf clubs are liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent, in common with commercial sporting facilities generally; taxation of such facilities is required by EC law.  Non-profit making golf clubs are currently exempt from VAT because they are not deemed to be engaged in the course or furtherance of business.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, from representations which he himself has made to me on behalf of the commercial sector, that such operators are concerned that the continued VAT exemption of non-profit making golf facilities is putting them at a competitive disadvantage.  In response to these representations, I undertook to look into the matter.  Accordingly, I have requested the Revenue Commissioners to undertake a review of the exemption for non-profit making sports facilities generally to see what action, if any, could be taken to ensure that competitive distortions do not arise. Obviously, any such action will have to comply with EC law: the latter permits taxation of non-profit making sporting bodies in situations of distortion of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Deputy will appreciate that it would be precipitate to take any decisions until the review has been completed.  Any corrective action considered necessary would be taken in the context of the normal budgetary process.</P>

      <P>The Doyle report dealing with the future of Dublin <Col N="703" /> Zoo was presented to the Minister for Education who decided against publishing the report pending consideration of substantial issues arising from it.</P>
      <P>One issue concerned the allocation of future responsibility for the zoo.  The Doyle report in making a recommendation that a Department should have a role in relation to the zoo did not indicate which Department this should be.  Having considered this issue the Government recently agreed to transfer responsibility for the zoo from the Department of Education to the Department of Finance.  At the same time the Council of Dublin Zoo propose converting to a Private Limited Company and two senior public servants will be nominated by the Minister for Finance to its board when established.</P>
      <P>I have since examined the recommendations of the Doyle report and can straight away affirm my agreement with the conclusion that there is a future for Dublin Zoo.  I have therefore asked the Office of Public Works to prepare a plan to ensure the future of the zoo having regard to the Doyle report and the following four objectives:</P>
      <P>1.  to operate to commercial standards so that State subsidies can be minimised</P>
      <P>2.  to continue the captive breeding of endangered species and the presentation of species to foster an appreciation of nature and global conservation</P>
      <P>3.  to achieve animal care which meets the highest international standards within appropriate space requirements</P>
      <P>4.  to contribute to the tourism and recreational potential of Dublin by providing quality visitor facilities and programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the plan would be available early in the new year and that after it is considered by Government the conclusions of the Doyle report and the outline of the plan will be made public. <Col N="704" /> The proposed zoo company will be a dynamic mechanism to implement the objectives of the zoo according to a commercial plan within a cost effective framework.</P>

      <Quest>if he will change the regulations so that individuals who have failed, through ill health, to submit claims for disability benefit can have their cases dealt with retrospectively, especially in view of the fact that many persons who have suffered from psychiatric problems fail to claim their entitlements and are prevented from doing so retrospectively despite support from the medical personnel and public representatives.</Quest>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Claims and Payments) Regulations, S.I. No. 189 of 1993, prescribe that a person claiming disability benefit is required to give notice of illness within seven days of becoming incapable of work.  In recognition of the fact that this is not always possible, the Regulations allow submission of a claim outside that period where good cause for late notification can be shown.  Retrospective payments are normally restricted to a period of three months prior to <Col N="708" /> the date of receipt of the medical evidence, but can be extended to six months in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The vast majority are covered by the six months limit.  Any extension of this limit would cause major disruption in that it would make it very difficult for my Department to carry out the checks on proper certification of claims which are a normal and vital feature of the administration of the disability benefits scheme. Under the circumstances I am satisfied that the Regulations are reasonable in their treatment of those who, for one reason or another, cannot make disability benefit claims within the prescribed period.</P>

In addition details of grant assistance in individual cases approved by the Galway County Development Team and County Enterprise Partnership Board are treated as matters of confidence between the Minister and the promoters concerned.

      <P>The Code of Practice on Disputes Procedures, including Procedures in Essential Services, drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission and published in January, 1992, aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action, by providing practicial guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes.  Particular emphasis is placed on the avoidance of disputes in essential services, with <Col N="715" /> the Code setting out additional safeguards for inclusion in employer/trade union agreements in such services.  The Code itself states that its principles are appropriate for employments in the public and private sectors of the economy irrespective of their function, nature or size.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Code's provisions should be adopted in employer/trade union agreements, particularly in organisations providing essential services. Regrettably, progress in this regard has been very disappointing and not one employment has adopted the code. Having regard to the lack of progress, I am now more than ever convinced that the Code's implementation needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, I am strongly of the view that the Code must be on the table for discussion with the social partners in any talks on a follow-up to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 3 of 23 June 1993.  The requirement under the Housing (Rent Books) Regulations, 1993, and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993, are in some respects a development of, and/or a replacement for, existing responsibilities of local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for individual local authorities to make the necessary arrangements to enforce the Regulations in their areas, including the allocation of staffing resources as considered necessary.  On-going administrative expenditure of authorities in matters such as the enforcement of these Regulations is not, in general, assisted by State grants.  There are no proposals to change the arrangements whereby such expediture is financed from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by the rate support grant.</P>

However, the Minister for the Marine may, under the Foreshores Acts, 1933 and 1992, serve a prohibitory notice or make a prohibitory order prohibiting removal or disturbance of beach material from the foreshore or the seashore whenever he is of the opinion that such removal or disturbance should be restricted or controlled or has affected or is likely to affect prejudicially any flora, fauna, amenities, or public rights.  These powers have been used in the past to assist local authorities in their efforts to protect specific sections of seashore and I will remain responsive to all requests for such assistance.  No case requiring the use of powers to abate or prevent this type of disturbance has come to my notice since the passing of the Foreshore (Amendment) Act in July 1992.</P>

      <P>The provision of ambulance services in the Eastern Health Board area is a matter for the board in the first instance.  The Eastern Health Board introduced mobile coronary care ambulances in 1979 following receipt of Department of Health approval.</P>
      <P>Initially, the service was introduced in the James's Street ambulance base from late 1979 and all ambulance personnel were afforded special training in the recognition of cardiac disorders, the use of portable defibrillator-monitors.  In addition, ambulance personnel carried special cardiac drugs for use by medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>All ambulance vehicles operating from the James's Street and Loughlinstown ambulance bases are now adapted to enable them to carry the cardiac equipment. Under the present operational arrangements, all ambulances on duty at both Eastern Health Board bases at any given time are cardiac equipped.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is already aware, my Department, together with the health boards, is currently undertaking a major review of the ambulance services nationally.  The review group is looking at the nature and level of service required. One of the main area for review is the provision of cardiac ambulance services.</P>
      <P>The review is ongoing and it is expected that the report will be presented to me later this year.  It would be intended that the recommendations of the review group would be taken into account by the health boards when considering any future developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has supplied me with the following background information with regard to the sale of the land in question.  The health board land at the rear of Ashgrove House totals approximately five acres.  The board proposes to provide facilities for the elderly on the site to replace the Lourdes Unit, now demolished.  The type of development intended here and on other sites throughout the Eastern region is a small community based modern complex rather than a large institutional building.  The ideal site for this kind of development has been identified as approximately one to two acres.  Accordingly, the board is retaining two acres of the site for this purpose and is selling the remaining three acres to fund the development.</P>
      <P>To enhance the value of the three acre site on the open market the board applied for planning permission for a housing project.  After months of investigation the planning authorities advised that planning permission would not be forthcoming because of inadequate access to the site.  Problems relating to sewerage and drainage connections were also cited. The site is effectively landlocked and without planning permission its commercial value is considerably diminished.</P>
      <P>As the developer of the adjoining site already has an approved access road and sewerage and drainage connections that could be extended to the board's site, the board negotiated with the developer for the sale of the site.  A sale price of £275,000 was agreed subject to the purchaser obtaining planning permission. The current position is that in accordance with standard procedure the proposed sale has been submitted to me for my approval.  I have not yet made a decision on the matter as I am awaiting a report from the Valuation Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prevention of addiction to all drugs, including prescribed drugs is best achieved at an early age.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the Department of Education and Mater Dei Counselling Centre has developed a substance abuse prevention programme for second level schools.  This programme, which has been piloted successfully in selected schools over the past two years will be available to all schools, with <Col N="737" /> appropriate in-service training for teachers in 1994.</P>
      <P>The programme covers areas such as assertiveness, self-esteem and decision making skills.  While it informs young people of the facts relating to drugs including prescribed drugs and tranquillisers, it aims to equip them with the skills to act responsibly regarding the use of all drugs.  It also shows them that there are drug free ways to deal with stress and tension, which in some instances may be just as effective as taking prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>In an effort to draw patients' attention to the fact that they do not necessarily need to receive a prescription each time they visit their general practitioner the Health Promotion Unit developed a poster which was distributed to all general practitioners and health board clinics during 1992.  The strong message on this poster reads &ldquo;Sometimes you need a prescription &mdash; Sometimes you don't &mdash; Take your doctor's advice&rdquo;.  General practitioners and other health service personnel have a role to play in informing the public that sometimes prescribed medication will not provide the solution to problems which may be psychological in nature and require counselling and support rather than drugs or medicines.</P>
      <P>As far as prescribing is concerned measures have been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation as part of the November 1992 GMS Agreement which are aimed at supporting general practitioners in achieving more rational, safer and more cost effective prescribing.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 give powers to the Minister to give a direction prohibiting the prescribing of controlled drugs in the exceptional cases where a doctor would be prescribing irresponsibly.</P>

      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit is involved in a wide range of initiatives at national level which are of particular relevance to women's health.  The Health Promotion Unit works closely with the Council for the Status of Women, the Irish Country Women's Association and a number of other organisations in the development of initiatives which address the health and well-being of women.</P>
      <P>During 1993 the Health Promotion Unit has financially supported the following projects relating to menopause: an educational video produced and distributed by Family Planning Services Limited; a manual for health professionals which will be launched at the inaugural meeting of the Irish Menopause Society in December; and a seminar, organised jointly by the Council for the Status of Women and Dublin Well Woman Centre.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit has worked in conjunction with the Council for the Status of Women on the development of a booklet on menstruation for girls which will be available in early 1994. The unit also continues its support for DES Action Ireland, which was initiated by the Council for the Status of Women in 1990 and which aims to identify all women exposed to the drug Diethylstilboestrol, DES, during pregnancy. The DES action group through its awareness campaign and follow-up screening service has identified individuals with definite signs of DES exposure and has been able to offer those individuals advice and support on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Endometriosis Society of Ireland has secured funding from the Health Promotion Unit to produce leaflets for distribution on this topic.  The Miscarriage Association of Ireland and Tipperary Childbirth Research Trust have also obtained funding to print their booklet on miscarriage, which will be circulated to prenatal clinics, obstetricians and gynaecologists and representatives of <Col N="739" /> medical, nursing and social work professions.</P>
    <P>The need for specific AIDS awareness messages targeted at women has been identified and the Health Promotion Unit's awareness campaign has addressed this issue.  Women are currently featured in the unit's multi-media AIDS prevention campaign which presents clear, hard-hitting messages on the topic.  Further AIDS messages targeted at women have also been placed in the washroom-toilet areas of women's clinics.</P>
    <P>The Social Work Department of St. James Hospital and Womens Aid with financial assistance from the Health Promotion Unit have developed resource materials for use by health professionals to assist them in identifying and recording assaults on women.  The Department of Health is finalising arrangements for the release of a health board officer to coordinate this project.  In the light of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation this will be a welcome initiative in helping to streamline the reporting process for such assaults, so that preventive action is taken at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Other organisations which have been supported in 1993 include the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their children, the Association for Improvement in Maternity Hospitals and La Leche League.</P>
    <P>If those providing health information to women are to do their job effectively, it is a prerequisite that they have available to them accurate, up-to-date information on women's health needs.  For this reason, the Health Promotion Unit is co-funding a major national survey of women's health needs being carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute for the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.  The results of the survey, to be published next year should provide valuable information on where useful health information and education interventions might be made in the future.</P>
    <P>The public office of the Health Promotion Unit in the Department of Health <Col N="740" /> provides free of charge a range of resource materials which relate to women's health.  Titles of publications include: <i>Book of the Child, Gynae Book, Hysterectomy, Menopause, Cystitis, Smoking and Pregnancy, Women and Alcohol.</i></P>
    <P>These titles together with a number of educational videos are distributed countrywide through the unit's links with health boards and voluntary groups. Demand for materials is very high and is evidenced by the ever-increasing numbers of titles printed each year.</P>
    <P>Because of the very comprehensive way in which the Health Promotion Unit is addressing women's health needs, particlarly in its collaborative work with various women's organisations, I have no plans currently for a Women's Health Week.</P>

      <P>Asthma is not a notifiable disease and most cases are treated by general practitioners rather then in hospital.  Detailed information on the number of people suffering from the condition is therefore not available.  In addition it is difficult to determine a precise medical definition of asthma; the term can cover a range of respiratory diseases, including bronchitis.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board is currently funding a three-year study of asthma as part of an EC concerted action programme.  The Irish element of the project is examining the prevalence of the risk factors associated with asthma in both rural and urban Ireland.  The study will conclude at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Aiséirí, Cahir is a private treatment centre which provides residential treatment to persons dependent on alcohol and other substances.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of alcohol treatment services in its functional area. The board has been developing an alcoholism treatment service in the community as recommended in the report on the Development of the Psychiatric Services, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, published in 1984.  Residential facilities for persons with addictions who have special needs are provided at the board's psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>As Aiséirí is a private treatment centre, medical card holders are not entitled to treatment in the centre without charge.  However, the South Eastern Health Board recognises the contribution of Aiséirí to the treatment of alcoholism and provides financial assistance to the centre.  In 1993 a financial contribution of £20,000 was made to the board towards the running costs of Aiséirí, Cahir.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>There is considerable co-operation between my Department and the Department of Education in relation to the provision of services to physically handicapped children in education.  Most of the special schools are operated by voluntary agencies who, with considerable assistance from my Department, provide a range of other services including medical and paramedical services, day care, residential care facilities, vocational training and the supply of technical aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need for ongoing review of the co-operation that exists between the two Departments.  I will be giving careful consideration to the recommendations in this regard from the Special Education Review Committee and the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability who are both looking at this issue.  I should point out that a representative of the Department of Education is a member of the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability and my Department is represented on the Special Education Review Group. The Deputy will be interested to know that the report of the Special Education <Col N="744" /> Review Committee will be available shortly.  More generally, I am confident that the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform will help to ensure a high level of co-operation between all Government Departments concerning issues of relevance to persons with a disability.</P>
    <P>The provision of wheelchairs is a matter for the health boards.  In general I am satisfied with the provision of wheelchairs to children in education.  I am aware that certain difficulties can arise from time to time in relation to the supply of wheelchairs.  In certain instances depending on the disability, there may be a delay in providing a customised chair. However, in these situations a standard wheelchair is provided in the interim. The supply of wheelchairs and other technical aids will be addressed by the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability. I would however, point out that health boards are spending an additional £100,000 on the purchase of technical aids and equipment from the £1.5 million made available this year for the development of services for those with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <P>The main element of the previous FICI agreement which operated over the period August 1990 to July 1993 was the linkage of price movements of medicines on the Irish market to the lesser of movements in the UK market and those in a basket of European countries.  In addition, the price of any Irish product could not, at the annual price realignment date, exceed the UK price of the same product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the commencement of the agreement <Col N="745" /> in 1990, the prices of Irish medicines were reduced by up to 10 per cent and over the course of the agreement, price increases totalling just over 2 per cent were approved.</P>
    <P>The new FICI agreement which came into effect on 1 August 1993 builds on the benefits of the previous agreement and provides for further price reductions.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the agreement include: &mdash; a reduction of approximately 6 per cent in the cost of GMS drugs and a minimum reduction of 3 per cent in the cost of hospital drugs; &mdash; a price freeze for a period of four years; &mdash; a once-off <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of about £2 million; &mdash; an explicit recognition of the right of hospitals and health boards to negotiate better terms with individual manufacturers, importers or agents.</P>
    <P>These agreements must be viewed as an integral part of my Department's overall drugs strategy aimed at containing the cost of drugs to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the combined benefit of both agreements are a minimum of £25 million per annum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 205 and 206 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department makes provision for children with physical disabilities in a variety of ways.  Depending on their particular disabilities and special educational needs, they can attend special schools, special classes in ordinary national schools or can be integrated into ordinary <Col N="747" /> classes in primary or post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>Many children with physical disabilities attend ordinary classes in their local school and transport is arranged by my Department where required.  Favourable consideration is also given to requests for funding to adapt school buildings to facilitate access for such pupils.</P>
    <P>There are seven special schools for pupils with physical disabilities at primary level, four of which are located in Dublin and one each in Cork, Limerick and Bray, Co. Wicklow.  All the schools in question have the services of a Child Care Assistant and therapy, medical, nursing and care facilities are provided by the health authorities.  The schools in question have a pupil teacher ratio of 14:1 and three of them have the services of an additional teacher to cater mainly for a number of children with communication difficulties.  In addition, special school transport arrangements are made for these children.</P>
    <P>There is one special class for children with physical disabilities at primary level and this is based in Galway.</P>
    <P>Educational provision is made for pupils in five Dublin hospitals which have the services of eight teachers funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>Provision for students with physical handicap at post-primary level is made in three designated second-level schools. Two of these schools are in Dublin and one in Cork.  Additional teachers are provided in each of the schools to cater for the special needs of these students. Additional support is provided in each school through the services of a Child Care Assistant and a nurse, funded respectively by my Department and by the health authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department operates a home tuition scheme, which is designed to meet the needs of physically handicapped children who have been absent from school for protracted periods due to illness or hospitalisation.  Under this scheme, the parents engage a teacher for <Col N="748" /> a number of hours each week and my Department meets the cost.</P>
    <P>There is extensive co-operation with and support from the health authorities in the provision of educational services for children with physical handicaps.  This is particularly so in cases of more severe disability where co-operation from doctors, nurses, therapists and child care personnel may be essential.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the ongoing need to review the adequacy of overall provision for children with special needs, including transport arrangements and co-operation between my Department and the Department of Health.  In this connection, I will be giving serious consideration to the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee which was established to address there issues.</P>

      <P>The introduction of a job sharing scheme for school secretaries employed under the Department of Education's scheme for clerk typists is at present under consideration within my Department. The case referred to by the Deputy will be examined on the introduction of any such scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the career break scheme introduced in January 1993 for clerk typists and caretakers, the school authorities in question may grant a career break to their secretary and would be grant aided towards the cost of a replacement. My Department has informed the school authority accordingly.</P>
