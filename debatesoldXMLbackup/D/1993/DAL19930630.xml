      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the work which has been done by our Whip and the Government Whip to have the Government guillotine which hung over all our legislation lifted.  I compliment the Government Whip for his efforts in this regard.  I have no objection to the debating arrangements but Fine Gael completely objects to taking this legislation, which provides for a tax write-off for tax cheats, today, tomorrow or any day.  It is fundamentally unworkable, unprecedented and unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While this represents an improvement on what was contained in the guillotine motion, the time allocated for the Second Stage of this Bill amounts to approximately five and a half hours.  This is not adequate to debate a Bill of this magnitude having regard to the extraordinary principles contained within it and the profound effect it will have on this country in many ways.  It is unfortunate that the debate is being guillotined considering that a report in one of the newspapers this morning highlights that the people concerned will, apparently, be beneficiaries under the provisions of the Bill.  This is deplorable.</P>

My party has tabled an amendment to the order for Second Stage.  We would take up the time of the House if we were to divide on the issue now.  A matter of principle arises when people who have broken the law for so many years are being rewarded while tax compliant citizens are being punished.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains the legal provisions for what has been colloquially termed the &ldquo;tax amnesty&rdquo;.  The objectives of the amnesty scheme are to provide those who failed to meet their tax obligations in the past with a final opportunity to regularise their affairs, in advance of the introduction of more stringent penalties for tax fraud, and the ongoing intensification of Revenue's compliance programmes; and to secure, at the same time, the highest possible proportion of undisclosed liabilities from the period prior to April 1991, bearing in mind that such evasion is difficult to detect at this remove.</P>
      <P>A further aim of the scheme is to facilitate the deployment of those funds relating to tax evasion, which had hitherto been held dormant, whether at home or abroad, for purposes of general benefit in terms of contributing to economic activity and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between the type of amnesty for which this Bill legislates and the interest and penalties waiver arrangement operated in 1988.  While in its own terms, the 1988 scheme was an unqualified success, the great bulk of the proceeds related to the clearance of arrears.  It is quite clear from the figures that very few new cases came on record, and, therefore, that the amount of previously unknown income on which tax was paid was quite limited. <Col N="405" /> New tax-head records were set up in no more than 1,000 cases, and, of those who availed, only 366 individual taxpayers and 13 companies were not previously recorded by Revenue under any tax head.  To put these figures in perspective, while an exact figure for the number of taxpayers who availed of the 1988 scheme cannot be derived, there were some 170,000 inquiries to Revenue about that scheme.  The number of payments received by the Collector-General in that year was some 357,000 more than in 1987.</P>
    <P>This present amnesty has been framed with a particular focus on the liabilities from the pre-1991 era which are not on the record &mdash; whether because the people concerned had successfully concealed the full extent of their income in the pre-self assessment era or had entirely escaped the tax net.  Previous experience strongly suggests that simply offering an interest and penalty waiver to such people would not entice them to bring their affairs up-to-date. Notwithstanding the very considerable improvement that has been brought about in tax-compliance over the past few years, through the shifting of more Revenue resources into compliance work and the more stringent legal framework progressively put in place, it would be unrealistic to expect that those who in the past successfully evaded taxes, and have escaped full detection for a lengthy period, would be prepared to cough up in full under amnesty.  To seek to insist on the payment in full of the tax liability on such undisclosed income, bearing in mind that the marginal tax rates applying until the mid-eighties were very high, would mean that very little of such income would be brought forward.  It was in recognition of this reality that the Government decided that a lesser charge was an essential feature of any scheme aimed at bringing these people within the tax net.</P>
    <P>First of all, I will give a broad outline of the scheme and then deal in some detail with particular features as set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The overall amnesty scheme covers the generality of undischarged tax liabilities in respect of the period up to and including <Col N="406" /> 5 April 1991.  There are certain exceptions designed to protect the yield from ongoing Revenue enforcement activities to the fullest extent possible.  Otherwise, it extends to all arrears of such taxes, comprising both liabilities in respect of previously undisclosed activities and other amounts unpaid.  Liabilities for social insurance contributions are not covered by this scheme.  They fall to be dealt with under the parallel amnesty for social welfare already announced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, full details of which will be made available by him in due course.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the benefits of the amnesty scheme are available to those only who regularise the totality of their pre-1991 tax affairs.  A basic condition of the scheme is that applicants must discharge, under the scheme or otherwise, their outstanding liabilities for the relevant period under all of the various tax headings covered by the overall scheme.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there is a further requirement to make a timely return with full disclosure in respect of the latest tax year. An individual, to retain the benefits of either tier of the scheme, must deliver by 31 January, 1994 a correct return of income for the 1992-93 tax year.  An equivalent condition applies in the case of a company.  This requirement is directed at ensuring future compliance, especially by persons who avail of the incentive scheme.  Unless they come fully within the tax net and keep their affairs in order, they will be exposed to very severe sanctions. Failure to fulfil this requirement will lead to a withdrawal of the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has two distinct tiers.  The innovative features are in the first tier which, for convenience, I will refer to as the &ldquo;incentives amnesty&rdquo;.  The core provisions for this tier are set out in section 2 of the Bill, which must, of course, be taken with definitions in section 1.  This relates to outstanding tax, levy and health contribution liabilities on income or capital gains and it applies only to individuals.  Persons seeking to avail of this tier must indicate the total amount <Col N="407" /> of the relevant income and gains, pay 15 per cent of that amount and make certain declarations.  Subject to the validity of these declarations, including full disclosure of such income and gains, the applicants' tax liabilities in this respect will be considered fully met.  Also, any penalties or interest that might arise will be waived.  Applicants who fully comply with these requirements can be assured that their pre-1991 tax affairs will not be the subject of further Revenue pursuit or investigation.</P>
    <P>The second tier closely resembles the amnesty scheme operated in 1988 and I will refer to this as the general amnesty. The main provisions for this scheme are in section 3.  As in 1988, this tier of the scheme also extends to companies.  This provides, where the relevant tax liabilities are paid in full by a specified date, for the waiver of all related interest and penalties.  This general scheme covers, as well as the foregoing personal taxes, capital acquisitions tax, residential property tax, stamp duties, value added tax &mdash; in respect of both sole traders and companies &mdash; corporation tax and corporation profits tax and liabilities of employers in respect of PAYE.  Applicants under this tier, unlike the incentive scheme, will have to provide the normal returns required in respect of the various tax headings, giving a year by year breakdown of the relevant amounts.  This general amnesty will apply to individuals availing of the incentive scheme who have relevant liabilities for the other taxes covered by the general amnesty.  It will also apply to persons without outstanding liabilities on income or gains.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that, in order to give maximum assurance to those availing of the incentive amnesty scheme to bring their pre-April 1991 tax affairs into order, a special confidential application procedure is appropriate. Accordingly, applicants for this tier will only be required to reveal their identity to a special unit within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The staff of this special collection unit will be obliged to respect absolutely the anonymity of <Col N="408" /> applicants.  There are penalties for breaches of confidentiality, whether to the public at large or to the general Revenue staff.  The staff of the special unit may, however, confirm the validity of certificates of moneys received under the amnesty which will be issued by the special unit, but this will only arise where the individual concerned has already acknowledged to Revenue that he or she has availed of the incentive scheme.  Furthermore, as there is likely to be a close connection in practice between non-disclosure of VAT liabilities and the evasion of income tax, an individual who avails of the first tier can apply to the special unit also in respect of his VAT liabilities. However, the requirement that there be a full discharge of those liabilities applies as in the general scheme.  Alternatively, VAT can be discharged to Revenue in the ordinary way under the general amnesty.</P>
    <P>Those seeking to avail of the general amnesty otherwise must, as was the case in 1988, apply to the Revenue Commissioners in the normal way.  In this instance the full tax due must be paid, but any interest or penalties arising, except those resulting from court proceedings, will be formally waived.  Obviously, where such a person has reached agreement with the commissioners in respect of these liabilities, the question of further pursuit will not arise.  Of course, it will be required that full declaration be made under the amnesty.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the withdrawal of the full benefits of both tiers of the amnesty under sections 2 and 3 in certain circumstances.  Such withdrawal will be made where: in the case of an individual, a correct return of income for 1992-93 is not delivered on time; in the case of a company, a correct return for any accounting period ending in the year to 31 December 1993, is not delivered on time; any declaration given by a taxpayer to the chief special collector under section 2 or 3 is proven to be false; and the amount paid by the taxpayer, under any tax heading, under the general amnesty was less than the full amount of arrears due by him or her.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for clear deadlines <Col N="409" /> for application for the amnesty and for the making of the payments required. In framing these deadlines I have taken into account the position that, where tax arrears over a number of years have to be brought to account, a reasonable time period is appropriate.</P>
    <P>For the incentive scheme all applications must be submitted not later than 30 November 1993.  Every such application must be accompanied by the prescribed declarations and in particular specify the relevant amounts of income and gains for which amnesty is sought. The deadline for the associated payments is 14 January 1994.  This period of grace for payments, as distinct from declarations, is intended to facilitate those needing to liquidate assets.</P>
    <P>For the general scheme the requirement is that outstanding tax liabilities in respect of the relevant period be brought fully up to date by 14 January next.  Any applicant for the incentive scheme with other undischarged tax liabilities must avail of this general scheme to clear these liabilities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that if the scheme is to operate as intended it is necessary that those availing of the scheme must have a means, should the need arise, of establishing that fact and of proving the amounts they presented. An individual who by the appropriate date provides the declarations required for the incentive amnesty and makes the payment required will be provided with certification both of having availed of the scheme and of the relevant amounts.  The form of certification will be prescribed in due course by the Revenue Commissioners with the consent of the Minister for Finance following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to protect Revenue's ongoing enforcement and collection programmes, there are a number of exclusions from the scope of the 15 per cent amnesty. The incentive amnesty is not available to individuals who, on 25 May 1993 &mdash; that is, the date of announcement of the amnesty &mdash; were the subject of investigation or inquiry by Revenue in respect of tax liability for the period to 5 April <Col N="410" /> 1991 and had been notified in writing of the position.</P>
    <P>The following amounts of tax are also excluded from the scope of the incentive scheme: tax already at enforcement stage on 25 May last &mdash; this covers cases with the sheriffs, cases where court proceedings have been initiated and cases which are the subject of a notice of attachment; tax which on that date was under appeal; tax which on that date had been agreed with an inspector but had yet to be paid; and tax not paid by virtue of an avoidance scheme which would otherwise have been payable on or before 25 May.  Neither is the incentive scheme available to individuals with undisclosed, or undischarged, liabilities deriving from an illegal source or activity; but for this purpose evasion of taxes and breaches of the exchange control provisions will be disregarded.  However, the general amnesty, whereby interest and penalties will be waived on full payment of the tax due, will apply to these excluded amounts of tax.  Individuals excluded from the incentive scheme are also covered by this general amnesty.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for specific declarations to be made under the scheme to the special collector by applicants for the incentive amnesty.  They are required to provide, firstly, a full and true declaration of the respective amounts of income and chargeable gains coming within the terms of the scheme; and, secondly, a declaration that none of these amounts arise from any illegal source or activity, with the exception of tax evasion or a breach of the exchange control provisions. Moreover, an equivalent declaration to the first of these must be given in respect of VAT arrears where these are remitted to the special unit.</P>
    <P>Where either of these declarations is proven to be false the benefits of the scheme will be withdrawn.  However, credit will be given against the full tax then due for the payment made under the scheme.  It is clear that certain assurances in relation to Revenue investigations into tax affairs of the relevant period are essential to the uptake of the scheme.  The legislation therefore provides <Col N="411" /> that should the Revenue Commissioners, in the course of their ongoing normal audit and inquiry programmes, seek to inquire into the pre-April, 1991 affairs of a person who has availed of the incentive amnesty, this person may challenge the commissioners' right to pursue such an investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that an inspector or other Revenue official will in certain circumstances be precluded from commencing an investigation in respect of tax which has been paid by an individual to the chief special collector for any period covered by the amnesty.  Because of the special confidentiality rules applying to the 15 per cent amnesty, Revenue officials outside the special unit will have no way of knowing who avails of the amnesty.  An individual who avails of the amnesty can block any investigation by Revenue into taxes covered by the incentive amnesty if he produces within 30 days a certificate of receipt from the chief special collector in respect of the liability to tax to be investigated.  Revenue will be prohibited from pursuing such an investigation further unless it can show to the satisfaction of the appeals commissioners that any declaration made by the individual to the chief special collector under section 2 or 3 was not a full and true declaration of the amounts of his or her undisclosed income or chargeable gains, or the amount of value added tax contained in the arrears of tax paid, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the situation that where an individual had received or receives a demand for an amount of tax which has been discharged under the amnesty to the chief special collector, including VAT remitted to the chief special collector.  The demand will be withdrawn on production by the taxpayer of evidence that he or she has availed of the amnesty.  The relevant evidence must be produced within 30 days of receipt of the demand or, if later, of the date of receipt of the certificate from the chief special collector.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the special confidentiality provisions which the Government <Col N="412" /> consider to be necessary in the special circumstances of the scheme. These ensure that persons who avail of the amnesty can do so in the assurance that the &ldquo;special collectors&rdquo;, who will administer the incentive amnesty, will be bound by stringent requirements in that respect, over and above the rules which govern all Revenue staff to respect the privacy of taxpayers.  Revenue officers assigned as special collectors will give a permanently binding undertaking, in the form of a &ldquo;declaration of confidentiality&rdquo;, that they will not disclose any information obtained in the course of administering the amnesty.  In general, no Revenue officer other than a special collector will have any involvement in, or any access to, information on the affairs of individual applicants arising from the administration of the incentive amnesty. Special collectors will be under the control and direction of a special collector, to be known as the chief special collector, who will have responsibility for the confidential administration of the incentive amnesty.</P>
    <P>The section provides for only the most limited and necessary exceptions to the prohibition of any disclosure of information by special collectors.  Special collectors may, if requested to do so by a Revenue officer, confirm or deny, without any elaboration, the validity of a certificate, or evidence of a certificate, produced to the officer by a person availing of the amnesty.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer of the Revenue Commissioners are to be given such information as they may reasonably require to check that the amnesty has been correctly administered. The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer may use any information they receive from special collectors only for the purpose of ensuring that the amnesty is administered correctly and for no other purpose.  Should a special collector disclose confidential information in any circumstances, other than the exceptional cases provided for in this section, he will incur a penalty. The results of the amnesty may only be communicated to the Minister for Finance <Col N="413" /> or the Revenue Commissioners in the form of aggregate results.</P>
    <P>Section 8 ensures that any payments made to the chief special collector will be payable to the Revenue Commissioners and lodged confidentially, along with all other payments to the Commissioners, in their general account in the Central Bank.  Specific and severe penalties are provided for persons who, having failed to meet their obligations for the period covered by the amnesty, then ignore the incentive amnesty, or abuse it by making less-than-full disclosure under it.  Section 9 provides that an individual who abuses or ignores the amnesty by failure to make or by falsely making the appropriate declarations and who, in respect of any years covered by the amnesty, has either failed to make returns or has submitted false returns, will be guilty of an offence and liable to a term of imprisonment.  If such an individual is summarily convicted, the term of imprisonment can be up to 12 months.  Where the conviction is on indictment, the term cannot exceed eight years.</P>
    <P>Any person seeking to avail of the incentive amnesty in respect of income or gains arising from illegal activity will, irrespective of whether previous tax evasion is proven, be liable to up to eight years of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for new and increased penalties for future non-compliance with the tax code.  Section 10 limits the possibility of mitigation of certain fines and penalties under the existing legislation which governs such mitigation. At present the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance can, after a court has made a judgment, remit the level of a fine or penalty to any extent, including remitting the fine or penalty entirely.  From now on in such circumstances these authorities will only be able to remit to the extent of 50 per cent of the amount of the fine or penalty. Moreover, in cases where the amnesty has been abused or ignored, no mitigation will be allowed.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that, as respects tax offences committed after the passing of this Bill, a taxpayer who files a false <Col N="414" /> return etc., or makes a false claim for an allowance or a relief etc., or a person who assists a taxpayer to file a false return or to suppress sources of income, will be liable, on summary conviction, to a term of imprisonment not greater than 12 months and, on conviction on indictment, to a jail term of not more than eight years.</P>
    <P>Section 12 brings the appropriate declaration under section 2 or 3 within the scope of sections 500 and 501 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which relate, respectively, to failure to make a return and to the making of an incorrect return, for the purposes of civil proceedings for penalties.  The penalties are £750 for failure to give the appropriate declaration and, in respect of an incorrect declaration, £100 plus an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid taxes.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill also provides for easier access by the Revenue Commissioners, where tax evasion is suspected, to information in financial institutions, including particulars of accounts.  These appertain only to a person who is resident of the State.  No change is proposed in the present position regarding the accounts of non-residents of the State.  Section 13 contains the relevant provisions and specifies particular penalties for noncompliance. Whereas at present Revenue must make application to the High Court, such access may in future be authorised by the Appeal Commissioners. The circumstances are that the taxpayer has filed a return of income or statement of profits or gains which his or her inspector feels is unsatisfactory; the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has an undisclosed account or accounts with the financial institution or that the financial institution concerned has information which would establish that the taxpayer's return or statement is materially false; the officer, on application to the Appeal Commissioners, secures a determination from them that he is justified in seeking details of all accounts held by the taxpayer with the financial institutions and certain ancillary financial information.</P>
    <P>Where the commissioners give such a <Col N="415" /> determination, there is provision for appeal on a point of law to the High Court.  The penalty for failure by a financial institution to comply with a request for information, made in accordance with the provisions of the section, is £15,000. That penalty can be increased by an amount of £2,000 per day in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 14 places all matters relating to the Bill under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners, subject to the chief special collector's managerial control of the arrangements for the amnesty.  Section 15 contains the provision for the short title and construction.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most unhappy with the way the Bill is being rushed through this House, notwithstanding the improvements that have been made on what was originally proposed by the Government Chief Whip.  We are being treated with contempt.  It is outrageous to expect Opposition parties to have amendments with the Bill's Office this afternoon having received the Bill in completed form just yesterday morning.  Unlike the Government, who has a plethora of tax experts in the Revenue Commissioners and in the Department of Finance who have been working on this Bill for several weeks, the Opposition is expected in a matter of hours to scrutinise the legislation without resources for expertise. This makes for bad law and is a fundamentally bad way to do business.  It amounts to Government by decree rather than a system of proper parliamentary accountability.  I have no doubt that some sections of the Bill are so ambiguous, and even contradictory, that they will require court adjudication.  It is obvious there will be different interpretations by tax consultants and the Revenue Commission officials on basic aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is unique in the history of taxation in two respects: first, it is the first Bill ever to write off tax itself retrospectively; second, it has universally angered <Col N="416" /> and upset everyone dealing with taxation.  It is obvious that the Revenue Commissioners are deeply unhappy with section 2, which facilitates a tax write down to 15 per cent on earnings.  The tax practitioners, on behalf of their clients, believe that the penalties provided for in the Bill are arbitrary and excessive.  Its provisions undermine the compliance ethic.  The Government is rewarding tax evaders.  This makes a mockery of our entire tax system.  The ordinary taxpayers, particularly those employees who have had to pay tax as they earn, are now being asked to approve of a situation where tax evaders can pay as they please and if they like.  The compliant taxpayer, particularly Schedule D taxpayers who have been subject to interest charges, penalties and audit, must be shocked by the contrast in the treatment offered to operators and even their competitors in the black economy.  This Bill, therefore, is inherently unfair and highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the case for the general amnesty on interest and penalties was the introduction of self-assessment.  It was to allow a clearing of the decks to a new administration system.  No such circumstance exist at present.  It is clear that the motivation for this Bill has nothing to do with taxation policy or enforcement methods.  Its true objective is to provide next year's budgetary fix.  This year's underlying Exchequer borrowing requirement is £900 million, excluding the proceeds from the sale of State assets. Indeed the 1993 underlying EBR could well exceed £1 billion.  The once-off proceeds from the sale of shares in Greencore and Irish Life should have been applied to reducing the national debt, as they represent a capital receipt.  Instead they are included in this year's budgetary arithmetic as a current receipt reducing the EBR to £760 million.  The Government, with cynical disregard for compliant taxpayers, has now produced a rabbit out of the hat to appear by 14 January next to enable the 1994 borrowing figures to mask the underlying reality.  It is a three card trick to give respectability to the public finances next <Col N="417" /> year when the underlying trend will show a marked deterioration.</P>
    <P>Tax revenues from the amnesty will help plug a serious budgetary gap for one year only.  The underlying deterioration in the public finances seems set to continue. Since 1990 current Government spending as a proportion of GNP has risen from 36.8 per cent to 39.3 per cent this year.  The outlook for 1994 is even worse.  Public service pay fell to 13.7 per cent of GNP in 1989 but has risen constantly each year since.  This year it will account for 15.2 per cent of GNP.  The £4 billion public sector pay bill is 46 per cent higher than in 1987.</P>
    <P>The Government has deferred additional public sector pay payments of £216 million to January 1994.  There may be further increases under the local pay bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and annualised increases in a new pay agreement. The abolition of the 1 per cent income levy creates a further revenue gap in 1994 of £130 million.  Before we implement any of the lavish commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government or embark on increased public sector pay in a new pay deal or on any improvements in public service we have a gap in excess of £500 million next year.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a desperate political stroke to raise once-off cash.  Logically this Government should consider a crime amnesty by releasing all current prisoners who have served 15 per cent of their sentences.  This would give a fresh start to everyone and it would cost less to run the jails.  This Bill is as farcical as that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies have sought to defend this amnesty on the basis that the proceeds will pay for expanded public services and tax reductions.  Government backbenchers have been trotted out to say that this Bill will mean the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy, that it will mean that there will be more money for the handicapped, for education and so on.  These multiple promises cannot all be met even if the most optimistic forecasts are realised. The yield from the amnesty will be once-off <Col N="418" /> and must not be included in the Government's accounts as current revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has repeatedly asserted that this amnesty is a last chance for tax evaders.  It is a multiple chance.  In fact three amnesties are being offered &mdash; an amnesty against interest and penalties, a social welfare amnesty and a tax write-off amnesty of 15 per cent.  The Government, in response to public criticism of the initial idea, has kept digging a hole that has got deeper and deeper.  The outcome of this is an amnesty culture which undermines the whole enforcement procedures of the Revenue Commissioners.  Its hardly credible for Fianna Fáil, having had an amnesty up to 1988, and a similar one up to 1991, to say it will never happen again. This is the sixth amnesty the State has had since 1932.</P>
    <P>The work of the Revenue Commissioners in recent years has been showing remarkable success.  Under the Revenue audit programme 28,733 audits were completed in 1991 yielding £90.6 million.  In 1992 27,916 audits were completed with an expected yield of £105 million.  Added to this yield is the fact that the reputation of this audit programme underpins tax compliance generally in the area of self assessment.  In answer to a Dáil question the Minister said that for 1990-93 the work of the self assessment audits had yielded an additional £41 million.</P>
    <P>I understand up to 600 staff were to have been transferred to the audit division this year.  I must assume that this programme is now in tatters as all audits will have to be suspended for the period of the amnesty.  What was the most effective anti-evasion enforcement scheme has been totally undermined by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The original purpose of the amnesty was to obtain repatriated foreign capital. It is clear that this will not yield any bonanza.  This is because such foreign capital pays no tax on the interest income.  If it is declared, future interest income will be taxed at 10 per cent or 27 per cent or, if sent abroad again, at the marginal tax rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> So-called hot money held abroad is undetectable by the Revenue Commissioners. Absolute confidentiality and inaccessibility is a well established, highly marketed and a fundamental principle of foreign financial services.  A myriad of offshore financial centres exist.  For example, financial services account for 47 per cent of the GDP of a small State like Guernsey.  Jersey, a small island with a population of 80,000, has £40.4 billion in sterling deposits and a further £7.3 billion under management.  Financial services account for 42 per cent of their GDP. Does the Minister think they will volunteer any information about any of their accounts?  The Isle of Man has had a huge growth; 4,000 people out of a total of 70,000 people work in the financial services sector.  Gibraltar had more than £400 million in 1987 but deposits now exceed a staggering £1.5 billion.</P>
    <P>There are now more than 700 companies which have located their offshore business in Malta.  Cyprus has promoted itself as the complete centre for offshore confidentiality over the past 15 years. There are 600 offshore companies incorporated there.  In addition, we have our own financial services centre.  We do not have to confine ourselves to the British Commonwealth.  We can look further. It is estimated that Swiss bank accounts handle 40 per cent or more of assets placed under management worldwide. Liechtenstein, which is in customs union with the Swiss, has a population of under 30,000 people but its secrecy is so developed that it is believed to have more companies incorporated there than people.</P>

      <P>What is the position in Newry or Cardiff in Wales?  We have a double taxation agreement with the UK. Article 25 of the Ireland/United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention, 1976, specifically precludes information flowing from the Inland Revenue Commissioners to the Revenue Commissioners about bona fide non-resident accounts.  For example, if Deputy Rabbitte were to place £50,000 in an account in Newry, give his address and declare his non-resident account, that information relayed to the Inland Revenue would not be conveyed to the Revenue Commissioners. Why would Deputy Rabbitte be enticed to bring that money back to pay tax on it when he will lose the interest income which is free of taxation at present?  Given that there are no exchange controls, there is no incentive to bring this money home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These wealthy tax evaders are unlikely to concede 15 per cent of their capital in these circumstances.  They will obviously be fearful irrespective of any secrecy deal &mdash; no matter how elaborate &mdash; that they could be included in a black list by the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 5 of this Bill allows the Revenue Commissioners through the appeal commissioners to seek a reversal of the immunity from investigation offered by the certificate.  These greedy and very <Col N="421" /> wealthy tax evaders will not run the risk of liability to a future audit.</P>
    <P>All the arguments relating to repatriated capital are void in the context of this debate.  An ironic aspect of this amnesty is that many prominent Irish taxpayers have had to to change their domicile and live abroad because of the tax system. Irish income tax is computed on the basis of worldwide income whereas in the UK only foreign income remitted to the country of residence is taxed.  It would be much more just and sensible of the Government to change this rather than to opt for this wholesale tax write-off.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 there will be easier access by the Revenue Commissioners to all accounts in financial institutions. Heretofore accounts on which tax at 27 per cent was levied were confidential.  I understand that financial institutions are concerned and fear, given the sensitivity of some of these depositors and their irrational attitudes to tax, that the net effect of this Bill will be capital outflows from these accounts to avoid investigation by the Revenue Commissioners. We have the ultimate irony that a measure designed to entice capital inwards may have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on the most grave and disturbing aspect of this Bill, namely section 2 providing for the 15 per cent amnesty.  The terms of this are fraught with unprecedented dangers for taxation policy and administration.  It seems that the method of obtaining a certificate under the amnesty is by way of self-declaration. If a taxpayer declares that the amount is a full settlement of earnings and was not obtained from an illegal source, then the Revenue Commissioners cannot refuse a certificate. What will most likely happen is that taxpayers, fearful of a future audit, will pay a nominal sum simply to purchase a certificate as an insurance policy against a future audit.  In other words, when the Revenue Commissioners audit a person's accounts in 1997, that person will produce one of these black certificates. That person may have declared £1,000 and paid £150.  They will tell the Revenue <Col N="422" /> Commissioners to mind their own business.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to oppose section 2 of this Bill and to change this form of declaration so that documentary evidence and audited accounts will have to be produced by the claimant to prove the veracity of the claim that the declared amount represents his or her total earnings. The total earnings figure is in the eye of the beholder.  While the claimant and the Revenue Commissioners may disagree, the Revenue Commissioners should be empowered to have some discretion in regard to granting a certificate. At present it has no discretion.  If declarations are made and they do not relate to illegal sources, in those circumstances the Revenue Commissioners cannot question the validity of the certificates. The Revenue Commissioners must have some discretion to question the validity of such certificates if they know the information included is palpably not true.</P>
    <P>The declaration that the declared amounts have not derived from an unlawful source or activity is a joke.  Does the Minister really think that subversive groups who have procured their ill-gotten gains in the most appalling ways, for example, by drug trafficking, would be troubled by making a false declaration about the nature of their gains?  They would not be in the least concerned.</P>
    <P>The minimum requirement should be an additional certificate obtained from the Garda Commissioner stating that he is satisfied there is no attempt at laundering the proceeds of criminal activity. Fine Gael will be opposing section 2 as it is badly thought out and unworkable.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will also table amendments to provide for a number of additional measures.  Interest rates have tumbled since earlier this year and it is not appropriate that the interest rate on arrears of tax should be frozen at 1.25 per cent per month or 15 per cent per annum.  Such a rate is totally unrelated to the AA rate or the AAA rate.  Interest rates should track prevailing commercial rates which are currently around 8 per cent.  Those who availed of the 1988 amnesty should <Col N="423" /> not have the benefits of availing of the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most cynical aspect is that the amnesty is deliberately related to the 1994 accounts.  The date of 14 January should be brought forward to 14 December so that the yield would be included in this year's Exchequer accounts as would be the normal procedure.  Where the Revenue Commissioners intend to carry out an audit on a taxpayer they should be allowed to do so.  The date of 25 May should be changed to 25 August this year to allow the Revenue Commissioners pre-empt the benefits of the amnesty to certain suspected tax evaders. Approximately 600 people in the tax office may have targeted the accounts of a few hundred people they had selected for audit this year.  I am not referring to a random selection but a carefully selected group whom they were satisfied were living beyond their means.  We are all familiar with the joke of the Revenue auditor who called to a man in Dublin and inquired how that man could afford to provide for four children in university, have holiday homes in Benidorm and Connemara, build a conservatory at his home and have a 1993 state of the art Jaguar on an income of £4,500 per annum.  The taxpayer, no doubt compliant, said it was not easy.  This example highights the problems faced by the Revenue Commissioners.  Between now and 25 August Commissioners should be given the opportunity to write to a certain number of people and advise them that they will not be given the benefit of this amnesty.</P>
    <P>Under sections 5 and 13 there is reference to &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;material extent&rdquo;.  What are these terms to mean?  They are entirely subjective. How are the appeal commissioners to interpret them?  We will be seeking power for the Minister to establish clear and concise regulations for the operation of all appeal commissioners hearings under the provisions of this Bill.  This will include allowing a representative of the chief special collector to attend such hearings.  Prior to this legislation I have <Col N="424" /> received complaints from accountants about the work of appeals commissioners. There is a feeling they are too compliant towards rubber stamping claims of the Revenue Commissioners. Former Revenue staff have been appointed as appeal commissioners. Appointment of such commissioners is entirely political.  Does this mean a political involvement in &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; amnesty cases?</P>
    <P>These sections are extremely unclear, messy and will undoubtedly be the source of litigation.  They are a legal minefield and should not be rushed through this House.  What someone would consider to be reasonable grounds for reversing a certificate and what others would consider to be reasonable grounds is completely open ended.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that all the proceeds and yield from these amnesties should go towards reducing the national debt and be treated as a capital receipt on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for jail sentences for tax evaders.  It is not explained what scale of tax evasion will warrant a jail sentence of 12 months or eight years.  We must have some clarity and some scale of offence.  Sums should be specified to give guidance to the courts in this regard. Should someone who has evaded tax for a minor sum be subject to jail sentences or treated in the same way as the most wealthy tax evader who has defaulted on mega amounts of tax?</P>
    <P>This amnesty legislation cannot be considered solely in the context of taxation. There are other criminal law implications. Amnesty claimants may have defrauded or defaulted on obligations to creditors.  This is especially so prior to company receiverships or liquidations. Breaches of company law may have occurred. The proceeds of crimes such as drug trafficking or subversion may be part of the amnesty revenue yield.  Is the Government offering an amnesty for any of those crimes?  This cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>The Government has not yet implemented the EC directive on money <Col N="425" /> laundering, which they were supposed to do by January of this year.  This imposes a far stricter regime on financial institutions in regard to the proceeds of crime and tax evasion.  I understand it will be an offence for a financial institution to aid and abet the laundering of money and that the proceeds of tax evasion will be considered in the same way as the proceeds of other criminal activities.  The amnesty provided for in this Bill breaches the spirit of that agreed EC policy, and the EC directive should have been implemented first.</P>
    <P>I now wish to put some questions to the Minister to which I would like him to reply at the end of this debate.  First, how far back must a declaration of undisclosed income go?  This is unclear from the Bill.  Is there any outer limit to which the people must reveal their income?  If they have had a good thing going in the black economy must they declare when that commences?  Second, why does the legislation not insist that all outstanding amounts of PAYE and VAT be paid in order to become eligible for the terms of the amnesty?  That question must be answered.  Third, if one has made an incorrect return for 1991-92 it seems from the Bill there is no obligation to correct that return.  The obligation seems to be that the 1992-93 returns must be accurate. If it is clear there is a gap, is this tax to be completely written off, or what practice can the Revenue Commissioners adopt in those cases?  Why has no provision been made to present a recurrence of the accumulation of arrears of taxes by including a requirement that direct debits be signed for VAT and PAYE? People who have a track record of being constantly behind in their payments should be obliged to enter into direct debits.  What is the situation in relation to people who have obtained a tax refund through the business expansion scheme or in relation to directors' loans?  Why has the Minister failed to include a clause that the tax refunded as a result of the return of these moneys to the legitimate economy cannot exceed the tax paid on the amnesty?</P>
    <P>This Bill has been hastily conceived <Col N="426" /> and its enactment is being excessively rushed.  Its long term implications have not been adequately thought out.  It is a crude, desperate and panic stricken measure to get the Government through the 1994 budget.  In doing this it has created a precedent of writing off taxes due to the State which have not yet been unearthed through the audit process.  The Government should withdraw this measure, even at this late stage, and must at all costs remove entirely section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats will oppose this Bill.  That will hardly come as a surprise to anyone in the House, given the opposition we mounted and the information we sought from a very reluctant Minister for Finance on this issue in the course of the Finance Bill.  I would remind the House that none of these amnesties was part of the strategy for the budget this year.  As I pointed out previously in this House, following a pause for reflection of some ten weeks before the Finance Bill was published no mention was made of the amnesty.  Eventually, on the eve of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, the Government agreed in principle to a form of amnesty in respect of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money, probably to be levied at a tax rate of approximately 15 per cent.  We then forced some debate on the matter on Report Stage of the Bill, during which some concessions were made by the Government.  The amnesty did involve &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money abroad and, if I could use the phrase in terms of unaccounted for accounts in Ireland, &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money here in various accounts referred to by the Minister.  The amnesty was then to be extended for a variety of reasons, not developed by the Minister, to include social welfare at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines the Bill before us today it provides for &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money amnesties, but beyond that it encompasses also capital gains, levies, a social welfare amnesty &mdash; we are not dealing with it in this legislation &mdash; and, for good measure, a 1988 style amnesty <Col N="427" /> so that no cheat should feel left out of this charter.  The Minister has produced for us &ldquo;the mother of all amnesties.&rdquo; I was reminded of that phrase when President Clinton sought to pass his first virility test last weekend by blitzing part of Baghdad using £28 million worth of Cruise missiles.  At the time I thought that our own &ldquo;Saddam Ahern&rdquo; was blitzing cheats with every available device to ensure these cheats get away with not meeting their due share of taxation.</P>
    <P>We in the Progressive Democrats will oppose this measure because we believe it is unprincipled.  That is a point I wish to return to, because I believe it is a fundamental point of our opposition.  It is an unfair Bill in terms of its implications and is wholly and completely inequitable between compliant and non-compliant taxpayers.  Following the implementation of a previous amnesty of a very different form, we were told it would be the last of such amnesties.  Yet again it is rewarding cheating and evading and it proves that in Ireland today crime does pay.  We are now bringing in legislation, proposed by this partnership Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour, which will enshrine in our law the notion that crime pays.  For that reason we will oppose it as a profoundly unprincipled piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Compliant taxpayers represent the majority of taxpayers.  I use the phrase &ldquo;compliant taxpayers&rdquo; because it included PAYE, but it includes much more also.  It includes people in companies who struggled to pay their taxes and to survive in marginalised businesses but who, against all the odds, paid their bills.  It says to every compliant taxpayer, you are a sucker if you pay your bill, if you play by the rules, if you believe in decency in terms of how any ordinary, proper, well-managed society ought to run its overall affairs.  What is being offered is a con job and an attack on decency.  What we are doing in this mother of all amnesties is elevating to an unprecedented status the role of the fixer, the stroke puller, the cute hoor, the dodger.</P>
    <P>There is a famous phrase &mdash; I do not <Col N="428" /> know whether it is in some of the American coats of arms &mdash;<i>fortuna favet fortibus</i>, fortune favours the brave.  In this case the brave are the cute hoors who are slick enough to hang in there and cheat the system, either hoping against hope that someone will come along and grant them a reprieve from their cheating and evasion or believing in any event that decency does not count, that making a contribution to the running costs of society does not count.  The victims who pay the price of the failure to pay taxes in terms of the absence of facilities, be they in health, education or employment creation schemes, do not count for a damn.</P>
    <P>This Government from which we have heard so much since its formation &mdash; ironically, mostly from the Labour Party &mdash; about the need for ethics in Government, brings in this tawdry legislation as a means of conveying a clear signal regarding ethics.  I refuse to believe there is the slightest concern about ethics in Government when the cheat, the cute hoor, is elevated to a reward status and decency is so gravely offended.</P>
    <P>My Party made the point at length on Report Stage of the Finance Bill that this tax is profoundly unfair and inequitable, amounting to an arbitrary discrimination between the honest citizen and the cheat. If brought before the courts, it may fail on a test of constitutionality because of the arbitrary discrimination between compliant tax paying citizens and the non-compliant cheat or cute hoor who will be elevated to the status of someone who deserves to be rewarded.  This is unprincipled legislation because it offends perhaps the most basic principle of any republic, that is, equal treatment of all people.</P>
    <P>This Bill most assuredly is a million miles from that basic principle.  It makes a mockery of the slogan on which the Labour Party succeeded in getting about 30 seats in last November's election &mdash; Put justice in economics and trust in politics. This Bill is some proof of justice in economics.  People who pay their way get a kick in the teeth and the sheriff will be out to scalp them if they fall behind. <Col N="429" /> However, the Government looks after those who do not pay their way.  It is elevating that whole process in Irish politics to centre stage.  People in that bracket are gold medalists and get a great reward. That is what we are legislating for.</P>
    <P>On the Finance Bill Deputy Kemmy referred to people like me who express concern about the attack on the integrity of our tax system as altar boys.  In a great declaration he said: &ldquo;I am no Matt Talbot socialist, if there is money out there, let us be practical and get it&rdquo;.  I am a politician who believes in pragmatism, but when pragmatism is bent to a point of no principle, one is entitled to ask basic questions.  I am outraged by this legislation and the public has every right to be outraged and dismayed by it.  For the vast majority of businesses, householders and ordinary individuals who pay their tax year in and year out, this is a kick in the teeth, the gravest insult that any administration could offer them.</P>
    <P>This mother of all amnesties has an interesting line.  I do not want to get lost in the promotion of the latest Steven Spielberg movie, &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;, but there is at least one parallel to be drawn. The movie is based on a scientist who discovers a chain of DNA, a dinosaur DNA which grows up to be a real live monster.  This amnesty proposal started as a twinkle in someone's eye &mdash; a little bit of DNA &mdash; an idea to bring home hot money.  As Deputy Kemmy said in justification of this pragmatism, we could look after the mentally handicapped and we could get rid of the one per cent levy about which many complaints were made.</P>
    <P>We tried to get information on this matter from a reluctant Minister on the Finance Bill, but he would not talk to anyone; he seemed to be in his office sulking.  All of us got the impression that he did not believe in the idea of an amnesty.  I still think he does not believe in it but he has to go along with the collective decision and he is now introducing a Bill and recommending it to the House.  I do not think he believes in this mickey mouse arrangement.  Under the Finance Bill we were told by the Minister <Col N="430" /> that the hot money included money at home.  At least twice in the Minister's contribution on the Finance Bill he said there are 15 million bank accounts that must be dealt with.  At this stage it looked as if the DNA was growing, there were two segments of hot money, that abroad and that at home, but if the money at home was already employed in the economic cycle it was not clear that it would be a great bonus.</P>
    <P>It was then decided to introduce a social welfare amnesty, the major beneficiaries of which will not be the fellow on the dole who is doing a little work on the side and who probably will not reveal this information anyway because he knows that in our society cute hoors get away with everything.  The people who will get the big break from the social welfare amnesty are those who did not pay their PRSI and so on.</P>
    <P>Finally today the DNA is revealed for the dinosaur monstrosity it is.  Section 2 of the Bill deals with hot money abroad, hot money at home, income tax, capital gains tax, levies and so on.  To add further insult to injury, the people who avail of the amnesty will have to pay only 15 per cent tax on this money.  The 15 per cent will sort it all out.  Under this Bill the Revenue Commissioners will have no right to inquire into how business was conducted in recent years.  In one bound our hero, in Ireland's case &ldquo;the cute hoor&rdquo;, is free as a bird.  Even though many laws have been broken, who cares?</P>
    <P>There is a profoundly disturbing second dimension to this Bill.  The Minister may have mentioned this in coded language when he spoke on the Finance Bill.  In his budget speech in 1988 the then Deputy Ray MacSharry said in relation to an incentive to bring tax affairs up to date:</P>
    <P>To encourage taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date now, it has been decided to offer them, on a once-off basis, an opportunity to settle outstanding tax liabilities without payment of certain interest or penalties.</P>
    <P>The scheme was published in due course. During an interview yesterday I remarked <Col N="431" /> that this &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; proposal reminded me of the chap who goes along to the Munster Final selling tubs of ice cream who will shout &ldquo;last of the ices&rdquo; to encourage people to buy immediately and ten minutes later we will see the same man with another box of ice cream still shouting &ldquo;last of the ices&rdquo;.  This Bill promises El Dorado around the corner as an incentive for people to settle their accounts now.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party Deputy Barry Desmond in 1988 had a few things to say.  He was apoplectic with rage.  At the time Deputy Desmond was lit up like a beacon, like an eagle soaring over the Minister, complaining about the proposed tax amnesty.  Deputy Desmond said, at columns 1495 to 1497 of the Official Report of 20 April 1988:</P>
    <P>... it is fundamentally wrong because in three years time people will be baying for another tax amnesty and perhaps a future Minister for Finance will reintroduce it.  Once you go down that road, it is hard to stop in terms of administering an effective system ...</P>
    <P>That was some prescience from an apoplectic Labour Party in 1988.  It was prophetic. We are now proposing &ldquo;the mother of all amnesties&rdquo; again.  If one does not fit into the staggering unprecedented undermining of the tax code in section 2, section 3 will come in.  That is a profound mistake in terms of administering the tax code.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill really captures its spirit.  The cheat, having paid the 15 per cent and being given the certificate, has to be re-assured by the Minister that he can get away with cheating in perpetuity and that nobody will come after him and winkle out the nasty details of the extent of the cheating.  In section 7 we have set up the special collector, who will be bound by very stringent confidentiality requirements.  The law demands the confidentiality of the special unit and guarantees confidentiality to the cheats, and if any one of the special collectors squeaks out of turn he will be fined.  If the people who administer the <Col N="432" /> system tell anyone in Revenue, let alone anyone in the public, anything about the previous tax affairs of cheats, he will be fined.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the Schedule to the Bill, but the public would like to know what the new collector must do with regard to confidentiality.  The special collector must appear before a commissioner for oaths and declare, as the Bill provides:</P>
    <P>I, A.B., do solemnly declare that I have read and understand section 7 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, and that I will not disclose, or cause to be disclosed, to a person who is not a special collector (within the meaning of that section) any information which I acquire, or have access to, in the course of discharging special collection functions (within the meaning of the said section) save where the disclosure of such information is deemed, by virtue of the proviso to subsection (4) of the said section 7, not to be a contravention of this declaration.</P>
    <P>The exemptions are minimalist.  It seems that we are to invent some new specialist unit in Revenue.  I will call it the Gulag Archipelago.  I do not know how one can come out of the Gulag unless one can become a sort of schizophrenic where one part of the personality knows many things about all the cheats in the country but which cannot be revealed to one's other self if one leaves the Gulag to become an ordinary Revenue officer dealing with tax files.  This solemn declaration converts the Revenue collector into a Trappist monk.  What we have in this amnesty, brought to us by the Minister in this unprincipled legislation, is a confidentiality system which requires people hired by the State to administer tax and to follow up on cheats to take a Trappist vow of silence which they must never consider breaking save in the narrow circumstances provided for by the Minister in this text.  This whole Bill is an outrage.  A double bonus is being given to the &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; syndrome in Irish society.  First, a person gets away with <Col N="433" /> blue murder if he or she does not pay tax.  Then a certificate is received from Saddam to the effect that he or she has been cleared and will not be subjected to any future investigation.  The people who know the details are sworn to a Trappist-like secrecy.  What will happen to those officials, will they be sent to the Gulag, to the dark side of the moon or will they be dispatched from Revenue?  What will happen them when this mother of all amnesties has run its course?  If they are ordinary Revenue officials and they recognise a name or know something about a taxpayer will they have to partition themselves from the other staff?  It is a most extraordinary process and shows the length to which this Government has gone to facilitate, in an unprincipled way the most unprecedented attack ever on the integrity of our tax system.</P>
    <P>I shall be tabling a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I thank the Minister for giving me an early copy of the Bill which I studied on the train journey to Cork on Monday.  We are discussing Second Stage today and the deadline for receipt of amendments is this evening.  As a result I will miss much of today's debate.  I would prefer to be here to listen to other Members' contributions.  Committee Stage has been ordered for tomorrow.  This is a crazy way to do business.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with some of the provisions for example, sections 9 and 11 which specify the penalties.  Section 516 of the Finance Act, 1967 specifies potential mandatory sentences.  As we contemplate imposing more mandatory prison sentences, will the Minister explain why the system we have does not work?  Why should I believe that including 12 months or eight years' imprisonment will mean the quality of enforcement will be any different from what has gone before?  We are entitled to an explanation.</P>
    <P>Section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983, gives some discretion as to how revenue offences are dealt with.  There is no discretion afforded in the Bill.  Is it a good idea not to give the courts some discretion? <Col N="434" /> If they have no discretion they might be more lenient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised a point about section 13 which deals with access to bank accounts.  Would it not be a curious paradox if something that began as what was described as the DNA, as bringing hot money from abroad into Ireland, ended up pushing money from Ireland?  What would be the impact of the right to go back ten years and look at bank accounts?</P>
    <P>The Central Bank wrote a letter on 23 July 1985 to the Commission on Taxation. The letter, which mentioned the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation &mdash; pages 179 and 180 &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>... it would be extremely difficult to maintain confidence in the normal relationship between banks and their customers if there were to be unrestricted access to customers' accounts by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Bank would be concerned that an erosion of that confidence would result in an outflow of funds abroad from both resident and non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted the Central Bank?  Has the Central Bank changed its mind?  The Central Bank, who relate to all the commercial banks in submissions to the Commission on Taxation stated clearly the very fear that has been expressed today.</P>
    <P>With regard to offences I would ask the Minister, and his officials, to consider the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation.  There has got to be some <i>de minimis</i> process between a minor offence, putting one into prison, giving one a criminal record, and a massive mugging of the system.  Some excellent elements of the Keith Commission of 1983 in the United Kingdom which were recommended by the Commission on Taxation were not even examined.  This Bill is flawed in that regard.</P>
    <P>My party, strenuously oppose this Bill. It is bad, inequitable, unprincipled and unethical.  In our Republic, it elevates those who cheat and dodge to a status of being rewarded.  It is a kick in the teeth to the honest, decent, regular taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The Progressive Democrats consider it an unworthy Bill which damages the credibility of those who promote it and of the institutions of State.  It is unworthy of any Government that has half a notion of what constitutes ethics in Government to stand over it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, believing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the proposed tax amnesty is an affront to tax compliant citizens,</P>
      <P>(b)  that it rewards those who have broken tax laws and exchange control regulations and will encourage further tax cheating,</P>
      <P>(c)  that it is particularly unacceptable that those who benefited from the 1988 amnesty and who have since again reneged on their tax obligations to the community will again be allowed to evade penalties and interest,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  that the guarantees of anonymity offered to tax offenders will facilitate further evasion and will <Col N="436" /> inhibit the investigation of the source of moneys which may, <i>inter alia</i>, have originated from serious criminal activities,</P>
    <P>declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Within the past few years we have had a general tax amnesty, a tax amnesty for unpaid capital acquisitions tax, unpaid PRSI and unpaid stamp duty.  However, the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, constitutes the mother of all amnesties.  Originally this was Albert's amnesty for big time tax cheats who had lied to the Revenue Commissioners and salted away their gains, illgotten or otherwise, in tax havens abroad, in bogus accounts here or simply in financial institutions outside the State.</P>
    <P>The message is: &ldquo;Come home; your country needs you; all is forgiven; give us 15 per cent off the top and mum's the word&rdquo;, but Bertie did not like Albert's amnesty because it threatened to undermine the very integrity of the tax system by blatantly rewarding tax cheats and thumbing its nose at tax complaint citizens. We now have Bertie's amnesty.  The lucky taxpayer who breaks his or her back week in, week out, to pay their lawful taxes now gets two amnesties for the price of one.</P>
    <P>Realising that he manages a tax system that stumbles from one amnesty to another the Minister for Finance has decided, since he cannot stop Albert's amnesty, to levy some serious money.  It is five years since those who availed of the 1988 amnesty contributed £500 million or more.  They should be good for another £300 million at least by now.  After all, most of them know that in our political culture all they have to do is keep the Revenue Commissioners at bay for a few years and the chances are there will be another amnesty around the corner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is aware that the Department of Finance agrees with the Opposition that the original amnesty, Albert's amnesty, would not have raised a fraction of the money claimed by its advocates.  The only way therefore to ride out the wrath of law abiding taxpayers is <Col N="437" /> to show that there will be a pot of gold at the end of the exercise.  This can only be done by way of a general amnesty <i>á la</i> 1988.</P>
    <P>The prize for the Minister for Finance in fixing the deadline of 14 January is a windfall gain which will ease the scale of his problems in constructing the 1994 budget, but the price for the Minister for Finance is that he risks undermining the tax system that he supervises, because above all else this mother of all amnesties threatens to undermine the improved detection and collection system ushered in by the same Minister.  It saps the morale of the Revenue Commissioners staff and calls a halt to some of their most valuable work.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he recognises the following quotation:</P>
    <P>To restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like a meaty quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That comes from page one of the mission statement, the Programme for a Partnership Government. It is salutary to compare the high flown rhetoric of just a few months ago with the seedy reality of trampling on tax compliant citizens in favour of crooks, liars, cheats and dodgers.  These fine sentiments are unrecognisable today, sullied and killed off by the nod and wink political culture that creates one law for the rick and powerful and another for ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most tax compliant citizens &mdash; the PAYE sector, for example &mdash; have their taxes deducted automatically.  Many tax compliant citizens outside the PAYE sector are vigilantly policed &mdash; sometimes, they argue, to the point of harassment &mdash; by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, those who by definition do not comply with the tax laws will now be about to make a self-declaration <Col N="438" /> and effectively have its contents accepted automatically and will be statutorily protected in the future from being investigated by the Revenue Commissioners. The word of cheats, dodgers and liars will be automatically accepted while &ldquo;officers or employees of the Revenue Commissioners may be fined heavily&rdquo; and, ultimately, presumably, imprisoned if they refuse to discharge such fines or for a breach of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about not paying one's taxes and it opens up the Orwellian vista of tax collectors being locked up for a breach of confidentiality while those who have breached the law will have the law set aside and new laws created to protect them from being investigated.  The stringent requirements of confidentiality that this Bill imposes on special collectors obliging them &ldquo;to give a permanently binding undertaking&rdquo; that in no circumstances will they disclose information obtained in the course of administering the amnesty, are bizarre.  It appears that they will not able to communicate such information to the Minister save in aggregate form only.  It is unclear whether we can be assured that beneficiaries, made respectable under the amnesty, will be recorded as being within the tax net for the future.  The guarantees of confidentiality are so absolute as to make a laughing stock of the people who struggle to lawfully pay their taxes.  My party will be tabling an amendment to require, at a minimum, that beneficiaries under this legislation will have their identities published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>It is clear that Opposition arguments concerning the original hot money amnesty, Albert's amnesty, now called the main amnesty, have struck home.  It is estimated that the revamped amnesty will produce a windfall of between £300 million and £500 million for the Exchequer.  The question arises as to what this says about the efficacy of our tax system.  It shines a harsh light on the extent of evasion in our society.  It also exposes the limited success of the 1988 amnesty and the culture of expectation that there is another amnesty around the <Col N="439" /> corner.  It is clear that the last amnesty did little to cause many wealthy citizens to put their affairs in order.  However, the 1988 amnesty, which wiped out penalties only, was far more severe than the main amnesty under this Bill.  Therefore, why should there be any expectation that those who will get away virtually scot-free under this amnesty should now be motivated to join the ranks of tax compliant citizens?</P>
    <P>In yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> the business editor stated:</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there will be people with undeclared tax liabilities assessing their positions (or employing their accountants to do so).  Many of them will not even look on this amnesty as an opportunity to settle their legal obligations at low cost, but will wonder if they might be better off avoiding contact with the Revenue Commissioners totally by keeping their money overseas, believing that it is beyond detection anyway.</P>
    <P>Some will take advantage of the amnesty, not through any moral obligation but because of the fear of the new sanctions being introduced.</P>
    <P>Last Monday, the day this Bill was finally published, the musical version of <i>Les Misérables</i> opened at the Point Theatre. This is Victor Hugo's story of Victor Jean Valjean who was sentenced to 19 years' imprisonment for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's family.  On Tuesday last a man was charged in Dublin District Court with stealing food worth £25 to feed his family.  While our political system is not much more successful in eliminating poverty and hunger than Louis Philippe, fortunately for this man our courts at least in this case showed some of the enlightenment which 200 years of progress ought to have brought us.  The motto of the age of Louis Philippe, the umbrella king, was <i>enrichez vous</i>, get rich.  Could there be a more apt metaphor for this legislation than the reproduction in 1993 of the set of <i>Les Misérables</i>, not in the Point Theatre but on the streets and in the homes of <Col N="440" /> Ireland?  Despite the achievements of the welfare state the message to those who do not have to steal to feed their families is still <i>enrichez vous</i> with a guarantee of only minimal and differential efforts by the State to draw a contribution.</P>
    <P>As has already been said, my party is opposed to this amnesty in principle because of the damage it threatens to do to the tax system on which any kind of civilised society depends.  The one question which occurred to me during the Minister's speech, as he made affirmation after affirmation, was: how do we know? The Minister has made statements to the effect that if these self-declarations are found to be false very serious penalties will ensue.  How will we know if they are false?  The greatest single defect in the Bill must surely be that people who are by definition, liars and cheats are to have their word automatically accepted.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for a minute the principal argument about whether it is a good idea every five years or so to have a tax amnesty for tax evaders while the rest of the population who cannot afford the expertise of the tax avoidance industry have to pay their taxes, I want to look at the amnesty in the context of the argument that there is a lot of money out there and we could be doing something useful with it here.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely remarkable that we have reached this stage of the Bill and we still have not been visited by a Labour Party Deputy, apart from when the quorum was called.  I invite my Labour Party colleagues to come into the House and tell us where they stand on the principal argument and the extraordinary provision in the Bill which will enable those fat cats, when they arrive back from wherever they have been, to make a self-declaration to the effect, &ldquo;Here is the £100,000 which I am re-importing into the country.  I say to you that this money does not have its origins in any criminal activity.  I further say to you that it is a full and true statement and I happen to have a cheque for £15,000 which I will now give to you.  Can I have my certificate, please?&rdquo; The special collector will have no special powers to look <Col N="441" /> behind that statement.  He must accept the statement of someone who, by definition, is a liar &mdash; he would not be in this position if he was not a liar.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about the non-payment of taxes.  The people who have defrauded the Exchequer and told lies to the Exchequer can come back at this late stage and make a statement while every other tax compliant citizen can be subjected, as they often are, to the most niggling, pernickety questioning by the Revenue Commissioners.  This Bill will enable a person to come back from his Christmas holidays on the Canary Islands and make a statement which must be accepted.  I find this proposal very difficult to accept, especially as the early argument was that we should look at the success of the 1988 amnesty.  The 1988 amnesty did not have this provision in this form.  If this amnesty is modelled on the 1988 amnesty, why go to extreme lengths to thumb our nose at ordinary law abiding citizens who do their best to comply with the laws of the land?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fully understood that the section dealing with confidentiality is as all-embracing and as much a source of comfort as I have just stated.  Section 2 proposes that once the prodigal son returns and makes a statement it will be automatically accepted.  There is no point in dressing this up.  The Minister said that a statement will not be accepted if it is proven to be false.  How can it be proven, by definition, that a statement is false? It is the most extraordinary mechanism whereby in return for paying over, say, £15,000 from the £100,000 brought back the person availing of the amnesty will get a &ldquo;stop cert&rdquo;, the effect of which is to stop the Revenue Commissioners from ever investigating or probing the source of the money or establishing the validity of the statements set out in the declaration. This is an appalling affront to the tax compliant citizen.  It is a disgrace that such legislation should have been brought before the House.  Like Deputy Yates, I will put down amendments on Committee Stage to require that supporting documentary evidence is furnished in that declaration, including <Col N="442" /> audited accounts in such form as prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The protection being given to those tax dodgers is absolute within the terms of the Bill.  We have the farcical situation whereby officers of the Revenue Commissioners, doing what they have always been supposed to do, may well end up in jail for a breach of confidentiality.  A breach of confidentiality not just to someone in a pub or on the public street but to their colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners or to the Minister is almost unbelievable.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there will be penalties for breaches of confidentiality, whether to the public at large or to the general Revenue staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that if they talk to themselves in their sleep at night and their spouse, or whoever they happen to be in bed with at the time hears them, they will be liable to these penalties.  That will be extraordinary, not to mention what other consequences exposure of their nightly habits might bring on.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the incentive scheme was not available to individuals with undisclosed &mdash; or undischarged &mdash; liabilities deriving from an illegal source or activity.  How do we know this?  I cannot establish from the Bill how we could possibly know whether the gains concerned derive from any illegal source or activity. We have the facility of self declaration and unless the person concerned happen to be a particularly prominent or well known head of some criminal gang in the city I do not know how it can be established whether the moneys are legal or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a special collection unit within the Revenue Commissioners, and the creation of the role of special collectors, will not help to probe this in any meaningful way.  The opening paragraph of the Minister's speech states: &ldquo;bearing in mind that such <Col N="443" /> evasion is difficult to detect at this remove.&rdquo;  If we all agree that it is difficult to detect at this remove, and I agree, I do not understand how the special collector is suddenly going to be able to detect it and establish the validity of the declaration.  That is a particularly disgraceful provision.</P>
    <P>I am curious about another aspect of the Minister's speech.  In line with the parliamentary questions answered in the House the Minister again said that he cannot say how many cases precisely benefited under the 1988 amnesty except in the form set out in his speech.  However, he conceded that most were in the tax net already and were in arrears.  He said that only 366 taxpayers &mdash; I thought the figure was 284 &mdash; were first time taxpayers and 13 companies which were not previously recorded by Revenue.  That is a very small number, but, obviously, they are extremely wealthy individuals and companies.  He went on to say that this amnesty has been framed with a particular focus on the liabilities from the pre-1991 era which are not on the record. If we failed in 1988 I do not know how we are going to attract them on this occasion. Deputy Yates dealt with this at some length.  I presume the Minister is referring to &ldquo;Albert's amnesty.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Obviously I did not get injury time for the arrival of the cavalry. I presume the Minister is referring to what is now known as the main amnesty and to the fact that this fantastic inducement of tax at 15 per cent will cause these people to regularise their affairs.  It is a fantastic inducement if you have money outside the State or in a bogus account in the country for the past 15 years.  That person will now get away with paying tax at the rate of 1 per cent as compared to the rest of us who pay at present 48 per cent and, indeed, if you go back over the 15 years a great deal more when it was in excess of 60 per cent at some stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that a Government <Col N="444" /> who promised such high standards in public life and promised to usher in an ethics in Government Bill immediately prior to this legislation has forgotten about that Bill which is now on the back-boiler. That says a great deal about ethics in public life.  The Minister is being slightly disingenuous in the way he has explained its provisions but I believe he has decided to make the best of the political circumstances in which he finds himself. It will be windfall in the framing of the 1994 budget and I suspect it will not do any harm to the accounts of Fianna Fáil either.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on his wisdom, foresight and courage in bringing this important Bill before the House.  I am convinced that the Opposition do not understand the real thinking behind it and I am surprised by their attitude.  Do they not realise that money is urgently required for a great many services and for job creation purposes?  All county councils are requesting money from the Department of the Environment every day for their county roads.  The county roads in County Kerry, for example, are in a desperate state.  That is one of the reasons this Bill should be welcomed.  The money that will accrue after the Bill is passed will help in the provision of badly needed infrastructure such as water and sewerage schemes, the improvement of tourist roads and other developments.  I would like to see the money being used to improve our health services and additional moneys provided for the health boards.  Some of this money should find its way to improving the education service for our young people.  Are the Opposition saying that money should not be obtained to provide these services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can use the money to assist our farmers.  Job creation is our top priority. The capital repatriated can be invested in projects such as agricultural and horticultural enterprises as well as tourism enterprises and community based projects. It could also be used as venture capital for manufacturing enterprises. <Col N="445" /> Finance will become available for job creation generally and it will enable the Minister to pay the justifiable pay increases to public servants whether in the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána, the health boards or the county councils.</P>
    <P>This Bill, colloquially known as the tax amnesty Bill, has one aim, to bring much needed cash into the Irish economy.  The money should be used to redress the imbalance of the current tax system and generate more jobs.  The Bill was both accepted and opposed by the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Yates. Fianna Fáil are confused, but unlike the Opposition parties, we are only confused by the Fine Gael stance on this Bill.  Fine Gael has engaged in political posturing in the past few months but, unfortunately, that is all we have seen.  We have yet to see them perform in a constructive political manner.  We will wait in the hope that after the summer recess things will improve and it will behave more like an Opposition political party. Fianna Fáil in Government introduced an amnesty in 1988 for tax evaders and this proved to be extremely successful.</P>

      <P>The amnesty of 1988 should not be confused with the 1993 amnesty.  Its purpose was to introduce a new self-assessment system.  This amnesty yielded £500 million to the Exchequer.  I have no doubt that the 1993 amnesty will prove to be equally successful, if not more so.  As in the case of the 1988 amnesty, nobody is sure as yet exactly how much money this current amnesty will yield.  Conservative estimates are quoted as saying that it could yield as much as the 1988 amnesty, but these same people were quoted as saying the 1988 amnesty would only yield £30 million.  As no one is sure until the amnesty is introduced and implemented, I will continue to be optimistic about the <Col N="446" /> figure and say that it will exceed the 1988 figure which was in excess of £500 million.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the 1993 amnesty are to provide a final opportunity to those who have failed to get their tax affairs in order in advance of more severe and stringent tax laws and to further enhance the tax compliance programmes.  The most important aspect of all is to secure the highest proportion of previously undisclosed sums in the period up to and including 5 April 1991.</P>
      <P>This latter point has been discussed in great detail at our parliamentary party meetings and it is on this point that I would like to concentrate.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that this Bill will introduce a special unit within the Revenue Commissioners, which will not communicate with the rest of the Revenue, for the purpose of collecting this &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;.  This unit will allay the fears of those involved in the return of the &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; that they might in future be subject to ongoing tax investigations.  The staff of this special unit will be obliged to respect absolutely the anonymity of applicants.  There will be penalties for breach of such confidentiality to the general Revenue Commissioners.  This will only apply to those availing of the 15 per cent &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; amnesty.  People dealing with the general amnesty must, however, deal with the main Revenue offices and will not have the protection of remaining anonymous.</P>

    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his proposals to imprison people who after this amnesty still try to evade their taxes.

      <P>In 1992 the PAYE worker paid 88 per cent of all income tax collected by the State.  This unfair burden must be shared on a more equitable basis.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism of the Government's intention to introduce this amnesty, but not one of the critics has suggested that there is not money out there which will come back into the economy through this amnesty.  The Exchequer needs any money that can be found without further taxing the PAYE worker.  This money can be used to reduce the national debt.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that there is in excess of £2 billion in overseas accounts. When this money is returned it will be taxed at a rate of 15 per cent.  There has been no suggestion as to exactly how much money is held in banking institutions within Ireland.  This money will also be liable to the 15 per cent tax rate.</P>
      <P>This Bill also introduces tough new measures for tax evaders.  Prison terms of up to eight years will apply to financial institutions who aid and abet tax evaders.

    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's speech this morning on this Bill, and I was delighted to hear his tough stance with regard to this amnesty.  Section 4 provides for the withdrawal of full benefits in certain circumstances.  These cases include an individual who does not file a correct return of income for the 1992-93 tax year in time; in the case of a company if a correct return for any period ending in the year to 31 December 1993 is not delivered on time; declarations given by a taxpayer to the chief special collector which prove to be false; and if the amount <Col N="448" /> paid by the taxpayer to the special collector was less than the full amount due by that taxpayer.  These cases must surely alleviate the fears that have been expressed by those people, who have been knocking the amnesty as a write-off for tax dodgers to the detriment of the legitimate taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I have also listened with interest to Deputy Yates speaking on this Bill this morning.  I found it quite amusing listening to him speak against this amnesty especially as only last month Deputy Yates wrote an article for the <i>Irish Press</i> suggesting that such an amnesty be introduced. He then went on to introduce an amendment to the Finance Bill also suggesting that the Government introduce such an amnesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Leary for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this Bill.  The accusation levelled at the Minister, his Department and the Revenue Commissioners that they are not fully behind this Bill has been proved false.  There is no doubt that this is a very comprehensive Bill and is more far reaching than originally expected.  Expert opinion raised some doubts about the workings of what was originally discussed a few weeks ago.  There is no doubt that a serious effort has been made to make this Bill work and I welcome that.  Certain Members of the Opposition were trying to sabotage the whole Bill.  One Member of the Progressive Democrats talked about going to the Supreme Court and everywhere else to stop it.  I am delighted that the Bill is comprehensive and I have no doubt it will increase the Exchequer funding and ease the situation for the Minister in his next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> In his contribution the Minister said that a lesser charge was an essential feature of any scheme aimed at bringing people within the tax net.  That is important because, regardless of what we believe, we would not have attracted that money back into our system.  Many people were of the view that it was only a matter of time before the Revenue Commissioners caught up with those who were defaulting on paying their taxes.  We are all aware that is untrue.  In very few cases would the Revenue Commissioners have been able to find &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; abroad.  They might do so in a small number of cases but not in the majority. If the Revenue Commissioners had access to offshore accounts the lucrative system on those islands would collapse because the main attraction for tax defaulters is the secrecy surrounding such accounts.  There was never any question of the Revenue being able to access those accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) (a) (iii) refers to &ldquo;a full and true statement of the respective amounts&rdquo;.  We are all aware of the complexity of tax matters and that there are numerous accounts and tax advisers dealing with such matters.  If a person discloses what he or she believes to be full liability and makes a genuine effort to repay it, who will deem that to be a full disclosure?  The Minister stated that Revenue would be prohibited from pursuing such an investigation further unless it can show to the satisfaction of the appeal commissioners that any declaration made by an individual to the chief special collector under sections 2 or 3 was not a full and true declaration of the amounts of his or her undisclosed income or chargeable gains, or of the amount of value added tax contained in the arrears of tax paid, as appropriate. With whom does the buck stop?  Will the chief special collectors have the final decision?  Will it be possible for a Revenue official to claim in, say, one year's time that a person did not declare his full accounts although the person involved may genuinely believe he or she did so? There is a maze of personal and company advantages one can seek.  An individual <Col N="451" /> may genuinely claim some of those advantages but, subsequently, it may be proven that it was a mistake.</P>
    <P>What powers will the chief special collectors hold?  Will they merely issue receipts or discuss tax affairs with people and agree on a tax liability?  Will it be impossible for the Revenue to go back to a person some time later and claim that he or she did not make a full disclosure? That is an important issue.  The tax system is a complicated one and, therefore, a clear agreement should be in place in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will ease the difficulties faced by the Minister and the Government in the next budget.  Pressures have eased already because the economy is picking up and, hopefully, the tax amnesty will bring in a considerable amount of money to assist the Government in doing many of the things which the Opposition want us to do, such as reduce taxes, increase various services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the enthusiasm of the previous speakers in regard to this tax amnesty and I am reflecting a majority viewpoint.  We must not forget that 88 per cent of our population are made up of PAYE taxpayers. This measure will not send a positive <Col N="453" /> message to the PAYE sector and other compliant taxpayers.  When they discover that those who have defaulted on tax in the past are being provided with an amnesty, naturally, they will query their rights.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1988, makes interesting reading, especially the comments in regard to the tax amnesty introduced at that time.  The present tax amnesty is even more generous than the one introduced in 1988.  It represents a rather defeatist attitude in trying to get people to repay their taxes.  Much has been said about the previous amnesty and the fact that it raised £500 million when it was envisaged that it would raise only £30 million.  It is interesting to note that the previous amnesty sought a repayment of all due taxes.  One can see the generosity of the present amnesty which proposes a 15 per cent interest rate.</P>
      <P>Section 68 of the Finance Act, 1988, sanctioned the varying of certain outstanding interest charges and penalties when taxpayers were making up their total liabilities.  It covered such matters as income tax, surtax, corporation profits tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value added tax, PRSI contributions, health contributions, employment and income levies.  It is significant to note that those taxes were eligible for exemption from interest and penalty charges only. That is a significant point having regard to the fact that a two-tiered tax system is being introduced in this case.  In this amnesty we are talking about unpaid personal income tax and capital gains tax with only 15 per cent of all taxable income being paid.  Yet in other tax categories, such as capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, the residential property tax, value added tax and corporation tax, all tax due must be paid.  It is therefore apparent that the Minister is being extravangantly generous as far as defaulting taxpayers are concerned and that sets a bad example, especially for PAYE workers who are taxed at source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Government decide to introduce a tax amnesty for those who failed to pay their taxes over the years and deprive us of proper education and <Col N="454" /> health facilities, housing and so on?  The Minister is appointing special tax collectors to deal with those defaulting taxpayers who decide to pay the arrears of income tax and capital gains tax and the names of those defaulters will not be made known to the Revenue Commissioners. Contrast that with Ray MacSharry's tax amnesty in 1988 by which £500 million was recovered.  At that time the defaulters paid all the taxes and I do not think the same secrecy prevailed.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that from 1988 to the present day there has been a series of scandals which has rocked this country to its foundations and has damaged the body politic.  We in politics have been tarnished by what is happening outside. The present amnesty would seem to compensate many of those involved in those scandals because I have no doubt that the money gleaned from the various property dealings was hived off into bank accounts abroad.  These people can now bring that money back at 15 per cent. There will be a veil of secrecy over these individuals and they can be secure in the knowledge that the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister will never know who they are.</P>
    <P>It is hard to reconcile such a benign tax regime for those tax defaulters with the treatment meted out to the likes of farmers and others who, when they try to reconcile tax arrears that have accumulated over the years and settle with the Department of Finance have found, if their debt is in excess of £10,000, that their names are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Such information is automatically extracted by the press and the names are published in the national newspapers. The Minister may say that these are taxes which should have been paid.  However, in defence of those people, many of them often have to resort to borrowing or selling some assets in order to placate the taxman.  It is hard to justify the fact that those people's names will be published if they owe over £10,000 while at the same time people who have invested millions in bank accounts abroad can bring money back under this amnesty and they will be entirely protected.  Maybe the Minister <Col N="455" /> should consider giving an amnesty to people who are trying to pay back tax arrears at least up to 14 January next. That idea may be worthy of investigation. I have a certain sympathy for those people, especially when I see what is happening with regard to the present amnesty.</P>
    <P>In 1988 all tax arrears had to be paid under the much tougher tax amnesty.  On 20 April that year the former Labour Deputy, Mr. Barry Desmond stated in relation to the amnesty: &ldquo;It is fundamentally wrong because in three years time people will be baying for another tax amnesty, and perhaps a future Minister will introduce it&rdquo;.  The only thing Barry Desmond got wrong was the time-scale. He said it would be three years, but it is almost five years.  The Labour Deputies on the Government side seem to grasp this idea of a tax amnesty enthusiastically on the basis that it will bring money into the country and help to create jobs.  I do not see the logic of that. By 14 January next year the Minister will have enough headaches trying to reconcile his budget to worry about creating jobs.  I suppose that in order to placate their constituents and to be seen to be doing something they must market this idea, but it is a load of nonsense.  The money retrieved will go into the national coffers to meet demands made on the Minister by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacSharry was hailed as a very good Minister for Finance at the time of the last amnesty.  He stated that tax defaulters would face a much more hostile climate in the future.  I do not know about the hostile climate.  All I know is that small businesses are being pressurised by the sheriff if they fall into arrears.  They claim that the Revenue Commissioners have too much power and the Minister says on television that it would give him a certain amount of pleasure to put people in jail.  On the other hand, we are introducing this amnesty for the big defaulters.  I cannot reconcile that with what Mr. Ray MacSharry said in the past about a much more hostile tax climate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> It is interesting that under the last amnesty Ray MacSharry said that tax defaulters were being given a once off incentive to pay their arrears of tax.  The result was a Pandora's Box of £500 million. Now we are back to the incentives again.  What has gone wrong?  An amnesty was introduced, sheriffs were appointed and attachment orders were introduced.  In the past few years the Revenue Commissioners have been given more stringent powers and yet, five years down the road, we are introducing another amnesty.  I wonder how much more powers the Revenue Commissioners want.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the measure allowing the Minister access to financial institutions to get information.  There will be a lot of resistance if people think the Minister will have access to bank accounts.  The Minister said recently that in this country there are 15 million bank accounts which is a lot for a country with our population.  He said he had five different bank accounts with five different overdrafts.  That area will give cause for a lot of concern.  If the Minister is to go down the road of having access to bank accounts it would behove him to outline exactly what regulations will prevail. The Minister is cloaking this amnesty in secrecy and hopes to get money in from abroad and from this country as well.  Along with all that he is looking for extra measures, but unless he specifies the circumstances in which he can have access to people's bank accounts people will be very concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, at the moment the power of the Revenue Commissioners to access bank accounts is through the High Court.  There is no other way.  In 1986 the IMF recommended full attachment of bank accounts.  Neither the Government of the day nor successive Governments did that and it is not being done under this legislation either.  It was recommended on the basis that we were introducing self-assessment. Other countries, such as the UK, where there is no self-assessment do have access to bank accounts.  I want to <Col N="457" /> make it absolutely clear that we are not making that move.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out the CSO tourism statistics for recent years, highlighting annual changes and trends in traffic from North America.</P>
    <P>The latest tourism estimates available from the CSO for the 1993 season relate to the period January-March and show an 8 per cent increase in overseas visitors on the same period last year.  The first quarter normally accounts for less than 14 per cent of annual tourism and any conclusions reached on so small a base about trends for the remainder of the season have to be treated with some caution. The CSO estimate that traffic grew by 12 per cent from Britain in the first three months of this year on 1992 and by 6 per cent from continental Europe but dropped by over 8 per cent from North America, where the US economy is still coming slowly out of recession.  International tourist traffic out of North America suffered a serious setback in 1991 because of the Gulf War and as a result traffic from that market to Ireland is still struggling to return to the all-time high record figures of 1990.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Ireland's share of the North American market, of people from North America visiting Europe, has declined from 6.5 per cent in 1987 to 5.2 per cent in 1991-92? Is he also aware that the numbers from 1990 to 1992 declined by 30,000? What steps does he propose to take to reverse this significant trend?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the numbers of tourists from North America to Ireland has decreased from the record figure in 1990 of 434,000 <Col N="459" /> to 405,000 in 1992.  The 1991 figure was down on the 1990 figure and the 1992 figure was an increase on the 1991 figure. We hope this year to get back to the 1990 figure.  There are many reasons the number of tourists from North America has decreased.  Bord Fáilte and my Department are aware of the position. Earlier this year there was an active campaign in the United States to boost figures for this year.  People take a number of economic factors into account when deciding on holidays.  I will be pleased if the 1993 North American tourists figures are similar to the 1990 figure.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 2 March last the position regarding the rights and obligations of tourists is evolving on an ongoing basis, particularly in an international context given tourism's growing status as an internationally traded service.</P>
      <P>In addition to benefits from advances made under consumer legislation in recent years, the position of the tourist will be further clarified and strengthened with implementation later this year by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, of the EC Directive on Package Travel.  This will offer the tourist greater protection against non-performance of contract for package holidays incorporating transport, accommodation etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a case for having a charter of tourist rights?  Recently the Minister for Health published a similar charter in respect of hospital patients. Would the Minister agree that people visiting this country should be afforded proper protection against crime which is rampant on our streets?  Prices advertised in respect of Ireland in brochures do not reflect true prices.  Would the Minister not agree that tourists to Ireland should be entitled to know the true prices? Would he also agree that they should be entitled to the car model they have been promised and should be provided with information regarding traffic regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan's question asks if I intend establishing a <Col N="461" /> charter setting out the rights and obligations of tourists.  There have been continuing advances in consumer legislation in recent years and I do not consider there is a need to establish a charter setting out the rights and obligations of tourists.  Irish and international consumers are well informed of their legal rights and obligations in a wide variety of areas.  People have become aware of their rights in so many areas now that I do not believe they are lacking in knowledge in this regard.  Bord Fáilte, through its offices and the RTOs, monitor complaints from tourists.  There is a later question by Deputy Deenihan in regard to that issue.  The number of complaints made, bearing in mind the total number of tourists who visit Ireland, is very small.</P>
      <P>If I felt a particular charter was necessary I would consider the matter further. However, I do not believe it is necessary at present.  The EC Directive on package travel which my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, will introduce later in the year will address some of the concerns outlined by Deputy Deenihan.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister implying that he is rejecting all forms of supervisory activity in the tourist industry? Does the Minister agree that in order to ensure standards are observed in the Irish tourist industry we must have such a charter? I am referring to visitors to this country, not Irish people travelling abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to ensure, through Bord Fáilte, that there is a certain standard in all sectors of the tourist industry.  Deputy Deenihan is correct in this regard.  In the interests of those who make their living from the tourist industry we must ensure that the highest standards obtain and that tourists get the product he or she has paid for. Judging by the level of complaints received by Bord Fáilte, I do not believe there is a need to consider a charter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 13 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, who has primary responsibility for addressing the problem of crime, including tourist related crime, recently outlined to the House various measures being taken by the Garda to combat crime against tourists.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to liaison arrangements between the Garda and the tourism agencies, which include a biannual security meeting involving representatives of the Garda and various sectors of the tourism industry, including hotels, car hire, tourist guides, coach hire and air and sea carriers.  Measures already being taken include: &ldquo;take care messages&rdquo; in overseas promotional literature, and multilingual leaflets for circulation through local tourist offices, hotels, B &amp; Bs, car rental companies etc; Garda patrols, and community relations officers, and &ldquo;take care messages&rdquo; in onboard and in-flight magazines produced by Irish Ferries, Aer Lingus etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, tour guides and coach companies have adopted the practice of warning their clients of the risk of crime while language schools now provide <Col N="463" /> induction talks for visiting students incorporating similar warnings.  Other tourism operators, including car hire companies and accommodation providers, are encouraged by their respective trade organisations to give verbal &ldquo;take care&rdquo; messages to customers.</P>
    <P>It is important also that we do not create a greater problem for ourselves by hyping the issue.  The problem is not unique to Ireland; while the problem here is real, it is mild relative to that existing elsewhere.  We must do what we can to eradicate it and to warn tourists to take care, but we must not frighten them away because the number of tourists affected in any way by crime in Ireland is infinitesimal relative to the number who enjoy themselves with a relaxed, carefree holiday here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I have discussed Uruguay Round issues with my EC counterparts in all the relevant EC Council meetings and I have, of course, also been represented at the various meetings dealing with the Round in Brussels, Geneva and elsewhere, and have had contacts as appropriate with other Community member states and other GATT parties as the talks have progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is fully committed to achieving <Col N="464" /> a successful, global and balanced conclusion to the Round, involving liberalisation commitments from all participants and covering all sectors including agriculture.  The outline EC/US agreement on agriculture reached between the EC Commission and the US administration has been referred to Geneva for integration in the negotiation process of the Round, but it has not as yet been approved by the EC Council of Ministers or, on the US side, by the Congress.  Many member states have raised reservations about parts of the agreement, most notably reservations by France and Ireland that it could not be accommodated within the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme already approved at Community level. We will be seeking to have these reservations fully addressed during the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    <P>The timetable for future meetings depends on progress as the talks continue. There has been a renewed effort in recent weeks to move the negotiations forward.  The Quad countries, the EC, US, Canada and Japan, have undertaken to work towards a market access package, that is, tariff reduction on goods and liberalisation commitments on services, which could be announced by 7 July. They have also endorsed a goal of completing negotiations on the Round by the end of this year.  The market access package would be expected to lay the basis for re-engaging the multilateral negotiations in Geneva as soon as possible after 7 July.</P>
    <P>In Copenhagen on 21 and 22 June the EC Council welcomed the Commission's report on progress to date in the Round. It underlined the need for the Community to continue to play an active part in achieving further progress in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>These recent developments have improved prospects for an early and successful conclusion to the Round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a recent television interview in which our representative at the GATT talks, Mr. Peter Sutherland, emphasised the necessity to complete the negotiations as <Col N="465" /> soon as possible?  Will the Minister agree that the present proposals are balanced in favour of the US, particularly in regard to agriculture?  Will the Minister agree also that the other GATT partners must adopt measures to curb their exports to the same degree as the EC?  We are losing valuable markets because we are keeping our side of the bargain while the US is not.  Will the Minister agree also that the provision for a quantified guarantee of extra access to EC markets must be suspended until final negotiations take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons Mr. Sutherland was considered for the position is that he showed himself to be impartial during his term as EC Commissioner. His nomination was accepted by all concerned.  It is hoped that the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations will conclude by the end of this year.  Following the appointment of the new US administration there are some doubts that this could be achieved but everyone was pleased to note that the conclusion date of 15 December stands. Ireland, with our EC partners, hope the negotiations will conclude by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of agriculture. Ireland, with France, has reservations about the package, known as the Blair House Agreement, negotiated between the then Commissioner MacSharry, on behalf of the Community, and the United States.  Ireland and France reserve their positions in regard to it and the Taoiseach, as recently as last month, when meeting the President and Prime Minister of France, reiterated those concerns. <Col N="466" /> We have some difficulties in this regard and our reservations remain.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the completion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The liberalisation of world trade is a considerable opportunity for Ireland and the world.  On my recommendation my Department has commissioned a study to give a balanced report on the advantages and disadvantages in the negotiations as as to how matters will progress for Ireland.  When the GATT negotiations are concluded, the advantages and disadvantages should be obvious and we will be in a position to make an objective decision in this regard. We have concerns regarding many of the issues raised by Deputy Deenihan but it would be in Ireland's interest, and the interest of the world economy, that these negotiations conclude in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and oral questions Nos. 18 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant easing of exchange rate difficulties for our exporters, the very <Col N="467" /> rapid and very substantial reduction in interest rates, together with our low inflation rate, have created an extremely positive business environment.</P>
    <P>The other key factor in successful export growth is the state of health of our principal markets.  Recent economic commentaries have generally been more optimistic than earlier in the year but it is still too early to tell if there is likely to be a widespread and sustained recovery.</P>
    <P>Indeed, recessionary conditions in certain markets in recent years have not prevented Irish exporters from increasing their market share and, once again, their niche market orientation should help to insulate them, should the general climate be one of weak demand.  For instance, an increase of 40 per cent was recorded in Irish exports to Japan in 1992, despite a downturn in consumer demand there.</P>
    <P>Overall, An Bord Tráchtála is projecting an increase of 5.3 per cent in our exports this year but, more importantly, its target for indigenous exports is an increase of 12 per cent.  Because of the absence of conventional trade statistics, which have not been available since the change in data collection methods at the end of 1992, it has been difficult to gauge trends but on-the-ground assessments by ABT offices overseas indicate that these targets are attainable.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive business survey, carried out this month, bears this out.  It shows that companies are significantly more optimistic about increasing their exports than they were in March.  It is worth nothing, in particular, that they are more optimistic about our most important market, Britain.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular markets which are likely to provide the best growth prospects for exports over the next three years, it is clearly unwise to speak in anything other than broad terms because global economic trends are so difficult to predict, especially in view of the unquantifiable impact of major factors such as the conclusion of a new GATT, the enlargement of the EC, the emergence of the new market economies in Eastern Europe and the creation of <Col N="468" /> the North American Free Trade Area. World merchandise trade grew by 4.5 per cent in 1992 and a figure of 5 per cent is predicted for this year.  To look beyond that is very hazardous and speculative. Rising public debt and fiscal tightening in the US, Germany and the UK is expected to deflate world trade during 1994-95, with a worldwide recovery forecast for 1996.</P>
    <P>In more specific terms, An Bord Tráchtála's regional markets programme, whereby high-growth regions are targeted for intensive attention, has proved to be a success in the 11 markets so far covered, including, for example, Lombardy and Catalonia.  There is no reason to suppose that the excellent results obtained in Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Japan and the Middle East, in 1992, will not continue over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the target which I have set for indigenous exports &mdash; an increase of 50 per cent from the present figure of £3.7 billion to £5.5 billion by 1996 &mdash; can and must be achieved in order to generate the employment growth which is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has confirmed that no trade statistics have been available since December 1992.  Will he tell the House when we can expect, under the new system that there will be figures with which we can make accurate comparison? Does the Minister agree that an over-valued Irish pound is probably the most serious obstacle to enhancing our trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there was a change in the compilation of statistics at the end of December and under the new method of compilation it should be possible, based on VAT returns, to give figures for every half year.  We hope to have figures in the next month or so.  Currency valuation is undoubtedly a major determining factor in successful export trading.  At present our pound is at an acceptable level.  It is self-evident that in order to ensure a successful trading policy there must be a <Col N="469" /> reasonable currency valuation, and that is the case in all international economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to Britain as our most important customer. How does he view the conventional wisdom at the time of the currency crisis that it was incumbent on people trading into the United Kingdom to shift the focus of exports to other EC trading partners? Does he think in hindsight that is a foolish view and that it is inevitable that Britain will remain a major trading partner, given the similarity in language and legal and accounting systems?

      <P>For the foreseeable future the United Kingdom will remain our major trading partner for the reasons outlined by the Deputy &mdash; it is our nearest neighbour, the people speak the same language, the same business techniques are used and so on.  When selling goods Irish companies naturally look to the United Kingdom in the first instance. However, since joining the EC dependence by Irish exporters on the United Kingdom market has reduced from two-thirds to one-third, which is a significant reduction.  If during the recent currency crisis we were as dependent on the UK economy for exports as we were before we became a member of the EC we would have experienced difficulties.  In that 20-year period we have diversified to various other markets.  It is not good business, whether one is in the exporting business or in the service industry, to concentrate all one's eggs in the one basket, to depend on one customer or supplier.  As we have successfully diversified into other markets we are less dependent on the United Kingdom market.  During the currency crisis the Government took all factors into account and made the right decisions.  Hindsight is wonderful vision and economics is not an exact science such as physics and chemistry, but I am satisfied the right decisions were made at the time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the relative improvement in indigenous export projections for this year, but is it not the case that that sector accounts for only a tiny fraction of our total exports and that this ought to be the main focus of Government policy and stimulation in the years ahead?</P>

Last year indigenous exports amounted to £3.7 billion and it is hoped to increase that figure in the next five years to £5.5 billion.  Total exports for last year amounted to £16.6 billion &mdash; I am subject to correction on that figure &mdash; for which £3.7 billion related to indigenous firms.  We wish to increase exports for indigenous firms and it is on that aspect that An Bord Tráchtála and the Department will focus.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte, the Regional Tourism Organisations and Shannon Development have in place established procedures for the receiving and dealing with tourists' complaints and queries about the tourism industry.  Last year, primarily through the local Tourist Information Offices, Bord Fáilte received a total of 2,150 complaints from tourists &mdash; a reduction of 175 on 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a large number of complaints. The total number of visitors from overseas <Col N="471" /> last year was 3.1 million and there were 2,150 complaints.  One complaint is too much but we must expect some level of complaints and I am satisfied that the level is more than reasonable.  Earlier in Question Time the Deputy suggested establishing an ombudsman or a charter. I do not see the need for that and it would not be appropriate to pass tourism complaints to the current ombudsman as his job relates to administrative procedures. There is no need for an ombudsman as the buyer nowadays either in business or in consuming the tourist product in any country is well aware of his rights and is more than willing to pursue them if he feels he has got a bad deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply typifies his attitude to tourism, a very laid back attitude which is nice in a way but in this instance he is missing the point. Would the Minister agree that one of the principal aims of Bord Fáilte and of the tourist industry in general is to encourage tourists to return but that they are not returning? What I am suggesting would be one way of ensuring that tourists who have bad experiences have their complaints dealt with and answered.  It would also ensure that standards would be maintained.  Surely the Minister can see some merit in appointing an ombudsman in the interests of repeat tourism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the best sales person to sell Ireland abroad is the person who comes here, has a good time, gets value for money and goes home happy.  He or she is more likely to influence others to come here than is the promotional activity of Bord Fáilte or anyone else.  I accept that the whole question relates to standards.  With regard to whether I am laid back about tourism, perhaps I am just laid back about life generally.  It may be that I have seen so much it is hard for me to get too excited. Undoubtedly, over the past number of years standards have increased.  I do not need an official report to tell me that, I know it from my own observations. There are now guesthouses that 16 years <Col N="472" /> ago would have gained hotels a Grade A or a three star designation.  That has happened because those involved in tourism know it is their livelihoods that are involved.  Those in the industry realise that tourism is where their children will find jobs, that tourism is an important product and they recognise the competition from other parts of the world. The Deputy's idea is a nice one but there is no need to set up a special ombudsman. I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>Are all the complaints responded to and, if so, by whom?  Will the Minister confirm that a majority of complaints relate to value for money and to the litter problem?  In the light of the recent upsurge in crime against tourists, and in order to avoid giving tourists cause for complaint, will the Minister consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, establishing as a practical measure in some of the Garda stations in the major tourist areas a victim support office where the Association of Victim Support could go into a Garda station and provide help, advice and counselling and language skills in order to assist tourists? There is such a procedure in most continental countries, I understand.</P>

I accept that tourists who get a bad deal probably do not bother to complain, that they simply do not come back and, in addition, probably tell their friends not to come to Ireland.  People in the industry nowadays are more aware of giving tourists a good deal so that they will return.</P>

      <P>Because of the many complaints that are brought to my attention I urge the Minister to review his <Col N="473" /> rejection of establishing an ombudsman to deal with this area.  Is the Minister aware of the significent number of complaints, over 2,000, received by the President from places like Germany and the US particularly, from people who say they love Ireland but are putting off coming here because of our continuing support for hare coursing, for instance, a subject which is very topical in the House?  Has the Minister been in touch with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this regard?  He has been getting similiar complaints.  Would the Minister accept that in the light of the legislation before the House, it is quite likely that this backlash or rejection of Ireland as a tourist destination will increase, given the publicity which may result, unless the Government decides to support the Bill?</P>

One will readily appreciate that 2,150 complainants out of a total of three million tourists would constitute a very small sample.

May I avail of the opportunity to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that sufficient measures are taken to alert tourists to the increasing incidence of tourists being subjected to personal attack, muggings and robbings, especially in urban areas?  Indeed, I encountered such a case myself yesterday when an Australian tourist was deprived of all her belongings and I had to negotiate with the Australian Embassy to faciliate her return to Australia.  As Minister for Tourism, is the Minister causing any steps to be taken to communicate his displeasure to the Garda authorities at the worsening position?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, announced, on 3 May the Government's decisions on the Moriarty Task Force recommendations in relation to the Culliton report and subsequently published the Industrial Development Bill, 1993, which deals with the structure of the industrial development agencies and which is before the Oireachtas at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation of the agencies <Col N="476" /> involve the creation of Forfás, in a co-ordinating role, with Forbairt and IDA (Ireland) being responsible for, respectively, the development of indigenous industry and the attraction of internationally-mobile investment.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I continue to be responsible for, and give policy direction to, An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Forfás will advise on the development and co-ordination of policy within which all three agencies &mdash; that is, Forbairt, IDA (Ireland) and An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; will operate.  Co-ordination will be enhanced by the appointment of the three agency chief executives to the board of Forfás.</P>
    <P>As regards Forbairt and ABT, the existing excellent relationship between the present IDA and ABT will be improved, in whatever respects may be considered necessary, at both national and regional levels, enabling them to fulfil their complementary roles, with the common objective of maximising the potential of indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade and the agencies concerned will operate from a common database to ensure consistency in the treatment of particular sectors and individual clients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Within my short time in Government I have realised that agencies and their officials spend much of their time worrying about their positions and that it is much easier to deal with the Minister concerned.  As far as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I are concerned, we did not have any <Col N="477" /> differences at all.  We are well able to resolve this matter of the relationship with An Bord Tráchtála.  Within the Programme for a Partnership Government and the decision to establish a Department of Tourism and Trade it would be a most nonsensical idea a few months later to hive off the executive arm of the Minister for Tourism and Trade to another body.  It was not an issue.  Since this is the first time I have been asked this question either inside or outside the House I am glad to have had an opportunity to reply.  I read all of the speculation on the matter.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I had no difficulty whatsoever in resolving this matter, much to the chagrin of officials within a wide variety of agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to hear that everything is peace and joy between the two Ministers.  How does the Minister reconcile that with the version of events the Minister for Enterprise and Employment gave us in this House in the course of the past week in our discussions of the Industrial Development Bill, 1993?  Does the Minister accept that I would not in any circumstances wish him anything but good in his new ministry?  Does he agree, having regard to the speculation to which he referred, that I am entitled to ask him if he does not agree that it is daft that we should break up the prospect recommended by Culliton of providing an integrated support service for Irish business by including An Bord Tráchtála in Forbairt, which is the new agency designed to promote and develop indigenous industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree and I do not want to step across any replies any other Ministers might want to give.  I will give the Deputy as open an assessment as I can of the position.  No experts or group of experts, whether under the chairmanship of Culliton or anybody else, remain experts on any given subject indefinitely; they are experts at a given time and give an opinion as they see fit. While Culliton came forward with a set of recommendations, the Government is <Col N="478" /> entitled to make its own recommendations. In the Programme for a Partnership Government it was decided to establish a Department of Tourism and Trade, placing a whole new focus on our operations abroad, to increase our foreign earnings, ensuring a sharply defined focus.  That was a decision taken by Fianna Fáil and Labour when they came to negotiate the Programme for Government.  Culliton never recommended the establishment of a new Department of Tourism and Trade; he never mentioned such an idea.  Had we taken An Bord Tráchtála out of the remit of the Department of Tourism and Trade we might as well have scrapped the idea of establishing a Department of Tourism and Trade in the first instance.  I stand over the statement that there were no difficulties experienced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and me in recognising that fact.</P>
      <P>If at some later stage we find there is a better way of doing it, if things do not work out as expected, then neither he nor I will be too proud to come back and say to the House we will do it another way.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and all members of the Government are determined that industrial policy formulation will revert to Kildare Street and not remain with the Industrial Development Authority where it has resided for many years.  We endeavoured to set up a structure which would develop that concept of policy formulation, devising the best possible system for Irish business.  We will worry about other problems thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to note there is such a unique friendship between the two parties in Government but it might well be the rock on which they will collectively perish.  Would the Minister agree that it was a mistake to establish a separate Department of Tourism and Trade?  Where was the initiative for such an establishment?  Was it from the Fianna Fáil Party or Labour Party in the negotiations leading up to the Programme for Government?  Will the Minister agree that in a small, open economy such as <Col N="479" /> ours there is a need for more integration and less fragmentation?  In addition to the agencies mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte we also have An Bord Bia.  Will the Minister accept that instead of setting up more quangos there is a need to cut bureaucracy and bring people together if we want to develop the economy to its full potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whose idea it was to establish a Department of Tourism and Trade.  He will find it was included in the Labour Party manifesto. I accept the Deputy's point that there is a need for more integration but we also need to create a business climate where people can make money and create jobs.  Five years ago many of the countries in which we are seeking a niche market would have been considered to be in a poor state of development but they are making rapid progress and breaking down layers of regulations. However, in Europe we are introducing more regulations to hamper and control businesses.  The developing countries have enormous growth rates and are creating jobs.</P>
      <P>I agree that business people want to have easy access to State agencies.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, other members of the Government and I &mdash; we are hoping for success &mdash; are testing a particular formula at present.  Forfás, the co-ordinating body, will work in co-operation with IDA (Ireland) and Forbairt.  It is recognised that we have been successful in attracting foreign investment but there is a weakness when it comes to promoting indigenous industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned An Bord Bia which is the subject of a separate question. I have commissioned a study of our overseas representation and I accept that there is a need for rationalisation, be it An Bord Tráchtála, the IDA, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Bord Fáilte and so on.  A study is being carried out to see how this can be done.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Government and I are trying <Col N="480" /> to give business an opportunity to deal with State agencies in a rational way and to eliminate duplication.  As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment said last week, if the system is not seen to be working in two years time we will change it; we will not be afraid to admit to our mistakes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the undoubted fact that the Culliton report never recommended this but is that not the point?  Was it necessary to establish a complex network of new agencies specifically to replace one agency?  Would it not have been in keeping with the spirit of the text of the Culliton report, which the Government states in every interview it is implementing, to allocate some of the tasks to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the remaining tasks to the Department of Foreign Affairs some of whose officers are somewhat reluctant to take up the cudgels on behalf of Irish trade abroad?  I am not suggesting that the Minister's Department be abolished; the Minister would make an excellent Minister for Foreign Affairs and he could conduct our trade at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised some interesting questions about our overseas representation.  There is no doubt that we are under-represented in many countries.  Therefore, there is a need for rationalisation so that everyone focuses on the main task which is to sell Ireland and create opportunities for business. My Department is carrying out a study in this regard.  The aim in establishing a Department of Tourism and Trade was to focus on the need to secure foreign earnings, as agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party in negotiating the Programme for Government. This was not recommended by the Culliton report but the elected representatives have decided to set up a Department of Tourism and Trade.  Our aim is to have an effective mechanism in regard to the new agencies and we should wait and see how they work.  We will not criticise them before they are put into <Col N="481" /> operation.  In two years the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I will review their operations.</P>

      <P>The measures to achieve the indigenous exports target mentioned by the Deputy will appear in the market development sub-programme of the operational programme for industry 1994-99.  This programme is being finalised at present as part of the national plan and will be submitted to the EC Commission as part of the Structural Funds exercise.</P>
      <P>The market development sub-programme for 1994-99 will seek to build on the success of the 1989-93 programme.  It will have as its main aim to promote and develop trade from the Irish indigenous industrial and services sectors through a market-led approach.</P>
      <P>The different measures, which will be implemented by An Bord Tráchtála, will cover issues such as aid for the marketing capability of indigenous Irish firms, increasing the awareness of Irish products overseas, support for small and medium-sized firms to develop their capacity to introduce new products and services in the marketplace and assistance in market development for companies already established or seeking entry to national or regional markets.  In addition, assistance will be provided for the promotion of international services and the textile and clothing sector.  These support measures from An Bord Tráchtála, when applied to the drive and commitment of our exporters, will be the basis for export growth in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree <Col N="482" /> it is essential to provide adequate funding if we are to have a well focused marketing drive to double indigenous exports and reach our targets?  Does the Government propose to make funding available to ensure that our 1,200 indigenous exporters can sell their products in the marketplace, especially within the Single Market?  It is very important that our indigenous exporters concentrate their efforts in the Single Market.</P>

      <P>When the next tranche of Structural Funds is received there will be a market development sub-programme of the operational programme for industry.  Such a programme was successful in the period 1989-93.  I hope the next programme will be equally successful. As the Deputy said, the prospects for growth lie with indigenous firms.  Our target is an almost 50 per cent increase in sales during the next five years, from a figure of £3.7 billion to £5.5 billion. Jobs will be provided in that sector.  I hope that when the national development plan is agreed provision will be made for a strong market development sub-programme.</P>

      <P>Since it is now unlikely that we will get £8 billion from the EC can the Minister say if this will affect his target for 1996?  To what extent is his target based on the development of the services sector which has not yet reached its full potential?  Will he accept that we should not throw money at indigenous industry, rather we need to create the climate in which it can develop and, in particular, to develop our marketing skills and improve the quality of our products if it is to be successful in an ever competitive overseas market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the £8 billion mentioned by the Deputy, I am hopeful that Ireland will be able to secure its fair share of EC funds but that matter has not yet been decided.  The Government is quite confident it can secure those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overseas visits have led me to believe that the greatest opportunity for <Col N="483" /> Irish businesses lies in the services sector. Our high labour costs and other costs mean that some Irish companies cannot compete in the new markets being developed throughout the world.  We have an expertise in the services area which other countries are crying out for. In the past few years many Irish companies have realised their potential in this area and are selling their services to other countries where there is tremendous growth.  We are in a better position than most other countries to sell our services. Much more emphasis will be placed on the services sector where jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>Many Irish companies need to focus more on marketing their services and products.  Some months ago I announced a new marketing initiative, the Euro Place Programme, under which Irish companies will be given a small grant, based on their sales performance, to enable them to attract more marketing people.  I was amazed to ascertain that only about 60 Irish companies had people employed abroad to sell their products. Many companies rely on agents to sell their goods abroad.  While this system can be very successful, these agents usually work for a number of companies.  I was amazed to find that so few companies in Ireland&mdash;a country which has more than £16 billion in exports and is a trading nation &mdash; had people employed abroad to sell their goods and services.  Some of the money under the next tranche of funding will be devoted to this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that more than 100,000 workers depend on our indigenous industries, may I ask the Minister if the Government intends creating a better financial climate for indigenous industries to enable them to prosper?  Would he agree that there are a number of barriers in the system which need to be removed before we can successfully take on the Single Market and other markets?  Some of the barriers in the system are preventing indigenous industries from prospering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the Culliton report was to lower costs thus making companies more competitive. Under the programme announced some weeks ago by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, the Government has committed itself to taking action in a wide variety of areas with the aim of reducing costs.  We need to realise that we are competing on a big stage with companies from other countries which have a more efficient means of doing business and lower costs, including lower wage costs.  We need to eliminate all those barriers if we want to be in a position to compete in these markets.  If we cannot compete in these markets we will not be able to create jobs and will lose some of our existing jobs.  We need to face up to this fact.</P>
      <P>Some economies which were regarded as very badly developed five years ago took action in these areas.  Hard decisions have to be taken by the Government to improve the position of Irish industry. We must be prepared to take those decisions.  Otherwise we will not be able to compete in the markets, and when we cannot compete we are lost.</P>

These companies, which do not have the benefit of a Government jet, have to rely on commercial flights to transport their goods to these markets.

      <P>On 11 June 1993 I opened the biggest ever overseas promotion of Irish goods which took place in Chicago under the title &ldquo;The Look is Ireland&rdquo;.  This three-day promotion involved 112 Irish companies from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. Products on display included classic clothing, knitwear, accessories, jewellery, tabletop crystal, home furnishings, giftware and food and drink.</P>
      <P>The promotion was attended by 382 buyers in the mid-west region of the United States, representing department stores, speciality independent stores, mail order catalogues and premium gift buyers.  An Bord Tráchtála is confident that the sales target for the event of IR£5 million within 12 months will be exceeded.  In addition to immediate sales, the promotion is expected to boost Irish consumer product sales right up to American Thanksgiving Day and Christmas.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Look is Ireland&rdquo; was organised jointly by An Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland and is supported by the International Fund for Ireland.  Of the companies taking part, 87 were from the Republic and 25 were from Northern Ireland.  A British junior minister, the Earl of Arran, was also present for part of the event.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Look is Ireland&rdquo; show was based in the Embassy Suites Hotel in Deerfield just outside Chicago.  Several floors of the hotel were transformed into an extended Irish shopping mall with individual shop-fronts and a showroom for each participant &mdash; all designed and built in Ireland.  The hotel featured Irish cusine, music and entertainment throughout the promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there has been an over-concentration on the east coast of America during the past number of years.  We have concentrated on this area for the very good reason that we can sell our products there much more efficiently and speedily.  The holding of the exhibition in Chicago recognised this fact.  It has not yet been decided whether a similar event will be organised next year on a North-South basis, but I hope it will.  The venue of the exhibition will be decided at the time.  An Bord Tráchtála will be placing increased emphasis on the mid-west and western parts of the United States for the very good reasons outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I do not have to hand the figure of our total exports to the United States but the US is our second largest market after the European Community. The United States enjoys a trade surplus with us as we import more from the US than we export to them.  This market is now under active consideration. We hope that the 112 companies, 87 from the South and 25 from Northern Ireland, which participated in the trade show will do increased business with the US.  In the main these are small companies employing a few people but from speaking to them I learnt that seven years ago the majority of them did not exist, and those that existed employed only one or two, whereas now they employ between 20 and 30 people each. There has been an increase in this area.</P>

      <P>These promotions are a <Col N="488" /> very good idea, particularly the cross-Border participation because it is better that Ireland is not competing with itself at international trade shows.  How are companies in the Republic selected to participate in a trade show?  Is it open to everybody to be considered for selection or are only the larger companies in the sector considered?  What is the cost of the promotion?  Is this fully covered by the Department or agencies under its aegis or do the participating companies make a contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the participating companies were very small.  An Bord Tráchtála contacted as many small companies as possible and invited them to participate.  The companies have to bear a certain proportion of the costs themselves &mdash; I do not have the details of the individual cost for each company. As most of the companies are small, they would be assessed on the same basis.</P>
      <P>The cost of the promotion was met by the International Fund for Ireland, the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland and An Bord Tráchtála. I do not have the figure of the net cost to An Bord Tráchtála.  The major cost will be met from the International Fund for Ireland which was very anxious that we would have an Ireland show abroad.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, we are creating a brand image of Ireland and this creates a showpiece for the progress we have made in economic co-operation and will have an impact on larger political questions.</P>

      <P>I met with Mr. Robert Atkins, MP, Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, to consider tourism issues at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental <Col N="489" /> Conference last March. We agreed that cross-Border co-operation in this area could result in considerable mutual economic and community benefit.  It is the policy of this Government that co-operation should be directed in particular towards activities and markets which generate new business, and should be mutually advantageous to both North and South.</P>
      <P>The relevant tourism authorities, North and South, are currently working jointly on a number of tourism developments including the development of an all-Ireland computerised reservations system, the restoration and marketing of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal and the development of the north-west passage &mdash; a new touring route between Dublin and the north west.</P>
      <P>Since our March meeting, I have asked Bord Fáilte to examine in addition, the feasibility of further cross-Border initiatives in marketing and development of all-Ireland guide books and trails, and I have asked CERT to pursue areas for further training co-operation.

When the Minister sets up the new tourism council will he consider including representatives from the North?  This would be a very convenient way of encompassing the tourism sector in the North in the broader picture.  Is it possible to include the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in all our tourist literature and stands abroad? Does he agree that it is better to sell the island of Ireland as a whole rather than just the Twenty-six Counties and that it is easier to create a brand image of the country as a whole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When setting up the new tourism council I will certainly bear in mind the possibility of having a representative from the Northern Ireland tourism association.  We have made progress in promoting an image of Ireland as the island of Ireland.  Earlier this year <Col N="490" /> at the international tourist fair in Berlin, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte were represented on the same stand and part of the cost of this venture would have been partially met from the International Fund for Ireland. This is the second year that has occurred and it is the intention to co-operate on an all-Ireland basis.  We will have an all-Ireland tourist and hotel guide.</P>
      <P>In May of next year the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal will open and people will be able to see evidence of cross-Border co-operation.  Together with my counterpart, Mr. Atkins, in the Northern Ireland office and our respective agencies, we hope to develop co-operation in the coming months and years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is adopting this approach.  I made the point in the previous question that we need to market the country as a whole internationally.  In relation to domestic tourism, does he agree that there is greater potential in encouraging southerners to go North and northerners to come South on holidays?  Many northerners go to Donegal but they do not tend to come further South.  Has the Minister any plans, in conjunction with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, to organise awareness and promotional campaigns in both directions?  It would not only be good for tourism on both parts of the island but equally it would be very good from a political point of view if people were to visit and get to know each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not discussed this with Mr. Atkins but it is a very good idea.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, apart from the Northern Ireland people who visit Donegal, few come South and the ratio of people from the South going to the North on holidays in infinitesimally small.  I do not have the exact figures but from the statistics I have seen over the years it is a very small figure.  Deputy Harney's suggestion is good and I will take it up with the Department.</P>

      <P>My Department is working with An Bord Tráchtála to monitor the implications for Irish exporters of the Green Dot programme on new packaging arrangements in Germany.</P>
      <P>Germany's new and comprehensive packaging laws became fully effective on 1 January 1993 and all suppliers to the German consumer market are now obliged to arrange for the collection and delivery to recycling plants of all product containers and transport wrapping.  The legislation affects all consumer packaging whether the product is manufactured in Germany or abroad.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations is to create an additional cost for the disposal of packaging for everyone in the manufacturing, distribution and retailing chain &mdash; a cost which must be borne in mind by exporters as they prepare quotes for the German market.  However the additional cost will apply equally to all, Germans and exporters alike, and therefore does not create an unfair competitive advantage.  An Bord Tráchtála organised a workshop to brief almost 100 Irish suppliers to the German market on the new packaging requirements.  Its Düsseldorf office continues to monitor the regulations and to advise Irish companies on how to adapt their marketing strategies to meet the new requirements.</P>

An Bord Tráchtála and Irish companies who export to the German market have been aware for some time of these new regulations and are complying with them.  If one were to place a bet one could do so with a fair amount of certainty that this type of regulation will become part of an EC directive and will apply throughout the Community. The manner in which Germany has applied the regulation is perhaps a lesson to us all.  The Germans have applied it rigidly for everybody with no exemptions, exclusions or anything else. It just had to work.  It caused some difficulties but it applies to everyone in the German market.  If it becomes a directive nobody can ignore it.  In a short time Irish exporters who are thinking of exporting to the German market or to anywhere in Europe will have to comply with an EC directive which will follow on from the German legislation.  Irish businesses should speed up because this is what they will have to face in the next few years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the packaging requirements in Germany in addition to the blue angel, which is an eco-labelling scheme applying to approximately 3,500 product ranges, were introduced for commendable and environmental reasons, because they do act as a barrier to trade?  The Minister is right in saying it is only a matter of time before they are applied to the Community at large.  Would he agree that Irish companies should be encouraged, <Col N="493" /> in advance of the regulation, to prepare for this rather than force the Government to seek derogation in relation to these matters?</P>

This Government or any Government here would be in a very weak position were they to seek a derogation because, as I have pointed out, the system operates efficiently in Germany.  Irish companies would need to speed up because if the scheme is operating in Germany it will apply to the rest of Europe in the very near future, and rightly so.  Even though it involves extra costs, I believe that for environmental reasons, which Deputy Harney would be very interested in, it is a very good thing.</P>

    <Title>Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, on Wednesday, 23 June 1993:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, believing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that the proposed tax amnesty is an affront to tax compliant citizens,</P>
    <P>(b) that it rewards those who have broken tax laws and exchange control regulations and will encourage further tax cheating,</P>
    <P>(c) that it is particularly unacceptable that those who benefited from the 1988 amnesty and who have since again reneged on their tax obligations to the community will again be allowed to evade penalties and interest,</P>
    <P>(d) that the guarantees of anonymity offered to tax offenders will facilitate further evasion and will inhibit the investigation of the source of moneys which may, <i>inter alia</i>, have originated from serious criminal activities,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was speaking of my concern about an implication in this Bill in relation to the appeals officer and the right of the Revenue Commissioners to have access to bank accounts.  I pointed out that in this country there is reputed to be 15 million bank accounts.  The main objective of the tax amnesty is to ensure that not alone are tax affairs put in order in Ireland but also that tax affairs in regard to money invested abroad, for whatever selfish <Col N="575" /> reasons or motives of the original investors are also put in order.  From what we read in relation to property scams, etc., and much media speculation that this money has been hived off in foreign bank accounts, I am sure the objective is to ensure that some of that money returns to this country.  I wonder whether this specific measure could have a counter-productive effect?  Could it stimulate people who may have accounts in banks or building societies in this country, by virtue of the fact that the Revenue may have access to their accounts, to move them abroad?  I am concerned that this may defeat the objective of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>I pointed out earlier that on previous occasions many speakers welcomed the amnesty on the basis that it would return money to this country and also that it would result in the creation of jobs.  I take a different point of view because it is clear in the budgetary arithmetic of the Minister for Finance for this year that already there are dark, ominous clouds looming in regard to next year's budget and how it can be sustained.  The Government have to look at all the pending extra expenditure &mdash; for example, the Aer Lingus equity, the overrun on social welfare, the increased public account expenditure &mdash; all of which will come into play later this year.  The eventual target for the finalisation of the amnesty is 14 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to his budgetary arithmetic, the Minister is hoping to exceed the £500 million which the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, achieved in 1988.  It is obvious to everybody that another objective is to try to placate the unions, because it appears that the Minister and, indeed, the Government do not have a healthy relationship with them. This is understandable because it is not so long ago since the 1 per cent income levy &mdash; a punitive instrument &mdash; was introduced.  This 1 per cent levy was imposed on the harassed PAYE person. These people will look with absolute cynicism on the anticipated achievements of the proposed amnesty, a measure that is being made available to people who <Col N="576" /> cheated the State out of millions of pounds and invested the money abroad. That should be contrasted with PAYE earners who are taxed at source and cannot evade the tax system even if they wanted to.  People in the PAYE sector will be disillusioned by the fact that this amnesty is being provided for the &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; in our society, selfish people who invested money abroad and deprived this country of much needed finance which could have been used in many ways.  Now they are being compensated for doing that.  In the case of the 1988 tax amnesty, people had to pay all their due taxes and only penalties and interests were waived. If the Minister is trying to attract this money back into the country, why is it necessary to apply a 15 per cent interest rate?  This measure imposes no penalty on those people for what they have done to our economy down through the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is using a blunt instrument and in the process he is damaging the credibility of compliant taxpayers.  This is an immoral and unsustainable measure.  It flies in the face of logic.  In my view the Government introduced this measure in the hope of placating organisations such as the trade unions and of abolishing the 1 per cent income levy later this year.  That is its objective in regard to the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not adopting a positive approach to this matter and I am concerned about the secrecy which cloaks such dealings.  If those defaulters are allowed pay only 15 per cent interest their identity should be made known in the same way as the names of taxpayers with tax liability arrears in excess of £10,000 are published.  There is no justice attached to this tax amnesty.  It is immoral and unfair to people who abide by our taxation code.</P>

      <P>Deputy Finucane's contribution was similar to &ldquo;the mint with the hole&rdquo;.  It lacked realistic content, he posited a world of make believe, one that exists only in the Deputy's mind.  Like Deputy Finucane, I would like it if everybody was perfect and paid their taxes &mdash; the wealthy, the not so wealthy and the poor people.  However, the world does not operate in that manner. As Deputy Finucane was a PAYE earner for some time, he should be well aware that 90 per cent of our tax is paid by PAYE earners.  The remaining 10 per cent is paid by professional people, farmers and the self-employed.  The structure is totally lopsided and unfair to the ordinary worker.  I would like to see everybody paying their lawful taxes and behaving themselves, but that would be a make-believe world, not reality.  That type of world exists only in the minds of people such as Deputy Finucane.</P>

      <P>This is the second time an amnesty measure was introduced. Deputy Kemmy should recall what the former Deputy, Barry Desmond, stated in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must deal with the realities of life as we find them and not as we would like them to be.  We must deal with facts, not with make-believe. The proposed amnesty is an attempt to deal with the reality and to confront the position as it is and not as we would like it to be.  I am well aware of the limitations of the proposed tax amnesty, probably <Col N="578" /> more so than most Deputies.  Nevertheless, that does not blind me to what could be beneficial to our economy and our taxpayers if this amnesty is successful. This measure is the lesser of three evils.  It is not, as Deputy Finucane claimed, an effort to placate the trade unions.  It has nothing to do with the trade union movement or another wage agreement.  If Deputy Finucane could cast his sights further afield he would discover that tax amnesties are not unique to Ireland.  They are a well known economic device throughout the world. Germany and France, who are much wealthier than Ireland, have had to introduce tax amnesties at various times to confront the reality of money earned in those countries being invested in offshore islands and countries such as Switzerland.</P>
      <P>For many reasons which I do not understand the proposed tax amnesty has got a very bad press.  The media has dealt with this tax amnesty with great relish and energy, but even the press is not above reproach.  It is not infallible and on this occasion it posited also an idealistic world of make-believe in respect of the proposed tax amnesty.  It deals with it in a black and white manner, avoiding the grey areas.  For reasons best known to itself, it portrayed the tax amnesty as an immoral measure.</P>
      <P>Many abusive words have been used in regard to the tax amnesty.  We could all adopt the attitude of Deputy Finucane and abuse tax offenders.  He used words such as &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo;, but tax defaulters are not all &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; or super-rich.  On the contrary, it is my understanding that many of them are professional people, farmers' business people and the self-employed. It is easy to select phrases and labels and cast abuse which may make newspaper headlines but that does not deal with reality.  The words &ldquo;tax cheats&rdquo; were used also in regard to such people, as if Members of this House would not cheat the tax system if they could get away with it.  Tax defaulters are not made up of one group of people, tax defaulting is endemic in our society and being abusive in this regard will do nothing to assist our economy or PAYE earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> We must face reality and do everything possible to attract back moneys which are illegally invested abroad.  We must also do everything possible to deal with people who are not paying their fair share of taxes here.  We must discover how the tax net was so easily evaded in the first place, seal the loophole and then try to attract the money back into our economy. When we get that money back we should attract the people who own that money into our tax net and make them pay their fair share of taxes.  This measure is not a foolish one.  It is a practical measure which will face up to the reality that many people, for reasons that are immoral have taken money out of our economy and invested it abroad.  Once they are in the tax net we can ensure that they pay their fair share of taxes in the future.  That is the whole purpose of the amnesty, which also recognises the fundamental inequalities in the taxation system.  It is an attempt to bring mechanisms into play that will stop people evading and avoiding tax in the future.</P>
    <P>If we ignore the problem of the so-called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money, we are shying away from the real world, the world of people, the world of tax evaders.  However, if the money is brought back we can use it to good effect.  I do not know how much money will be realised if the tax amnesty is successful, but whatever it is it will be money that we did not have before.  The fundamental flaw in the arguments put forward by the opponents of the tax amnesty is that they cannot suggest what should be put in its place.  There is a pregnant pause if they are asked that question on radio, on television or in this House.  What we are seeing is pure opportunism.  They are using this opportunity to paper over the cracks in their own structure which are caused by lack of discipline and lack of leadership in their own party.  They are adopting the old tactic whereby if one's case is weak one tackles one's opponent.  All we have heard here is sound and fury but nothing positive or useful.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House, with the exception of the Democratic Left, have <Col N="580" /> their own proposals in regard to the tax amnesty.  Because this proposal has come from this Government it suits the opponents, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, to attack it and throw enough dirt at it in the hope that some of it will stick.  However, the bottom line is that if asked what they would put in its place they have nothing whatsoever to offer.  That points to the bankruptcy and transparency of their arguments.  I do not like people who avail of taxation and, having done that, do nothing for people who live in the here and now.  If this amnesty is successful, taxation should increase and more money should become available in the short term to alleviate the desperate situation we are in in regard to finding equity for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Every week, in response to pressure from the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped, motions are put down here asking for £16.5 million.  If the money were available I would be the first person to advocate spending it.  Similarly £42 million is needed to fully implement the Child Care Act, and opponents of the tax amnesty are calling for its implementation in full.  I support them also. However, they do not say where the £42 million will come from.  There is an obligation to be responsible in Opposition also.  That £42 million is not there but if money is brought back into the economy through the tax amnesty it is possible that the money could be used for such purposes.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago physically handicapped people demonstrated outside the Dáil, having come to see me as chairman of my party, and they made a very good case for more spending on physically handicapped in our society.  Again, the money is not there right now.  Indeed, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is besieged by lobbies every week seeking more money.  They are entitled to make their case in a democratic society. However, the Opposition are leading many of these delegations but they are bankrupt of ideas about where the money is to come from.  The time has come for more responsible Opposition.  We do not <Col N="581" /> need people hoping to make the headlines with catch cries and slogans.  Any persceptive critic of this debate will see that what is being put forward by the Opposition is a smokescreen, a bogus, spurious approach, a monument to bogus punditry with nothing real to offer.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is endemic in our society. It is not the preogative of the super-rich but goes right through society.  The proposed tax amnesty is an attempt to face up to that in an honest and realistic way.  It admits that our tax system is lopsided and unfair and, above all, full of loopholes through which money can be easily spirited out of the country.  What is needed is to bring it back into our society and use it for constructive purposes, such as alleviating the sorry plight of Aer Lingus, the suffering of handicapped people and coping with the results of child abuse.  I would be against the idea of letting that money slip into the maws of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The next step will be to extend that amnesty into other areas of our society, for instance, the black economy, social welfare and other areas of life.  We live in an imperfect society.  It is difficult to achieve 100 per cent success in anything. Since I came to this House 12 years ago I have seen a lot of legislation pass through.  Much of it was well intentioned and aspirational but it is never applied 100 per cent.  We will never achieve 100 per cent success.  We will never have a taxation system that will bring in a 100 per cent tax yield.  If that were the case, it would be a wonderful country to live in, truly a country of saints and scholars. However, we live in a country which is like every other country, where there are good people and not so good people, where people are doing their best to survive and where there are crooks and gangsters.  It is said that sometimes people whose voices are not heard have little virtue.  That is true in this respect as well.</P>
    <P>I hope when this amnesty goes through this House it will be implemented rigorously and fairly by the tax authorities and that in the future we will see a decreasing amount of tax evasion.  I <Col N="582" /> hope the penalties will be implemented by the Department of Justice in the future.  If people evade their taxes they must take their punishment like everybody else and, if necessary, go to prison. It has been said that if the famous jockey, Lester Piggott, had been living here, he would, instead of going to prison have got a nomination for the Seanad.  That day is gone.  The people who evade their taxes, be they influential, powerful or ordinary, will pay the price.  We will show, by example, that we intend to make these laws stick so that tax evasion will be scaled down and all people will pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>This proposed amnesty will be a water-shed in the taxation code of this country. It would be unrealistic to say that tax evasion will be a thing of the past. However, it will be scaled down; everybody will pay his or her fair share and this will be a better place to live in and where we can tackle some of the problems that have long bedevilled our country. I hope this debate will take on a more mature ring so that we can have a general debate.  If the proposed amnesty can be improved on Committee Stage that is all to the good.  We have an obligation to run this country and find enough money to meet the increasing demands.  This amnesty is a mechanism to bring more money into our economy to tackle the things I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this very important debate which affects every person in this country.  What affects everyone is the attitude of this Government towards people who are honest, upright and diligent in their affairs.  The impression is going abroad that this country is full of racketeers, full of people who are trying to circumvent the system of justice.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There are so many decent, <Col N="583" /> hardworking people, with families, who are diligent about their tax affairs and want to keep them up to date.  I know many publicans who check their takings nightly and leave aside the amount of money due for VAT to send it away. They are diligent about this because they realise that if they fall behind they will be in trouble.</P>
      <P>Other people involved in big business and who have contacts believe they can circumvent the tax system, but they represent a small number.  Some people would question how others who can afford a good lifestyle are being granted an amnesty.  The people who would ask about those people's lifestyles are diligent in paying their bills and their taxes.  I am sure there are many annoyed spouses wondering how a neighbour can afford a good lifestyle, the big car, the yacht in the bay and two holidays while they cannot.  The simple answer is that he or she was not paying taxes and the Government now suggest to give them special consideration.  Those people represent a small number in any society.  I may be pointing the finger wrongly at some people &mdash; they may have won the lottery and told nobody about it.  The Government has said that if those people come back within the net, they will let them off with paying 15 per cent tax.  For the past ten to 20 years those people may have paid some tax but they were not meeting their full tax commitment and that is fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>This Government is becoming more like a soap opera.  Big business, money under the table and a smart Dallas lifestyle is being promoted.  We know how soap operas end.  Everyone is a loser. This Government and country will be losers because of the attitude and image portrayed in this House in recent legislation. Such legislation does not reflect the views of the people.  We are heading in the wrong direction and it is time to stop.  If people default on paying their taxes penalties should be applied not an amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most amazing aspect of this Bill relates to the chief special collector.  His <Col N="584" /> role reminds me of that of a confessor in the confessional.  He has a vow of secrecy. He hears all the big sins but is not allowed to tell anybody.  He will give absolution and people will be let off with a burden lifted from their conscience.  Those people will have cleaned their souls and will be able to face the world.  That may be okay in the case of confessing sins in a confessional but it is not okay for the chief special collector to operate in that manner in taxable income.  It is not fair that such people can get their affairs in order in the dark of the night, so to speak, and get away with a minimum tax commitment of 1 per cent per annum in respect of a 15 year period, or less if the period is longer.</P>
    <P>The story circulated that this money is to create jobs is the greatest insult.  The unemployed do not want this type of money pumped into job creation.  I do not believe such money will provide for jobs.  It is an insult to the 300,000 unemployed, the majority of whom are seeking work.  I have listened to Government backbenchers say that the money collected will be allocated to provide roads in Cavan, Kerry, drainage works in other areas, establish industries and so on. Such money cannot possibly provide for all these proposed projects.  What type of money is involved?  Is it like the airy fairy £8.8 billion promised through the EC Structural Funds from Brussels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That money has now been reduced to £5 billion or perhaps less. Much time was wasted in regional committees calculating figures on the assumption that they would be allocated a slice of EC Structural Funds of £8.8 billion.  Is this money to be collected to prop up the £8.8 billion?  Is the Government so desperate that it is prepared to reach into any cesspool to get money?  That is not what the people want and it is wrong. How can we be sure that this money is all in off-shore accounts?  How do we know it is not buried in accounts in this <Col N="585" /> country?  If that is the case, what will be the benefit of this amnesty?  Some people have enjoyed the lifestyle I have described and they will declare their income in the confessonal in the dark of the night and get away with paying 15 per cent.  I can see by the smile on the Minister's face that he is beginning to realise this is wrong.  I am glad I took the opportunity to say these few words.  The Minister could have a change of heart yet and this matter can be further teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The proposed amnesty is outrageous and any argument in regard to it does not stand up.  Deputy Kemmy's contribution which condoned this amnesty was a real turnabout.  Deputy Kemmy represents PAYE workers, as do all Deputies. Those workers must pay their tax at source &mdash; money they never see.  They have marched in this city and we will see them march again when they realise that there are people abusing the system.  The Government claims there are a large number of people involved but I do not believe that is the case.  The PAYE workers have been given the impression that the self-employed are ripping off the tax system but nothing could be further from the truth.  Self-employed people are small business people, farmers and others.  I have heard it said many times that farmers should be taxed as they have plenty of money.  It is claimed that they have money buried in the North of Ireland and in some of the European banks.  I would like to meet some of those wealthy farmers and shake their hand and, perhaps, some of their wealth might rub off on me.  Farmers in my area do not have that wealth.  Perhaps some farmers elsewhere have that type of wealth but all farmers should not be tarred with the same brush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small businesses find it hard to survive. Recently I met a small business proprietor who could just about afford to take his wife out for a quiet drink.  That couple have four children.  I could see the worry in his wife's face.  The man was a little more jovial.  His wife is the book-keeper in that small business and she knows the bills that must be met and how <Col N="586" /> difficult it is to make ends meet.  She is very diligent about keeping her tax affairs in order because she dreads not being able to meet her bills and the threat of the Revenue collector.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connaughton.  Perhaps Deputy Crawford may also wish to share time.  There are a range of Deputies on this side who are anxious to debate this issue.</P>
    <P>There is a witchhunt being carried out at present on those involved in small businesses, the shopkeepers, garage proprietors and farmers.  It is perceived that there is a wealth in small business to which the Revenue is not getting access. There is no leeway for people involved in small business.  If those people fall behind in their payments they receive an official letter, followed by a visit from the sheriff.  I am not saying that city people are not diligent in their business affairs but they are not exposed to the same embarrassment as that suffered by a person involved in small business in a rural community who receives a visit from the sheriff.  The Minister is from a rural area and he knows this to be the case.  Such a visit can have a devastating effect.  Rumour can spread that a person's business is not operating well because a sheriff was seen to visit that person. However the person may be keeping his business afloat and doing quite well.  The Government should provide encouragement and assistance through various agencies for those involved in small businesses. If a business person carries out improvement works or adds an extension to his premises, he will receive a visit from a local councillor for a review of ratable valuation.  The health inspector will verify that the extension contains all the necessary items that should be part of the development of a business, which I agree should be the case.  Then the tax inspector will inquire whether the books are in order and where the funds came from to carry out the extension.</P>
    <P>The IDA, for example, should make a grant available to erect such extension to introduce an element of competition.  If the Minister adopts that attitude, he will find that the people will respond.  I have <Col N="587" /> no sympathy for those who are not paying their taxes, the people the Minister should be targeting.  Why should a person pay his taxes while another does not because he may be a friend of the Government, or knows a Minister?  That is wrong and it is not a proper attitude to adopt.  While the Minister may collect some money through this tax amnesty, in five years time, or perhaps less, there will be a clamour for a further amnesty from the people who brag in our bars and lounges that they got away without paying their taxes.  The problem will snowball and more people will become involved.  The Minister is adopting the wrong approach to this issue.  My party and I are opposed to this measure and I am glad to have the opportunity to say that in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to have more than eight minutes to speak on this very important subject.  I wish to refer to tax amnesties in general.  They are a new feature of Irish life.  The last amnesty was supposed to have been extremely successful and I understand the Government took in millions of pounds under it.  Tax amnesties send a deplorable signal to the general public who grudgingly pay their fair share of tax because it is the law.  That is the reason they pay their tax; it is not because they enjoy doing so.  I do not enjoy paying my taxes and I am sure the Minister does not.  However, we pay them because the law requires us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is now sending a different signal, that under a certain set of circumstances a law will be introduced that will excuse them from paying their fair share of taxes.  I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Boylan.  I have no doubt that some money will be collected from this amnesty but the harm it will do, particularly to young people who are paying tax for the first time, will be enormous.  One can imagine the talk in the pubs among young people receiving their first pay cheque, the few of them who are working.  They will say that the Government is introducing a <Col N="588" /> system under which when times get tough they will not have to pay their fair share of taxes.  That is the view of all people.</P>
    <P>I have had great regard for Deputy Kemmy over the years but in his contribution on this national issue he made a U-turn.  They were not the views he would have had over the years on the subject of tax amnesties.</P>
    <P>Ireland, like other democracies, has a peculiar tax system in that we have a tax for everything.  We have income tax, corporation tax, probate tax, capital acquisitions tax, employer and employee PRSI, VAT, car tax, water taxes, rates and so on.  There is a very influential minority grouping here and, despite what Deputy Kemmy said, few of them draw the dole.  They set out with the intention of not paying their tax.  They are perceived by the general public as parasites, which they are.</P>
    <P>They live off Irish society and make a good living doing so.  The tragedy is that until recently they have remained untouched in their daily life.  I have heard officials from the Revenue Commissioners, particularly members of the trade unions within the Revenue Commissioners, say that they now had the model to develop anti-tax evasion measures provided that a number of steps are taken.  The Revenue units say they are understaffed, that certain measures need to be implemented to enable them carry out this task, but that they are in a position to tighten the screw on tax dodgers.</P>
    <P>The Government, and many other govenments, seem to have decided that it is not worth the trouble, that the amount of money required would not provide a sufficient return.  However, this year out of the blue the Minister decides we should try to collect those millions from abroad.  This is the most cynical part of this exercise.  Was much research carried out into this measure or was it a figment of someone's imagination?</P>

      <P>Somebody felt that this was a good idea.  However, no research has been carried out on how much money could be collected.  This minority I mentioned may decide, for whatever reason, not to put their money into the Irish economy.  What is so great about this new Ireland with Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government and 305,000 people out of work?  Why does the Government believe that this money can be collected now?  The Government has been sold a pup.  It has discovered, since the rosy scheme was floated, it would not get wren money from abroad and decided that there might be a better chance to obtain money at home.</P>
      <P>Some officials in the Department of Finance agree that not much money will be collected from abroad.  Whether the money is in the system is another story but the signal the Government has given to the people of Ireland will not be forgotten for a long time.  The more successful the amnesty the worse the signal will be.  Business graduates will want to know whether it will be possible to avoid paying tax if they have Government backing.</P>
      <P>As the Government has a majority in the House this legislation will be passed today.  Opposition Members can but express their criticism of the measure. People will recall June 1993 in Dáil Éireann as the time when the Government gave a blessing to everyone to evade tax in every way possible.  I hope that even at this late stage the lily whites in the Labour Party will see the error of their ways.</P>

      <P>I am happy to lend my support to the Bill.  There has been a heated debate on this matter, much of it ill-informed.  The Bill has received much criticism from the Opposition.  I fundamentally disagree with some of this opposition.  It smacks of political opportunism, basically it is opposition for the sake of opposing.  It is ironic that most of this opposition has come from the Fine Gael side.</P>
      <P>In 1989, when Fine Gael proposed an amnesty, it suggested that people be allowed pay back the money over a two year period at a rate of 12 per cent interest.  I have heard Fine Gael Deputies ask how much money is out there.  In 1989 Fine Gael said we would get £45 million from such an amnesty, but suddenly there is a loss of memory. However, that is not surprising because the very respectable Deputy Yates put down an amendment about which his leader knew nothing and subsequently the idea was scuppered.  There is now total opposition to this amnesty.  I am not certain that the people are convinced by the arguments put foward by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a very ambitious programme which will benefit the Irish people and improve their quality of life. Considerable resources are required to implement that programme.  There are many vital services which demand additional resources such as health, schools, services for the disabled, infrastructure and, of course, the regeneration <Col N="591" /> of employment.  In order to tackle these important objectives it is imperative that the Government considers all sources and avenues to raise revenue.  One such avenue is the proposed amnesty which is being introduced in this Bill.  If Fianna Fáil is serious about committing itself to the implementation of the Programme for Government, the tax amnesty must be seen as just one tool in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>This is a responsible approach and is in direct contrast to the immature posturing of the Opposition on the issue.  I particularly refer to a senior Opposition spokesman whose contribution was a model of bluster, was played to the Gallery and was full of cheap gibes, snide remarks and meaningless tripe.  In the Deputy's eagerness to play to the Gallery we heard a whole range of cheap sound bytes.  It was regrettable that a senior Opposition Member indulged himself in that way.</P>
    <P>I remember the sceptical voices that were raised at the time of the last amnesty.  People said it would not succeed and it would bring in only a paltry amount of money.  How wrong they were. The Opposition was wrong then and it is wrong now.</P>

      <P>The only difference with this amnesty is that the Opposition has clearly decided to exploit this situation <Col N="592" /> so that they can indulge themselves in an orgy of righteous indignation.</P>
      <P>The 1988 amnesty was a tremendous success.  It was a credit to the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, and indeed to the man who proposed it at the parliamentary party meeting, Deputy Noel Davern.  It provided much needed revenue to the Exchequer.  Revenue is still needed for a variety of reasons and I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the current legislation.  I ask those who oppose the Bill: what use will this much needed money serve by remaining outside the country?  How will it benefit the people of Ireland by languishing in foreign banks?  Would these people like to see this money lost to the Exchequer or be actively put to work for the Irish people?  Judging by their statements they would obviously prefer to stick their heads in the sand on this issue.</P>
      <P>We have much to gain from this amnesty, as was proved by the success of its predecessor.  There is much money out there and by means of the tax amnesty it can be drawn into the tax net and used in a productive manner.  It is estimated that £3 billion could be gained as a result of the amnesty.  Even if £1 billion was brought in, £150 million would go to the Exchequer.  There is much concern among PAYE workes about the 1 per cent levy, and we are well aware that the PAYE sector is overburdened by tax demands, but that levy could be abolished as a result of the amnesty.  Some of the money could be used, for example, as funding for the handicapped.  I ask the Opposition: what is wrong with trying to ensure we get money back to this country to make it work for the people?  That is what good government is about and that is what this Government is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put one question to the Minister.  For instance, if John Murphy earned £50,000 on nixers and declared only £30,000, how would Revenue determine the full extent of the money?  If the same person decided to put his money in a bank in Jersey between now and 1 January &mdash; the date on which the money <Col N="593" /> is lodged may not be apparent &mdash; how would that be established? If that person was to declare the money he would have to pay 48 per cent tax but by putting it in a bank in Jersey he could then bring it back at only 15 per cent tax.  Will the Minister say how that problem will be overcome?</P>
    <P>Those who wish to participate in the amnesty have until 1 January to regulate their affairs.  The opportunity is there for them and if they do not grasp it they will face the full rigours of the law.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Rabbitte say that fear will make people bring back the money.  What is wrong with that?  This is the last occasion on which this opportunity will be given to people to regularise their affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that the friends of Fianna Fáil would benefit from this amnesty.  That was ironic coming from Deputy Rabbitte who seems to have a short memory having regard to his departed soldiers of destiny.  Some would say that they might benefit more than others.  However, many people will benefit from the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Batt O'Keeffe for sharing his time with me.  I commend the Minister on his initiative and foresight in introducing this Bill.  It is welcome legislation which does not deserve the churlish and ill-informed comments directed at it by members of the Opposition.  The comments of Deputy Pat Cox were particularly hard to stomach.  Does the Deputy not know that the natural constituents of the Progressive Democrats are those well-heeled individuals who will avail of the amnesty?</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell has laboured the point that this Bill may be unconstitutional but he has failed to acknowledge, either in public or in private, that, being a money Bill it is constitutionally protected as it goes through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking I welcome the Bill but with some reservations.  I commend the Department on publishing this legislation within a relatively short time but tax legislation is becoming increasingly <Col N="594" /> complex and it is almost inevitable that legislation drafted in such tight circumstances will have weaknesses or will create ambiguities.  Section 2 (2) (b) (v) fundamentally excludes from the amnesty any tax due.  It proposes that relevant tax shall not include any sum:</P>
    <P>which was not paid on or before the designated date by virtue of an arrangement or scheme the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which was the avoidance of liability to tax,</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, the avoidance of a liability to tax is defined in 1988 legislation.  It would appear that where one has already disclosed to the Revenue that one is engaging in tax planning, he or she is precluded from the amnesty, whereas if one had opted for full evasion one would be included.  There is little that can be done about that at the moment because it is incorporated in legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the proposed confidentality attaching to disclosures for amnesty purposes.  There are two types of amnesty &mdash; the 15 per cent amnesty and the amnesty on interest on penalties and other taxes.  The 15 per cent amnesty and the amnesty on interest and penalties will be dealt with by a new officer, namely a chief special collector.  The only undertaking on confidentiality and the pursuit of the taxpayer as a targeted taxpayer by the Revenue is in respect of the tax paid under the amnesty.  If, say, a trader in Mallow with an up to now undisclosed deposit account of £1,000, discloses the account and pays 15 per cent on the interest, the only tax which he is guaranteed he will not be pursued is the tax waived on the deposit account.  The business could still be audited and targeted by virtue of the fact that the trader availed of the amnesty in respect of the deposit account.  The press release on the general amnesty says, in relation to this amnesty on interest and penalties in respect of the taxes, that provided there is a full declaration there will be no question of further pursuit.  There is nothing in the legislation about this.  In those circumstances people would not feel confident <Col N="595" /> that they would not be pursued. The appropriate remedy in these circumstances is for the Minister to give an undertaking in the Dáil that the Revenue will not audit any accounting period ended before 5 April 1991.  This would ensure that anybody who has disclosed details will not be targeted and it will not create a paradox as between those who availed of the amnesty and those who did not avail of it.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> from the taxpayers on this issue could be that they will bring up to date their tax affairs as at 5 April 1991.  One could owe a fortune in tax in 1992 and still avail of the amnesty in respect of 1991.  It is this kind of taxpayer which could be used as a battering ram to knock the whole amnesty.</P>
    <P>Section 11 almost drives my blood pressure through the roof.  It says that anybody who:</P>
    <P>(b)  knowingly and wilfully aids, abets, assists, incites or induces another person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(ii)  unlawfully to avoid liability to tax by failing to disclose the full amount of his income from all sources.</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence that carries a term not exceeding eight years.  That is draconian.  It will inhibit tax advisers from advising on the amnesty, since they may have doubts in regard to the certainty of the application of this section to themselves and having regard to the matter of confidentiality in dealing with clients.  The Minister should give some assurance that it is not intended to apply this section to technical and professional advisers, since tax legislation, of its nature, is very complex and people require advisers.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today it is said that even the advisers cannot fully understand the amnesty legislation. Section 9 provides for a new offence punishable with an eight year imprisonment where a person who should do so, has not availed of the amnesty.  I hope the Minister will consider what I have said.  If my suggestions are taken on <Col N="596" /> board they will make a welcome Bill more effective.</P>
    <P>I urge the Revenue Commissioners to look seriously at the way they do their business.  Their inquisitorial and draconian approach is counter productive.  It puts people off declaring their interests. There should be a more open and business like approach by the Revenue.  It would be better for all concerned.  We are all aware of the major problems that beset many business people especially in the private sector which is the productive sector.  If we are not prepared to work with the productive sector we will have no business and no employment.  If one approaches the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of a constituent one is met with a frosty reception although the problem involved may be only short-term.  A more business like approach like that of the banks, for instance, would be better.  The attitude of the Revenue Commissioners disturbs and annoys people.  It adds to the problems this Bill seeks to address. Many people would have declared their interests long ago if it were not for the attitude of the Revenue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this forward thinking, progressive Bill.  We must recognise human weaknesses but hope that the legislation will result in money being brought back into the economy and invested productively, thereby allowing for more liquidity and, in turn, for more money being available to the banks to enable them reduce interest rates further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Creed.  I found the contributions of the most recent speakers very interesting.  They displayed an honesty in terms of the kind of crime we are discussing.  Of course, I mean that in the lightest possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most offensive parts of this Bill is the element that became public knowledge in the past week only &mdash; that on top of the amnesty for &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money invested abroad we are to have a repeat of the general amnesty which we had thought we had dealt with and financial benefits of which we thought we had <Col N="597" /> received in 1988.  That was meant to have been the amnesty to end all amnesties, that was going to get everybody's tax accounts in order, that would herald a new regime under which taxes would be paid.  The penalties to be imposed were to be severe: anybody not complying from that date would be treated in the most severe manner.  How are we expected now to listen to the same presentation by this Minister, suggesting that this time we are deadly serious, that this is the final amnesty.  What does final mean?  The 1987-1988 amnesty was to have been the final amnesty.  Can our system of taxation, providing support for the State, have any credibility following such a decision?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with any of these issues.  This is such a complex, technical Bill, as was mentioned by Government Deputies who have just spoken, that even financial experts are having grave difficulty coming to terms with its provisions &mdash; and they, like the rest of us, are not being given a great deal of time to mull over it.  It has to be acknowledged that it is a complex Bill. The Minister avoided the broader issues here, although I have heard him endeavour to defend the Bill in the public media within the past 48 hours when the full scope of the proposals became public knowledge.  To me such defence wears extremely thin.  In regard to the hot money outside the country, while I entirely support the argument that it fundamentally undermines our tax system, it is a source of money difficult to estimate.  It is a source of money we have not targeted to date and which has not been the subject of an amnesty.  I suppose within the context of the range of proposals in this Bill, this proposal could be seen as less offensive than repeating an amnesty sold on the basis of that it was finally regularising our tax system, releasing our tax inspectors for the task of ensuring that henceforth tax would be paid promptly and that the heaviest penalties would be imposed on those who did not do so.</P>
    <P>Many of us will have heard the kind of stories that make us feel embarrassed to <Col N="598" /> be Irish.  This approach to taxation &mdash; a second tax amnesty in six years, a tax amnesty for foreign money and now a social welfare amnesty &mdash; makes us appear as some sort of a banana republic, where the systems that support the State lack absolute credibility.  I am thinking of stories like the one told this morning in the media in regard to the final report of the Telecom Éireann <i>débâcle,</i> when it was clear that the inspector had found that no criminal or other charges had been upheld against those being investigated. However the point was made that the tax inspectors might find a great deal in which to be interested and to pursue.  But the interviewer went on to say: &ldquo;Of course, that is now all covered by the tax amnesty&rdquo;.  How convenient.</P>
    <P>Then there was the other story told &mdash; I think by a Member of this House &mdash; about a person who, paying their bill on foot of the last amnesty, sent a covering note to the officials saying: &ldquo;Now, there you are.  You have got it.  That is the last you will be getting from me until the next amnesty&rdquo;.  Indeed, the next amnesty has arrived, probably just in time for that and other individuals.  I cannot understand how the Government cannot see that this grossly undermines our tax system, rendering it extremely difficult for any of the Government's utterances about their seriousness of intent in the future to be taken at all seriously.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill create two amnesties &mdash; the incentive amnesty for those with money abroad and the general amnesty with which we are all familiar and which, forgive me if I am sounding cynical, will obviously be a recurring feature of Government policy as long as the current influences prevail within the parties comprising the present partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The third element is the social welfare amnesty, a more confused area since no Bill has been produced but rather a date set by which persons can set their affairs in order.  I think the date is similar to that applicable in the case of financial and tax matters.  However, the consequences for somebody declaring under the terms of the social welfare amnesty are even <Col N="599" /> greater.  It is my understanding that persons who have already made themselves known under the social welfare amnesty are being subjected to quite extraordinary rigours while those who have been reaping the benefit of substantial tax incomes which should have been paid over to the State are treated much less severely.  I refer to the £500 million involved on the last occasion an amnesty was announced, the unquantifiable amounts that may result for the foreign hot money amnesty and the still undiscovered pre-1991 sources the Minister hopes to reach under the general amnesty.  But the consequences for somebody declaring under the social welfare amnesty can be much more severe and it may mean loss of family income of between £20 and £30 per week over a substantial period in order to recoup sums either overpaid or underpaid for a period of time.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have never had an opportunity, other than at Question Time or on discussion of Estimates, for anything other than the most superficial examination of that amnesty and how it is operating.  I should like to see an opportunity being afforded for a proper debate on the amnesty in order to establish whether the estimated sums of money will be forthcoming.  The Minister has not indicated how much he expects to come his way from that amnesty.  The Minister has not indicated how individuals are to be treated, whereas in this Bill it is fairly clear and those involved have their financial advisers and accountants advising them.  But an individual who may have, wittingly or unwittingly, received social welfare payments must take a substantial risk in regard to a payment that may be the major supportive element for them and their family.  While fraud within the social welfare system is something we all oppose because it undermines the benefits of the system for those most in need, I should like to think that in pursuing persons under either amnesty there would be an even-handed approach and an understanding and sympathy for the human circumstances prevailing in the <Col N="600" /> case of many social welfare recipients whose circumstances contrast enormously with those of many of the people who avoided substantial tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by expressing my concern about the general amnesty, which is an appalling additional provision in this already highly unacceptable Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty for allowing me to share her time on this debate, for which so little time has been provided by the Government.  This is an extraordinarily complex Bill which has baffled not only those of us who labour in Opposition and who have none of the handlers, advisers or assistants available to Government Ministers.  It is totally inappropriate that this Bill should be rammed through the House within such a short timescale.  It is not being rushed through for any pressing financial reasons but for the sake of political convenience. The Government is only too well aware that there has been an adverse public reaction and the only way to combat this is to get it out of sight as quickly as possible.  The Taoiseach heralded his arrival with the now tarnished phrase &ldquo;open Government&rdquo; and it is to his eternal shame that this significant legislation is being rammed through the House.</P>
      <P>Many insincere comments have been made about Dáil reform.  The committee system was established recently but this legislation will not be scrutinised in sufficient detail in one day by a committee. For this reason I have serious reservations about it.  It will not be debated or teased out adequately in the time allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle behind an amnesty is that it is a once-off measure.  As we are aware, this principle has been breached time and again in recent years.  This raises serious questions about the signal sent to the community at large, primarily the PAYE sector which has been carrying a heavy burden for years.  The proposals before the House provide tax cheats with a way to have their liabilities waived in respect of taxes which should have been paid to the State.  At least in relation to the 1988 amnesty a person had to meet his tax <Col N="601" /> liabilities; only the penalties and fines were waived.  In this instance the Government is adopting a grovelling attitude.  It has no financial policy and is begging the tax cheats to give us their money and in return we will do a good deal.  Compliant PAYE taxpayers are being kicked in the groin even though they have served the State well in difficult circumstances in recent years.</P>
    <P>A signal is also being sent to the tax advisers and specialists who offer their services to the larger companies.  Given the frequency with which amnesties are offered they will advise their clients not to meet their tax liabilities, that there might be another amnesty and they might be able to squeeze another drop out of the Government before they have to pay what is rightfully due to the State.</P>
    <P>One of my principal objections to the Bill is that it opens up the possibility of money laundering.  We will not have sufficient time either today or tomorrow to tease out this matter and to be able to say, if and when the Bill is passed, that money will not be laundered.  The Government has a strange set of priorities given that it has failed to introduce legislation to implement the EC Directive dealing with money laundering which should have been implemented by 1 January this year.  Without the safety net of that directive, which may not in itself be adequate, there is enormous potential for dealers in death, who have made their money out of drug trafficking and arms dealing, to launder their profits.</P>
    <P>In my own area in Cork there is a small band of wealthy people who are well known to the Garda Síochána and the legal profession.  They have made huge sums of money through these activities, particularly drug trafficking.  Unfortunately, we have only been picking up the minnows and have failed to nail the main offenders.  I am afraid that these people who have huge sums of money at their disposal, much of it stashed in foreign accounts, will be able to avail of this tax amnesty.  For this reason alone we should reject the Bill which is illthought out and opens the door for such people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> Government backbenchers have been searching desperately for a justification. Many of them have come up with a range of pet projects and lame ducks in their constituencies which they feel will benefit from the proceeds raised by way of the amnesty.  My Cork colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, mentioned that the services which the handicapped are entitled to could be paid for by the tax cheats. This was the lowest of the low and an insult to a forgotten sector of the population. Prior to the election the Labour Party made certain promises which were reiterated in the Programme for Government. These included a commitment to provide £30 million.  We have been informed by backbench Deputies that £5 million has been provided and that the balance could be provided by the tax cheats.  This begs the question as to where in the order of priorities services for the handicapped come.</P>
    <P>A promise has been given to provide £175 million by way of equity to Aer Lingus.  There is a danger that the yield from the tax amnesty will be used to defer unpalatable budgetary decisions which have to be made relating to public expenditure and public sector pay.  This would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has also sought to justify the amnesty by saying it is a once off, the amnesty of all amnesties, and if people do not avail of this amnesty they will be sent to jail once the deadline expires.  There is a significant number of small businesses, including publicans, around the country are desperately trying to survive.  The Minister for Finance is scraping the bottom of the barrel in threatening such persons, who do not have access to tax advisers and specialists whose services are available to the big winners, that the Revenue Commissioners will have new powers to hound and harass them and close down family businesses which are under pressure.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I find it difficult fully to support the legislation as there are some aspects about which I have reservations.  This is a very controversial Bill.  At the end of the day the implications of the legislation are vital in terms of the functioning and development of our democracy.  If the law is not seen to be impartial in its administration, we cannot expect the public to view either the courts or the Oireachtas with respect.  The legitimacy of our democratic institutions will be fundamentally undermined if the perception gains credence that corruption is acceptable in our society, is condoned in any way and not penalised.</P>
      <P>The practice of holding &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money, that is, money which has evaded the tax system and has been invested either at home or abroad, is corrupt.  It also debases our democracy as it denies the State the revenue which is essential to provide the services to which a civilised society governed by the rule of law is entitled.  This practice cannot be condoned. An attempt has been made to justify this practice on the basis that tax rates were too high in the past.  It should be pointed out that the PAYE sector had no choice about paying its tax, which was also high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that this amnesty may give the public a wrong signal about the direction in which the Government is going, particularly having regard to the recent spate of scandals about the amount of public money spent to date on the beef tribunal.  I fully accept that the intentions of both Deputy Davern and Deputy Kemmy are honourable and that they are guided by a wish to return to this jurisdiction as much as possible of the tax which has been illegally evaded.  I also accept that it is the Government's objective to secure some measure of taxation <Col N="604" /> rather than allow this money remain outside the country where it will make no contribution to the Exchequer. However, the Government's intentions and the public's perception of the motivation behind this legislation may be totally different.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance to consider placing advertisements in the newspapers to clarify, first, that the full amount has to be paid of all tax arrears other than moneys held outside the State; second, that companies will be excluded from the main amnesty; and, third, individuals who fail to disclose moneys held outside the country will be prosecuted and jailed for serious offences.  He should also clarify that it is not intended to extend the new stringent penalties for so-called &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; to ordinary taxpayers, particularly small traders and the self-employed who may be late making their returns or behind in their tax payments due to identifiable trading problems. It would be a perverse form of justice if these people were criminalised by the introduction of an amnesty for people whose activities are not far from theft.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in a report published by the Auditor General last October that there is approximately £2.5 billion owed to the Exchequer in arrears of PRSI, income tax, etc.  Obviously this is a huge amount of money.  The Auditor General believed a large proportion of this money could be collected.  I hope substantial inroads will be made in the collection of that money.</P>

      <P>Tax evasion is not dissimilar to theft.  Anyone who acquires money which does not rightfully belong to them commits a crime.  This legislation will correctly impose substantial penalties on these people in the future.  I would like substantial penalties to have been imposed on these people in the past and substantial powers to have been provided <Col N="605" /> to enable people involved in any form of money laundering, tax evasion or criminal activity to be caught and prosecuted. This would have led to a number of these people being imprisoned which is not the case at present.</P>
      <P>The penalties should be suitably draconian and relate to the amount of tax which has been evaded.  Instead of providing that some of the larger evaders may be jailed, the penalty should be mandatory jailing for amounts evaded above a specified minimum.  This threshold should be set at £100,000.  We should not shun this suggestion.  It is important that we make it clear we are serious about penalising those people who have defrauded the system of money which could have been spent on essential services. This proposal would strengthen the Bill and ensure the greatest possible return of capital held abroad.</P>
      <P>I should like strong mandatory provisions covering the disclosure by financial institutions of accounts, including accounts where nominees are used.  In the past our financial institutions have been used for tax evasion purposes.  In view of the abolition of exchange controls and the free movement of capital, it is necessary for the disclosure provisions to be made more effective.  The Bill provides for access by the Revenue Commissioners to accounts held in various financial institutions.  However, if the money is held in nominee accounts that accessibility is useless.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.  I understand that people who open accounts in other countries, for example, the USA, must disclose their social security numbers.  This means that these people are immediately identifiable.  The practice of using nominee accounts to evade tax cannot be tolerated in the future.  I ask the Minister to make it clear that people who hold bank accounts must be clearly identifiable. Recent reports suggest that there are something like 15 million bank accounts in Ireland.  Obviously this is excessive in view of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amnesty raises the expected revenue, the Government and Minister should indicate that any budgetary surplus <Col N="606" /> will be earmarked for expenditure programmes which will benefit the disadvantaged in our society, particularly those who have neither the income nor opportunity ever to have the luxury of paying taxes, not to speak of getting involved in tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the criticisms made about balancing the books through the mechanism of once-off cash injections. The objection to the use of receipts from privatisation to balance the book is equally valid in terms of the amnesty.  It can be argued that the previous Government was over-enthusiastic in cutting personal tax rates as a result of revenue buoyancy, which had been brought about by the previous amnesty, and strong economic growth.  I estimate that since 1987-88 some £200 million per annum has been acquired either through the previous tax amnesty or the sale of State assets.  This is an artifical source of income and it should not be used to balance the books.  Obviously we cannot continue to rely indefinitely on this quick fix method of acquiring cash to balance the books.  There is no substitute for tax reform, which is the key to ensuring an adequate amount of money to provide the State services that a democratic society requires to ensure that the less well off, the sick and the old have the level of service required by a civilised community.</P>
    <P>The objection to the 1 per cent income levy which was pitched at too low an income and thus was an unfair imposition on the PAYE sector, can be dealt with in the next budget if there is the expected revenue yield from the tax amnesty.  We cannot rely, however, on the proceeds of the amnesty to fund existing ongoing commitments, never mind embarking on any new major expenditure programmes. We should specify that the money from the amnesty is directed to the section of the community that never had the opportunity to evade taxes or to that section that has paid its taxes, namely the PAYE sector, in order to alleviate the burden in the latter case and provide some benefit for the former.  Quite clearly the Government should target any <Col N="607" /> money collected in that beneficial and productive fashion.</P>
    <P>Let me register my concern that this should be the last amnesty.  I know the Minister has indicated that this is his intention.  We need to firmly uphold the principle that the law applies equally to every citizen and those covered by Irish as well as European law.  We must make it clear that there cannot be an ongoing situation whereby those who have operated in a devious and less than legal fashion are seen not to be penalised but effectively to benefit from their nefarious activities.  We have to put behind us even the slightest suggestion that powerful individuals can gain an advantage from members of the Government, Members of the Oireachtas, or, indeed, any elected public representative.  Any whiff that lobbying influenced the activities of any Government must be dissipated and we must not allow the notion go abroad that powerful forces who have money to spend can influence Government decisions.  That should be an important priority for Government.  We have to support the principle that the State will be used only as an organ to discriminate positively in favour of the weak and disadvantaged, that the powerful and privileged will be restrained and that we will ensure they pay their fair share of taxes. That is the essence of a democratic state. When we are seeking to strike a balance, it should be in favour of the less well off in our society and should help to alleviate the burden of their circumstances.  It must never be in favour of the rich and privileged.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Minister for Finance were to indicate on Report Stage that this is the last chance that serious tax evaders will have to legalise their affairs. That must be indicated to them very clearly.  It must also be indicated clearly that the penalties for failing to do so will be very severe and on a different scale from what currently applies to those who have fallen behind in their payments or under-paid the amount they actually owe.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister further examine the <Col N="608" /> provisions in relation to confidentiality? It should be the intention of the legislation to ensure that what has happened in the past will not happen again and therefore it is important that we seek to close the loopholes that exist.  From that viewpoint, it is not the best idea to keep revenue from the tax amnesty a confidential matter internally.  This should not be confidential within the Revenue Commission but it should not be disclosed publicly.  We must make maximum use of the information when it becomes available to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are able to do their job satisfactorily, that loopholes are closed and that procedures are streamlined in the future.  That would be of enormous benefit to us.  We have embarked on a very delicate process because the public will become cynical about Government if they see that people, for no good reason, can get away without paying their fair share of tax and therefore we must be very careful how we implement this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the moneys will be used to the benefit of the people and the community.  We must ensure that happens but we must ensure that this Government or any further Government will not embark on a similar course.  I believe if we come back in five years' time to look for another amnesty, the public will throw it in our faces that this was the last opportunity for those either in arrears or who had evaded tax to put their affairs in order, and now we are being presented with another amnesty. We would lose our credibility.  The process of democracy in this country, as in other countries, is under considerable threat and minute examination by the media which is very demanding, and by the public who are equally demanding. We have to ensure that our activities are seen to be above partisan considerations.</P>
    <P>While I see the benefits that can be gained if the expected revenue is forthcoming, and the way it can be used, I do not welcome this legislation whole-heartedly. Let me echo a warning that we must ensure that the money is used properly, that it will be the last time that <Col N="609" /> an amnesty can take place.  In the final analysis we need to heed the views of the public at large and ensure that our democracy is not undermined by any cynicism which arise as a result of this Bill.</P>

The fact that Deputy Costello called three times for this to be declared the last amnesty reminds me of the story that my colleague, Deputy Cox, told this morning of ice cream sellers at the Munster finals. Next Sunday in Limerick they will be selling the last of the ices at least 17 times from the time they start until they finish. It was solemnly declared from the Fianna Fáil benches that the last amnesty would be the last one ever and never could such a thing be contemplated again.

      <P>If it is the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna Fáil we will not have an amnesty of this kind because it would be only the Labour Party that would stomach it.  Deputy Costello finished his oration with references to hypocrisy.  I thought that was not the happiest of phrases for him to use.  If he believes one-tenth of what he said he certainly would not be voting for this Bill but I suppose we will see him troop through the lobbies afterwards.  What that is called is a matter for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 75 year history of this House many Bills have been introduced from time to time by the Government of the day which met with the vehement and often passionate opposition of Deputies <Col N="610" /> who disagreed with the policy being pursued in those Bills.  Sometimes Bills were dropped altogether as a result of the opposition expressed to them over a period of weeks or months; sometimes Bills were significantly amended to take account of strongly held views; sometimes Bills were forced through and in some cases afterwards were found to be unconstitutional, or were repealed at the instance of succeeding Governments.</P>
    <P>Never, however, in anything that I can recall, or that I have read, was a Bill introduced in this House for the purpose of protecting and benefiting criminals and other members of a privileged Golden Circle, some of whom seem to dominate our economic and commercial life.  This Bill is, therefore, unique.  What is especially disturbing about it, apart from its obnoxious terms is the fact that its Second Stage is being debated over a period of about six hours and there is no interval before the Committee Stage, which takes place not in this House but in a Select Committee.  Unless sections 2 and 3 are withdrawn, which would remove the entire point of the Bill, it seems to me that this Bill is not capable of worthwhile amendment.  If any form of honour and integrity in our public administration is to be maintained, and if the principle that &ldquo;crime does pay&rdquo; is not to be enshrined in our public law, then this Bill must be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Because this Bill is now much longer and more complex and covers far more areas than the original proposal of four weeks ago, relating to so-called &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; held in overseas bank accounts, there is a danger that we will become bogged down in criticism of the detail of this Bill, and that we will lose sight of the fact that it is the first Bill ever introduced in Dáil Éireann for the purpose of rewarding criminals and crime, and protecting them from investigation.</P>
    <P>The morale of the public service must be seriously affected by a proposal like this, most particularly the morale of the Revenue Commissioners and their staff of thousands who are now going to be told by the Legislature of this country, if this Bill is passed, that they are to turn a blind <Col N="611" /> eye to criminals who cheat, defraud and make false declarations.  They are told that they are to protect the anonymity and &ldquo;good&rdquo; name of these criminals, but they are to continue to administer the law in such a way that it will bleed dry hundreds of thousands of compliant taxpayers who have the gravest difficulty in meeting their obligations, but who endeavour to do so often at huge personal cost to themselves, their families and, if they are self-employed, their businesses.</P>
    <P>Is there any other country in Europe or in the civilised world, outside of banana republics and corrupt dictatorships, where the law-abiding, compliant citizen is penalised and the corrupt fraudster who evades his lawful taxes is protected, favoured and nurtured?  It is a principle of our Constitution that an act cannot be retrospectively declared to be a crime if it were not a crime at the time it happened. Our constitutional lawyers can now apply themselves to the unique proposition that this Government subscribes to the view that the corollary of that principle is not true and that an act which was, and is, a crime will be retrospectively declared immune from prosecution for those who avail of the terms of this Bill.  For those who do not avail of the terms of this Bill these matters will remain a crime.</P>
    <P>If the principle enshrined in the Bill of giving immunity and anonymity to criminals who breach the Income Tax Acts and the Exchange Control Acts is accepted by this House, why should we not logically extend the same immunity and protection to criminals who breach other sections of our criminal law, such as the Offences Against the Person Acts, or who commit felonies against common law such as murder or manslaughter?  If one is to be given immunity, protection and legislative approval for having defrauded the public purse by the actions of this House, why should this House not give equal approval, legitimacy and immunity to those who commit the less serious crime of defrauding an individual or a company?</P>
    <P>I want to come now to some of the provisions of the Bill and to spell out <Col N="612" /> precisely how they offend the general principle of integrity in our tax system, in our public administration and in our constitutional and legal provisions about equality of citizens before the law; how, in effect, they offend against the very basic principles of a Republic, and why I would hope that some of those sitting opposite me in this House would for once stand by that Republic, rather than stand by the sleazy associates of some of those who lead them.</P>
    <P>In section 2 &mdash; apart from the gross inequity of somebody who has defrauded the Revenue being allowed away with a payment of 15 per cent, where a compliant taxpayer would have paid as much as 60 per cent or more &mdash; there is a particularly grotesque anomaly which underlines the whole corrupt approach of the Government parties to this matter. Subsection (2) (b) (v) states that the main or 15 per cent amnesty shall not apply to tax which was not paid by virtue of a tax avoidance scheme.  A tax avoidance scheme is an arrangement whereby somebody arranges his affairs in such a way as to seek to avoid liability for tax while remaining within the law.</P>
    <P>However, subsection (2) (b) (vii) removes that exclusion, and thereby includes in the 15 per cent amnesty those who acted illegally by evading as opposed to avoiding tax, and those who acted illegally by not complying with the Exchange Control Acts.  This is a monstrous preference of those who blatantly and deliberately broke the law over and above those who tried to remain within the law.  Needless to say, it is even greater preference and a more monstrous act of favouritism of criminals as against those who actually complied with the law and paid their taxes.  Furthermore, somebody who either paid his taxes, or who sought to remain within the law, will not be given a certificate by the chief special collector protecting him from further investigation, but someone who deliberately broke the law, and made no bones about it by setting out to evade tax and to breach the Exchange Control Acts, will be protected by such a certificate and the Revenue can never approach him again <Col N="613" /> about that tax, or about that period, or about his sources of income.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding tax avoidance schemes, as opposed to straightforward tax evasion, will have another curious result if this Bill is passed.  Prior to 1974, I understand it was common for wealthy people to transfer assets abroad and not to draw the income from those assets, but to place them in the name of a company and to take loans from the company.  These loans were not taxable. In 1974 it was provided in the Finance Act that such income was taxable unless the resident here could show that the arrangement was not made for the purpose of avoidance of tax.  The Act provided that such a scheme was a tax avoidance scheme unless it was certified to the contrary by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Such money, therefore, which is abroad and which has not been certified by the Revenue, will not benefit from this amnesty as set out in section 2.  If it were certified by the Revenue Commissioners it would not have been &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; but would have been known to them. Therefore section 2 ensures that the benefit of the Bill will not apply to &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; abroad held in these particular circumstances and the provisions of the Bill, as now set out, run counter to the purpose of the original alleged scheme. It seems to me that in trying to broaden this amnesty to take account of the initial criticism of it, the Government and the Minister have now lost sight of what was allegedly their original objective.  Why should any such uncertified money held abroad in these circumstances be brought back?</P>
    <P>The benefit of the amnesty is lost according to section 4 if the declaration made to the special collector is false. Section 5 allows an inspector of taxes to make an application to the appeal commissioners for a declaration that the certificate of the chief special collector was issued on the basis of incorrect information. The onus appears to be on the inspector to prove this, but I fail to see how he can prove it by virtue of the terms of section 7, which impose virtually total <Col N="614" /> confidentiality on the special collector, who cannot show any documents or give any tip-off to the inspector, even though they are both working for the Revenue Commissioners.  Neither the appeal commissioners, nor subsequently a judge, can see the declaration made by the person trying to avail of the amnesty.  How therefore can they conclude that it was a false declaration?</P>
    <P>It follows from this therefore that if he can obtain a form of settlement certificate from a special collector, a non-compliant taxpayer relying on section 5 (1) can tell the inspector of taxes, or the Revenue Commissioners generally, to get lost.  It may well be that a dishonest adviser &mdash; and I regret that such exist &mdash; could advise a criminal for whom he is acting that if he declares some nominal income of, say, £100 under section 2, and pays £15 and gets a certificate to that effect, he makes it very difficult for an inspector of taxes to pursue him further.</P>
    <P>The special collectors appear to have a totally passive function.  They appear to be there simply to receive declarations and cheques and not to investigate anything. They do not seem to have power under the Bill to ask any questions or to pursue inquiries.  They will never know whether a declaration made represents assets or income understated.  If any meaningful assessment is to be made as to the truth or otherwise of a declaration, the Revenue would need to know and be able to distinguish between the two of these.</P>
    <P>Take the case of somebody who has five separate accounts abroad of £200,000 each.  He declares £450,000.  In order to prove that the declaration was false the Revenue would have to find three or more of those accounts.  The possibility of Revenue doing so may well be very remote.  It may in fact be impossible if it has to try to investigate it without any access to the declaration itself.  It must be about the most daunting legal challenge of all to prove the falsity of a declaration that one has never seen.  It reminds me of the problems I faced in trying to disprove what was allegedly in documents that I was never shown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> To whom are special collectors to be accountable?  It seems from the provisions of the Bill that they are accountable to nobody.  If they are asked questions by the Revenue Commissioners they can and must plead section 7.  These two amnesties are apparently to be of short duration and the payments have to be made by 14 January next.  Where are the special collectors to be redeployed after their duties under this Bill end?  Are they to go back into the Revenue and forget everything they learned as a special collector, even if matters relevant to their work in the Revenue already came to their notice as special collectors?</P>
    <P>I am advised that the terms of section 13 of this Bill would appear to amount to an administration of justice under Article 34 of the Constitution.  The section would therefore be unconstitutional if it does not come within the terms of Article 37, which allows limited administration of justice by persons other than judges. Whether or not it comes under the provisions of Article 37 is a moot point, but at the very least it raises serious doubts.</P>
    <P>Apart from its possible unconstitutionality, section 13 is likely to have the effect of ensuring that money which is already within the banking system &mdash; including building societies &mdash; and in many cases legitimately so, will now leave the country in the absence of exchange controls.  People, including compliant taxpayers, may simply not want to take the risk of this section being used against them.  It would be one of the most amusing ironies of all if the provisions of this Bill were to frighten out more money than they bring in.  Banks and building societies must be very fearful of the consequences of section 13 regarding the confidentiality of accounts which they hold.  There are broader constitutional problems and doubts with regard to this Bill, the provisions of which are certain to be widely challenged, if and when it is passed.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court held in April 1988, in the farm tax case, that it is unconstitutional for the Government to suspend <Col N="616" /> the administration of the law.  It was held that it was the Government's duty to enforce the law unless the Oireachtas repealed it.</P>
    <P>What is provided for in this Bill is the non-application of the law to certain people who have committed offences against the Income Tax and other Acts. One's feeling about the doubtfulness of such a provision is strengthened by the decision of the Supreme Court in the East Donegal Marts case in 1970, when it held that under the Constitution the Legislature cannot exempt individuals from the scope of legislation, as the Marts Act had purported to do.</P>
    <P>What is this Bill doing except providing for non-application of law to certain people and for exemption for certain people?  It does not provide for any refund for those who have paid their taxes, or for a refund for those who may have come to a composition with the Revenue before 25 May last.  It, therefore, is not treating people equally.  The inequality is heightened by the fact that it favours citizens who broke the law, as against those who complied with it.  Is such a legislative scenario likely to survive?</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill applies not just to income tax but to a huge range of taxes, one of which is residential property tax. There are thousands of people who paid this tax each year as it fell due since its introduction about ten years ago.  If they were late in paying in any one year they had to pay interest.  There are thousands more who were liable for the tax but who did not pay anything.  They are now given the opportunity to pay without any penalty or interest, and what they are paying now in money terms is worth a great deal less than the same amount of money was when the tax fell due.  Will those of us who paid our residential property tax each year get a refund to compensate us for paying on time, and where appropriate for paying interest?</P>
    <P>The same principle can be applied to any of the taxes.  The sad sorry lesson at the end of it all is that if this Bill is passed, as the Government have prepared it, the clearest possible signal goes out that if <Col N="617" /> one obeys the law one is penalised; if one evades the law, and does not comply, one is rewarded.</P>
    <P>If this House enacts that principle, it is saying that we are a sick society and anyone who fulfils his or her obligations to that society is a fool, and that the wise ones in this society are those who thumb their noses at law and at duty.  The even wiser ones are probably those who leave this society, saying as they go &ldquo;Republic of Ireland, <i>requiescat in pace&rdquo;.</i></P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this important debate.  A tax system that is fair in intention and equitable in implementation is at the heart of any democracy.  This legislation was introduced because our tax system has not been equitable in its implementation.  Tax amnesties are the sign of a flawed system.  This Bill in particular highlights not only a flawed system, but an unfair society.</P>
      <P>The famous New York hotelier and socialite, Leona Helmsley, famously remarked a few years ago that &ldquo;only the little people pay taxes&rdquo;.  The values of Reagan's America are, it seems, to be the values of Ireland in the nineties.  This Bill sends out the signal that greed is good.  It seeks to enshrine into law a crooks' charter.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Opposition, I do not seek to deny reality.  That reality is that huge amounts of uncollected and probably uncollectable taxes remain outstanding. The further reality is that moneys collected under the terms of this Bill are welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's ever-changing position towards a tax amnesty is as distasteful as it is bewildering.  The Fine Gael Party went before the electorate in the general election of 1989 advocating a tax amnesty.  Some weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition publicly opposed a tax <Col N="618" /> amnesty.  To his apparent surprise and very public anger his Finance spokesman, Deputy Ivan Yates, had already favoured the idea of an amnesty.  Deputy Yates had tried to influence this year's Finance Bill to that effect on Committee Stage. His latest views on the matter are not only in complete opposition to an amnesty, they are also a complete contradiction of his own previously stated views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies John Bruton and Ivan Yates are exposing a position that is in complete contradiction of stated Fine Gael Policy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael's record in this House in the last few weeks has been a shameful shambles.  Hares, hookers, homosexuals and hot money have left the party twisting in the wind.  Deputy Bruton's Fine Gael has not even the courage of its own confusion.  A weak and divided Opposition is of little service to democracy. Fine Gael instead of exposing weakness in Government policy chooses instead to expose its own weakness.  The Opposition is a laughing stock.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the Government and the House that if not on the Opposition benches then certainly on the Government backbenches there is a watchful and constructively critical body of Fianna Fáil Deputies.  If necessary, we will be both Government and Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Ahern, conservatively estimates a return of £200 million from this amnesty.  I have no opposition in principle to the idea of an amnesty.  £200 million is to be welcomed at any time.  My fear is that too many hostages have been handed to fortune. The little people, the PAYE workers who pay 88 per cent of all income <Col N="619" /> tax collected by the State, are deeply angry and they have every right to be so.</P>
      <P>In the last budget a 1 per cent levy was imposed on incomes.  I said then, and I repeat now, that it was a grave mistake. In the context of economic policy it is anti-employment, anti-growth and, in effect, contraditory of the Government's stated economic aim.  In the context of this debate, it was a deeply inequitable tax.  This amnesty adds insult to injury. We are told that this is to be a once-off amnesty.  However successful, amnesties are seldom once-off.</P>
      <P>There would seem to be two critical aspects to this debate, the first, in regard to where the money collected is going as distinct from where it might come from and the second in regard to the notion of an amnesty culture.  Moneys collected under this amnesty constitute an unfairly small proportion of the ill-gotten gains of a golden circle.  It is imperative that those moneys are not used to further already deeply ingrained inequities in Irish society.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable that money from this amnesty be poured into the bottomless pit of the public service pay bill or into more time-serving, money-wasting, overlapping, bureaucratic State boards and agencies.  It is totally unacceptable that money be poured as subsidy into inflated public spending programmes.</P>
      <P>The only use worthy of the 30 bits of silver the Government intends collecting is reduction of the national debt and reduction of taxes for the PAYE sector. Scandalously, no progress was made in either of these areas in the last budget. Instead scarce resources were devoted to cosseting the privileged.  That is what the public service pay bill amounts to.  There are as yet no signs that the Government has to stomach to tackle this crucial issue. If this money is used to take the soft option in the next <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> talks then effectively Ireland's two golden circles will be cross-subsidising one another.  The Government will be pimping for parasites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> The Government should be aware that interest will have to be paid on their new found gains.  The first price they will have to pay is a growth in public cynicism.  The belief in the existence and untouchability of a golden circle is being perpetuated. There is a correspondingly deep disbelief in the finality of this present arrangement. By granting another amnesty so soon after the last, the Minister has created an amnesty culture.</P>

      <P>When the discussion about the tax amnesty started, I had grave reservations about it.  All of us who always pay our taxes on time feel that everybody should share the burden. Some of this debate reminds me of the Kerryman who was asked directions to Dingle and whose answer was, &ldquo;If I was you, I would not start from this point at all.&rdquo;  Of course, we should not be where we are.  We should not have had a collection system that was totally ineffective in the seventies and eighties when not only Fianna Fáil but Fine Gael and Labour were in Government.  We should have had a tax system that was effective, simple and equitable.  The same can be said of the social welfare system.  If we were proposing a tax amnesty without also proposing similar measures in the context of social welfare, I would find the idea of an amnesty very hard to accept.</P>

      <P>There has been much talk of tax cheats but I do not represent the multi-millionaire tax cheats Deputy Rabbitte referred to.  One would be living in an unreal world if one believed that non-compliance with the tax laws is only the preserve of well-heeled people.  Many people visit my clinics who have not complied with the tax laws, but those people are on the breadline.  They cannot pay the amount requested in respect of interest, penalties and tax.  Perhaps I am the only Deputy whom such people approach. The number of people attending also relates to the unreasonably low level of exemption limits and the position regarding pensions as opposed to unemployment benefits.  Pensions are taxable. Many old age pensioners own small farms.  There are widows in receipt of contributory pensions who in the past may not have completed a tax return and who probably owe tax.  Those people may owe amounts of only £3,000 to £4,000, but they may not have such money.  I am referring to people whose gross income per year is approximately £4,000 to £5,000.  I know the tax inspectors have a job to do, but I have heard those people being asked for sums of money which they do not have.</P>

      <P>I represent an area where most people depend on social welfare benefits and pensions.  I have seen those people drawn into the social welfare system because of the requirement to have tax numbers for various Government grants.  I have favoured the issue of RSI numbers to such people, but I know that if those people are drawn into the tax net it will not be possible to collect money from them in respect of interest and penalties for a ten year period.  Those people do not have the money to meet that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not represent people involved in big businesses, but if it is not possible to collect the money in any other way it should be collected by way of amnesty. The position is somewhat like a shopkeeper who provides credit.  Perhaps such credit should not have been given in the first place.  If it is not possible to collect such moneys in other ways, it should be collected in this manner on a once-off basis.  Half a loaf is better than no bread at all.  I support this measure on the condition that henceforth all loopholes will be closed, that people will not say they are not in favour of RSI numbers being issued in respect of everyone and that the Opposition will row in behind the measures which need to be taken in <Col N="623" /> future to ensure that tax is collected effectively.</P>

      <P>I would draw an analogy between a country shopkeeper who allows his customers credit and is not too concerned about collecting the money but then decides to change to a supermarket system where the customers must pay for goods as they buy them.  In the transition the shopkeeper would encounter problems with his customers in the operation of his business.  If his customers were asked to pay all the money they owe in one day and were told that in future they would not be able to purchase goods in his shop unless cash was paid up front, we all know what would happen.  That is the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves; it is a legacy of previous Governments.  This amnesty, linked with social welfare and tax reform, should be provided as a final measure to give people a chance to straighten out their affairs, whether they are big or small business people.</P>

      <P>If this issue referred only to bringing the money home I would find it difficult to accept.  However, I accept the modified and changed circumstances which we face now in that everybody is being provided with a once off chance to get their affairs in order.  We are reforming the tax system as the Progressive Democrats wanted us to.  I have asked for a long time for reform of the social welfare system. Reform of the two systems must be linked.  It is practically impossible for somebody on the dole to legitimately comply with means testing regulations. The people should be given a break and a line should be drawn now to ensure that as from 1993 onwards there will be full compliance with the tax laws and in 20 years time I hope we will not have to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps there is a difference between rural and urban areas in relation to outstanding taxes.  I am aware of cases in rural Ireland where outstanding taxes are owed by people, but they have found that the cost of paying their taxes is beyond <Col N="625" /> their capacity.  Interest and penalty relief for those people would mean that they could get their affairs in order and not become bankrupt in the process.  They would then have to comply with the tax laws in the future.  This is the aim of this measure and it is one of the ways the Progressive Democrats informed us we would have compliant taxpayers in a rational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am happy to speak on this Bill because it brings shame on the House.  This Bill was initially to deal with &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; invested in accounts on offshore islands. It was also to provide for people on social welfare or those who were cheating the social welfare system.  We now have a total amnesty to provide for those who have not paid their tax on interest and so on.  The Minister realised when he first mooted this tax amnesty and promised millions of pounds for other purposes, that the amnesty on &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; would not provide such sums and he has now introduced other measures.  He has taken away the respect of this House, because nobody believes in the workings of this House any longer.  The Labour Party has accepted the few pieces of silver and a recent contribution we heard supported that.  They do not believe in the measure but because they think they will recoup a few pounds from it they are prepared to continue their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we do about the new poor? The new poor, and I have spoken about them in this House previously, are those who pay their taxes, especially the PAYE sector.  Because they are a few pounds over the income limit they are unable to obtain grants for college fees or for maintenance.  Those who are paying their taxes and who have met all the requirements of the laws are unable to get medical cards and avail of services such as free school transport.  Yet those who invest their money outside this country and who cheat the taxation system can afford to employ auditors to help them avoid paying their fair share of tax.  They place their money in offshore island accounts and because of this measure they are <Col N="626" /> allowed off scot free.  Admittedly, they will be required to pay 15 per cent but that is minimal compared to the penalties suggested for the small farmers, for example, who were mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív.  They will be sent to jail.  We have been debating recently the various categories of individuals who will be jailed, yet the real criminals walking the streets of Dublin will escape.</P>
    <P>We are promoting tourism as a saviour for jobs yet many family hotels and public houses were refused licences in the past year because their tax affairs were not in order.  Small farmers affected by TB and other diseases in their herds cannot obtain grants due to them unless they can produce a tax certificate.  Those applying for headage grants next year must also produce a tax certificate.  I cannot believe that the Minister will force those individuals to keep their affairs in order while others organise their business in such a way as to avoid all the penalties it is intended to impose.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley stated that this new Bill will force money out of the country. This is clear from the reaction I have received during the past few days from old age pensioners and others who are coming near the end of their days.  They have invested a few pounds in building societies, a couple of thousand here and there, to ensure sufficient funds for their families to provide them with a decent burial.  This money will now be examined in detail by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that those people pay their fair share of taxes.  They may lose their social welfare entitlements and there is no doubt that some of them will take their money out of the building societies and perhaps put it under their mattresses, leaving themselves open to be burgled in the middle of the night.  That is what this Government is forcing on people and we cannot be proud of it.</P>
    <P>We have heard on a number of occasions today that this amnesty represents the last chance for tax cheats.  We are told the same in 1988.  How long is a piece of string?  That is the real question. The message will leave this House that if <Col N="627" /> one is good at fiddling the books one can persuade the Government that it is worthwhile to give an additional few pounds to individuals for good deeds done, which will result in another tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>Obviously I will welcome the money if it comes in.  I hope some of it will be spent on the roads of Cavan-Monaghan. I was talking to somebody today who had visited the Golf Classic in that area and could not understand how we can live there, the roads being so poor.  Our hotels are great and we would welcome the Minister if he decided to visit.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for highlighting that statement.  Unfortunately Deputy Kemmy is not present in the House to hear those words because they may have helped him to change some of his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amnesty represents an amazing course of action by any Government.  I hope the Minister for Education will not <Col N="628" /> become caught up in this attitude and reward lazy students by giving all of them As in their leaving certificate results.  Perhaps the story of the prodigal son is being adopted by the Government and it is prepared to forgive everyone for their offences.  It is about time that good was rewarded, that honesty was seen as the best policy and that we no longer gave credence to those who break the law while ordinary citizens, much to their annoyance, are paying their fair share of taxes.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; has been used in this debate to describe certain people. There are only &ldquo;thin cats&rdquo; in the PAYE sector because anything they have the possibility to earn is deducted direct from their salaries.  I never had to worry about locations in which to invest my money. One small pocket contained most of what I had.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the contributions of the Labour Deputies it is true to say that Stonewall Jackson is alive and well. They are coming out of the woodwork to defend the indefensible.  My colleague, Deputy Crawford, referred to third level students not being eligible for grants. They qualify for nothing.  They are taxed to the hilt and are required to obtain overdrafts and pay interest on those overdrafts to obtain an education.  Some of them may have paid a rate of 48 per cent. The Minister will now reward those who had the use of this money abroad and they will be required to pay a mere 15 per cent.  There is no justice in that and I hope we will hear no more about ethics in Government from a Government that obviously does not understand what ethics in ordinary life is about.</P>
    <P>Small business people around the country are being harassed by individuals from the Revenue Commissioners who are checking VAT and PRSI payments. At times this is done in a way that can frighten certain people.  I am aware of two women who closed their shop because they could no longer tolerate VAT inspectors visiting them to check their records.  Those are the people who are paying their way.  We do not mind putting them out of business, knocking <Col N="629" /> on their doors and convincing them they are criminals.  With this Bill we are thanking those who did not pay their fair share of taxes.</P>
    <P>We will have special inspectors sworn to secrecy while, at the same time, people who are in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners, particularly publicans whose gross profits can be jacked up when the Revenue Commissioners visit a premises, suddenly find they are sent a new bill, an argument ensues and their names appear in the paper.  This is done even though these people genuinely wish to pay their tax.  There may have been a difference of opinion in regard to the amount due as assessed by the Revenue. The financial institutions will be fined £15,000 and an additional £2,000 for not declaring a person's investment.  There is also reference to special collector, who including the chief special collector, who seems to be the master of secrets in society.  Honesty has not been rewarded. The excuse that high interest rates encourage people to take their money out of the country is unacceptable.  PAYE taxpayers pay high interest rates and they stand by the country but they get very little reward.  Instead they were asked to pay a 1 per cent levy.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Aire Airgeadais as cúpla nóiméad a thabhairt dom chun dearcadh an Chomhaontais Glas a chur os comhair na Dála i dtaobh an Bhille seo.  It is strange to hear people saying that half a loaf is better than none.  This is a very simplistic view which does not help because if we take the analogy further, half a loaf may lead to food poisoning. The amnesty will be damaging to the country from an ethical and economic point of view.  It has already had a backlash as can be seen from the letters which I and, I am sure, many Deputies have received.  One letter I received expresses disgust at the amnesty for hot money. Another letter refers to a mother on a contributory old age pension who had to pay £25 tax in the 1992-93 tax year.  This person wonders why other people are allowed pay only 15 per cent tax.  This <Col N="630" /> amnesty will further lessen the esteem in which this administration is held.  For example, people cannot understand why telephone charges are being increased while at the same time TDs are allowed free phone calls, why flats in Mespil Road are sold at low prices to certain people and the use of the Government jet at a time when Aer Lingus experiences great difficulties.</P>

      <P>Double standards exist throughout the country.  Economically the desperation seems to be very obvious. To suggest that money injected into the country in the form of an amnesty will create jobs for the unemployed is questionable. Is this matter being analysed in a rational way or is the amnesty being introduced in desperation?  I have yet to be convinced that the money collected as a result of this amnesty will create jobs, as suggested by the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In the sixties investment created jobs, but current financial evidence is that capital investment often results in fewer jobs because it encourages automation and rationalisation, as in the case of Guinness and Aer Lingus.  Many employers take this course, yet we are ensuring that more capital is pumped into the economy.  We are dealing with an ethically and economically indefensible measure.  I hope the Department's thinking will change to take account of the fact that we should concentrate on the redistribution of wealth and the guaranteeing of basic incomes as options.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate on this legislation.  In the time available to me I will deal as comprehensively as possible with the main points raised.  Tomorrow we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to go into the provisions in greater detail. There are only 15 sections in the Bill and we will have ample time to consider them.  The reason I was absent from the Chamber was to consider some of the <Col N="631" /> issues raised by party spokespersons this morning.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of this amnesty are to provide those who failed to meet their tax obligations in the past with a final opportunity to regularise their affairs.  This opportunity is being given in advance of the introduction of more stringent penalties for tax fraud and against the background of the ongoing intensification of Revenue's compliance programmes.  In recent years Revenue has been much more successful in closing loopholes and moving generally on non-compliant taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The 1988 amnesty was very successful in bringing people into the tax net. However, it was a failure in terms of retrieving money held in accounts abroad.  The figure I quoted many times, and which has been quoted by Revenue, as to the number of accounts involved is 379 but the figure quoted by Deputy Rabbitte is slightly higher at 400.  I presume that figure includes cases which subsequently came to light.  However, we will not argue about figures.  A very small number of such accounts were detected on the last occasion.  This amnesty is designed to deal with dormant accounts which were not disclosed in the 1988 amnesty.</P>
      <P>A large number of so-called compliant taxpayers who have their affairs in some order do not pay their full tax.  This is the case in all sectors.  I was amused listening to Deputies&mdash;I exclude Deputy Rabbitte who is consistent in this matter &mdash; talk about the people involved as if they are all millionaires.  That is not the case.  I receive hundreds of letters each day about revenue matters concerning owners of small shops and businesses, tradesmen and professionals who suppress their income each year.  There are 15 million deposit accounts in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change in attitude to this matter in the past 12 months.  I was berated in this House last year by all but one Deputy for closing in on non-compliant taxpayers &mdash; even many of my colleagues thought I had gone over the top.  However, I welcome the support <Col N="632" /> from Members on all sides today for a compliant society.  We have now reached a position where we might be able to achieve success.</P>

We are speaking here about a lot of small business people.  If we can get them into the tax system they will pay 15 per cent in income tax and capital gains and they will have the same anonymity clause for VAT.  All of the others paid 100 per cent.  They then must fill in their 1992-93 tax forms.  Naturally enough, if they are unknown in the system they will have to fill in their 1991-92 tax forms as well.  We are not working back on any limited period.  Under section 2 the individual will come to the special collector and will declare the amount of undisclosed liabilities.  If it is income tax or capital gains tax taxpayers will pay the 15 per cent.  They will receive their certificates.  They will fill in their 1992-93 tax forms by the end of next January and will pay the money by 14 December.  If they are honest, following the amnesty, they have nothing more to worry about.</P>

      <P>For many centuries the Irish nation has been regarded by the rest of the world as a brave, generous, humane and sporting people.  However, during the past two weeks in particular this reputation has been somewhat tarnished. Last week this House passed a Bill which will have serious consequences for our social behaviour.  This week we may reject a Bill which will cause serious doubts about our humanity as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activity of hare coursing &mdash; I refuse to call it a sport &mdash; is a vile and degrading one from which society at large needs to be protected.  There is a school of thought within the Government parties that measures are necessary to modify this <Col N="639" /> barbarity.  It is extraordinary that these measures have not been in place and it has taken a Bill introduced by an Independent Member to jolt the Government into taking some action on this issue.</P>
    <P>Neither the Government nor the Fine Gael Party will allow a free vote on this issue and this does nothing to enhance the reputation of the political parties in this House.  I do not know at what stage the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry intends to come back to the House with the measures he has in mind but does this not amount to an admission that this Bill is necessary and long overdue? I call on the Minister to let the House know as soon as possible, in the event of this Bill not being passed tonight what exactly he has in mind.  Needless to say, the measures contained within it should not be watered down.</P>
    <P>The Bill calls on the Government to ban blood sports, particularly hare coursing. However, I would not like to see those people who catch fish or take part in other genuine and necessary activities held up to ridicule in this regard.  I wish to make it abundantly clear that hare coursing is by far and away the lowest form of human depravity which affects the animal world.  It is time it was banned.</P>
    <P>The contributions I have listened to in this debate have been interesting and even amusing.  I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald who regarded hare coursing as a noble sport, while Deputy Foley said that hare coursing is part of the natural heritage of man.  If it is part of the natural heritage of man it is extraordinary that last week the same Deputies voted in favour of the Bill which decriminalised homosexuality, which is a contradiction in terms.  Deputy Fitzgerald also pointed a finger at Deputy Gregory saying that he knew nothing about hares and that one would find few hares parading through the streets of the inner city of Dublin.  That is true, but let me say, as someone who comes from farming stock, on behalf of all the decent farming and rural people that there is a feeling of revulsion about this activity.  I take exception to some of the remarks made by <Col N="640" /> journalists during the past few weeks that this activity is part of the rural scene and is supported by the farming community. This is not the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by calling on all parties to allow a free vote on this issue and on all Deputies to remember the screams of God's creatures which face a certain death in this revolting and inhumane fashion.  If this Bill is not enacted and hare coursing is not banned immediately we will not be able to hold our heads high or call ourselves a brave, humane or sporting nation.</P>

      <P>I understand fully the circumstances that gave rise to Deputy Gregory's wish to have this Bill brought before this House.  I have been concerned by some of the material on this subject which has been circulating in recent years.  The graphic portrayal of certain incidents at coursing matches has raised concern on cruelty issues.  I am not here today to defend or even to play down the unacceptable incidents that were witnessed at some recent coursing meetings. I have already condemned outright what happened at Clounanna last February and at Clonmel last year.  However, we should not judge any long-established or traditional sport or industry on the basis of recent events or selective statistics.  We must take the full picture into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue with which we are dealing today. Agriculture is important to Ireland economically but many of its facets are steeped in tradition.  The farmer invariably enjoys his or her work and this contributes substantially to his or her performance and job satisfaction.  In Ireland, more so than in most countries, agriculture means the caring and tending of animals.  Over the years this occupation and, indeed, preoccupation has led to an innate love of animals.  This love of animals manifests itself not only among the farming community but also among town and city dwellers who, in many cases are just one or two generations <Col N="641" /> removed from the land.  This is one area in which Ireland's urban and rural ethos combine.  As a nation, we would class ourselves as animal lovers and regard intentional cruelty to animals as unacceptable behaviour.  The Protection of Animals Act, 1911, as amended in 1965, gives testament to this.  This legislation outlaws the beating, kicking, ill-treating, over-riding over-driving, over-loading, torturing, infuriating or terrifying any animal.  I could go on but the point I want to make is that we are a nation of animal lovers and we will not permit any unnecessary cruelty to animals to continue.</P>
    <P>It is right that all reasonable shades of opinion to be found in our society find expression in this House.  I was very impressed by the reasonable opinions expressed on this sensitive subject during the past week.</P>
    <P>However, the responsibility rests with Government to examine problems in a wider context and to bring forward proposals which would best meet the need of society as a whole.  We cannot look at coursing in isolation.  It is, as my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, has already told the House last week, inextricably linked with the greyhound industry and its development.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware in this regard, that the greyhound industry has been going through serious difficulties.  Last July I established a task force of representatives of Bord na gCon and officials from my Department to examine the structures, financing and legislation governing the whole greyhound industry. Naturally I included in the remit of this group the issue of coursing.  They looked into the history of the subject and the current issues surrounding the sport.  The task force concluded its deliberations recently and a position paper on the industry was submitted to me.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of a separate and special investigation which was carried out recently by the Irish Coursing Club following the killing of 48 hares at a coursing meeting in Clounanna in February last.  At my direction, officials of my Department kept in touch with that <Col N="642" /> investigation and reported on it.  I have now received the ICC report on the incident. The House is already aware that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who has functional responsibility for this area in the Department, has, since taking office, engaged in wide consultations with the various representatives in the industry. Recently the Minister of State and I met jointly with the ICC.  He has also met with the Irish Council against Blood Sports as recently as this morning.</P>
    <P>I have examined the task force report, the Department's position paper and the ICC report on Clounanna.  I have considered the various views put forward by the greyhound industry as well as those groups opposed to coursing.  I have also had regard to the June 1992 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee which reviewed the industry and made recommendations relating to the role and statutory position of the ICC.  Bearing in mind all these reports, I submitted my proposals on the future of the greyhound industry and its development, including the coursing issue, to Government last week.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline to the House some of the main factors I considered on this issue.  First, I considered the overall greyhound industry and its future.  It is an important sector and gives valuable employment in rural areas in particular. Greyhound rearing and breeding are a genuine alternative enterprise in the agricultural sector.  In times of over-production in many agricultural products, with Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT agreements limiting our options to an ever-increasing extent, we are constantly in search of alternative enterprises in which we are skillful, have natural advantages and which have a market potential.  Greyhound breeding satisfies these criteria.  Approximately 10,000 people currently derive their livelihoods either directly or indirectly from the greyhound industry and approximately 8,000 of these are breeders, owners and trainers.  Approximately 20,000 greyhounds are produced each year, about half of which are exported, mostly to the UK.  It is estimated <Col N="643" /> that the industry is worth about £40 million per annum to the economy.</P>
    <P>It is felt that there is considerable potential for development of the entertainment side of greyhound racing in Ireland and in foreign markets for the sale of quality Irish greyhounds.  I am reliably informed that our European and US markets in particular can be expanded considerably.  The exploitation of the full potential of this industry, both in regard to racing here at home and to exports, would benefit many local communities and would increase employment, particularly in rural areas where many people are deprived of other opportunities and have suffered badly in recent times.</P>
    <P>A major factor in helping us to develop the greyhound breeding and racing industry is that we already have an excellent reputation worldwide for producing good quality greyhounds.  The coursing fraternity make a strong case that it is, in fact, the coursing lines in the pedigrees of our track racing dogs that gives them their speed and contributes significantly to the quality of their performance on the racing circuit.  They point to historical information on the pedigrees of Derby winners down the years, including the English Derby which was run last week. Their concern in this area is for the quality of the Irish greyhound in the future. They claim that if hare coursing is banned the quality of the Irish track dog will suffer irreparable damage and if Ireland loses its reputation for quality in its greyhound breeding then the industry could go into terminal decline.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this would necessarily be the case, but I do not think that we should take this risk lightly.  Exports are the lifeblood of our greyhound industry and if the overseas demand for our dogs diminishes then the future of the industry in this country will be anything but bright.  If coursing dogs are used in the breeding cycle then their pedigree must have some influence on our track dogs.  These considerations suggest that every effort must be made to remove any <Col N="644" /> unacceptable elements of coursing rather than going for an outright ban.</P>
    <P>I am informed that most people in the industry are not opposed to coursing and many participate in both racing and coursing activities.  There is a strong body of opinion, in rural areas in particular, in favour of coursing.  The competitive pursuit of hares by greyhounds has been engaged in in this country for centuries. It was introduced on an organised basis in 1819 when the first coursing meeting was held in the Curragh.  Interest in the sport has traditionally cut across the various sections of our society.  In the 19th century the sport was very popular with landowners, small farmers and farm workers alike.  It currently enjoys the support of the professional classes, skilled and unskilled workers and the farming community.</P>
    <P>The impression is often given that all the people who support this activity are blood thirsty and have a naturally cruel or sadistic nature.  Of course, this is not true.  I personally know many good and caring families who are stalwarts of their communities and enjoy participation in this sport.  Another impression which is often put about is that the participants in coursing are animal haters who enjoy seeing a hare being killed and that this in some sordid way whets their appetites for more of the same.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The sport is essentially about the testing of one greyhound against another for speed and agility.  Most supporters of coursing take enjoyment from seeing the hare outwit the dogs and escape to safety. It is also a fact that the Irish Coursing Club and its members are committed to the protection and conservation of hare stocks and have on their own initiative taken measures to protect the hare in the Irish countryside.  The ICC has held seminars for its members and those interested in such aspects as hare welfare, husbandry, habitat, population and medication.</P>
    <P>Deputies might at this juncture query the events at Clounanna last February. The ICC report on its investigation into this matter suggests that, having considered <Col N="645" /> the evidence from those interviewed, in particular the veterinary evidence and the results of laboratory examinations of some of the hares killed, no clear veterinary conclusions could be drawn to explain the high number of hares killed at the meeting.  All the hares were dosed for worms and coccidiosis on intake to the hare paddock.  On veterinary advice the hares were twice medicted by dosing with amprol in the weeks before the meeting.  The hare stock was examined in its entirety on a number of occasions and pregnant and otherwise unfit hares were removed and released. The remaining hares appeared fit before coursing and generally ran very well for a certain distance.  There was no evidence of coccidiosis found in any hares on which a <i>post mortem</i> was carried out following the coursing.</P>
    <P>The general purposes sub-committee of the ICC suggested a number of factors which it considered would have contributed to the high number of kills at Clounanna.  These include the following: the coursing stretch involved was extensively drained prior to the meeting and this, combined with the very dry weather in February, resulted in the running surface being very &ldquo;fast&rdquo;; because of the mild, unseasonable weather there has been unprecedented grass growth leading up to the fixture and the presence of a drain at the end of the coursing field caused some of the hares to be drowned.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee in its report sets out a number of very specific measures which it has decided upon for future Irish cup meetings to eliminate the possibility of such a high mortality rate.  These include reducing the length of the field by 200 yards, thereby eliminating the drain; curtailing the programme, thereby reducing the number of courses from 162 to 109; reducing the size of the hare paddock to a more manageable size of one and a half to two acres and stricter and more regular veterinary inspection of the hares and formal reporting.</P>
    <P>An action programme for all future coursing meetings was also recommended. This would involve: the maximum number of courses per day to <Col N="646" /> be reduced from 88 to 72; formal veterinary involvement with all clubs prior to and during meetings; mandatory <i>post mortems</i> and persons of proven knowledge and experience of hares to be employed to inspect hare stocks of all clubs prior to coursing.</P>
    <P>These measures in themselves are not enough and I am of the view that a suitable muzzle must be developed which will have due regard to the welfare of the hares and the dogs and will serve to eliminate entirely any cruelty, especially the &ldquo;kill&rdquo;, from this sport.  I believe effective control and stringent supervisory measures which will have statutory backing and the introduction, at the earliest possible date, of mandatory muzzling of all greyhounds participating in coursing will be widely accepted.  Research work on the development of a suitable muzzle is already well advanced and I am satisfied that progress on that front is sufficient to allow for the use of muzzles during the next coursing season.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the June 1992 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. I would remind the House again that the activities of Bord na gCon, the greyhound industry and the legislation governing it were the subject of a fairly lengthy review by that committee last year.  It also examined the coursing question and heard evidence from Bord na gCon, greyhound owners and breeders, the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Council against Blood Sports.  The organisation named the Campaign for the Abolition of Cruel Sports also submitted its views.  The committee did not, however, recommend a ban on hare coursing. It recommended that there should be no statutory link between Bord na gCon and the ICC.  It also suggested that ICC revenue from greyhound registrations should not exceed what is necessary to fund the cost of maintaining the greyhound stud book.  The maintenance of the stud book is, of course, currently the function of the ICC.  The committee went on to say that in effect the thrust of its proposals was that the ICC should <Col N="647" /> become an independent self-regulating body.</P>
    <P>It also recommended that the requirement that greyhound owners should be members of coursing clubs in order to become eligible to register a greyhound should cease.  I can accept this latter recommendation and I am aware that the ICC is considering how to accommodate it.  However, I do not agree that the ICC should be self-regulating.</P>
    <P>The activity of coursing must be controlled and I believe the State must provide for that control.  I agree that coursing must be self-financing and the State should not provide any assistance or, indeed, allow any organisation operating a stud book for the wider industry to use profits from greyhound registrations to fund coursing activities.  I can assure the House that the draft Bill which I plan to introduce next term will deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be seen to be overcritical of the ICC.  One area which was not covered sufficiently in the Oireachtas committee's report, and which may not be fully appreciated by the public at large, is the history of the role of the ICC and the major contribution it has made down the years to the greyhound industry. While its title is the Irish Coursing Club this does not, in any fair way, reflect its full role in the industry.  The ICC regulated greyhound racing in the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland from the foundation of the club in 1916 up until Bord na gCon was established in 1958.  It has compiled and published annually the stud book for pedigree greyhounds since 1923 and the integrity of the stud book is recognised worldwide.  The club has perfected the system of greyhound identification and was the first to introduce DNA bloodtyping on a fully computerised register.  Greyhound owners and breeders will appreciate the essential nature of this service to the greyhound breeding and racing industry.</P>
    <P>The ICC has also been publishing the industry's weekly greyhound newspaper the <i>Sporting Press</i> since 1928.  This paper is recognised as the official organ of the <Col N="648" /> greyhound industry.  It gives valuable news and information to greyhound owners and breeders on racing events, results, sales, stud dog services and reviews on developments in the industry generally.  It has been through the ICC, its provincial committees, local clubs, and so on that many policy ideas for the breeding and racing sectors were first mooted.  Since 1958 the ICC is still the controlling authority for greyhound racing in Northern Ireland.  Coursing is still run on a 32-county basis and it is one activity where there are very strong links with Northern Ireland.  There is always, I understand, great support for coursing events in the South from supporters in the North and this support extends across the political divide in the North.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to the immediate matter under consideration, that is Deputy Gregory's Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, last week referred to a number of technical defects in this Bill.  I can appreciate the circumstances that gave rise to Deputy Gregory's wish to enact a law that would ban hare coursing.  However, I would be anything but confident that that would, in fact, be the effect of the Bill before us if it were to be adopted.  I do not propose to outline in detail the defects in the Bill as I consider that Deputy O'Shea did so sufficiently well last week.  However, I am anxious to point out and to clarify for the information of Deputies that there are in fact three Acts dealing with this subject: the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Bill, 1993, does not amend the various sections of the Protection of Animals Acts which exempt coursing from its general provisions dealing with animal cruelty some of which I outlined earlier to the House.  Neither does the Bill deal with all of the sections of the Wildlife Act which refer to coursing and in particular it leaves sections 34 and 45 intact.  It also leaves unaltered certain parts of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which makes reference to the rules of the ICC and its duties &mdash; provisions which should be reviewed if coursing <Col N="649" /> is to be outlawed.  Also I am not sure that the Minister could have the right to amend unilaterally the constitution of a private organisation.  I consider that these matters are legal points and in order not to create any confusion in our legislation or to include provisions that would be anomalous all of these matters would need very close legal scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I hope, despite the reservations I have outlined about the technical aspects of this Bill, that Deputy Gregory will appreciate that I concentrated today on the major issues involved in the coursing debate and that I have persuaded him of the correctness of my proposals regarding this somewhat sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>There will be no delay in introducing changes as I now have Government agreement for the drafting of a Bill to amend the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, in fact, the drafting has commenced.</P>
    <P>The new Bill will include provision to empower Bord na gCon to license the holding of all coursing meetings, subject to strict conditions which will have to be agreed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  These conditions will include limits on the length of each course, veterinary supervision of hares prior to all meetings, veterinary presence at all meetings, supervision of the release of hares into the wild after meetings and, following a trial period, the muzzling of all greyhounds in enclosed coursing.  The object of these controls will be to prevent cruelty and eliminate the kill.  The Minister will be required to monitor the operation of coursing and report to the Oireachtas on the results of the monitoring.</P>
    <P>In the new legislation Bord na gCon will also be assigned responsibility for the breeding and registration of greyhounds but will be empowered to contract this task, or part thereof, subject to conditions to be attached to the relevant licence, to an outside agency.  I believe that my proposals are reasonable; that they are in the best interests of the industry; and that at the same time they will be successful in removing the unacceptable elements to which all speakers referred. I wish to refer to the reasonable and <Col N="650" /> responsible contributions made by Members who emphasised that cruelty and killing of hares is an unacceptable element of coursing.  I propose to remove those unacceptable elements of this ancient sport.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with my colleagues, Deputies Flood and Tom Foxe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gregory, for bringing forward this Bill because he has given all of us the opportunity to debate the issue of live hare coursing in an open and frank manner, perhaps in a way they has never happened previously either inside or outside this House.</P>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the many contributions but I have not yet been convinced by the various arguments that live hare coursing should be allowed to continue.  I accept that those who call for the continuation of live hare coursing believe fully in their point of view and are genuinely convinced that their position is correct.  They are entitled to their viewpoint but I do not share it.</P>
      <P>My opposition to live hare coursing has not arisen recently and I have long been opposed to a practice that I believe should have no place in modern Ireland. We have heard very strong arguments in the course of the debate as to why the &ldquo;so-called sport&rdquo; should be allowed to continue in its present format.  The economic argument, in particular, was highlighted as was the argument that coursing, both park and open, is an ancient Irish sport that has been enjoyed since pre-Christian times.  I cannot accept that it is right that the practice of live hare coursing should continue with its inevitable cruelty to hares on the basis that it has been around for a long time or because we derive an economic benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who oppose live hare coursing offer an alternative form of coursing, which is pursued in other countries which previously had an established tradition of <Col N="651" /> live hare coursing.  Other countries have ended the practice of live hare coursing and substituted a mechanical device for the live hare and surely it is not beyond the ability of the Irish Coursing Club to follow what has already been done in countries such as Australia and Germany. My information is that coursing with a mechanical lure continues to flourish. A coursing meeting in those countries is presented as an occasion for a family outing, drawing support from all sections of society and of course, there is never any element of cruelty at them.  I fully understand that the object of live hare coursing is not to kill the hare but to pit dog against dog.  However, according to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Brian O'Shea, approximately one hare in every ten courses is killed.  I understand that a fraction less than six hares on average per meeting are killed. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Many of those who support live hare coursing make the point that hares are very carefully screened and looked after in preparation for a course.  The hares are captured in the wild and are kept in an enclosure for some weeks before a coursing meeting.  This is a contradiction in itself, because if you take the hare out of its natural environment and put it into an enclosure then obviously it is already at a major disadvantage and it cannot be correctly argued that in these circumstances the hare is better off than it would be were it to remain in the wild. The very fact that it is kept in an enclosure, which is unnatural for the hare and its survival instinct, means that its ability to survive the chase by the greyhounds is seriously impaired and obviously that gives rise to the fact that slightly less than six per meeting are killed by the greyhounds.</P>
    <P>To anyone with any knowledge of what goes on, the destruction of the hare when caught at the coursing meeting by the greyhound is cruel and extremely painful. I disagree very strongly with Deputy Alan Dukes, who talked about not looking <Col N="652" /> at the world through the eyes of an animal.  All you have to do is to listen to the manner in which the hare dies.</P>
    <P>Those who organise hare coursing know full well that to the vast majority of Irish people live hare coursing is unacceptable and basically, that is the reason television cameras and photographers are not allowed in.  There is very little pictorial coverage of live hare coursing.  If those images were presented they would undoubtedly encourage people in far greater numbers to be more vociferous in their opposition to live hare coursing. Therefore the challenge to those involved in hare coursing, if they want it to survive, must be to implement new ways of ensuring that coursing will survive without the element of cruelty, which undoubtedly arises despite the best efforts of the best run coursing meets in this country.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that coursing, where the live hare is used, will gradually diminish and die and, perhaps, even the entire so-called &ldquo;sport&rdquo; will disappear from this country if those who organise coursing meetings do not take advantage of the technology available which no longer requires the use of live hares in coursing.  This technology has been proved in other countries.  If they meet that challenge then all of us will support them in developing the industry, but they must remove the element of live hare coursing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his generosity in sharing his time with us and I compliment Deputy Gregory on introducing this Bill.  I am completely opposed to cruelty of any form to animals. Unlike bull fighting, where the aim is to kill the bull, the aim in hare coursing is not to kill the hare.  The objective is to course two dogs against each other and from that to choose a winner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 92 coursing clubs in the country embracing the 32 counties. Approximately two-thirds of those clubs run two day coursing meetings, one-third run one day meetings and one or two clubs hold three day meetings.  There are <Col N="653" /> 25,000 pups born in the country, 20,000 of which are registered and named and about 10,000 are exported, mainly to England but also to Australia and the United States.  The export of those greyhounds is worth in the order of £6 million to the coursing industry.  The total greyhounds industry is worth approximately £60 million to the national economy. When we bear in mind that 300,000 people are unemployed we should not lightly scoff at an industry which is responsible for floating £60 million in the economy.</P>
    <P>We were informed the other evening that because of hare coursing in here Irish dogs are not allowed on certain American tracks.  That is not true.  There is no state in the US where Irish dogs are barred because they are Irish.  Incidentally, those people involved in breeding state clearly that it is the coursing bloodline in the greyhounds that makes the Irish dogs so attractive.  The Australians and the Americans have discovered it, because they have come to realise that without the coursing strain their dogs tend to lose interest in coursing.  For that reason we have more American and Australian breeders coming to Ireland to purchase our dogs for breeding purposes.</P>
    <P>Every living thing in this world falls into one of two kingdoms: namely, the animal kingdom or the plant kingdom. With the exception of mankind, it is a case of the survival of the fittest.  In the plant world broad leaves prevent the sunlight reaching the ground thereby killing any plants which may be growing underneath the shade and thus preventing other plants from growing.  There are other cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the last coursing meeting held in Roscommon on 26 and 27 December 1992 on the first day <Col N="654" /> there were 72 courses and three hares were killed, on the second day there were 51 courses and five hares were killed.  Out of a total of 123 courses, unfortunately, eight hares were killed, but that is not an excessive number.  When the coursing was over, the surviving hares were taken and released approximately 100 miles from where they were captured.</P>

      <P>So far in this debate we have heard both sides of the argument regarding hare coursing.  The pro-coursing TDs laid emphasis on the traditional cultural and economic aspects of coursing. The TDs against coursing referred to the cruelty, suffering, blood lust and the clandestine nature of the sport.  They want an outright ban.  I believe it is not feasible to impose an outright ban on hare coursing for the reasons already outlined in his debate by several Deputies on all sides of the House.  The arguments in favour of a ban were that the sport of hare coursing is long established as an integral part of Irish rural life and pastimes. Apart from the part it plays in the everyday pastimes of rural Ireland, coursing plays an important part in the economic life of rural communities.  A study carried out in 1990 by a group of economists of the Department of Agricultural Economics of University College Dublin concluded that the value of coursing <Col N="655" /> to the Irish economy is in excess of £14 million per year.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out also that greyhound exports, a multi-million pound industry, benefits from coursing breeding.  This is the principal reason Irish bred greyhounds are in such demand in England and more recently in the US and Australia.  Coursing bloodlines were present in the pedigrees of 77 per cent of winners of major track events in England and Ireland in the last ten years.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the coursing fraternity will have to get their own house in order if the sport is to survive.  There is major need for the imposition of strict statutory regulations to ensure that there will never be a repeat of this year's Irish Cup at Clounanna and other disasters of recent years.  The Fine Gael Bill published this week would, in my opinion, ensure that all coursing meetings are properly run and that the number of &ldquo;kills&rdquo; would be reduced considerably. The Bill would provide a clear statutory basis for the regulation of the sport.  It provides power for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry by regulation, to lay down standards and procedures which must be observed.  I will refer to aspects of the Bill later during the course of my contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of this debate I would like to refer to extracts from the report on the Hare Coursing Bill, 1975, by the Select Committee of the House of Commons published in 1976.  This was one of the most extensive reports ever carried out into greyhound coursing.  Regarding the supporters of coursing the report stated:</P>
      <P>The Committee are fully convinced that those coursing people whom they met are not sadists but people who believe that they are engaged in a legitimate and controlled country sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate statements were made by some Deputies which implied that people were less human because they supported hare coursing.  This is a very insensitive and <Col N="656" /> unfair allegation and totally misinformed. The report states also that public opinion is increasingly opposed to coursing meetings.  The Special Committee pointed out, however, that &ldquo;if those canvassed by the antis are as ignorant of the facts as members of the Committee were before the inquiry the value of this statement must be considered debatable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whereas I do not doubt the sincerity of those TDs who are against coursing, nevertheless many of them are not familiar with the sport and are expressing opinions based on newspaper reports rather than personal experiences of the sport.</P>
    <P>The Special Committee also stated:</P>
    <P>It was generally agreed by all those giving evidence that hare shoots caused much more suffering than hare coursing. Nobody disagreed that the number of hares which die a lingering death after being wounded in a hare shoot is much larger than the number of those which are not killed instantly when caught by greyhounds, nor was it disputed that they suffered for a longer period.</P>
    <P>There was no mention in this debate about shooting hares or indeed the snaring of hares, which is extremely cruel.  If suffering and cruelty are the criteria for the abolition of hare coursing, surely it is unbalanced to concentrate the attack on coursing rather than on snaring and other methods of killing, which account for far more hares being killed and can be the cause of often prolonged acute distress and suffering.</P>
    <P>It appears that in the case of opponents of hare coursing the highly publicised concern for the treatment of the hare is not matched by any apparent interest in the protection or conservation of the species.  Thus, the report of the Scott Henderson Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals stated:</P>
    <P>Many of the opponents of field sports have gone so far as to tell us that they would welcome the extermination <Col N="657" /> of a species if that were the only means of avoiding cruelty.</P>
    <P>Hopefully this is not the position of those who are anti-coursing in the country.  If it is, it is a very dangerous position.  On the other hand, it is in the interest of the coursing fraternity to ensure the survival and conservation of our hare population. The Select Committee pointed out that &ldquo;coursing is therefore to be welcomed from the point of view of the naturalist and conservationalist who can be assured of seeing hares where coursing is practised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Scott Henderson Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals, referring to natural death, stated:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that hares that are not killed by man seldom reach old age and frequently meet a death as painful as that involved in a field sport and, while we do not accept this as a defence of field sports and other activities, we think it is an important consideration which should always be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>All Deputies in this House are concerned about reducing the suffering of hares.  The question is whether the suffering of the hare can be effectively diminished by this Bill or whether there are better ways of tackling the problem.  The passing of this Bill would make an insignificant impact on the numbers of hares killed annually &mdash; only a quarter of 1 per cent of all hares killed are killed at coursing meetings.  If this Bill was passed, coursing would still remain in unregulated forms &mdash; in these forms its purpose would be solely the taking and killing of the hare.  I am convinced that the Fine Gael proposal and the proposals put forward by the Minister are the best solution. This would ensure that the hare mortality rate would be considerably reduced or eliminated at hare coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to acknowledge that certain coursing meetings have been poorly run with scant respect being shown for the hare.  The message from this debate is clear &mdash; the sporting fraternity must get their house in order if the sport is to survive.  If killing the hare <Col N="658" /> is irrelevant in competitive coursing then every effort must be made to ensure the hare will always have the advantage.  I will go further and say that I believe no pair of dogs are a match for a good hare. Nature has equipped the hare with a number of very vital attributes but because of the short time available to me I am unable to state them here.  Suffice to say that whereas a dog is well fed at all times and trained to be an effective running machine, the same is not true of the hare.  That is why it is important that hares in captivity should be fed properly and receive proper supervision from veterinary surgeons, which is provided for in this Bill.  There should also be a regulated slip of at least 150 yards which would eliminate much of the cruelty and carnage. The hare should be coached properly.</P>
    <P>The provision of special muzzles must be considered immediately for coursing. These should be designed in such a way to protect the greyhound from injury and to prevent the killing of the hare.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome this debate on hare coursing.  An outright ban on the sport would be both inopportune and unworkable at this time.  However, I hope the Irish Coursing Club will note this debate and take every measure possible to eliminate the killing of hares at coursing meetings.</P>

      <P>In the short time at my disposal I wish to make three points. I want to dispel a myth which may emerge following this debate, that only those who support this Bill tonight are concerned about the well-being of animals.  Many Members who will vote against this Bill were born and reared in the country and spent most of their lives surrounded by animals and in such communities cruelty to animals is not acceptable.  Like many Members, I believe that there are many deficiencies in the way coursing meetings have been run.  Nevertheless, to ban the sport at this stage would be a premature step.  Strict standards and procedures must be laid down and they will be honoured by those involved in coursing. Having spoken to people involved in hare <Col N="659" /> coursing in my constituency, I am aware that they are as anxious as we are to have stricter rules enforced to ensure that coursing as a sport has a better reputation.</P>
      <P>I have witnessed enormous depths of emotion in this House while debating this issue.  I look forward to the day when I will witness similar depths of emotion and passion when debating the violence and cruelty to women and children which is taking place not just occasionally but on a daily basis.  Furthermore, we should not forget that more than 400 people are killed on our roads every year by drunk drivers.  I will welcome the day when a Bill is introduced banning people who kill others because of drunken driving from driving for life.  I hope this debate will improve the manner in which coursing meetings are run and give protection and security to the hare.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  In regard to the comments of my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn, I hope that when we have a debate in this House on any of the measures about which she spoke that a large number of Deputies will not oppose them.</P>
      <P>From as early as 1982, shortly after my election to the Dáil, I have indicated my support for the banning of live hare coursing in correspondence with interested local individuals and national groups, because it is an indefensible and inhumane sport.  I want to state my position at party level.  I argued in support of a free vote in this case because there are varying views within my party on this issue, as is the case with most parties in the House.  I do not wish to force my views on anyone and I freely understand that people from different cultural and geographical backgrounds can hold differing views in this regard.  However, I hope to be given an opportunity to express my views freely on this occasion. That should be the case in respect of all parties on issues such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced by an Independent Deputy and, therefore, is suited <Col N="660" /> to a free vote.  I regret that my choices are limited to voting against the Bill, which I will not do, taking a back way out, which I do not propose to do either or voting against my party Whip.  After 12 years in this House that is a significant step to take but, perhaps, after 12 years of compromising one gets tougher.  I regret I will be voting against the majority of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, but it is in the best interests of Fine Gael, especially in Dublin, that some Members support the proposal to ban live hare coursing, a measure which would be supported by the majority of my constituents.</P>
    <P>Although I am a Dubliner, my parents are from the west and south of the country and I spent many long months in rural spots.  The suggestion that the loss of hare coursing will harm the quality of life in rural Ireland does a serious injustice to the many and varied entertainments and activities that go on there.  In my long summers there I participated in a variety of activities that go to make up what I consider to be a much more essential part of rural life.  I wish to put on record that I feel obliged to honour a commitment I have made to groups over a very long period indeed, although I regret that it involves, on this occasion, going against my own party's directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years I have been among a small number of Deputies who have regularly raised wildlife issues in this House, even before environmentalism took off and it became fashionable to do so.  Seal culling, badger baiting, other hunting, whaling, as well as hare coursing, have all been raised by me in this House since my election in June 1981.  I have addressed many non-party political meetings on wildlife issues and corresponded with adults and children throughout the country on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an extremist in these things. I just dislike senseless cruelty being inflicted on animals.  I believe it is demeaning and dehumanising.  Contrary to what has been said by some speakers in this House, I have no wish to stop <Col N="661" /> people fishing or engaging in some other sports.</P>
    <P>Live hare coursing is an issue on which my own personal views have been known for many years.  For approximately five years I have been Honourary President of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, and Deputy Gregory, who has sponsored this Bill in this House, is Honourary Vice-President of that organisation. I think it is largely through the work each of us has done in opposing hare coursing that we were given these honourary positions.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it comes as no surprise to any Member of this House, either within or outside the Fine Gael Party, that I would like to see live coursing banned.  There is no reason why those who promote live hare coursing could not end the cruelty involved in coursing by promoting drag coursing as an alternative. Drag coursing is practised currently in Australia and is growing in popularity there.</P>
    <P>Hare coursing has always been a divisive issue within Fine Gael, as it has within the other major parties, Fianna Fáil, Labour and the Progressive Democrats. If the Democratic Left had not lost some of their members in the last election, it would also be divisive for them.  Due to the divisions within the major parties on this issue, it has always been my belief that a Private Member's Bill to ban hare coursing would not succeed unless Deputies in all parties were allowed a free vote.  I am sorry that is not happening tonight.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten days I have watched a number of Deputies on all sides of the House sincerely expressing support for this Bill and then, in total subjugation to their party's Whip, explaining they cannot support it, and I ask myself why? Why should grown men and women be forced to behave in such an undignified and demeaning way?  Why should they be forced on an issue such as this to let people down and add to the public's cynicism of politicians and of the workings of this House?</P>
    <P>There is a need in this Parliament for us to grow up.  There are fundamental <Col N="662" /> issues of economic and social policy which require political parties to impose a party Whip to ensure a degree of political discipline and coherence.  There are other issues to which the tyranny of the Whip or, indeed the protection of the Whip, should not apply.</P>
    <P>These are issues which are never given priority by Government but in respect of which Deputies in each of the parties may hold strong, sincere and conflicting views.  The fate of the nation does not depend on these issues.  Live hare coursing is one such issue.  Although I strongly believe hare coursing should be banned, I recognise that there are many more important issues with which the country is confronted and which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>If all the major parties allowed a free vote on issues such as this Governments would not fall, nor would political parties disintegrate.  There would be no political cataclysm.  The institutions of the State would not collapse.  The removal of the Whip might also restore some of the general public's faith in politicians.  Most people outside this House cannot understand Deputies who say one thing and vote for the opposite.  We have heard much about muzzling dogs during this debate.  It is time for us to remove the self-imposed political muzzles.  It is time for us to allow Deputies of all parties to behave and act on occasion like legislators and not just as lobby-fodder. Unfortunately, I have been unsuccessful in persuading my party to allow a free vote on this issue as have other Deputies in the other major parties.</P>
    <P>The vote tonight is not only about hare coursing.  It is also about allowing the spirit of a new, modern Ireland permeate the politically cobwebbed walls of this House.  An overwhelming majority of people outside this House support a ban on live hare coursing, yet their views are to be ignored.</P>
    <P>Ireland is divided, but not by where one lives or on grounds of class.  The old Ireland is the politics of the smoke-filled room at the back of a half-deserted public house.  The new Ireland is the politics of free choice and personal responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> It yearns for a compassionate responsible civilised view of itself.  The old Ireland is the dark men in long coats; the new Ireland is kids buying compact discs recorded by their fellow Irish men and women.  Some of these kids are now well into their forties &mdash; they are the Woodstock generation of the booming sixties.</P>
    <P>It is these generations of the new Ireland who least understand the workings of this House and who have scant regard for the politicians who inhabit it. Have none of the Deputies considered why it is that so few urban people in their twenties, thirties and early forties have any interest in politics?  Can they not see that Members of this House have turned their backs on whole generations, except at election time when through media hype and political soft sells they temporarily try to manipulate their support in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The new Ireland is predominantly peopled by those in urban and suburban life, people who are mobile, people who want better answers, people who have turned away from the politics of the knowing handshake, the pre-arranged holiday, the politics of nudge and wink.</P>
    <P>Any party in this House who either fails to embrace or who abandons and deserts these new generations does so at its peril.  Any party in this House who fails to reflect their aspirations not only by what it says but by what it does, is on the road to political extinction.  Any party that so behaves may still remain on the political landscape for some time. However, the younger generations of Irish men and women will regard Stephen Speilberg's &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo; as a more relevant location for such party's activities than this House or Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>It is with great sadness that I find myself, this evening, at odds with a majority of my friends and colleagues in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  I am, however, grateful to the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, and to the members of the parliamentary party for the understanding and consideration they have given to my position and to the <Col N="664" /> position of others who have difficulty with the party's stance on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been in this position on one previous occasion &mdash; in 1983 when together with a colleague, Monica Barnes, I voted against the proposed so-called Pro-Life Amendment to the Constitution. I believe that the events that followed after the passage of that legislation and its inclusion by referendum into our Constitution, have proved that we were right on that occasion.</P>
    <P>While I regard hare coursing as an unacceptable and cruel activity, I recognise that the legislation involved here tonight addresses an issue that is not as serious nor viewed by the general public as being as serious as the issue which gave rise to difficulties for me in 1983.</P>
    <P>My vote tonight is not simply a vote to express my support for Deputy Gregory's Bill.  It is to some extent irrelevant whether I vote tonight in favour of the Bill or not.  A Government majority has been whipped into this House to oppose the Bill and sadly the Bill will fall.</P>
    <P>My vote tonight is a simple thing.  It is about something unfashionable.  It is about something that is not supposed to be a part of the armoury of today's mature politicians.  It is about something not seen as politically cute.  It is something long since abandoned by Government in this Dáil and not seen as relevant to its day to day workings.  Put simply, it is about keeping faith with people with whom I have been in contact over the years and it is about fulfilling a promise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole question of hare coursing has led to some very heated arguments.  While this is to be welcomed, it is important that argument is conducted in a calm, tolerant and understanding manner.  Regrettably, this has not always been the case with regard to the Bill before this House tonight.  The heat has become so great that many Government Deputies who, in the past have vehemently expressed views against hare coursing, have chosen, or in many instances, have been directed to absent themselves from the debate tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both sides to this debate have argued <Col N="665" /> the correctness of their cause with passion. When one looks objectively at the two lobbies, one finds some of the best and most respected citizens arguing the case on both sides of the House.  This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the issue must be complicated when it can attract some of our best people to argue the case either way.</P>
    <P>Looking at each group individually, the anti-coursing group has to be applauded for the professional manner in which it has arranged its campaign for its concern for animals and the elimination of cruelty in all its forms.  Any human being who would not aspire to eliminate cruelty is lacking in basic humanity and kindness.  However, one must also consider the coursing fraternity and to be fair to them, it is clear that they do not wish to see cruelty or condone killing.  It is not the objective of their sport to kill hares but to race dogs.  Unfortunately, it is true, however, that a small percentage of hares are killed in the conduct of their coursing activities.  This clearly begs the question as to why a reasonable person with a humanitarian outlook should participate in this sport.</P>
    <P>In his analysis of this question, my colleague, Deputy Dukes, last week referred to the origins of the human race and the critical part played therein by hunting. His argument merits considerable attention.  All carnivores, including man himself, are hunters and killers.  Man alone has evolved from his primitive origins as a hunter and killer to his present sophistication where he has only to go to the nearest supermarkets to get his supply of beef, mutton, pork and fowl without having to kill or watch the kill of these animals.  We kill approximately two million cattle, three and a half million sheep, three million pigs, 50 million chickens and five million turkeys annually without a major clamour for alteration to our national diet.  Unfortunately, the vast range of carnivorous animals has not evolved into a handout society like man, so each has to carry out its own hunting and killing to secure its daily balanced diet of flesh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> I do not need to elaborate that as part of our Creator's plan for the survival of thousands of species, some must be killed, often cruelly, and with much pain, to enable others to survive.</P>
    <P>I applaud the advocates of the abolition of cruelty.  However, in this imperfect world, it will be impossible to eliminate cruelty to animals.  Nature has so ordained that cruelty is part of life and if we start to interfere with nature, where do we stop?  Do we eliminate all foxes so that rabbits and hares can survive?  Do we eliminate tigers and lions so that gazelles can survive?  Hare coursing should not be looked at in isolation but against the backdrop of nature.  In this context all sports involving animals and fish embrace some degree of cruelty yet they also give a great degree of pleasure to man.  Some 300,000 people are actively engaged in field sports most of whom are family people who are not cruel or lacking in mercy or kindness.  In addition, our natural habitat and environs assisted in the development of a tourist industry built on outdoor and country pursuits which has resulted in the creation of a large number of jobs.  Bearing these points in mind, I am of the opinion that the vast body of reasonable people are entitled to their sport, but with the proviso that where possible cruelty should be minimised and all humane methods exercised to eliminate suffering and pain.</P>
    <P>Throughout the course of this debate Fine Gael has tried to adopt a position of tolerance and understanding.  We have listened to all sides of the argument and have not sought to influence the debate by outrageous stunts such as that introduced to the House last night by Deputy Sargent or concerted and pressurised campaigns.  We attempted to introduce a reasoned amendment to the Bill introduced by Deputy Gregory, but it was ruled out of order.  We published a Bill which to my mind takes a more moderate view of the whole subject and endeavours to ensure that by listening to both sides of the argument a more reasonable solution can be found.  It is very much in the interest of all parties to look at ways and means of eliminating, where possible, the <Col N="667" /> physical suffering caused by hare coursing. I have no doubt that a certain unanimity of views can be found among the pro and anti-coursing people with regard to the abolition of cruelty.  Their opinions, together with the advice of conservationists and representatives of animal welfare societies, could go a long way to ensuring that cruelty in all its forms is minimised.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the abolition of coursing would be a drastic and major step.  To outlaw it could have even more harmful effects as by driving it underground there would be no supervision or control over the cruelty and killing aspects.  It would be extremely unreasonable of this House to suddenly transform overnight a pastime into a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind my arguments regarding the laws of nature, the possibilities of eliminating cruelty and the merits of the economy of the coursing industry, the question this House must ask is whether the degree of suffering caused by the sport is such as would justify legislation to ban it.  This House must come to the conclusion that banning is an incorrect approach.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael examined the question of coursing and published a Bill to regulate the sport.  As Deputies Deenihan and Dukes pointed out, the Bill attempted to deal with the problems through greater regulation, the creation of a task force to study various aspects of the industry and an imposed review period of regulations within two years.  It is our belief that this approach represents a more reasonable way of treating and dealing with the problem. I am confident that provisions such as these would eliminate the suspicion which surrounds meetings, provide an independent and transparent form of regulation to coursing and rebuild confidence on all sides that a sporting pursuit enjoyed by thousands can be conducted without scandal or slur on the participants.</P>
    <P>This topic has generated considerable debate both on the floor of this House and within political parties.  It is unacceptable <Col N="668" /> for a sporting pastime and pursuit of so many thousands of our people to become criminalised overnight.  These are not simple and straightforward questions and the proposals of Fine Gael constitute a reasonable constructive approach to this issue and ones which we will be seeking to incorporate into any future legislation.  We do not believe that an outright ban on coursing and the criminalising of participants is the correct course of action to take.  With the majority of my party colleagues I will be opposing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not recall when there were such sustained attacks on any issue as has been mounted on coursing.  It is little wonder that those actively involved in the promotion and running of coursing &mdash; their numbers run to thousands throughout the 32 counties &mdash; feel aggrieved and somewhat under siege. The Irish Coursing Club, and its affiliated clubs, have been subjected to a barrage of criticism and charges which must surely appall those not conversant with field sports and, in particular, those not versed in coursing.</P>
      <P>Those vociferous, highly organised groups who oppose coursing &mdash; I do not for one moment deny their right to do so &mdash; have, in the view of many Members, gone too far.  The content of some of the pamphlets distributed by anti-coursing activists, particularly those from outside this country, are outrageously inaccurate in the view of fair-minded people with no vested interest in the subject of hare coursing.  The degree of professionalism displayed in the orchestration of letter-writing, nationally and internationally, to Members and the Irish media has been another characteristic of this campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will certainly have welcomed the assurances given by a spokesperson for the Irish Council Against Blood <Col N="669" /> Sports on a Marion Finucane radio show on 23 June, 1993 to the effect that his organisation disassociated itself from the campaign of violence against people and farm animals, bomb threats and such reprehensible tactics practised by what are obviously dangerous and irresponsible fringe groups.  This House, and this State, gives no support to such actions or behaviour.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be consensus in the House that a review of the operation of coursing is overdue.  The initiatives taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, must be heartily commended. Indeed, their approach in investigating the Clounanna meeting cannot have escaped the attention of all. The Irish Coursing Club, as the coursing controlling authority, from the outset supported and co-operated in this investigation which was intensive and wide-ranging. The unfortunate mortality rate at this meeting was a cause of deep concern to all sections of the greyhound industry as much as to all animal lovers. It certainly caused the members of the County Limerick club deep concern and anxiety in regard to what went wrong. The members of the County Limerick club, like all who participate in the sport, are people of status in the community.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's report on the inquiry which he mentioned here tonight and I welcome also the proposals outlined by him, which I am sure will play a major part in ensuring that we do not have a recurrence of the most regrettable incident in Clounanna.</P>
      <P>There is a real danger that in the midst of the charges levelled against coursing since Deputy Gregory's Bill came on stream the perception of the Irish Coursing Club and its subsidiary organisations will be badly, if not permanently, damaged. Should that occur it would be a travesty.  The Irish Coursing Club, as the representative body of more than 10,000 owners and breeders in this country, is held in the highest regard in all countries where greyhound sports are operated. Its state of the art registration systems guarantee the integrity of the Irish greyhound breed and is the envy of all.  The ICC's total dedication to the introduction of DNA blood typing and its efforts to foster many facets of the Irish greyhound industry have been highly successful.  Its immensely successful introduction of the most stringent dope testing procedures at the major meetings gives the lie to the suggestion that coursing greyhounds are hyped up for that sport.  Of its own accord and from its own finances the Irish Coursing Club has been operating and implementing over the past few years measures in the area of hare husbandry and hare preservation.  This area has been dealt with by the totally voluntary Irish Coursing Club's executive committee, which is a 32-county organisation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Irish Coursing Club has the unique distinction of being accepted by all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland as the control authority for the sport of greyhound racing in that part of this island.  I would suggest that this indicates on the part of Northern Ireland confidence in the impartiality, initiative and expertise of the club's secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out the readiness with which the Irish Coursing Club has agreed to immediately pursue feasibility studies and muzzle experiments in relation to coursing.  This indicates a readiness to <Col N="671" /> meet the criticisms of this House and any shortcomings which may be perceived.</P>
    <P>Like many distinguished Members of this House, I have had the pleasure of owning and racing greyhounds.  It is a sport that is a part of the Irish way of life and I hope it continues to be such.  I look forward to the Minister's proposals to help the sport develop.  Indeed, with regard to the experiment of muzzling coursing greyhounds, I would like to put it on record that this is a measure which I have advocated for consideration over a period of years.  I hold no brief for cruelty in coursing or any other sport, nor indeed does anybody involved in coursing.  I wish to ensure that everything possible will be done to eliminate cruelty from the sport and I am sure this will have the full support of every Member of this House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> I need hardly remind the Minister that what is at stake on Second Stage is the general principal of the Bill, which I see as a desire to change the law on live hare coursing.  The Minister of State and I are in agreement that the law must be changed; but the Minister wants a change to muzzle the greyhounds whereas I want a change to drag coursing.  If the general principle of the need for change or some kind is agreed, surely the Bill should not be opposed on Second Stage.  If the Minister of State genuinely wants consensus, which he stated, then I am offering him a means to work towards that end.</P>
    <P>I would prefer not to enter into argument on the detail of my Bill; that is, as we know, the function of Committee Stage.  However, since the Minister of State chose to put such emphasis on what he sees as technical flaws in the Bill, I feel I must respond if only to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>My Bill seeks to amend the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 and the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The Minister argued in his speech that it would be more appropriate to amend the Protection of Animals Acts of 1911 and 1965.  This is the first and, as far as I can gather, the fundamental flaw, according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I now wish to quote the Official Report of 21 May 1992, column 156, where the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, stated:</P>
    <P>Coursing is regulated under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which is under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Any decision by the Legislature to abolish hare coursing should appropriately be made in the context of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that my Bill specifically seeks to amend the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, along with the Wildlife Act, 1976.  I am following the explicit advice given in the Dáil record as to the appropriate Act to amend.</P>
    <P>If that is not sufficient, may I quote from a letter dated 25 March, 1993 from <Col N="673" /> Deputy Noel Dempsey, Government Chief Whip to the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>The position is that the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, established the Irish Coursing Club, and invested it with powers to regulate and control hare coursing.  Any proposals to abolish hare coursing would, therefore, be considered in the context of this Act.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister: who is fooling who?  Can I suggest to the Minister that this conflict of evidence is a very serious flaw in the Minister's attempt to discredit my Bill.  Indeed, I would go further and suggest that to say on Second Stage that a Bill is flawed is really just the last refuge of the scoundrel and has been used over the past week by various Labour Party Members as an excuse for their own hypocrisy.  Having given unequivocal commitments that they would abolish live hare coursing, they are now intent on voting against a Bill that would do just that.</P>
    <P>I must admit to being a little puzzled by what seems to me to be two quite conflicting statements in the Minister's speech where he stated:</P>
    <P>I believe that these flaws are such that if it were enacted it would not succeed in achieving its aim.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Any discretion to the authorities to allow a limited form of coursing would be removed.  If the Bill were successful it would, for example, outlaw the muzzling of greyhounds for coursing purposes.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister's problem with the Bill is that it would achieve what I want it to achieve, but does not do what the Minister wants.  That is its real flaw.  It seems fairly evident to me that the reason the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government is opposing this Bill is quite simply because the Government does not have the courage to bring real change <Col N="674" /> into an area that has been crying out for it for a long time.  The Minister said that the timing of this Bill was &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;&mdash; I assume he meant for the Government; it is certainly not unfortunate for the defenceless victims of coursing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, I and others have been raising this issue for well over ten years now and nothing at all was done.  Now we get the half-hearted panic efforts to &ldquo;develop&rdquo; a muzzle and run a few trials in the next coursing season.  We are told that muzzling will be introduced at the earliest possible date, after a trial period. If this means anything, it is that the torture and killing of hares in the cruel sadistic ways of the Irish Coursing Club will continue unabated, apart from a few muzzle trials.  Those of my colleagues in the &ldquo;party of change&rdquo; who gave written commitments of their unequivocal opposition to such cruelty are quite content with this.  I cannot come to terms with such hypocrisy.  I can accept a difference of opinion, or even hard compromises, on policy positions; but this issue of horrific cruelty to a small and gentle animal goes much deeper than a lot of what we debate and differ on in this House.</P>
    <P>Those Members of Dáil Éireann who wrote and spoke so passionately in the past and now refuse to take a stand must be very proud.  When the next coursing season starts I hope they attend and see what they made possible by their vote tonight.  Even if muzzling of all greyhounds was to be introduced now, it would not be an acceptable solution, for many reasons.  It would not eliminate the &ldquo;kill&rdquo;.  The terror that coursing involves for the hare will continue and many of the terrified little creatures will die of fright.</P>
    <P>The ISPCA points out that &ldquo;cruelty begins with hares being injured during netting&rdquo;.  Apart from the fear and terror it involves for the hare, many hares break legs while struggling to free themselves from the nets and are left with festering wounds to die in the wild.  Those who are captured are penned together in small enclosures where some die from stress and disease.  Hares are timid, solitary creatures who suffer fear and terror in <Col N="675" /> captivity.  They are delicate animals and close proximity to their own kind often leads to the spread of infection.  As long as live hare coursing is permitted under the law, whether dogs are muzzled or not, it will lead to and indeed facilitate horrific abuses, the worst of which is what is called &ldquo;blooding&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can the welfare of animals be entrusted to people who have for decades regarded as sport and obtained enjoyment from the mutilation, terrorising and killing of inoffensive and defenceless animals? It is simply incomprehensible and there is no point in ignoring the truth. People who &ldquo;blood&rdquo; dogs, who re-course hares again and again, who use sick and weak hares, simply do not know the meaning of animal welfare, whether they care for their greyhounds or not.</P>
    <P>The main reason we are debating this issue here tonight is because some of these people have disgraced themselves over and over again.  When I spoke last week I listed several of the most blatant and public of the scandals they allowed to happen.  Virtually all of those scandals were not made public by the Irish Coursing Club.  Most of them were brought to our attention by observers of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports.  If those observers had not been there those obscenities would have been covered up, just as so much else is swept under a very dirty carpet.</P>
    <P>If the Irish Coursing Club cared at all about the issues raised here, would they have waited for the public humiliation of seeing Dáil Éireann being forced to act, forced to curtail the excesses and muzzle dogs?  Everyone here knows the answer to that question.  Ireland's reputation as a civilised country is at stake.  Animal welfare organisations around the world are waiting for the outcome of this debate.  What are they to hear &mdash; that Ireland does not kill animals for fun any more?  Ireland just terrifies and tortures animals for entertainment.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister to suspend all coursing activities for the coming season and examine in detail the possibility of introducing drag-coursing.  I am <Col N="676" /> convinced that this would help consolidate the whole coursing and greyhound industry, enhance its image and reputation and give the industry a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is voted down tonight it will not dissuade me from pursuing this issue. I intend to take this case to the Council of Europe.  The Council of Europe has stated that it will &ldquo;endeavour to ensure that animals are treated in a way that does not inflict on them any avoidable pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a representative of Dáil Éireann on the Council of Europe, I will, along with the ISPCA and the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, pursue this matter there.  I regret having to do so because I believe our reputation as a modern state will suffer significantly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Alan Dukes quoted from what he said was a House of Commons Select Committee &mdash; as did Deputy Deenihan tonight &mdash; which he said put my remarks in perspective; but he gave no source.  He was in fact quoting from a 1976 House of Lords Select Committee set up specifically to delay the decision of the House of Commons, which by a majority of 111 had voted to outlaw hare coursing, That puts in perspective Deputy Dukes' remarks.  Deputy Dukes suggested that my reasoning was excessively anthropomorphic, which he interpreted as attempting to view the world of animals through the eyes of a human person. However, my understanding of anthropomorphism is to attribute to animals the characteristics of humans, something I did not imply in any way.  Peter Singer, the Australian philosopher, who in 1976 published a book on <i>Animal Liberation,</i> concluded that what is important is the capacity to suffer, which he argued is self-evidently present in both animals and humans.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in his speech listed the usual reasons why he could not ban hare coursing.  I was a little taken aback because it is only a few years since the Minister, acting as one of Tramore's town commissioners, mandated fellow commissioners at the 1988 Association of Municipal Authorities to put forward <Col N="677" /> Motion No. 144 &mdash;&ldquo;That the Minister be asked to make enclosed hare coursing illegal&rdquo;.  Now, however, he is the Minister of State and he says that coursing is at the heart of an important indigenous industry and, if it were banned, the quality of the track dog would suffer, our exports would suffer and money would be lost to the economy.  In view of what Deputy Kemmy told us last night about Labour Party policy, how any Labour Minister could accept this poisoned chalice is beyond me.</P>
    <P>For those who, like the Minister, are more practical than I am and worry instead about the value of coursing to the economy, I can only ask: how much is the international reputation of Ireland worth?  How much will we lose in tourism revenue when the World Society for the Protection of Animals takes action?  For me the essential question is: what price does the Minister and this House put on cruelty to a defenceless animal?</P>
    <P>I thank the members of the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Democratic Left, the Green Party and my fellow Independent colleague who intend to support the Bill.  An ideal opportunity to demonstrate the maturity of this House <Col N="678" /> has been lost by the refusal of the main parties to allow a free vote on this issue. It would have been an excellent exercise in democracy to see what the outcome would have been.  Although I am looking for change in a modern Ireland, I will quote briefly from St. Thomas More who wrote in 1534:</P>
    <P>thou shouldest rather be moved with pity to see a silly innocent hare murdered of a dog: the weak of the stronger, the fearful of the fierce, the innocent of the cruel and unmerciful. Therefore all this exercise of hunting, as a thing unworthy to be used of free men.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 13, to delete &ldquo;the Security Council or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment to the definition section seeks to delete the term &ldquo;Security Council&rdquo; from the Bill.  My reason for tabling this amendment is the fact that the United Nations has remained virtually unreformed in its structures since its establishment almost 50 years ago.  As I pointed out last evening, the Security Council has been extremely selective in the manner in which it deals with questions of international threats to peace, a matter of great concern to most people who viewed the post-cold war scenario as one in which we might expect a new confidence to develop worldwide, when the <Col N="681" /> United Nations would at last confirm its role.</P>
    <P>The expectation was, at the end of the Cold War, that the United Nations would have space to act in a fair and unbiased way.  People felt that we would move from a bi-polar system, as it was known &mdash; the challenge between the east and west &mdash; to a uni-polar system and that the antagonism would be replaced by a willingness on all sides to co-operate in relieving international tensions but that is not the way it has worked out.  It is obvious that various self-interests have presented themselves in different guises since the end of the Cold War in areas of tension.  An example is the manner in which the United States received a mandate from the United Nations to launch its attacks on Iraq in early 1991.  This sent a shudder down the spines of those who had thought we were about to enter a new era.</P>
    <P>The least we should do, if we are to pass this Bill which will change the way in which Ireland will approach its international commitments and relationships, is ensure, where we embark on missions which may involve peace enforcement, that such a mission has received a broad mandate from the United Nations General Assembly.  I do not think we can say, given its present make-up, that the Security Council will not allow itself to be swung behind missions this country would not be happy with.  We have experienced this in relation to the Gulf War when there was a strong feeling that we should be critical of what was being done in the Middle East but the Government swung in behind the American effort by allowing warplanes to land and refuel here.  This was done for reasons which had little to do with the Middle East and much to do with our relationship with the United States.  It was felt that we should not be out of step with the most powerful states in the world.  In promoting this Bill the Government should ensure, until such time as the Security Council is reformed and there is a balance as between the various sections of the world, particularly among the permanent members, that we only become <Col N="682" /> involved in missions which have received a mandate from the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    <P>There are 15 members on the Security Council, five of whom are permanent members and have a veto.  Since the United Nations was formed they have exercised this veto on so many occasions that the United Nations was essentially sidelined in regard to most of the crises which occurred between 1945 and 1989-90. It is extraordinary, even at this point, that no moves have been made to reform the system.  I made the point that the permanent members of the Security Council do not include any African representative. If one considers Russia to be a European country, virtually all the members are European.  We should seek to have this changed.  There are now in excess of 180 members in the United Nations.  Therefore, in this day and age it is an anachronism that five of the old colonial powers are permanent members of the Security Council and have a veto which should not be allowed to continue. I would strongly argue that we should not change our role internationally from one of peacekeeping to peace enforcement until such time as the United Nations has been reformed and democratised because there is little democracy when it comes to the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> in March of this year, Ms Liz Heffernan, a lecturer in law at TCD, pointed out that signs of undemocratic practices have emerged, not least the selective nature of Security Council action and the use of the Council as a vehicle for the promotion of the agendas of the permanent members.  That was not a statement by Deputy De Rossa of Democratic Left but rather by a lecturer in law at TCD whom I do not know.</P>
    <P>There are many examples one could give to highlight the selective nature of Security Council action.  As I said on a number of occasions in this House, to use the Gulf War as an example, within a matter of a few months the United Nations was embroiled in the massive destruction of Iraq.  I have the same <Col N="683" /> antipathy towards Saddam Hussein as every Member but I argued at the time that it would have been more appropriate to proceed by way of imposing sanctions. I argued also that in the assault on Iraq many hundreds, if not thousands of civilians would be killed.  We still do not know how many civilian casualties there were in that war.  It would have been more humane to impose sanctions which would have been in line with the character of the United Nations which sees military action as a last resort.  The sanctions were not given enough time to work effectively on that occasion because the United States, which received approval for this action from the United Nations Security Council, wanted to establish its hegemony over the important resource of oil which it regards as its bailiwick in that part of the world.</P>
    <P>We should compare this action with the issue that was discussed today at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians in 1975 in clear breach of the United Nations charter.  This was a clear case involving the annexation of a small island with a small population which was unable to resist its larger neighbour's pursuit of offshore resources.  That invasion resulted in the genocide of in excess of 200,000 people in East Timor.</P>
    <P>In spite of the many resolutions passed by the United Nations demanding that the people of East Timor be granted the right to self-determination and that their human rights be protected, Indonesia continues to occupy East Timor and the United Nations has not lifted a finger to impose sanctions against Indonesia or to take action against that invasion. Plenty of resolutions have been passed, plenty of statements have been made by the European Community, plenty of tears have been shed and plenty of hands have been wrung about that invasion. Yet there has been no invasion of Indonesia or a missile assault on that country. People will obviously appreciate that I am not advocating such an approach.  I am simply drawing a comparison <Col N="684" /> between the selective way in which these decisions are made by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that we were living in the Cold War era in 1975.  That is true. However, this is 1993 and the Cold War, so we have been told, ended in 1989. Therefore, one would have expected some more upfront action to have been taken by the United Nations on this issue. A statement was made by the European Council in December 1991 that the cooperative relations between the European Community and Indonesia would be reviewed because of the infringement of human rights in East Timor.  We were told today by the Department of Foreign Affairs that that review has not been carried out two years later.  There has been no review of the economic, trade and diplomatic relations between the European Community and Indonesia despite the solemn declaration made by the European Council in December 1991, 18 months ago.  My basic argument is that the Security Council addresses issue in a very selective way and that the General Assembly could give a surer guarantee that any missions or actions undertaken by the United Nations would have the broad mandate of the United Nations. That is the bottom line issue in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In case Deputies are getting bored listening to me, I wish to remind the House that we are discussing together amendments Nos. 1 to 3 in my name. Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;for the preservation or restoration of peace&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;United Nations&rdquo; in section 1.  The Bill as it stands makes no reference whatsoever to the purposes for which a United Nations force can be used.  There is no reference to the types of operations in which we will seek to become involved.  It opens the door completely.  The Defence Act states specifically that the Irish Defence Forces will be involved only in police actions &mdash; in other words, peacekeeping actions.  We are proposing to change our law to permit the Irish Government to agree to Irish Defence Forces, and presumably other forces, <Col N="685" /> becoming involved in missions on behalf of the United Nations or together with the United Nations, but we have not been given any indication of how far we will go in those missions.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will argue that all the missions in which our Defence Forces become involved must come before this House for approval.  That is true.  However, missions tend to have a long life and can change in character.  I suggest that missions which involve peace enforcement can change in character extremely quickly.  Peacekeeping missions can also change, but it is less likely that they will change in character.  There is every possibility that a peace enforcement mandate may change very quickly to one where the United Nations, in order to gain the upper hand in circumstances which they regard as extremely difficult, will engage in a Gulf War type assault.  We must ensure through this Bill that Ireland's role will not extend to that type of operation.  I am arguing that we should include in the Bill a reference that the missions in which our Defence Forces will engage will be for the preservation or restoration of peace.</P>
    <P>I would argue that that is all we are entitled to do under our Constitution.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to Article 29 of the Constitution.  Article 29.1 states:</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree with that statement. Article 29.2 states:</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
    <P>Article 29.3 states:</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Article 29.2 makes it <Col N="686" /> obligatory on us to ensure that Irish troops are involved only in operations for the preservation or restoration of peace. The provisions of the Bill in this regard are much too wide and leave too much scope to a future administration, which may make a policy decision to take up a different position.  Everyone knows how difficult it is for citizens of this State to challenge any law passed by this House. The costs of taking a case to the courts of the land are extremely high and it is only people who are extremely wealthy, or perhaps extremely poor, who can afford to take a case to our courts.  We should insert in the Bill the words: &ldquo;for the preservation or restoration of peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;but excludes a force or body approved by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;United Nations&rdquo; in section 1, On a first reading, that amendment may seem odd.  I wish to explain the purpose of it.  Section 1 states that the term &ldquo;the Act of 1960&rdquo; means the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the term &ldquo;International United Nations Force&rdquo; means an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations.  It has been argued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that that refers to a body established under the direct control, administration and command of the United Nations.  Of course, that type of operation has been used less frequently in recent times than the type of operation where regional bodies or individual states are essentially licensed to do certain things on behalf of the United Nations. This was true in relation to, for example, the Iraq War and the decision by the United States to go into Somalia to, as it said, restore hope.</P>
    <P>Under a mandate approved by the United Nations, the United States subsequently went back in with bombers and gunships to seek to put manners on the warlord, General Aideed.  It is notable that in spite of the &ldquo;precision strikes and surgical strikes&rdquo; General Aideed was not <Col N="687" /> to be found.  He is still alive and organising his faction in Somalia.</P>
    <P>President Clinton went on television to outline the objectives of the operation; to establish peace; to protect human rights and to establish market economics, and to proclaim the success of his mission.  It is quite odd that we permit a situation where individual countries can act under the guise of the United Nations' mandate while essentially pursuing domestic policy internationally.  It struck me as odd that the Minister, in response to questions about the US presence in Somalia, claimed that it was there under the same mandate as UNOSOM II.  It is my understanding that the two mandates are different. The Minister was asked the following question if the United States decided to engage in a particular operation, would Irish troops in the area acting as transport unit be involved?  I am sure the Minister will respond by saying that Irish troops are not in that area, but while they are not in that area at present, perhaps they may be there next week or the week after.</P>
    <P>I do not object to our troops working alongside US troops but I object to the fact that there are two distinct mandates in operation.  One mandate is under the direct command structure of the United Nations and the other is under the direct command control of the United States. This raises the contradictions that currently exist in the United Nations and the way it proceeds with its business.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the United Nations and it has survived through very difficult times.  In the first 40 years of its existence it was, to a large extent, misused and abused, nonetheless it has done important work in international aid and development and in developing conventions on human rights and, by and large, operating within the constraints imposed on them by the major powers which were at loggerheads at that time and who engaged in wars at arm's length in many parts of the world. As a very small country our very existence depends on ensuring that there is an international order based on law and <Col N="688" /> compliance with law and it is important that we ensure the United Nations is reformed.  We need to ensure also that when we are engaged in UN operations we are engaged solely in a peacekeeping role.  There is nothing fundamentally cowardly or wrong with Ireland maintaining its role as a peacekeeper.  We played an honourable role in the past and we continue to play it to this day.  I hope that even with the passing of this Bill that the vast majority of the missions we will be engaged in will be peacekeeping missions.  I fear the trend is otherwise.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a view abroad that to sort out the natives you send in warships. It is believed that they must be forced to come around the table as they do not know how democracy works and the way to do that is to eliminate the hard-nosed individuals, whether they be criminals, recalcitrant politicians of one kind or another.  That is a detectable trend at present.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the US wanted to go into Bosnia-Hercegovina in the same &ldquo;gung ho&rdquo; style as if entered Iraq and engage in what it defined as surgical strikes.  I think it is time that the media in this country as well as everywhere else refused to use blatantly distorted language and terminology to describe missiles and bombs. They have no surgical precision whatsoever and there have been plenty of studies since the Gulf War to show that a very small percentage of the so-called &ldquo;precision bombs&rdquo;, actually hit the intended targets in Iraq.  That point needs to be addressed and should not be ignored by this country.  Language has a very important role to play in the media, particularly when sound bites are the order of the day.  They have a very important role in either winning support for or engendering opposition to the direction of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>We have sufficient examples of this in Northern Ireland where language is used by one side in a particular way and by the other in a different way.  When Provisional Sinn Féin talk about a shoot-to-kill policy, we all know there is no such thing as a shoot-to-kill policy by either the British or Irish Government but <Col N="689" /> because of the way certain troops reacted to particular incidents it was a good propaganda exercise for the Provisionals to claim a shoot-to-kill policy.  That then became common currency and it was an easy hook to hang campaigns on.  It is important that this area is addressed. That broadly covers the three amendments I have tabled.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister virtually made no argument whatever for a change in our law in the general way it is being proposed here.  He argued that we should send 80 troops to Somalia as a transport unit under UNOSOM II.  He stressed the moral argument that it was the right thing to do and we would be turning our backs on the aid organisations which we had a duty to protect, if we did not do so.  I would not object to Irish troops protecting the aid agencies but I think we have to draw a distinction between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  Irish troops are known around the world as peacekeepers and although it is argued that they will not be directly involved in combat operations they may be deployed to enforce a particular rule of law in Somalia.  Taking active aggressive steps to ensure that that is the case is different from the physical protection of aid workers and the civilian population and the right to defend oneself in any given situation.  These are the general points I wish to make in relation to the three amendments I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope we will be able to get through all the amendments. In reply to some of the points made by Deputy De Rossa, all of us feel uncomfortable about this whole new departure into peace-enforcement but we have to look at the situation and, on balance, given proper protection and taking proper precautions in relation to the role of the Dáil for the right to review each mission on a regular basis, we can manage to keep an eye on things to the extent that we will not go far beyond the role of peacekeeping.  That is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the Gulf War but what must be said also is that Iraq invaded a very small country, <Col N="690" /> Kuwait.  For a small country like Ireland it is important that there should be people around who would say &ldquo;You are not going to do that.  We will not tolerate that&rdquo;.  A small country like Ireland could not afford to defend itself against any invasion.  We need co-operation from partners within the UN, which is the world organisation, to protect big and small, but particularly the small.  The big powers will always be able to look after themselves.  If we do not keep the US within the main structures of the UN there is a danger that they will take their own action and that is not in anybody's interest.  As I said last night, Ireland, as a small country, has a very important role to play in the UN to make certain that no one power or bloc controls the decision-making process.  As a small country we can play a major role in insisting that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that the structures of the UN need reviewing.  It is time we had a look at those structures and whether an African country is a permanent member of the Security Council or a small country will always be a member.  There are many good things to be said about that. Equally, one has to be practical and realistic and make certain that the big powers are also tied in so that they will not take their own action.  As a small country we can have a major influence in the decision-making process and we should never lose sight of that.  For that reason I will not be supporting these amendments as I think it would be unwise to do so.  One is better off in there arguing the point and trying to persuade people to one's way of thinking rather than be in a position where one could force others to take decisions without consulting the wider group.  On balance, it is always better to be in there and have an influence on the decisions instead of sitting outside the door sulking.</P>
    <P>I accept that peace enforcement is a new departure for this country.  There is a danger that it may go too far.  I do not condone the action of the US in terms of the retaliatory action taken in firing Tomahawk missiles on Baghdad last Saturday, but I would not allow a situation <Col N="691" /> to develop where people would forget that a small country like Kuwait was invaded.  There will be times when people will be unreasonable and persuasion will not work.  We have heard and read about the terrible atrocities that took place in Kuwait during its invasion and occupation by Iraq.  We should not forget that women and children were mistreated, that women were raped and killed.  It is not all wrong on one side but at the same time if something goes wrong on the side we are supporting we should not be afraid to say we do not agree with it and we should play an active role in insisting it does not continue.  For those reasons I will not be supporting the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night &mdash; and I will say it again &mdash; that this is the minimum response on the part of Ireland to this situation.  The UN operation force in Somalia will be in the order of 28,000 strong so far as troops are concerned. We are contributing 80 members of the Defence Forces to a transport contingent. The whole emphasis in the future so far as the United Nations is concerned, with the ending of the Cold War and the removal of the ideological divide down the middle of the Security Council, will be on enforcing the peace.  Up to now our troops have gone out on purely police missions and have been deemed to be such, acting in operations of a police character under the 1960 Act.  Under the provisions of this Bill they are going as members of the Defence Forces acting in a military capacity in a transport contingent dealing in a logistical way with military operations to enforce the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is part not of a new innovation but is part of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to which we adhered from the very day we agreed to join the United Nations.  Chapter VII could not be implemented until now because of the divide down the middle in the Security Council where they were unable to agree on the necessary measures required to enforce collective security.  The concept of collective security is one to which we have always adhered.  We adhered to it <Col N="692" /> in the old days of the League of Nations when Eamon de Valera voiced that opinion on numerous occasions in the thirties.  We have adhered under the Helsinki agreement to collective security under the CSCE, east and west in Europe.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked for the first time to make effective a provision that has existed since the formation of the United Nations but defunct because of the divisions in the Security Council.  We are now asked to contribute in this minor capacity by providing 80 members to a transport contingent.  When one looks at it in that context one sees the reality of the matter.  It is further safeguarded by the provision that every decision by the Government where over 12 members are involved in such an operation in the future, must come by resolution to this House.  That is still the law and is an ample safeguard.  Every operation of any consequence has to be scrutinised in the House and the Minister has to answer for the details and the mandate of the particular operation.  It is important to remember that all these operations differ.  If one goes across the world and looks at all the troubled areas the type of operations required in each case are different and vary to an amazing degree. It is important that that provision stands. The Minister of the day must come into the House and say the troops are needed for a particular operation, explain what is involved and make his case here.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in Deputy Barrett's suggestion that we could possibly have a review provision written in a later amendment.  Perhaps a procedure of that kind would be useful.  The concept of enforcement of collective security is fundamental to the core of what the United Nations is about.  If the UN is not to degenerate into a futile talking shop it must have this type of power and bring into operation Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which has been defunct since the forties because of the divisions in the Security Council.  I sympathise with Deputy De Rossa's views on the need to reform the composition of the Security Council.  The arrangements whereby <Col N="693" /> Britain and France carry the vote on their own on the Security Council is no longer relevant in a modern world.  We now have a new global power structure which incorporates China, India, the European Community as one power &mdash; including Britain, France, Germany and other members &mdash; the United States and Japan. Those countries should be part of a newly composed Security Council, but the Security Council must remain an implementing executive of the United Nations.  I can think of no greater recipe for either anarchy or non-decision than a system which would give the entire power in respect of directing operations to the United Nations, as Deputy De Rossa suggests in his amendment.  That would mean that 180 nations spread across the globe, with many diverse and differing interests, would be the decision making body in regard to operations enforcing the rule of law.  That would be totally ineffective.</P>
    <P>The United Nations General Assembly is basically a debating chamber and plays a role in that respect; but it is not a decision making body and by its very nature can never be one.  Under the Charter, the Security Council is a decision making body; and Deputy De Rossa is seeking to delete from section 1 the provision whereby the Council is the effective decision-making executive directing the operations of the United Nations. That cannot be done and anyone who gives the matter serious consideration will realise that.  Hopefully, with the assistance of Deputy De Rossa and others on the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, we will be able to examine the structure of the United Nations and suggest reforms in that regard.  There is a case for reforming the structure and composition of the Security Council, but we must have an executive head of the United Nations that can make decisions, implement them and ensure they are carried out.  The operation proposed by Deputy De Rossa could not be even thought up, not to mention executed, by the United Nations if the General Assembly was acting as the directing force.  That would be similar to a Parliament <Col N="694" /> trying to govern a country without a government, for want of a better analogy.  In effect, the Security Council is the government as far as the executive actions of the United Nations are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's proposal to delete from section 1 of the Bill the provision relating to the Security Council is not a sensible one.  The section, as it is worded, is excellent.  Above all, it provides that we take our rightful place with other countries within the framework of enforcing collective security.  For the first time our military personnel, in whatever role they may play, will act as professional soldiers, which they are well capable of doing because of the magnificent professional expertise which exists in the Irish Defence Forces as a whole.  Members of our Defence Forces are capable of carrying out whatever professional role is allocated to them.  In this case they will have the role of acting as a logistical transport contingent.  Certain caveats must be applied to Deputy De Rossa's proposal.  It is important that all operations carried out by our Defence Forces are under the command of the United Nations and this is something we should insist on in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a minimum response to the crisis in Somalia.  The Irish Army and any other unit of our Defence Forces which may be required for such duties will prove themselves to the hilt, as they have done in the past. They will be proud to carry out the role allocated to them by the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many points have been put forward in relation to the amendments tabled by Deputy De Rossa.  It must be said that the tenor of this discussion is more appropriate to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which Deputy Lenihan is chairman.  Nevertheless, on the basis that these matters have been raised in the context of the Bill before us, I have no difficulty in discussing them; but if I go outside my remit in regard to Defence matters, Members will have to forgive <Col N="695" /> me, as it will not be my intention to do so.  However, I do not wish to avoid answering any questions.</P>
      <P>On that basis I will launch into a response to the matters raised by Deputies De Rossa, Barrett and Lenihan.  I sympathise with Deputy De Rossa's views, in particular those relating to the Security Council.  The point made by Deputies De Rossa and Lenihan in that regard is a fair one.  The Security Council may be in need of reformation in that the balance of power, population and input lies between the existing permanent members of the Security Council &mdash; the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom and Russia.  A case could be made for the addition of other countries, including an African country or countries.  Countries such as Japan and India could be considered also, and I support Deputy Lenihan's view in regard to encapsulating the Twelve European Community countries under the style or title of &ldquo;The European Community&rdquo; on the Security Council.  Deputy Lenihan made a worth while point in that regard.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am not out of sympathy with Deputy De Rossa's amendments, particularly his first one.  In reality the United Nations is made up of 180 nations. While we await the reformation of the Security Council or the United Nations we must follow the rules and regulations of the United Nations as presently constituted. On those grounds alone Deputy De Rossa's amendment cannot be accepted, apart from our wish to have the headquarters of the United Nations taken out of New York.  Why should it not be regionalised, with its headquarters based in other continents of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made available to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security a booklet entitled <i>An Agenda for Peace</i> by Boutros Boutros Ghali and a great deal of its content would need to be addressed in the context of the formation of the United Nations.  The United Nations, like any other body, cannot remain static. It is the successor to the League of Nations, an organisation which died on the vine because of its inability to do the <Col N="696" /> very thing we are now seeking to do under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter of 1945.  Of course the United Nations, set up in 1945 just after the Second World War is a long time in being.  It may be said, in support of Deputy De Rossa's point, that it does need to move with the times, that it needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa quite properly and fairly addressed the Foreign Affairs Committee before which was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Last night the Deputy addressed me in my capacity as Minister for Defence and he addressed me again this evening.  He will now have a fourth or fifth opportunity of raising the issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he comes into the House to give effect to the resolution required under section 2 of the 1960 Act.  I sympathise with the point of view expressed by Deputy De Rossa, but in the present circumstances I cannot accept his first amendment as proposed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of East Timor.  I have supported an organisation in this city which supports the right of the East Timorese to their independence and I take the view that the Indonesians have a lot to answer for on that account.  The East Timorese should be supported as part of our foreign policy and as part of the direction in which our country should be going in the context of our membership of the United Nations. However, this is not proper to me but to another Minister on another occasion and at another time.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 2 again, we in this country are seeking to preserve and restore the peace.  That is the reason we are going into Somalia.  However, as there is no peace in Somalia we have to recreate peace there.  The country must start from the beginning and we are seeking to bring that about by maintaining a presence of a minimum of 80 men, a gesture in the context of 28,000 troops being there.  We are going in, we hope to help return Somalia to peace and build the country up by setting up a police force and supporting the ongoing efforts of the aid agencies in recreating the schools, by <Col N="697" /> ensuring that the community is weaned, as it were, off its dependency and is returned to normality in the context of its agronomy &mdash; its horticulture and agriculture. Crops will be ready for taking in the next few months.  These are the hopeful signs that the United Nations hope to build on.</P>
    <P>In supporting the views in a general way I addressed the timescale that the United Nations hope to operate in Somalia. I addressed the issue with Admiral Jonathan Howe, Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali's representative in Somalia.  His assessment of the situation, which I am not certain I would agree with, is that the United Nations would aim to leave Somalia within a period of two years and that there would be democratic elections within the next year or two.  I am not certain that that will happen either, although I would like to think it will.</P>
    <P>I would like to think also that Somalia will be returned to the Somalians so that the Somali people will be the masters of their own destiny sooner rather than later.  That is what the United Nations seeks to achieve, whether in a peacekeeping or a peace making role.  One has to take the conditions of Somalia as one finds them.  Today's terrorist can be tomorrow's leader of a country.  There is a strong point of view among the nongovernmental organisations that General Aideed should not be taken into custody but should be brought back into the fold of the democratic process and not described as a war lord.  The reality is that in their fight against General Bir, General Aideed and his former Coalition partner, Mr. Ali Mahdi, split and what they did to the country was quite indescribable. It is obscene in its context. They devastated the country and left it in a shambles, left the people starving and dying in their hundreds of thousands. There is a question about whether the country should be handed over to those people.  The whole purpose of the United Nations in Somalia is to preserve or restore the peace, bearing in mind that at the moment there is very little peace there except in isolated pockets.  Consequently <Col N="698" /> I cannot see the need to accept the Deputy's not unreasonable statement.</P>
    <P>The third amendment is to insert, after &ldquo;the United Nations&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;but excludes a force or body approved by the Security Council of the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo;.  I am not certain that I can accept that point of view.  The effect of the amendment would be to expressly exclude participation by Ireland in a force approved by the United Nations as distinct from one established by that organisation.  Since the Bill now before the House is clearly concerned with United Nations missions only and refers to forces established by the United Nations, my respectful suggestion to the Deputy is that he might withdraw his amendment on the basis that it is not necessary in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let me reflect once more in a general way on my views of the not unreasonable thoughts that gave rise to these amendments. The effect of amendment No. 1 would be to restrict Irish participation in United Nations peacekeeping to missions established by the United Nations General Assembly alone.  It simply would not be possible to depend on the General Assembly to give us a mandate.  As to whether the Security Council should be extended or retained in its present form is a matter for debate on another occasion.  At least it is as an executive, with a managing role and is a neater operation in terms of size than the amophorous mass of the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The amendment is unrealistic since all such missions are now established by the Security Council.  It would effectively deny the Council's role as set out in Article 24 of the United Nations Charter whereby the Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  If I were to accept this amendment it would mean that the Government would be precluded from responding favourably to requests from the United Nations to participate in peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions established by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> of all United Nations <Col N="699" /> missions is in part to preserve or restore peace.  The amendment seeks to anticipate United Nations mandates and circumscribe the type of operations in which Ireland could participate.  This is contrary to the thrust of the Bill.  In the circumstances I cannot agree to it.  I understand the philosophy behind the amendment and I have sympathy with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ireland's participation in the United Nations mission, this will involve a transport unit going to Somalia in a non-military role.  The personnel will be provided with small arms protection. Thirty transport vehicles will be sent and the cost of the mission will be $2.7 million. The overall cost of Somalian United Nations missions on a 12-month basis will be $1.555 billion.  As Deputy Barrett stated, each mission must be the subject of a resolution of this House.  That is a fail-safe opportunity for this democratically elected assembly to address this issue on each occasion a request is made by the United Nations to create a new mission.  If people have concern in regard to the ability or otherwise of the Minister for Defence of the day at least they have this protection.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that UNOSOM II and the United States have separate mandates, nothing could be further from the truth.  A Turk, named General Bir is the Force Commander. He is supported by Deputy Force Commander, General Thomas Montgomery, of the United States. While there is a large presence of US military personnel there, nevertheless, they come under the control of the United Nations.  They all operate under the same rules and regulations, from the smallest to the largest country, and are bound by the same restrictions, obligations and conditions.  We would all like to think that the 32 national contingents will be bound by the same conditions under the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned the United Nations operation &ldquo;Restore Hope&rdquo; which was under UNITAF.  The original UNOSOM mandate did not get off the ground and, consequently, <Col N="700" /> UNITAF, that is the United Nations task force was established.  That was subsumed by the mandate given under UNOSOM II by the United Nations.  To suggest that there is a distinction and that they have different obligations is contrary to the facts.  UNOSOM took over from UNITAF on 1 May 1993 and the latter is no longer in operation in Somalia.  The United Nations contingent is part of UNOSOM II.  The United Nations role will be mainly peacekeeping and the less peace enforcement there is the better, but it may arise.  Under the circumstances, as I indicated yesterday, I can give assurances but not guarantees as to what might arise from the peace enforcement aspect of the mandate.</P>
    <P>As Deputy De Rossa said, the use of language can be obscene in the context of expressions like &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo; when people turn on their own troops and kill them.  They use this type of formula to test the intelligence of people.  It is an obscenity.  The Deputy's suggestion that my speech yesterday was less than thorough in the context of the United Nations mandate and the use of the 80 man transport unit is contrary to the facts.  The Deputy is entitled to his view but I thought I dealt well with the UN mandate and the conditions under which this small group of courageous Irishmen who will serve the cause of peace in that part of the world will operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested we would be uncomfortable with this legislation.  We are making history in passing this legislation. This is an historic departure for this country.  There are many ways to address this issue on the basis of a principle of review.  Deputies may raise this matter on the Adjournment any evening with the permission of the Chair.  There will be an opportunity also to address it in the debate on the Estimate, by way of Parliamentary Question and within the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  There will be many opportunities to express concerns in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and former Minister for Defence, in his contribution spoke about <Col N="701" /> operating Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter for the first time in a post Cold War world.  Up to now it could not be used and it was not practical to use it.  It is now being used in a collective security context.  He referred to the development of the United Nations, the League of Nations and the CSCE.  The Deputy suggested that if the General Assembly were to give a direction, as suggested by Deputy De Rossa, there would be confusion.  I hope I have responded fully to the points raised.  I remind the House that many of the issues raised are matters for a debate on foreign affairs.  Deputies will have an opportunity of raising many of the issues again in the next few days with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his civil response to the points made.  On other occasions when I raised contrary points of view the responses were not always civil.  Indeed, I accept the genuineness of the Minister's sympathy with the view that the United Nations Security Council is in need of reform. However, sympathy is one thing and action is another, and I am pleased that at least the issue of reform of the United Nations Security Council is now on the agenda of this House.  I am not suggesting that it has not been on the agenda of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am sure it has not been on the agenda of the Department of Defence because, as the Minister said, it does not, strictly speaking, come under that Department. However, in making his case for the reform of this Defence Act the Minister has relied almost totally on the case of sending 80 Irish troops to Somalia and the needs of that country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out that this reform of the Defence Act will be in effect until such time as this House decides to reform it again at some point in the future.  While this change is required to implement the decision to send our contingent to Somalia, nevertheless its effect is much wider than the problems in Somalia.  I have already expressed my concerns in <Col N="702" /> relation to the operation in Somalia.  The Minister has responded to some of those. I am pleased with at least one part of his response &mdash; that he believes the United States is tied into the United Nations command structure and therefore cannot operate unilaterally in relation to what it sees must be done in Somalia.  I hope the Minister is right in this regard. Obviously, we must wait and see if that is the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a small point.  In reading out the list of the participants in UNISOM II, which I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do yesterday at the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Minister conveniently omitted the presence in that list of United States troops. I am not too sure why he did that because he had the list before him.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Minister omitting the reference once but in fact they are listed twice.  First, at point 29, USA, 2,700 and, second, under subtotal &mdash; US quick reaction force, 1,148.  I will raise this point with the Minister when the actual motion for Somalia comes before the House.  The Minister will forgive me if I am suspicious of this approach to what he has referred to as an historic change in our Defence Act and the role of Irish Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett stated that he is uncomfortable with this change in the Act.  I fully accept that.  There is an uncomfortable feel about the fact that we may be making a change in our Defence Act which will involve Irish soldiers in situations which they will not have faced before and which may involve much greater risk.  However, I stated last night that I was not arguing against this change on the basis of risk.  As other Deputies have said, armies take risks; but my fundamental point is how we perceive politically the role of Irish Defence Forces internationally and whether our role should be as peacekeepers or any role that the United Nations may decide through the Security Council, whether <Col N="703" /> reformed or unreformed.  This Bill allows for Irish troops to be involved in virtually any role that the United Nations decides in whatever way it makes that decision. I am arguing fundamentally that at this point in time at least we should retain a role solely as peacekeepers.  I will not rehearse the arguments I have made already in relation to that.  They have been heard frequently from me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may well feel it is a cop out, but a cop out from what?  Does the Deputy believe that the role of the United States has been a correct one in relation to Iraq either recently or in the past?  Was it right in relation to Libya?  Were the United Nations right in relation to the Palestinians or East Timor?  If the Deputy believes that one approach was right, he cannot believe that the other was right also, where there is clear selectivity with regard to how particular crises are dealt with based on the interests of the major power players on the political stage and how they judge their interests at that particular point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a small country and we cannot expect ever to have the same clout as any of the major world powers.  However, we can seek to ensure that the role we play is one which does not exacerbate any given situation and does not reach a point where we find ourselves the pawn in some power play, which can very easily happen in a situation such as this.  By and large we have managed to avoid that as peacekeepers, and it is an insult to the Irish troops who have been involved in peacekeeping since 1958 to say that that role is a cop out.  I fail to understand that kind of thinking.  My view is that our whole approach to international relations should be, as our Constitution says, a <Col N="704" /> pacific approach and a pacific resolution of international crises.  Under our Constitution the role we should play is that of peacekeepers or helping to restore peace. This is a point which will require a considerable amount of debate.</P>
    <P>I take the point the Minister has made in relation to the number of occasions I have had an opportunity to raise the points I am raising.  I would tend to think that if I had not been so awkward in insisting on raising the need for this debate at various points, I may not have had so many opportunities.  However, that is a personal view.</P>
    <P>I intend to finish my remarks in time to allow the other Deputies make their contributions.  I would make the point that I am the only Deputy in this House representing the only party that has serious disagreement with the thrust of the Bill.  Therefore, I hope the House will allow me to avail of the opportunity I have been given to make the points that must be made on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan stated that the 80 troops which we are sending is a minimum response.  I agree with that.  Since the troops involved are in a transport unit as distinct from a front line contingent, this is, as he says, a minimum response. In the debate on the actual motion to send troops to Somalia I may well be making a different case specifically in relation to Somalia.  I have not yet seen the terms of the Somalian motion but, fundamentally the amendment of the Act and my amendments relate to the generality of our approach to international affairs.</P>
    <P>The point has been made in relation to the right to review missions and the Minister has indicated that he believes that is a good idea.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to indicate before the debate ends that he will be accepting or proposing an amendment to provide for such a review.  I would argue equally there needs to be some trigger mechanism to deal with circumstances where the Government intends to increase the size of a mission.  The Bill provides for approval of this House when 12 or more people are being sent abroad on a mission, <Col N="705" /> but no approval is required if fewer than 12 are being sent.  Once the House agrees to the sending of 12 or more people &mdash; in this case the number is 80 &mdash; there is no obligation on the Government to come back to the House to seek approval to increase the number to say, 800.  However I am sure that number would be more than the Defence Forces could send, given the already extended nature of their commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 provides for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically the Deputy is correct in that there is no need to return to the House to seek permission to add to an existing mission.  If that circumstance arises, I, as Minister for Defence, would present a case to the Security Committee or the Dáil.  I would not act by way of subterfuge, without bringing the matter into the public domain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that from the current Minister for Defence. However, the Minister recognises, perhaps more than most, that security of tenure in any given Ministry is not part and parcel of being a Minister.  While the goodwill of the Minister in that regard is taken without question, there is no obligation on future Ministers to do the same.  I have been told that is a matter other Deputies wish to pursue under their own amendments, so I will not pursue it further.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with one of two other points and I am conscious of the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but we are dealing with three amendments in my name and this is an important and historic change in the Defence Act.  It is important that the issues I am raising are teased out.  It is not my fault <Col N="706" /> that time is restricted.  I opposed the application of a guillotine, as did other Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to the point raised by Deputy Barrett that we are better off in there arguing our point.  Of course we are, and there is nothing in the amendments I put forward that would exclude us from making our points.  I am not proposing that we withdraw from the United Nations, rather I am arguing that we should seek a much greater role within the United Nations to have our voice heard more effectively.  Therefore that matter does not arise under the amendments I am proposing.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Barrett about the Kuwait atrocities, of course there were atrocities in Kuwait and the United Nations responded to those by very stringent sanctions and within a very short time with military action.  I am not going to rehearse the debate, but I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that one of the most publicised so-called atrocities &mdash; and I am not referring to all atrocities as so-called &mdash; was of a woman who when interviewed claimed her child had been battered to death in a hospital by Iraqi troops.  Following the war the same women appeared on television stating that no such thing ever happened, that it was a hoax.  Those propaganda exercises take place in time of war.  We have to be very careful about how we respond and the views we take in terms of justifying actions without having the full facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Lenihan about the Irish Army being professional and well capable of dealing with whatever they are faced with, I have no doubt whatsoever about the professionalism of the Irish Army or the role they play in whatever circumstances they find themselves. I am certain that whatever this House decides they should do, they will gladly do with utmost professionalism and loyalty.  Again, that matter is not at issue.  I am trying to make a political case in regard to the Irish role and how we use our Irish troops internationally. Whatever the circumstances in which Irish troops find themselves, they are our <Col N="707" /> responsibility in the first instance, not that of the soldiers on the ground or their immediate superior officers.  They are placed in those circumstances by a political decision, and that is what my argument is about.</P>
    <P>I would take up the point raised by Deputy Lenihan, and indeed by the Minister, about the General Assembly and the fact that it is ludicrous to expect that the United Nations General Assembly would make a decision or would be capable of making a decision.  The Bill refers to a decision made by the Security Council or the General Assembly.  It provides for the fact that the General Assembly may make decisions in relation to missions in which we would be involved.</P>

      <P>I am not making the case for a total review of the United Nations.  If I put forward a ten page amendment outlining the reforms of the United Nations I would like to see, I am sure it would be ruled out of order.  I have to deal with this matter in the best may possible in order to generate the debate about the issue.  Of course 180 members meeting in a crisis may be able to make only a general decision, but the role of the Security Council as manager of that decision would then come into play.  It is a mistake to rule out the possibility that the General Assembly may have a decision-making role&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will appreciate that I am being antagonised by the impatient Deputies on my left.</P>
      <P>The Minister addressed my three amendments and argued that amendment No. 1 was more appropriate to a foreign affairs debate.  I would have a certain sympathy for that view but for the fact that we are amending the Defence Acts to provide for the involvement of Irish troops.  Inevitably the foreign affairs issue has to be addressed when changing our Defence Acts to incorporate a decision made by a future Government. It is impossible to keep the international and political dimensions to this decision out of this debate.  I could understand that if the Minister was proposing an interim arrangement to facilitate the sending of troops to Somalia but we are being asked to make a wide-ranging change in the role of our Defence Forces. Inevitably the wider implications of that have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he supports the case of the people of East Timor.  I knew that and I welcome that support.  Indeed, in a debate in the foreign affairs committee this afternoon the committee indicated its support.  My point in raising that issue was to highlight the selective way international questions of aggression are dealt with and the different levels of reaction or retaliation. Despite the fact that the invasion of East Timor took place in 1975 neither the UN nor anybody else has applied one sanction against Indonesia.  Yet, we have all sorts of other reactions by the UN to other acts of aggression and invasion.  The selectivity of the Security Council is one of the reasons I am seeking to have that arrangement deleted from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second amendment the Minister referred to the preservation and restoration of peace and made the point that there is no peace in Somalia.  That is true by and large although there are areas where the level of violence is not so great. Indeed, the Minister pointed out last night that in Baidoa where the Irish <Col N="711" /> troops are going the risk is not as great as it is in Mogadishu.  I would draw the Minister's attention again to the fact that this Bill is not solely addressed to Somalia. My point is a general one in relation to the Defence Acts, that Irish troops should be used solely for the preservation and restoration of peace.  In promoting the change the Minister should have addressed the wider implications of the change in the Acts rather than relating it solely to Somalia.  The Minister made a strong case for sending troops to Somalia but the change in the Bill does not relate solely to Somalia.  I simply draw the Minister's attention to that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that amendment No. 3 is not necessary.  To some extent that amendment is more important than No. 1.  The Minister argues that the word &ldquo;established&rdquo; in that section clearly implies that Irish troops will be involved only in missions which are directly under the control of the UN as distinct from missions which are approved by the UN and carried out by a member state or a group of member states.  The UNITAF mission, for instance, was approved by the UN to be carried out by the US.  That mission was established on the offer of the United States.  The distinction between &ldquo;approved&rdquo; and &ldquo;established&rdquo; is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give some clear definition of what &ldquo;established&rdquo; means.  I understand that the Minister said it means precisely that the Irish Army will only be involved in missions directly controlled and under the leadership of United Nations forces established by the United Nations and not in missions allocated to a member state or group of member states, for instance the CSCE, the Western European Union or NATO.  I will accept the Minister's assurance on that point.  I tabled the amendment to get that assurance from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he cannot accept amendment No. 2 as it would circumscribe the purpose of the Bill.  Without doubt, it would, because I am seeking to restrict the role in which Irish Forces <Col N="712" /> will be involved to one of restoration or preservation of peace where as this Bill seeks to provide a general power, unrestricted in any way except by motion passed by the House subsequently in regard to any mission.</P>
    <P>If the Minister replies to the points I made I will promise other Deputies that I will not seek to contribute again on my three amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that as far as one could satisfy a Deputy who does not agree with the Minister, I had done so. On the word, &ldquo;established&rdquo;, I can assure the Deputy that this does not differ to any great extent from the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, the Long Title of which is as follows:</P>
      <P>An Act to authorise, subject to the previous approval of Dáil Éireann in certain circumstances, the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State with international forces established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations for the performance of duties of a police character ...</P>
      <P>The additional ingredient in this Bill is to extend the area of service of certain members of the Permanent Defence Force by amending the Defence Act, 1954 in certain respects and provide for other related matters.  As far as this Bill is concerned, that is basically extent.  In the circumstances I can give the Deputy the assurance, as far as I can, that he seeks.</P>

    <P>(2)  The Authority conferred by a resolution of Dáil Éireann under section 2 (1) of the Act of 1960, shall lapse and cease to have effect on the day that is 6 months after its passing, unless another resolution shall previously have been passed extending that Authority for a further period not exceeding 6 months.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any resolution extending the authority conferred by a resolution under section 2 (1) of the Act of 1960 may itself be extended in like manner for a further period not exceeding 6 months.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the Authority conferred by a resolution of Dáil Éireann under section 2 (1) of the Act of 1960 or of any resolution extending such authority passed under subsections (2) and (3)  of this section has expired, the Minister shall take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure the repatriation as soon as reasonably <Col N="715" /> practicable, of any members of the Permanent Defence Force serving outside the State in pursuance of the expired authority.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where there has been any significant change in the matters set out in the memorandum required by subsection (1), the Minister shall notify the members of Dáil Éireann in writing of such change by laying an amended memorandum before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where an amended scheme has been laid before Dáil Éireann under subsection (5) of this section, it shall be lawful for Dáil Éireann within 21 sitting days by resolution to rescind any resolution made under section 2 (1) of the Act of 1960, in which case the provisions of subsection (4) of this section shall apply to any contingent despatched.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have tabled this amendment because we believe that section 2 (1) of the 1960 Act, which was enacted to facilitate peacekeeping, would be much too wideranging for peace enforcement missions, when one could envisage the position in Somalia escalating into something similar to the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes two principal changes.  The first is that a memorandum be laid before Dáil Éireann setting out the basis of the United Nations mission, the size and type of force to be formed, giving a clear indication of who will have overall military control of the United Nations forces; and an exposition of the actual mandate to ensure clarity of the purpose of the mission, its objective and the circumstances in which it would be deemed to have been completed.  We consider it important that participating countries should have some idea of the expected duration of any mission and the arrangements for its financing. In the past difficulties have arisen in the case of peacekeeping missions in all of these areas.  Obviously, it will be of greater importance that such issues be <Col N="716" /> clarified when the more difficult role of peace enforcement is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The other principal proposal in this amendment is the requirement that the Dáil should have the opportunity to review the position every six months to coincide with the rotation of each contingent, which has been the case with UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the first mission the Irish troops will be expected to undertake following passage of this Bill will be that in Somalia.  Therefore, it is important that there be a clear understanding beforehand regarding the United Nations mandate governing the UNOSOM II troops in Somalia and the mandate governing the United States peacekeeping mission in Somalia, the level and type of co-ordination existing between United States and UNOSOM II troops.  For example, to what extent do United States and UNOSOM II troops operate jointly and what command and control procedures prevail?  Do they operate jointly under United States command and how does that affect the UNOSOM II mandate?</P>
    <P>Politically it is important that the role and objective of United States troops in Somalia be clarified.  During the Gulf War the perception was that United States troops operated under a United Nations flag, but in reality they were controlled by the Pentagon and the United Nations was used to legitimise its activities. Consequently, troops from other nations could be caught up in activities which might not be in the strategic interests of the United Nations.  In addition, it is important that the objectives of the United Nations and the United States in Somalia be known.  It is of equal importance that the strategy used to achieve such objectives be known.  For example, is it proposed to establish a political infrastructure in Somalia and, if so, how is such to be achieved? Is it intended to withdraw forces when political stability has been restored and relief agencies can function in safety?  If that is the case then a strategy to achieve those objectives must be accompanied by a plan of implementation which must <Col N="717" /> include target dates and a definite timetable.</P>
    <P>It is essential that my amendment be accepted as it provides that all these matters be clearly explained and placed before the Dáil before any decision is taken to participate in a peace enforcement mission and, in addition, it enables the Dáil to review the position regularly. I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In these amendments I am endeavouring to make it clear that the Dáil makes a distinction between peace-enforcement and other activities carried out by our troops on behalf of the United Nations.  The 1960 Act was passed to allow us provide troops to take part in peacekeeping missions but this is a new departure.  In amendment No. 8 I am attempting to make a clear distinction between peacekeeping and peace-enforcement and asking that each resolution should be debated in the Dáil be it for ten troops or 80 troops provided they will be involved in peace-enforcement. In other words, the Dáil would be afforded a further opportunity to debate the issue of peace enforcement.  It could be argued that this is provided for in section 2 of the 1960 Act but I am trying to make a distinction given that this is a new departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 9 I am trying to cover the points I made on Second Stage. At this point we should forget about Somalia. To date the discussions have centred on the provision of 80 troops to serve there but this Bill will still be on the Statute Book long after we have left this House.  This legislation will enable the Government of the day to make a <Col N="718" /> decision as to whether Irish troops should engage in peace-enforcement in any dispute in any part of the world.  Therefore, many of us on this side of the House are endeavouring to forget about Somalia for the moment.  The issue is not whether we will be asked to send more troops to Somalia in six months time; we can debate that issue when the motion relating to the request to provide 80 troops is presented to the Dáil next week.  Because this legislation will apply when it comes to making decisions about whether we should send troops to Bosnia, Somalia and so on the House should be given opportunity to debate each request separately to review the position after a period of 12 months and decide whether it should continue to support the cause or withdraw.  While this may be cumbersome for the Government of the day this is what parliamentary democracy is all about.  I appeal to the Minister and the House to support the principle I am trying to establish.</P>
    <P>I note that in their amendments the Progressive Democrats are suggesting a period of six months but I think that this may be too short.  I would respectfully suggest that it would be better to select a period of 12 months.  I do not mind, however, if the House opts for a period of six months provided it is given an opportunity to debate the issue.  I appeal to the Minister to afford the House an opportunity to review, renew or cancel a previous decision in respect of a particular request from the United Nations to provide troops for a peace-enforcement mission given this concept is in its infancy.</P>
    <P>As there is a major difference between a request to provide a transport company and a request to provide a combat unit, we should watch carefully the way in which the United Nations approaches the question of peace-enforcement.  Having listened to the Minister and received assurances, I am satisfied that the 80 troops in the transport company who will go to Somalia will be protected in so far as is humanly possible.  I am also satisfied that the Minister has outlined the duties they will be asked to perform.  I hope they <Col N="719" /> will receive the support of the United Nations commander in charge.  The Minister cannot do any more than this.</P>
    <P>As I said this legislation will apply not only to the request to provide these 80 troops in the transport company but also to many other requests.  For this reason the Government and the House would be wise to watch carefully the way in which this issue is approached both now and in the future and we should always reserve the right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As I said on Second Stage, if it had been a soldier wearing a blue berét who fired the Tomahawk missile which killed six civilians in Baghdad, the moral authority of the United Nations would have been seriously affected.  There is a danger that people will become trigger happy.  While I am not happy with the position in which the Pakistanis find themselves in Somalia, I am happy that we as a country will play our part in getting people back on the rails.  We should ensure that the reputation of the United Nations will not be destroyed and lose its moral authority.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen carefully to what the Progressive Democrats are saying and note what I am endeavouring to do in amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  If the Minister were to accept my amendments, future Governments would be answerable to this House.  This would be a good thing because they would be conscious that they are answerable to this House but they could go away knowing that they had received its support after the matter had been debated.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the thrust of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments under discussion are of enormous importance to those who will serve under the flag of the United Nations in the future.  Because of the changes proposed in this legislation my party and I, as a former Minister for Defence, are of the view that it is absolutely essential that safeguards are provided to ensure that there is transparency in regard to the commitments that this country will give when it agrees to participate in peace-enforcement missions <Col N="720" /> with the United Nations in the future.  The time allocated for this debate has been used up in discussing amendments which related more to foreign affairs matters than to defence matters but these amendments are crucial to protect the welfare of the men who will serve this country abroad.</P>
      <P>There should be no doubt that under this legislation members of the Irish Defence Forces working under the United Nations flag in other countries will be putting their lives much more at risk than has been the case up to now. We cannot afford to accede to requests unless we are absolutely certain about every aspect of the mission.  There is only one way in which we can do this, that is to bring the request before the House so that the elected representatives of the people can decide whether it wants the men and women of its Defence Forces to serve on peace-enforcement missions in various trouble spots throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflicts in some areas can deteriorate overnight.  That is why we proposed a period of six months&mdash;contingents have a six month tour of duty.  I do not have time to go through all the reasons the Minister should accept our amendment and I am anxious to hear his response.  I hope he will move away from the usual Civil Service-Government response to matters of this kind, for example, &ldquo;These matters are safe in our hands.  We will make the decisions; we have made these decisions in the past&rdquo;. Our Defence Forces have not been engaged in peace-enforcement duties in the past.  There was some confusion in the past as to the role of our Defence Forces and whether the mandate was being fulfilled or exceeded in certain areas.  This is a very important point.  I hope the Minister will say he has studied the amendment, he understands the point made by us and he is prepared to accept the amendment or alternatively, he accepts its intent and will bring <Col N="721" /> forward his own amendment on Report Stage.</P>

I wish to refer briefly to these amendments and comment on what I perceive to be a degree of arrogance on the part of some Deputies in regard to the earlier amendments which relate directly to this Defence Bill before us.  The fact that that also relates to the Foreign Affairs was not of my making; it is due to the nature of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a good amendment and I hope the Minister can see his way to accepting it.  I would be particularly anxious to see the implementation of the procedure set out in the amendment. The committee which have been established would be a good means for ensuring that there is adequate debate by the House in advance of a decision being made to accede to a request.  It is particularly important that we have a clear understanding of the mandate of the force, given that Resolutions passed by the United Nations in recent years have not been at all clear.  Despite the fact that the Gulf War ended, in theory at any rate, in 1991, the United States saw fit to launch a further attack in 1992 under the mandate passed in 1991.  It is important that we clearly understand the mandate when we are requested to send troops abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of Deputy Clohessy's amendment, which is similar to Deputy Barrett's amendment.  Of the two periods proposed, I think a 12 month review would be the proper approach in all the circumstances. Having studied the amendments with the experts from the <Col N="722" /> parliamentary draftsman's office I have formulated an amendment.  While this amendment does not encapsulate all that Deputy Clohessy's amendment seeks to achieve, much of the information sought in his amendment can be obtained during the debate on the resolution which will be brought before the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I understand that his proposals were addressed in a general way by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett that we are not necessarily talking about Somalia in the context of his amendment.  His amendment would cover both upcoming and future missions.  The period of six months proposed in Deputy Clohessy's amendment is too short.  The 12 month period proposed by Deputy Barrett would be more appropriate in the circumstances. With this in mind, I have formulated an amendment which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4.  &mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the 1st day of January in each year beginning with the year 1994, make a report to Dáil Éireann on the operation in the preceding year of section 2 of the Act of 1960 and Dáil Éireann may by resolution approve of the report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not cover all of Deputy Clohessy's proposals, particularly his proposal that a memorandum should be brought before Dáil Éireann. That is a very general requirement.  The information sought in section 2 (1) of the Deputy's amendment will be made available under the relevant resolution. This has been the position in regard to several missions undertaken down through the years.  To my knowledge, it has never been suggested that the information forthcoming on missions was inadequate.  All the information required in Deputy Clohessy's amendment is in the public domain and I am not sure that we should write it in stone.  The information sought by Deputy Clohessy <Col N="723" /> was considered yesterday by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in the context of UNOSOM II.  Arrangements are being made to debate the resolution on UNOSOM II next week.</P>
    <P>I believe my amendment will give the House an opportunity each year to debate overseas military commitments.  This would go some way towards meeting the demands of Deputy Clohessy on the one hand and Deputy Barrett on the other.  Deputy Clohessy's amendment is far reaching and general and I ask him to withdraw it on the basis of the undertakings I have given.  As Deputy Molloy said, he was Minister for Defence. Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Defence and I will be a former Minister for Defence one day.  I cannot go any further in this regard.  I should like to hear the Deputy's response to my amendment.</P>

      <P>We will try to oblige everybody by keeping our contributions short.</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Bill stems from issues which arose in the context of prosecutions for drink-driving offences.  The issues relate to the form in which the register of medical practitioners was maintained by the Medical Council under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, and the certification procedures arising from that.  I have been advised that it is proper to amend, by way of this Bill, some provisions in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, and the Road Traffic (Amendment) <Col N="726" /> Act, 1978, to ensure that their provisions are placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give express authority to the Medical Council to keep the general register of medical practitioners on computer and, also, to give express authority to the registrar of the council to issue certificates attesting to matters contained in the register.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978, to extend the presumption that certain persons are registered medical practitioners to include proceedings where persons are charged with offences of refusing or failing to provide a specimen of blood or urine to a registered medical practitioner. At present, that presumption only applies for the purposes of prosecutions under section 49 or 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  Prosecutions under these sections relate to the offences of driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant or where the blood or urine alcohol level exceeds specified maximum limits.  The amendments contained in the Bill extend the presumption to all circumstances where a person refuses to co-operate in the giving of a specimen of blood or urine.</P>
    <P>Taken as a whole, the Bill seeks to tighten up provisions of both the medical practitioners and road traffic legislation which will assist in road traffic&mdash;and, indeed, in any other&mdash;legal proceedings. The reason for bringing forward amending legislation at this stage is to copperfasten the provision in the Medical Practitioners Act relating to the form of the register and to make suitable provision for certification of entries contained in it.  If left unattended to, these have the possibility for endangering the success of prosecutions for drink driving offences under road traffic legislation.  I have been advised that this matter should be dealt with urgently in association with the Road Traffic Bill which, I understand, will be before the House tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are quite <Col N="727" /> straightforward.  The first part of section 2 gives express authority to the Medical Council to keep the general register of medical practitioners on computer which, in this day and age, I suggest, can only be considered non-controversial.</P>
    <P>The remainder of section 2 (2A), reintroduces a provision that appeared in somewhat similar form originally in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927.  It provides, among other things, that a certificate from the registrar of the council attesting to an entry in the register shall be evidence of the matters attested to unless the contrary is shown.  Apart from any other reason, the certification provision is absolutely vital in the context of the register existing, for all practical purposes, in computerised form.  It is a standard provision in legislation of this and similar kinds where records, written or computerised, are referred to.</P>
    <P>So far as the health professions are concerned, a provision along these lines is included in the Nurses Act and the Dentists Act, both of which date from 1985.  The registrar of the Medical Council has been issuing certificates relating to the registration of doctors since the council commenced operations.  These are required for general certification purposes, such as for employers, for purposes of working abroad, for taking higher level examinations and any number of other reasons.</P>
    <P>In the context of legal proceedings, where the success or failure of a case may depend on the legal status of a certificate issued by the registrar of the Medical Council, it is clear that there can be no room for equivocation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a consequential amendment relating to the computerised form of the register.  Sections 4 and 5 contain the amendments to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Section 4 brings the offence in section 17 of that Act into line with the offences in sections 13 and 14.  It puts beyond doubt that it is an offence to refuse or fail to comply with <Col N="728" /> a requirement of a registered general medical practitioner in relation to the provision of a specimen of urine.  Section 5 extends the presumption that persons are registered medical practitioners to prosecutions for &ldquo;refusal offences&rdquo; under the Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that this short Bill is fundamentally a Bill which simply ensures that a number of issues relating to the general register of medical practitioners is placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the drink driving legislation are repeated in the Road Traffic Bill, 1993, which will come before the House tomorrow and these amendments will only operate pending the enactment of the road traffic legislation.  I am advised that those particular requirements are so urgent that they should be enacted immediately.  They will be overtaken by the Road Traffic Bill when it is debated in Special Committee.  Members will have an opportunity for a broad ranging debate on all aspects of the Road Traffic Bill when it comes before the House tomorrow for Second Stage and will be dealt with in more leisurely detail in the Special Committee in due course. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>First, I want to state my utter dissatisfaction at the manner in which this Bill is being taken tonight. I have no difficulty with facilitating the passage of this legislation in one day. However, it is ridiculous to expect that Dáil Éireann should pass all Stages of a Bill in less than three-quarters of an hour. It is absurd that the Minister should state in his final remarks that Members will have an opportunity during the debate on another Bill to discuss the provision of this Bill.  Is that what the Minister is telling us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions are repeated verbatim in another Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should deal with this Bill on its own merits.  The Minister <Col N="729" /> is asking us to pass legislation here tonight and debate it tomorrow morning under the Road Traffic Bill.  That is outrageous. However, as Members of other parties wish to contribute, I will be suitably restrained.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and accept that it, together with the Road Traffic Bill, is a further example of the will of the Legislature to minimise the number of legal defences, justifiable or otherwise, that may be available to an offender indulging in alcohol and driving a car.  The elimination of loopholes by Parliament reflects the widespread social opposition to drinking and driving that has changed considerably since the introduction of the breathalyser in 1978.  It is no longer socially acceptable to drive a car immediately after the consumption of alcohol and the change in attitude in this regard throughout society is welcome.</P>
      <P>In that context it is appropriate to give credit to the Garda for their vigilance, and positive action and the success of the recent Christmas crackdowns which were carried out in many parts of the country. That has resulted in far fewer drinkers risking life and limb of themselves and others in taking to the roads and, thankfully, far less carnage.  Garda traffic units throughout the country deserve our acknowledgement and appreciation for the reduction on drink driving offences. Statistics clearly show that in spite of a considerable increase in the number of cars on our roads, the courts are dealing with considerably reduced numbers of drink driving cases.  The display of bravado by way of flashing the keys of the car while tanked up at closing time has been replaced by the indignity, stupidity and foolish spectacle of driving a car while under the influence of alcohol. Much credit is due also to many licensed vintners for giving a good example in the area of drink driving by providing alternative modes of transport as well as positively discouraging their patrons from driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribute must be paid also to the medical <Col N="730" /> profession and its contribution to law enforcement.  Without the availability of general practitioners in every part of the city and country our drink driving laws could not be applied and the law would be completely unenforceable.  Driving while drinking is no longer a socially acceptable practice.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Road Traffic Act, 1978, the Supreme Court has in many respects judicially amended the Act by many judgments which are fundamental to the present law.  Although those decisions have little to do with the role of the medical practitioner, it is living proof that both the letter and the spirit of what we as legislators might mean or intend may not be interpreted accordingly by the courts.  That is all the more reason we should have an opportunity of debating this legislation line by line.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us therefore is necessary, as the Minister has stated, first, because of a loophole in the matter of the definition of the medical register and, second, to accord the same burden of proof in cases under the Road Traffic Act, 1978, as exists in cases that have become known as &ldquo;the old section 49&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordinary drunken driving&rdquo;.  The Bill spells out the extended definition of the medical register and clearly establishes the matter of the burden of proof on determining the status of the designated medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for two changes to the Medical Practitioners Act of 1978 and two changes to the Road Traffic Act, 1978.  The Medical Practitioners Act of 1978, and in particular section 26 of this Act, provides for the establishment of a register of medical practitioners and for the issue to every person on this register of a certificate sealed with the seal of the Medical Council as per section 8.  This sealed document may be admitted in evidence and deemed to be in order without proof unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>The Amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act are welcome in that they clarify the confusion that exists at present <Col N="731" /> on the matter of the status of the medical register.  Under the law as it stands the existence of a permanent up to date single register is referred to.  The computerisation of records and data however has rendered the concept of a ledger type register somewhat obsolete.  The definition of the register was amplified and deliberated upon in a 1980 case stated to the High Court entitled <i>Martin v Quinn.</i> In fact the need to change the law in the manner we are doing tonight is indicated by reference to this case, where the defendant in the Garda station questioned the doctor as to his qualifications. Under the law an individual is required to provide a specimen of either blood or urine to a doctor described as &ldquo;a designated registered medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The designation is at the behest of the Garda, while the registration is a matter for the health authorities.  In the Quinn case oral evidence was given in the Circuit Court by the doctor that he was in fact a registered medical practitioner and this was accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of that fact.  This evidence however could have been rebutted by the defendant, but the burden of proof was firmly on the shoulder of the defendant and in the particular case he could not rebut the fact.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that any defendant does however have a fundamental right to ascertain the name of the designated registered practitioner and this is not always observed.  This may be so because the certificate of the doctor will not be available to the defendant before the hearing of the case.  This certificate merely sets out the name and address of the defendant and contains a certificate by the medical practitioner that he either took a specimen of blood or was provided with a specimen of urine.  The doctor signs twice, at the beginning and in the recital at the end.  I recall a Roscommon case where a defendant wished to ascertain the name and address of the doctor and in due course he sought the information from the local superintendent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The information was refused and application was made to the High Court, which duly referred the matter back to the District Court.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper and in keeping with the principles of natural justice that the name of the doctor be known, especially if any point is to be made as to his or her status, be it registered or otherwise.  In practice however the use of this certificate is very limited and it is worth bearing in mind that failure on the part of the doctor to sign the certificate is not fatal to the actual case.  However, the certificate may be of use to the defendant on the basis that the back of the certificate is stamped by the medical bureau, which stamp contains the date on which the sample was received in the bureau.  This indicates the speed with which the analysis was carried out as well as the speed with which the sample was posted from the Garda station, both of which may be fundamental to the action.</P>
    <P>There is one area of concern however on which I would like to hear the views of the Minister and that is the matter of doctors attending, or failing to attend, if a colleague is to be tested.  Recently it has been reported that where a member of the medical profession was taken to a Garda station, having failed a breath test, it proved impossible on the part of the Garda to have a designated medical practitioner attend at the station within the timescale for the purpose of requiring a sample to be taken.  This is an outrageous practice on the part of a small number of members of the profession and if there are no Medical Council Regulations in place to ban this gross abuse the Minister should himself regulate the matter.</P>
    <P>The matter of the existence of the medical register however is important. His Honour, Judge Henchy, while satisfying himself about the oral evidence of the doctor since the doctor was present to give evidence, dealt at some length in the Quinn case with the register itself. While accepting the evidence of the doctor as <i>prima facie,</i> the evidence of <Col N="733" /> the register would have been conclusive, provided of course the register was at the time available.  The judge accepted that the production in evidence of the register in each necessary case was impractical because &ldquo;such prosecutions regularly take place simultaneously throughout the State&rdquo;.  It would of course be quite impossible for the register to be available to every court in every town and even the production and maintenance of copies of an up to date nature would be cumbersome, to say the least.</P>
    <P>In the Quinn case the defence team then contended that it was not sufficient for the doctor to provide evidence as to his qualifications, but further that there was an onus on him to provide evidence that he had recently inspected the register and that his name was contained therein. On this point, thankfully, commonsense prevailed and it was ruled that such evidence would, in effect, be hearsay.  It was also held that expert witnesses who appear in court on a daily basis such as engineers, architects, doctors and accountants must, because of their special qualifications, be treated as competent witnesses without the need for them to carry around their degrees and diplomas in their briefcases.  However, there could well have been problems in cases where the doctor was not in court to prove his qualifications and where the register was, for practical reasons, unavailable.</P>
    <P>This is what I think happened in the Jock Haughey case and which has promoted the Department of Health to close the loophole.  This was a case where there was no register.  A doctor appeared in the Garda station, he was registered and was a designated medical practitioner, however, he did not come to court to prove that point and the case fell.  Section 2 of this Act deals with the form of the register and it is interesting to note that similar provisions were contained in the Solicitors Bill of the last Government which fell on the election.  The Minister <Col N="734" /> also made reference to the Dental Bill and the nurses register.</P>
    <P>Another case which indicated the difficulty was that of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>.  O'Donoghue in 1991. Here a defendant was charged with failing to provide a specimen under section 13 of the Road Traffic Act, 1978.  The case was dismissed in the District Court by the judge on the basis that it had not been proven that the doctor who attended at the Garda station on the night was a designated medical practitioner. However, it was established that he had been introduced to the defendant as, such and, further, that on the date of the case he was a registered practitioner. However, the sequence of events was flawed as there was no proof that on the night in question he was registered.</P>
    <P>It was held by Mr. Justice O'Hanlon that the evidence at the initial hearing was deficient in so far as there was a failure to establish that the witness in question had been a registered medical practitioner at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed and that in the absence of the essential proof &mdash; probably the register &mdash; the District Justice was correct in dismissing the charge. An essential link in the chain of proof that would lead to a conviction was missing. Under the legislation before us, we have ensured that this cumbersome chain of links will no longer be necessary.</P>
    <P>The High Court based its decision on the Quinn case which had established that in order to support a conviction under section 13 (3) of the Road Traffic Act, 1978, it was necessary to prove that the person for whom the defendant had failed to provide a specimen of his urine was in fact a registered medical practitioner. This placed an extraordinary burden of proof on the doctor.  The case against O'Donoghue was dismissed as the necessary level of formal evidence was not provided and there was not sufficient proof at the time of the offence, or in the consequent District Court hearing, that the doctor was registered.  This situation <Col N="735" /> warranted the change we now see in section 5 of this Bill where section 23 of the Road Traffic Act is amended to transfer the burden of proof from the registered medical practitioner to the defendant.</P>
    <P>This has always been the case under the old section 49 and I am glad it has been extended to cover offences under the 1978 Act.  The section sets out that there shall be a presumption that the designated person is a medical practitioner and it is clearly up to the defendant to show otherwise.  It must be remembered that in the O'Donoghue case and in others like it, the clear opinion was formed by the prosecuting garda that the defendant was over the limit, further, that the breathalyser test was failed and that an invitation to provide a specimen was refused.  It is obviously unjust that such persons be acquitted without sanction.  Up to now, the presumption contained in the new section 5 applied only to charges under sections 49 and 50 of the Road Traffic Act.  Thus a failure to provide a specimen or, indeed, a refusal to provide a specimen under sections 13 or 14 of the 1978 Act required specific evidence that the doctor involved was on the register and was a practitioner.</P>
    <P>Because this Bill was so rushed I did not have an opportunity to look at the 1978 Act.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me why were sections 13 and 14 left out in the context of the 1978 Act and yet we could allow the presumption under the old sections 49 and 50.  There must have been a reason.  I would like to know why.</P>
    <P>The extension, by virtue of section 5 of this Act, of section 23 of the Road Traffic Act, 1978, means that it is now no longer necessary for the prosecution to prove that the doctor called to the Garda station by the garda and duly employed for the purposes of obtaining the specimen, is on the medical register. However, it appears that while we are addressing the matter of registration <Col N="736" /> there may, at some future date, be a problem with the designation.  The Bill presumes that a doctor is a registered medical practitioner but the law requires that a specimen be provided to a designated medical practitioner.  There is an onus on the prosecution to show that a particular practitioner was designated to take that specimen.  At present it is assumed that the summoning of the doctor by the garda officer is in essence designation but, in my view, this may be further tested by the courts.</P>
    <P>This essentially technical Bill is welcome in view of the lengths to which defendants have gone, and will no doubt go in the future, to avoid a conviction and automatic loss of licence.  There have been many ingenious defences, carefully designed and delicately crafted.  The extent to which people will proceed to find a loophole must serve as a warning to us as legislators to be vigilant and to amend the law speedily and effectively where necessary.</P>
    <P>I would again counsel caution to the Minister because of the manner in which he proceeded with this legislation.  I fundamentally object to the taking of all Stages of a Bill being taken together.  I have some amendments which I hope we may have time to discuss later.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan's contribution would convince us all that this legislation is complicated.  I am reminded of something that Mr. Peter Sutherland said the other night when talking about GATT matters.  He said that if one is not confused one is not listening properly.  It is very unsatisfactory to have to try to &ldquo;scarper&rdquo; our way through this legislation at 11.30 at night.  The Minister will admit that we have legitimate cause to criticise the Government particularly in regard to what I see as a worrying slippage of parliamentary procedure.  The criticism has focused mainly on the complexity and pure volume of legislation being herded through the House with very little time <Col N="737" /> for any sort of debate and analysis which, as Opposition Deputies, we are entitled to.</P>
      <P>This legislation was published at 5 p.m. this evening and is set to pass all Stages by midnight.  I accept that this was agreed by the Whips, but the Whips found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.  The Whips had to bargain for time on very substantial legislation such as the Defence (Amendment) Bill and the amnesty Bill.  However, that does not mean that this is satisfactory.  I just want to place on record my own and my party's dissatisfaction at the way all the business is being jackbooted through.  This has already been well articulated, but this particular late night special really leaves the other Bills in the shade because it is procedurally suspect.</P>
      <P>Although I understand it is not technically in breach of the Standing Orders, it seems at the very least, irregular that a Bill like this could go on the Order Paper this morning, before it was actually published.  As a new Deputy, I find this a baffling series of events.  The reasons for the stealth and secrecy surrounding this, given to the spokespersons in a private briefing, were that this legislation concerned closing a loophole which could topple prosecutions for drink driving offences and that it was, therefore, undesirable that the press or anyone else in the House should be aware of it. However, as far as I can ascertain from talking to practitioners, this loophole has been well known and used by lawyers over the last couple of years so I really cannot see the point of all this cloak and dagger stuff.  I am certainly uncomfortable with this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an open parliamentary democracy all matters which comes before this House by way of legislation should be open, transparent and a matter of public record and notified to all Members.  It really does fly in the face of the Government's so-called commitment to open Government that we are dealing with this in this way.  We were given a proof of the <Col N="738" /> Bill last week but, until 5 o'clock today, we did not have an explanatory memorandum. I do not think it is regular or in order that legislation should be revealed to only a handful of spokespersons.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is entitled to be notified on all legislation.  The Clerk of the Dáil was in a state of baffled innocence when I spoke to him about this legislation.  That is fundamentally undemocratic and I hope it does not set a precedent as to how the business of the House is dealt with.  The Government should not be in a business of Marcos-style unpublished decrees, even if the motivation is good. The reason for this legislation is well motivated and we support it, but the way in which it has been managed diminishes the role of this House.</P>

      <P>Only an arrogant Government with a huge majority would dare to pull this off.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Medical Practitioners Act and the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.  It updates the position in regard to the keeping of the Register of Medical Practitioners on computer and also provides under section 5 for a fault which arose in the Jock Haughey case and others when the defendant successfully defended a prosecution by the use of a loophole in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978 Act includes a presumption, until the contrary is shown in a prosecution, under section 49 or 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 that certain persons are registered medical practitioners, but it failed to extend the presumption to a circumstance where a person refused to co-operate in the taking of blood or in the provision of a specimen of urine.  That is what happened in the Haughey case and the prosecution case fell.  To alter the law to close that loophole is welcome. However, since the loophole is well <Col N="739" /> known since that case, I am baffled at the seeming need for secrecy on changing it.</P>
    <P>The general evidential matter of proving in court the Register of General Medical Practitioners is also specifically facilitated in this Act.  In the past there were difficulties in regard to proving the register because the register was no longer being kept in the manner envisaged under the legislation.  A practical way around this matter was that a doctor would come along to court personally but as prosecutions under the Act increased and became routine, it was not always practical for a doctor to do so.  I understand that one particular doctor was used in the majority of cases but due to a falling out between the Department and the doctor, that was no longer a reliable way to manage this business.</P>
    <P>This Bill just deals with the evidential problem as it relates to the Register of General Medical Practitioners.  However, I wonder if by raising this problem it casts a doubt over the proving in court of other registers.  I note the Minister referred to other such registers. Does it not raise questions, for example, about the proving of the Register of Veterinary Surgeons or the Register of Solicitors should the need arise?  Is it wise to deal with this evidential problem in a piecemeal way in relation to medical practitioners.  Perhaps it might have been better to encompass such evidential problems relevant to all such registers in separate legislation of general application.</P>
    <P>An amendment I tried to table aimed to help the Bill to survive any constitutional challenge because the retrospective aspects of sections 2 and 3 could possibly render the Bill unconstitutional. This is the type of matter that could be teased out if we had sufficient time to debate it.  Regarding the question of unconstitutionality, I relate that to a case of a person who was convicted before the passing of this Bill and who may now read section 2 and 3 and seek to challenge the prosecution on the grounds that the old <Col N="740" /> legislation was defective as is not evident in this Bill.  That person's constitutional right to do this would take precedence. The amendment I tabled was ruled out of order because it was late, though I would challenge that point even though it was deemed to be late.  It was late because we did not have enough time to prepare for this legislation.  That amendment sought to protect the Minister's Bill from constitutional challenge on the grounds that it retrospectively prohibited such a challenge.  My amendment would not seek to assist such a challenge to a prosecution or a conviction, that it would protect this Act from possibly being held to be unconstitutional.  I objected to the refusal of the Ceann Comhairle's office to accept my amendment on the grounds that it was late.  Technically, I understand an amendment can be tabled after Second Stage and that Stage has not been completed yet.  I would have thought tabling the amendment would have been in order even though there was not sufficient time to circulate the amendments.</P>

I wonder what the position would be if somebody was charged with refusing to provide a sample of urine or blood for an offence which took place before this Bill was passed.  Those are legitimate questions.  They may be faulty but I consider I am entitled to raise them. Having regard to the scheduling of proceedings tonight, I am being denied the opportunity to tease out any doubts I <Col N="741" /> might have.  This matter is being handled in an untidy manner and I note the Minister has said that various sections of the Bill will be repeated tomorrow in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill and there will be more time at that stage for debate, but that does not take from the irregular nature of the procedures relating to this legislation.  I am baffled by all the secrecy and I hope this is not a precedent that will be repeated at any stage in the future.</P>

      <P>I am probably one of the few Deputies &mdash; though Deputy McDaid has had similar experience &mdash; who from time to time has been awakened by gardaí telephoning for a medical practitioner.  This is a subject dear to my heart.  I am appalled that it is now 11.48 p.m. and I am making my contribution at the end of a short and rushed debate. This is not the way that any Bill should be brought to this House.  It is an experience that should never be repeated.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the method adopted by the Minister in relation to this Bill.  A few days ago the other Opposition spokespersons and I were presented with a photocopy of the draft of the Bill and a request was made to the Whips that we not comment on it publicly.</P>
      <P>Unusually, the Bill was not published until this evening.  The reason given was that a court case decision had created a loophole that could be exploited.  We were given the impression that the case was a recent one and that the floodgates would open for quashing drunk-driving cases if news of the Bill leaked out.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I was surprised to discover that the first time a case of this nature was heard was as long ago as 1990. The defendant was a brother of the then Taoiseach, and the loophole in the law &mdash; regarding the admissibility as evidence in a court of computerised records to show that a doctor was a qualified medical practitioner &mdash; was known to the dogs in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive <Col N="742" /> Democrats Government undertook to introduce legislation which would have closed the loophole and promised that it would be published in 1991 and would cover the general point about computerised evidence not just relating to medical practitioners.  There was no secrecy about that commitment.  The flaw in the law was raised repeatedly in the Dáil and was the subject of an Adjournment Debate raised by the former Deputy, Mr. McCartan, when he said:</P>
    <P>We as legislators have failed to act to make prosecutions more simple and relevant.  The absence of a modern criminal evidence Act led to the disgraceful decision in the recent case of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Haughey where a prosecution failed because a doctor was too ill to attend and to attest to his signature on an unchallenged document and to confirm his status as a registered medical practitioner. This weakness in the law was evident long before that case exposed it.  The soft attitude of this House reaches further.  It has the office of the DPP in its grip.  The decisions of our courts again often lack any understanding or comprehension of the extent of the damage and injury caused by these drunk drivers.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that large numbers of defendants have taken advantage of the long gestation period of this very short Bill in order to get off the hook.  It has taken until now, the middle of 1993, for anything to be done about the matter. The Attorney General clearly felt there was no great urgency about it.  Now that action is finally being taken, it takes the form of a short, simple Bill which to my untutored eye does not seem to have required any extraordinary effort by any parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>In retrospect any risk &mdash; and I doubt if there was any risk &mdash; attached to publication would have been worth taking and the Bill should have been published in the normal way.  The failure to do so <Col N="743" /> goes against the essential principles of this House of openness, public accountability, media assessment and public response.  I do not intend to put myself in conflict with those principles again, nor do I wish to find myself in the position I was in yesterday when a highly respected journalist contacted me to find out what was in this Bill.  I was unable to give him the information that I believe he was entitled to because of my undertaking in relation to the Whips.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry earlier referred to the muzzling of greyhounds. We now have an example of TD's being muzzled.  I certainly know how the greyhounds feel.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill, but I find the Minister's approach immensely puzzling and I would wish to hear the reasons why so much secrecy surrounded the publication of a Bill that was well known in advance and which contained nothing new, apart from the fact that it was tackling a problem that has existed for a long time.</P>
    <P>I and my party support the Bill.  It brings up the interesting question of the role of the Minister for Health in regard to road safety.  Unfortunately, I will not have much time to go into that in detail, but it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health to consider that one of the major reasons for death and serious injury in children is road traffic accidents. Even within the figures that relate to the deaths and serious injury of children there is an essential inequality in that poor children have a risk of pedestrian injury three times greater than the less poor.  Census area unemployment has been shown to be strongly correlated with census area child pedestrian injury rates. This has been highlighed by research carried out in England and other countries. That is a point the Minister could take up.  He has responsibility for this Bill before the House today.  I would suggest to him that when he is formulating the national health strategy he mentioned &mdash;<Col N="744" /> he says he is in favour of equality within the health service and I will take him at his word &mdash; part of that strategy could be to include the whole question of road accidents and the inequality inherent in relation to those accidents, namely, that poorer children are more likely to receive serious injuries.  This is the case for a number of obvious reasons, such as parents not having cars to drive their children around or that these children are more inclined to play on the street because they have no playground facilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with one aspect in relation to serious accidents, but it is important to consider other equally lethal factors that kill and maim people, in particular our children.  It would be a good initiative if the Minister for Health set goals to reduce the level of injustice and deaths as part of the health strategy. While it is true that our road deaths are about the middle level within the EC, in regard to pedestrian deaths we have the second highest rate in the EC.  That surely is a cause for concern for any Minister whose brief is to protect the health and wellbeing of our population.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, but I do not agree with the way it was presented to this House.  I wish to record my dismay and dissatisfaction at the unnecessary secretiveness that served no useful purpose but simply set an undesirable precedent which I do not intend to follow in the future.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my support for this Bill and I thank the Minister for sharing some of his time with me. Having taken part in many of these <Col N="745" /> debates in this House late at night, I too only became aware of the content of this Bill quite late.  There is much work to be done in regard to this Bill when we consider it in conjunction with the Road Traffic Act, particularly when we consider that 35 per cent of all fatalities on the road occur between 9 o'clock at night and 3 o'clock in the morning.  It used to gall me at times when I had to get up at night to attend court only to find that because of a brain storm by some district justice, people involved in these accidents were getting off on technicalities because of this loophole in the law.  It leaves much to be desired when the local gardaí are not able to designate a doctor known to them and it is used by some justices to adopt this approach.  I felt annoyed that that loophole existed and I am glad to see that the Minister will address this point.  There are other points which I would have liked to have made if the time was available to me.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the comments made in regard to this Bill.  I am not happy with the time allocated to this Bill.  I have been given three different time slots for this legislation during the course of the last couple of days.  I have as much control over the time allocation as other spokespersons here.  The Whips have been discussing and re-arranging the business up to today and it was re-arranged this morning.  I am as unhappy with the time allocation as anybody else here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple Bill which sets out to achieve very simple objectives.  No Deputy has expressed any opposition to the contents of this Bill.  What most Deputies have raised issue with are first, the lateness of the hour and the confined debate.  I share that view and I wish we had more time.  Second, the implication that a cloak and dagger effort was involved in the introduction of this legislation. There is no cloak and dagger effort involved here.  Some Deputies who <Col N="746" /> spoke do not have a long experience in this House but no precedent has been established in the way this Bill has been handled.  There are many precedents and I will cite them, if Deputies wish, in relation to dealing with issues such as this.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Attorney General that this Bill was necessary and that it was necessary for me to introduce it in advance of the Road Traffic Act, for good reasons.  I accepted the word of the Attorney General.  My staff briefed all the Opposition spokespersons and provided proof copies of the Bill last week so that they would be aware of its content and would be in a position to prepare their contributions.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly it is foolish and unwarranted for comments such as &ldquo;Marcos style decrees&rdquo; to be introduced into this debate.  This Bill seeks to do something very straightforward with which nobody in this House will have any difficulty, that is, to ensure that we have the tightest possible legislation to prevent drunk driving and that nobody can use a technicality to circumvent the intentions of this House.</P>
    <P>I have no responsibility in relation to road traffic legislation.  Comprehensive road traffic legislation will be brought before the House and debated in a leisurely fashion.  However, in the interim, neither I nor this Government were prepared to have any doutbs in relation to existing law.  Comments were made in relation to the Haughey case. That case fell on the issue of certification, not on the form of the register.  The register certificate was not accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of registration because there was no explicit power in the existing Acts to prove registration by way of certification. We are trying to redress that in this Bill by giving explicit power for certification. There has never been any judicial ruling that the computerised register was illegal, but I am determined that there would be no doubt about the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> This is a simple straightforward Bill with no cloak and dagger aspects to it, but on advice I was not anxious to have a broad debate before this legislation is enacted, when there were cases before the courts.  Most people in this House accepted the good faith of the explanations given last week.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the Wildlife Service is inadequately resourced.  I refer to this matter particularly in light of the United Nations Convention in Trade of Endangered Species which Ireland has <Col N="748" /> endorsed but, unlike other members of the EC, has yet to ratify.  I assume it is only a matter of time before our commitments in relation to the CITES Agreement are met.  We await with interest publication of the report on Dublin Zoo which refers to this matter &mdash; which is the responsibility of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The resources available to the Wildlife Service have been shown to be inadequate. I understand there are about 50 pet shops in Dublin.  There is a need to train Customs and Excise personnel as well as those in the Wildlife Service, if only to identify the species they encounter.  On 3-4 June a shop under the management of Pet World Ireland in George's Street Arcade, Dublin, was visited by the Customs and Excise, the Wildlife Service, the DSPCA, Care for the Wild and the Garda Síochána.  About 200 animals, worth an estimated £40,000, were involved and I understand an investigation is being carried out in this regard. On 24 June this shop was closed and I assume the animals have been relocated. Does the Minister have information on this matter?</P>
      <P>The CITES Agreement covers not only animals but animal products such as fur and ivory.  I understand Dublin Airport is putting on a display in this regard. I would welcome a statement from the Minister on the budget of the Wildlife Service given its responsibilities such as personnel training, provision of equipment for the seizure of animals brought in illegally and facilities for coping with such seizures.  Will the Minister agree there is lack of regulation in the area of animal trade?  What is being done in this regard and how can the position be improved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a risk of rabies as a result of smuggling.  There is also the possibility of a craze like the turtle craze as a result of the movie &ldquo;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&rdquo;. There is now an amazing demand for reptiles as a result of the new Steven Spielberg film, &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;.  I understand <Col N="749" /> there are no quarantine requirements in regard to reptiles.  Will the Minister comment on the points I raised, particularly the lack of regulations in this area?</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who cannot be here this evening.</P>
      <P>The Wildlife Service was brought under the aegis of the Office of Public Works in 1987.  Prior to this, the service was part of the Forest and Wildlife Service. Since the beginning of 1992, the Wildlife Service and the former National Parks Service of the Office of Public Works have been amalgamated in one unit for reasons of organisational efficiency.  It is not possible to separate the financial resources for the amalgamated service into its component parts. In addition, the Deputy should be aware that the salaries and overheads of the professional and technical staff are part of the administrative budget arrangements and it is not possible to separate those costs from the other elements. Apart from salaries and overheads, the financial outturn last year for the amalgamated service was £6.6 million and the allocation for 1993 is £9.1 million.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, public interest in environmental matters is increasing all the time, in urban areas as much as rural. The Government has been aware of this for some time and in November 1991 11 new rangers were recruited, an increase of about 25 per cent.  This included one ranger specifically assigned to Dublin, the first time such an appointment was made.  This ranger is part of a regional team of 13 officers who cover Counties Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.  In addition the district and regional wildlife officers carry out work in the Dublin area and the professional staff based at 51 St. Stephen's Green are also available when needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> These appointments point to the Government's ongoing commitment to our natural heritage.  Obviously, the Wildlife Service is subject to the same financial constraints as all the other agencies of the State, but I assure the House that the Minister will keep the matter under review.  I will convey to the Minister the points raised by Deputy Sargent and I am sure he will contact the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <P>Rosslare Strand is one of our most valuable home holiday resorts with exceptionally fine facilities, including hotels, golf courses, caravan parks and so on, all constructed around the initial attraction, a very fine, safe, sandy beach.  Rosslare Harbour, a few miles further south, is one of our most important sea ports with exceptionally fine facilities and is a credit to Iarnród Éireann, the port authority for whom it makes a handsome profit.</P>
      <P>The problem relates to the fact that the construction of the new piers and the works in Rosslare Harbour to accommodate the modern facilities for the ferry companies, and their passengers, has resulted in the starvation of Rosslare Strand of beach nourishment by interfering with the natural tidal flows and sea currents which for centuries replenished the beach on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical people and experts on both sides of the island have failed to agree on the cause of the sudden deterioration of Rosslare beach over the past decade or two.  However, the erosion of the beach corresponded with the development of the port.  On 4 November 1982 the Government issued a decree to CIE to <Col N="751" /> make beach nourishment available for Rosslare Strand and on 16 November 1982 a letter sent by the marine division of the Department of Transport to the Secretary of Wexford County Council stated:</P>
    <P>The Government at its meeting of 4 November 1982 decided that costs arising from the provision of transportation of beach material to counter coastal erosion at Rosslare Strand should be borne as to 80 per cent by CIE and as to 20 per cent by Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>At this stage the erosion of Rosslare beach was critical and a breach of the dunes was imminent with potential losses of millions of pounds worth of property not to mention the threat to lives and to Wexford harbour and town.  That Government decision was followed by maintenance works by the Office of Public Works and then by the Department of the Marine on an agreed programme of coastal protection and the provision every three years of sand by CIE for beach nourishment.</P>
    <P>The last beach nourishment programme was in 1989.  A similar programme was due last year but was deferred for one year at the request of the Department of the Marine to allow for the construction of rock groynes to hold the beach.  So far this year there is no evidence of any work on the beach.  I understand that work is due to recommence in September, a most unsuitable time of the year as calm seas are needed to allow for the deposit of the beach material successfully from the seaward approach to the beach.  I understand that Iarnród Éireann is now jibbing and objecting to paying this year's contribution to the provision of beach nourishment, as the Department of the Marine is looking for substantial increased sums this year &mdash; approximately three times the normal amount.  I <Col N="752" /> estimate that to be about £300,000 this year, from Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that Iarnród Éireann will not be released from its contract this year even from the payment of this increased sum, or released at any stage for as long as Rosslare Harbour exists, as the harbour will continue to starve the beach of natural replenishment.  Will the Minister indicate to Iarnród Éireann before its board meeting next Wednesday that any change in the present contract will not be entertained by the Government?  The Minister should endeavour to bring forward this year's coast protection programme from September to July to ensure efficient and effective expenditure on the beach, a beach that is again deteriorating but which can be saved by a construction and nourishment programme.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Doyle for giving me an opportunity to agree whole-heartedly with her argument.  The building of groynes is essential.  To date they have been very successful in gathering sand and in protecting the beach.  Work has not commenced this year and we do not know why.  I support the call for beach nourishment to be supplied by CIE and for the Department of the Marine to proceed immediately with the lengthening of the groynes.</P>

      <P>Rosslare Strand has a history of erosion going back to at least the turn of the century.  Extensive protection works were undertaken by the Office of Public Works in the 1950s and <Col N="753" /> by the 1970s their operations were winding down.  However, in the late 1970s the situation deteriorated.  An Office of Public Works investigation around that time indicated that the undermining of previously completed protection works and consequent ingress of the sea were unlikely to occur in a single event.  The process of erosion takes the form of isolated, individual breaches of the defences, which it may be possible to repair, but at considerable cost.  In time the position would gradually worsen along the entire extent of the sea defences, leaving them vulnerable to serious breaches and possibly an irretrievable situation in so far as the property at risk is concerned.</P>
      <P>Detailed examinations have indicated that the most effective method of counteracting the erosion problem at Rosslare Strand is the phased undertaking of rock groyne construction, extending from the beach into the sea, and filling the areas between the groynes with suitable coarse nourishment.</P>
      <P>To this end, the rock groyne construction commenced in 1991 and continued during 1992.  The groynes, which have been built at right angles to the beach and extending into the sea are designed to trap passing beach nourishment from the natural movement of sand along the coast with the tides.  This work will be continued during 1993.  It is proposed to construct six rock groyne extensions. The element of the project has been put to open tender and it is expected that a contract will be placed within the next few weeks.  Associated with the rock groynes construction is the beach nourishment programme to raise beach levels and prevent down drift erosion. A considerable quantity of nourishment will be required for this phase of the project.  However, the groynes must be constructed in the first instance to hold the nourishment to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for this project will be provided by the Department of the Marine, Wexford County Council and the EC.  A <Col N="754" /> contribution towards the cost of beach nourishment will also be required of Irish Rail.  Discussions on this contribution are currently taking place.  EC funding is available through the ECOPRO project. ECOPRO-environmentally friendly coast protection &mdash; is a joint operation between a number of Irish bodies &mdash; Clare, Wexford, Waterford and Kerry County Councils, Coastwatch Europe, Eolas and the Department of the Marine; a number of northern Ireland bodies &mdash; the Department of the Environment, the University of Ulster and The National Trust; and also the Danish Coast Authority. The objectives of the ECOPRO project are to assess the vulnerability of the coast to change, including erosion, to consider the need for protection and to examine the performance and environmental impact of existing coastal protection works, including a demonstration project.  Rosslare Strand has been chosen as the Irish demonstration site.</P>
    <P>The ECOPRO project will produce a methodology for future protection needs, a code of practice for the planning, installation and performance monitoring of low cost protection and a source of information for managerial purposes. ECOPRO encompasses the whole concept of coastal zone management, looking beyond individual projects and embracing the concept of comprehensive coastal planning.  It is an excellent example of the close co-operation now taking place between the Department of the Marine and coastal local authorities in the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>

      <P>A young 16 year-old girl is in need of immediate orthodontic treatment. <Col N="755" /> This person, who has finished fourth year in secondary school, was classified as being a category B case some years ago and was last examined in December 1992.  She has not heard anything since, although she was advised at the time that she would be seen shortly after in Cavan.  Every week that passes constitutes a serious delay for this young girl and her problem is causing her great embarrassment.  It is also causing her parents much anxiety.  I understand there are 225 young people on the categories A and B lists for the region for the period November 1991 to December 1992.  Sixteen only of these young people fall within category A and, of the remaining 209, approximately 100 were earmarked for priority in November and December 1991.  Obviously, these are urgent cases.</P>
      <P>I have made representations to the North Eastern Health Board in respect of other cases.  Indeed, I should say I appreciate their courtesy and help, but I realise that they can only deal with these problems subject to the availability of finance and personnel.  I might mention another case of a young boy of 14 who has finished his second year at secondary school who is also awaiting orthodontic treatment.  In the opinion of his parents his younger sister was in less need of treatment but, thankfully, she has already been dealt with.  Yet her brother still awaits attention.  I would point out to the Minister that many others who cannot afford to pay for treatment have obtained care either locally or in Northern Ireland, while other parents have had to borrow money they cannot afford to have their children treated at the most opportune time.</P>
      <P>I realise that funds are scarce and that the best possible use must be made of them.  But I would urge the Minister to ensure that the necessary help is made available to this young girl in particular and that the waiting list is eliminated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="756" /> thank Deputy Crawford for having brought this matter to my attention.  The responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to persons from the Monaghan area, is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  I have obtained information from the health board as to the position regarding treatment of the particular case raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The board has informed me that she was assessed by the North Eastern Health Board for the provision of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department.  As a result of this assessment she was placed in category B for treatment purposes in mid-December 1991.  She was one of a number of children who were placed in category B for treatment at the same time.  Following a waiting period this group of children are now coming into treatment.</P>
      <P>The health board have informed me that it is expected that treatment for this girl will commence within the next few months.  The board is not in a position at this time to be more precise as to the commencement date.  Orthodontic treatment can take from 18 months to two years to complete, and according as treatments are completed new cases are brought into treatment.</P>
      <P>For the past few years special additional allocations have been provided to the North Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of their orthodontic services.  The Government is committed to further improve orthodontic services, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. To this end I am pleased to inform the House that I have recently allocated an additional £60,000 to the North Eastern Health Board to further develop its orthodontic services.  This will result in additional children receiving treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concerns the Deputy has expressed regarding the provision of orthodontic services and I can assure him <Col N="757" /> that I will further improve the situation as resources become available to me.</P>

Scoil Ghaeltachta í Scoil Shailearna atá suite dhá mhíle siar ón Spidéal.  I láthair na huaire tá 230 scoláire ar an rolla agus seachtar múinteoirí fostaithe.  Ar na huimhreacha a bheidh ann i mí Méan Fomhair seo chugainn ceapfar an t-ochtú oide ag tús na scoilbliana 1994.</P>
      <P>Faoi láthair tá cúig seomra ranga sa scoil agus seomra il-úsáideach nó general purpose room.  Úsáidtear an seomra sin anois mar dhá sheomra ranga.  I 1982 deineadh iarratas ar sheomra breise a chur leis an scoil agus cuireadh an t-iarratas sin chuig an Roinn Oideachais. Sa bhliain dár gcionn ceadaíodh múinteoir breise&mdash;sé sin an seachtú múinteoir. I 1985 tháinig litir ón Roinn ag ceadú dhá sheomra ranga breise agus halla.  I 1986 fostaíodh múinteoir breise.  I 1987 fuarthas cead pleanála.  I 1988 tugadh cead ailtire príobhaideach a fhostú.  I 1989 leis an halla agus an dá sheomra ranga a thógáil cuireadh iarratas isteach go dtí Roinn na Gaeltachta ar dheontas i leith an halla.  Tugadh cead do £60,000 de dheontas i 1990 ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I 1991 íocadh £4,701 ar tháillí ailtire de réir rialacha na Roinne; fritheadh tairiscintí agus cuireadh go dtí an Roinn iad.  I 1992 fritheadh cead ón Roinn Oideachais tairiscintí a lorg agus cuireadh na tairiscintí sin ar aghaidh go dtí an Roinn.  I 1993 cuireadh liosta na gconraitheoirí go dtí an Roinn agus fritheadh don dara huair cead pleanála.  Tá chuile rud ag dul ar aghaidh, más mall é, go breá.  Bhí caiteachas iomlán de £200,000 i gceist ó tharla go raibh deontas £60,000 faighte ó Roinn na Gaeltachta bhí £60,000 á lorg ón Roinn Oideachais leis an togra seo a chur i gcrích.  I Meitheamh na bliana seo cuireadh in iúl do chathaoirleach an <Col N="758" /> Bhord Bainistíochta go raibh an tógra seo curtha siar.  Caithfear smaoineamh chomh maith de bhreis ar an ocht múinteoir a bheas ann i 1994 go bhfuil múinteoir feabhais ag freastal ar an scoil seo atá roinnte idir scoil an Spidéil, Scoil Shailearna agus scoil an Tulaigh.  Chomh maith leis sin bíonn múinteoirí ealaíona, cigirí Gaeilge agus mar sin de ag teacht chun na scoile.  Bíonn ar na daoine sin faoi láthair seomra na múinteoirí a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Is é an t-iarratas atá ann ná, le deontas £60,000, go n-athrófaí an halla nó an seomra ilghnéitheach ina dhá sheomra ranga, go dtógfaí halla don scoil agus go dtógfaí seomra ranga breise.  Dá mbeadh sé sin déanta bheadh ocht seomra ranga sa scoil agus seomra ginearálta.</P>
    <P>Mar bharr ar chuile mhí-adh tuigim go bhfuil múinteoirí na scoile, ar threoir an INTO, tar éis a chur in iúl nach mbeifear sásta ranganna a thógáil ó Mheán Fómhair 1993 sna seomraí atá ar fáil i láthair na huaire.  Mar sin, d'iarrfainn ar an Aire an deontas don scoil seo a cheadú ó tharla go bhfuil an scéal seo ag dul ar aghaidh chomh fada agus ó tharla go bhfuil an caiteachas £60,000 chomh beag sin i gcomhthéacs an chaiteachais iomláin de £200,000 agus ó tharla go bhfuil deontas ceadaithe ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ó 1989 i leith.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm gur thug an Teachta deis dom, thar ceann an Aire, an scéal maidir le Scoil Náisiúnta Shailearna, Contae na Gaillimhe a chur in iúl don Teach.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has said this is a seven-teacher school with a current enrolment of 227 pupils.  The existing accommodation, which dates from 1972, consists of five classrooms and a general purpose room, which has been divided to accommodate two of the class groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education has approved the provision of a major building project, including a permanent classroom, adaptation of the existing general purpose room to provide a further classroom and library, together with provision <Col N="759" /> of a ballcourt and new drainage and septic tank.  The estimated cost of the works is about £70,000.</P>
    <P>These works will comprise a part of a larger scheme which will also include the provision of a new general purpose room/hall and various external works, to be funded by Roinn na Gaeltachta and the school authorities.  The overall estimated projected cost, including the works to be grant-aided by the Department of Education is £250,000.  The Minister for Education regrets that owing to the large number of urgent building projects <Col N="760" /> currently on hands, it was not possible to include this scheme in the primary school capital programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, níl ach méid áirithe airgid ag an Aire agus mar sin tá cosc ar an líon scéimeanna móra gur féidir léi ligint ar aghaidh in aon bhliain amháin.  Is féidir liom a dhearbhú don Teachta áfach, go ndéanfaidh an tAire gach iarracht an scéim seo a chur san áireamh san chlár caipitil don bhliain atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 July 1993 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>Bord Tráchtála's overall strategy for selling Irish consumer products in the US is to encourage and assist companies to develop business through mainstream department stores, Irish and <Col N="495" /> other speciality shops, television home shopping networks and mail order catalogues. Television shopping is a rapidly growing part of the retail sector in the US and it represents a useful addition to the established outlets for Irish consumer and giftware products in the US.</P>
      <P>For the past three years An Bord Tráchtála has used cable television to promote Irish goods around St. Patrick's Day and, in co-operation with the Festival of Kerry Office, during the Rose of Tralee.  These promotions have shown that the TV shopping approach is capable of getting good results for Irish companies with good quality products suited to this type of marketing.  The St. Patrick's Day promotion this year featured the products of some 30 Irish companies against the background of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin.  I understand that sales turnover for this promotion and for the very successful Rose of Tralee event in September 1992 was of the order of £3-£4 million.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála is working closely with the major cable television shopping channel and with Irish suppliers to develop new products for their 1994 promotions. If the Deputy knows of anyone who might be interested in participating in this type of promotion, or in home shopping network sales generally, An Bord Tráchtála will be happy to give further information and advice.</P>

      <P>I might remind the Deputy that the board's overall 1993 marketing budget is also derived from other sources including the Operational Programme for Tourism, INTERREG and the International Fund for Ireland.

      <P>The IHF survey referred to by the Deputy reveals that, in general, hoteliers are optimistic about growth in the sector during 1993 with 67 per cent of respondents forecasting that employment will either be maintained, or increased, on 1992 levels.  Only 33 per cent of those surveyed anticipate a reduction in employment.</P>
      <P>The latest estimates of tourist numbers for 1993 available from the CSO relate to the period January to March and show an 8 per cent increase over the same period last year.  However, the first quarter normally accounts for less than 14 per cent of annual overseas tourism, and any trend indications at this stage should obviously be treated with caution.  A comprehensive research study published by CERT last April which provides a detailed analysis of employment in the major sectors of the industry, forecast growth in tourism employment of 3 per cent for 1993.</P>

      <P>Ratification of the Treaty on European Union, signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992 has not yet been completed.  The United Kingdom and Germany have still to finalise their ratification procedures. Under the terms of Article R, the Treaty shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last signatory State to take this step.  Current indications are that this will not take place until later this year.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the necessary amendments to the Constitution and the European Communities Act, 1972, have already been put in place.  The adoption of these measures enabled Ireland to lodge its instrument of ratification of the Treaty on European Union on 23 November 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commencement order will be required prior to the entry into force of the Treaty to bring the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1992, into force.  The effect of the Act is to amend the existing definition of the Treaties governing the European Communities to include certain of the provisions of the <Col N="502" /> Treaty on European Union.  It is proposed to make the commencement order when the last ratification has been lodged i.e. within the period of one month after the last ratification before the Treaty comes into effect.  No other constitutional or legislative measures are necessary as far as Ireland is concerned to comply with the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of specific provisions of the Treaty where action is required by my Department, the position is as follows.  At the Edinburgh European Council the Twelve set out guidelines for the operation of the principle of subsidiarity (Article 3b).  Negotiations of an inter-institutional agreement with Parliament and the Commission on the application of Article 3b is now underway.  Guidelines for the consular protection of unrepresented EC nationals (Article 8c) in third countries come into force on 1 July 1993.  These will entitle Irish nationals in distress in countries where there is no Irish representation to receive consular help from the embassy or consulate of another member state, on the same basis as nationals of that State.  The detailed provisions governing the right of inquiry (Article 138c) are the subject of a resolution agreed by the European Parliament in December 1992.  The issue is currently the subject of discussion between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission as is the implementation of the Treaty provisions on the Ombudsman (Article 138e).  Ireland strongly supported the inclusion of a title on development co-operation (Article 130u-130y) in the European Union Treaty. Last November the Council of Development Ministers initiated a review of the development co-operation policies of the Community, taking into account the relevant Articles in the Treaty.  Ireland is contributing fully to this ongoing review. As regards common foreign and security policy (Title V of the Treaty) the Twelve have undertaken preparatory work with a view to identifying areas open to joint action under the future common foreign and security policy.  The Lisbon report, laid before the House as an annex to <Col N="503" /> the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, defined a number of objectives for the Community's relations with Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and the former Soviet Republics, the Maghreb countries and the Middle East.  The Edinburgh and Copenhagen European Councils took note of preparatory work on issues in the security field, for example on non-proliferation and the strengthening of the CSCE.  Ireland is contributing fully to this work.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Irish Council of the European Movement published a report on the enlargement of the European Union two weeks ago.  This wide-ranging document is a stimulating survey of the questions raised by enlargement and a useful addition to the debate on the future of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Irish Council of the European Movement has made a number of suggestions concerning the enlargement process. It highlights the need to ensure protection of the interests of small countries. It emphasises the role which the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs can play in the enlargement debate.  It suggests that a committee be established of personal representatives of the member states and the applicant countries with whom enlargement negotiations have been opened.  This committee would examine, <i>inter alia,</i> institutional arrangements and voting rights in a larger European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of institutional change in the context of the forthcoming enlargement there is already an established Community position which was endorsed at the Copenhagen European <Col N="506" /> Council last week.  The Lisbon European Council in June 1992 concluded that the enlargement of the Union to include the EFTA applicants was possible on the basis of the institutional provisions contained in the Treaty on European Union and attached declarations.  The European Council did not, therefore, envisage any major changes in the institutional framework of the Union.  It considered that a Union of 16 or 17 members could be accommodated on the basis of the present institutional structures with necessary adaptations.  This is a position we share.  It is the basis on which negotiations are now proceeding with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the necessity for joint reflection by European Community and applicant representatives on institutional arrangements in the context of the current enlargement is not clear. There may be a need, however, for such a reflection in the context of a wider enlargement, beyond that currently under negotiation, to include other European countries.  This is an approach which could be considered, perhaps, in the context of the 1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty.  For the present, however, the actual implementation of the Treaty is an urgent priority and a debate now on wider institutional change, apart from that required to accommodate the EFTA applicants, would be premature.</P>
    <P>With regard to European Community policies, it is a basic principle of the Community's negotiating stance that the <i>acquis communautaire</i> should be accepted in full by the applicants.  Any derogations should be temporary and transition periods kept to an absolute minimum.</P>

      <P>The Government has noted with great interest the proposal by Prime Minister Balladur for a Conference on Stability in Europe.  Although we have not yet had an opportunity to consider the proposal in detail, our preliminary assessment is that it could provide a valuable contribution to the development of collective European security arrangements and help to ensure that tragic situations, such as the present one in the former Yugoslavia, do not recur in the future.</P>
      <P>The Government shares the view which underlies the Balladur proposal that the settlement of frontier disputes and agreement on the protection of minority rights in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are essential for the promotion of stability in the region.  We also believe that security in Europe concerns all European states and that we have a shared responsibility to contribute to the enhancement of peace and stability in our continent.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the development of co-operative security arrangements for Europe which will satisfy the security needs of all European states.  To this end, we have sought to develop the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a pan-European security forum based on the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter.  In this context, we welcome the fact that the Balladur proposal aims to build on the achievements of the CSCE in the security field and to strengthen the role of the CSCE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prime Minister Balladur presented his proposal to the European Council in Copenhagen on 21-22 June 1993.  The European Council agreed that recent events in Europe have shown that action towards assuring in practice the implementation of the principles agreed by European countries with regard to <Col N="508" /> respect for borders and rights of minorities is timely and appropriate.  The European Council invited the General Affairs Council to examine the proposal and report to its next meeting in December 1993 with a view to convening a preparatory conference on the pact.</P>
    <P>As regards the more general question of protection for ethnic minorities, this has become an urgent issue as a result of the re-emergence, in the states of Central and Eastern Europe, of traditional disputes between different ethnic groups which had been suppressed under the former communist regimes in those countries. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in response to these developments, recently instructed its appropriate group of legal experts to examine this question with a view to proposing specific legal standards relating to the protection of minorities.  The group of experts is currently engaged both in formulating a possible list of minority rights and in considering by what means those rights might best be protected.  The work is still at an early stage.  Ireland is following the matter closely.</P>

    <P>The position is that Ireland already satisfies these criteria &mdash; and has done over each of the past five years.  It appears very probable that this year's General Government Deficit will be among the lowest in the European Community.  As regards the period from 1994, when the provisions formally come into effect, I would refer the Deputy to the Fianna Fáil and Labour <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i> In the section which summarises the Government's policy in the budgetary area, there is a fundamental commitment to the maintenance of &ldquo;firm control of our public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the national debt-GDP ratio&rdquo;.  This commitment is specifically defined in the programme by reference to the budgetary convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, which require adherence to an annual General Government <Col N="511" /> Deficit of around 3 per cent or less of GDP, and the reduction of the debt-GDP ratio towards 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Structural Funds initiatives.  My Department is the lead Department in relation to the INTERREG programme.  In the Irish context, the INTERREG programme's objectives were (a) to assist Border areas North and South to overcome the development problems associated with underdevelopment and peripherality, and to encourage the process of rural regeneration and community development and (b) to encourage cross-Border co-operation in order to maximise growth potential of the area, especially in the lead up to 1992.</P>
      <P>A total of 76 MECU, in 1991 prices, was provided by the European Community. The programme has five sub-programmes: tourism, agriculture-fisheries-forestry, human resource development, environmental protection, and regional development.  Taking account of the application of the annual deflators, the value of the Community contribution to the programme is now 82.157 MECU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is jointly managed by the administrations in Dublin and Belfast, and individual projects are considered under a joint planning framework. The present programme runs to the end of 1993.  The Commission has recently published a consultative document on Community initiatives in the 1994-1999 period.  This document proposes, <i>inter alia</i> a further INTERREG programme.  While it will be later this year before decisions are taken on the initiatives I am confident that there will be a new INTERREG programme. Although a period of consultation between now and the end of the year <Col N="513" /> will be necessary to determine the exact shape of the new programme, it can be taken that the progress achieved under the existing programme, which has been widely acknowledged as being very successful, will be continued.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy is to ensure that the criteria for European Monetary Union will be met and our budget and economic policies are designed to achieve them.  This will continue to be the position. In addition, a new Central Bank Bill is in preparation to make the small adjustments necessary to ensure that Central Bank's powers and duties are in line with the requirements of the Treaty and that the bank is fully empowered in law to carry into effect the relevant parts of the Treaty.  The Bill will be introduced later this year.</P>
      <P>The Treaty provides for the continuation of the existing Structural Funds and the creation of a new Cohesion Fund which will assist projects in the fields of environment and transport in the context of trans-European networks in the four poorest member states including Ireland. I indicated in this year's Budget Statement the projects which are being forwarded for Cohesion Fund assistance in 1993.  The National Development Plan which will set out the Government's proposals for the use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the period 1994 to 1999 is being prepared at present.  In the context of preparations of the National Development Plan full account will be taken of policy priorities contained in the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute in association with DKM Economic Consultants; G. Boyle, Centre for Agriculture and Food Policy Research, Maynooth College; and Brendan Kearney and Associates were engaged by my Department to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989 to 1993 in contributing to Ireland's economic development and to make recommendations on the strategy that should underpin the next Community Support Framework, following from that strategy, the optimal mix of national programmes and measures to implement the strategy, and practical ways of providing for greater integration and complementary of measures within programmes. The consultants were engaged in October 1992 and submitted their report in late April 1993 and the draft summary of the report in late May 1993. The cost of the assignment was £130,000. Of this £80,000 has been paid and the balance will be paid shortly.</P>
      <P>The assignment was carried out by the consultants on the basis that it was not the intention of the Department of Finance to publish their report.  Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies co-operated with the consultants and supplied material to them on that understanding.  In the circumstances it was considered inappropriate to publish the full report.</P>
      <P>However, an extensive and detailed summary report, prepared by the consultants and containing all of their main conclusions and recommendations, was published on 14 June 1993.  Copies have been made available to Members of the Oireachtas, the social partner organisations and the sub-regional Review Committees.  The summary is also available through the Government Publications Office.</P>

      <P>Co-operation in the areas of police, drugs, immigration and judicial matters has been taking place between all of the member states of the EC for many years on an intergovernmental basis outside the framework of the European Treaties.  Title VI of the Treaty on European Union provides a new framework for co-operation in these areas which will largely replace the existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>A number of member states are also parties to the Schengen Agreement which is primarily concerned with the abolition of checks at their common borders on the movement of persons and the facilitation of the transport and movement of goods.  The Agreement has not been ratified by all of the parties concerned and the provisions of the Agreement are not being implemented therefore as of yet.  There are no proposals at this time for Ireland, which does not of course have a common land border with any of the Schengen countries, to accede to the Agreement.  Any such proposals would require a considered examination and, if it were decided to proceed, a detailed negotiation process would also be involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides for co-operation between the member states for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the Union, including co-operation in the areas of justice and home affairs.  Pending ratification of the Treaty by all of the member states and the entry of the Treaty into force, it is not possible to anticipate what initiatives, legislative or otherwise, will be necessary on my part arising from such co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Community objective of a Single Market, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 17 June last to a question from Deputy Liz McManus relating to the free movement of persons. Measures remain to be taken to implement certain EC directives relating to this area.  Directive 91/447 EEC on the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons was due to be implemented on 31 December 1992.  Draft regulations to implement the directive are ready for completion.  However, on the advice of the Attorney General I have deferred making the regulations pending the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Meagher <i>v.</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Others. <Col N="521" /> Articles 9 to 14, inclusive, of Directive 93/15 EEC on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses are due to be implemented before 30 September 1993.  The remaining provisions of the Directive apply from 1 January 1995.  Draft regulations to implement the Directive are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of Council Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering &mdash; adopted on 10 June 1991 &mdash; is to ensure that member states do not adopt measures to combat money laundering which could be inconsistent with the completion of the Single Market Legislation to give effect to the Directive is at a very advanced stage of drafting and will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to Community initiatives under the Structural Funds in Question No. 59.  My Department has not had a specific role in relation to these.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question arises from agreements notified to the Competition Authority by certain national newspapers seeking a licence or certificate under the Competition Act, 1991.  The agreements notified relate to distribution and supply of newspapers to newsagents.  The reference numbers are CA/112/92E, CA/113/92E, CA/114/92/E, CA/375/92E, CA/376/92E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that if, in the Authority's opinion, the arrangements notified have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State, they do not qualify <Col N="522" /> for a certificate.  Consideration is then given to the question of whether the arrangements qualify for a licence of exemption.  The Act sets out strict criteria which an agreement must satisfy in order to gain a licence of exemption.  A licence is granted for a specific period and may be subject to certain conditions.</P>

      <P>Community Initiatives are Commission sponsored initiatives which are implemented under Article 11 of EC Regulation No. 4253/88. Through Community Initiatives assistance is provided for measures of significant interest to the Community not covered by the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>My Department has primary responsibility for the following Community Initiatives: Euroform, Horizon, NOW, PRISMA and RETEX.</P>
      <P>The Euroform Community Initiative concerns transnational projects in the area of new qualifications, new skills and new employment opportunities induced by the completion of the internal market and technological change.  The total EC allocation to Ireland for Euroform up to the end of 1994 is £10.6 million.</P>
      <P>Sixty five projects have been approved under Euroform.  They cover a wide variety of areas including qualifications in arts' administration, distance learning for the long term unemployed and local tourism responses in the West of Ireland.  All projects have transnational partners in other Community Member States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NOW Community Initiative promotes equal opportunities for women in <Col N="523" /> the field of employment and vocational training.  All projects supported under this programme have a transnational aspect and are linked with compatible counterparts in other member states. The total EC contribution to Ireland under NOW in the period 1992-1994 is IR£4.6 million.</P>
    <P>To date thirty-two projects have been approved for funding under NOW.  Community groups, voluntary organisations and statutory training bodies benefit from the Initiative.  While NOW provides voluntary organisations with the opportunity to directly implement Community aided activity, it also provides statutory training organisations with the resources to target their activities in the area of positive action programmes for women.</P>
    <P>The HORIZON Community Initiative provides Structural Funds for innovative projects involving transnational partnerships which are aimed at assisting the disabled and disadvantaged.  The programme seeks to facilitate the social and economic integration of its participants into the labour market in particular and society in general.  The total EC allocation to Ireland for HORIZON is £15.4 million.</P>
    <P>Ninety-four projects have been approved to date and they will fully take up the Structural Funds available.  It is anticipated that projects will have a multiplier effect in creating sustainable employment and that innovatory activity undertaken will serve as models for future developments in the provision of services to the disabled and the disadvantaged. All projects are linked with transnational partners in other member states.</P>
    <P>Under the PRISMA (Preparing Regional Industry for the Single Market) Community Initiative EC funding will be provided to Ireland to support infrastructural development work in four highly specialised fields.  These are: the improvement of calibration and metrology infrastructure and services; the improvement of third party testing and certification services; to increase or enhance the information available to <Col N="524" /> firms regarding business opportunities in EC public procurement markets; and to provide some additional support to previously protected sectors (e.g. textiles, clothing and footwear) to enhance their future competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Nineteen projects are being assisted under the Programme of which the most significant and important are&mdash; the modernisation of Ireland's Legal Metrology Service and the European Procurement Information Network (EPIN) being developed at ESBI Computing Ltd.; £7.22 million is being provided in EC support over the period 1992-93.</P>
    <P>The RETEX Initiative is intended to encourage diversification of economic activity in those regions of the Community which have a heavy reliance on the clothing and textiles sector.  Under this new initiative, Ireland will receive total funding of £9.1 million over the period 1993 to 1997.</P>
    <P>Ireland's RETEX Operational Programme was adopted by the EC Commission 18 June 1993.  A small number of clearly defined projects will be supported under the Programme.  Details of the Programme will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>A Green Paper has recently been issued by the Commission on the &ldquo;Future of the Community Initiatives under the Structural Funds&rdquo; and will be the subject of detailed discussion and consideration in the coming months following which decisions will be taken by the Commission on the number and type of initiatives to be implemented in future years. The Green Paper suggests that there will be a smaller number of such initiatives in future.</P>

      <P>The same rates of basic pension in respect <Col N="533" /> of 21 years' pensionable service and of special increment in respect of each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years are payable to all soldiers irrespective of their dates of retirement.  An addition to pension in respect of military service allowance is, subject to certain conditions, payable only to soldiers retiring on or after 1 August 1990.  This addition was introduced on foot of a recommendation of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission) that the military service allowance should be made pensionable and applies only to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following publication of the Commission's report.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the frustration felt by Officers of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board arising from lack of finance being provided by the Government, the results of which are an inadequate number of permanent officers to protect inland waterways from Ballycotton to Kerry Head and to patrol almost 500 miles of coastline, no sea patrols having been undertaken since the beginning of the commercial season almost four months ago and no proper training for part-time fishery officers who frequently are expected to give evidence in Court against those with whom, during the closed season, they stand side by side in the dole queue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have implemented measures under two community initiatives, the INTERREG Programme, the STRIDE Programme.</P>
      <P>The Department is responsible for the fisheries measure of the INTERREG Programme.  The INTERREG Programme is an EC initiative with the purpose of assisting the internal border regions of the Community, in this instance the Border with Northern Ireland.  The moneys available under the fisheries measure in the current programme (which runs from 1991 to the end of 1993) are to be allocated to the inland fisheries sector for a total of nine projects in the Border counties.  The total EC grant aid for these projects is IR£555,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's operational programme under the Community initiative STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe) 1991-1993 is directed at developing research, innovation and technological capacity in the four natural resource based areas of marine, environment, forestry <Col N="535" /> and food.  The total investment under the programme is £13.5 million of which the Community is funding 75 per cent, with a national contribution of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The STRIDE Programme for Ireland gives particular recognition to marine research and development where £8 million is being invested over the period in the marine research facilities at the Department's Fisheries Research Centre and other centres of marine expertise around the country.  The environment sub-programme is spending £3.466 million in regional facilities for environmental research and monitoring.  The forestry sub-programme is spending £1.023 million to establish and co-ordinate research facilities for the forestry industry, and to promote the transfer of technology to the industry sectors.  The food sub-programme is spending £0.678 million in technological support for product development in the meat and dairy sectors.</P>
    <P>It is the objective to build on initiatives currently being funded under the STRIDE Programme through further investment in national research and technology capability.  Proposals in this regard are being considered in the context of the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has recently published a consultative document on Community Initiatives.  This document proposes, <i>inter alia,</i> a further INTERREG programme.  It does not propose a further STRIDE programme, however, neither does it rule such a programme out.  The implications of the consultative document are being examined.</P>

      <P>The development of trans-European <Col N="536" /> networks arises from Articles 129 and 130 of the Treaty of Maastricht. Article 129 b to d provides for the Community to contribute to the establishment of trans-European networks (TENS) in a number of areas, including transport infrastructure.  It requires the community to promote the interconnection and inter-operation of national networks, and access to them, taking account of the particular need to link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the community.  Trans-European networks are being developed for all land modes of transport.  Guidelines have been considered by the Council for a high speed train network; and proposals have been prepared for guidelines on combined transport, motorway and inland waterway networks.  The Commission is committed, as a matter of priority, to developing guidelines for the remaining modes, i.e. conventional railways, airports and air traffic control, ports and maritime transport (to the extent that they are not covered by the proposal on combined transport) and vessel traffic systems (VTS).  The ulimate aim is to integrate all the guidelines into a multi-model approach which will maximise the efficiency of transport operations in the Community.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine have been participating in discussions on the TENS guidelines for ports and these are at present being finalised.</P>

      <P>Measures were taken by the Department during 1992 to alleviate the congestion of vessels at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre; a number of pontoons were installed at the West Wharf of the harbour.  A more longterm solution to the berthage difficulties would, however, involve major development works.  The Department is currently implementing the final year of its Fishery Harbour Development Programme for the period 1989 to 1993.  There is no provision under this programme for <Col N="538" /> major development works at the harbour and no finance is currently allocated.</P>
      <P>An ambitious development plan has been presented to the Department by a locally formed development group and the Department is presently assessing this proposal in the context of future development programmes.  The Department is currently drawing up a new Fishery Harbour Development Plan to cover the period 1994 to 1997 and Dunmore East will be considered in this context.  Pending finalisation of the Plan and clarification of funding, I am not in a position to say what development works will be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>I assume that this question relates to the 1992 ewe premium scheme.</P>
      <P>As pointed out in my reply of 8 April last, applicants under the 1992 ewe premium scheme were required to keep on their holding for 100 days from 14 March 1992 to 21 June 1992 the number of eligible ewes on which they applied for premium.  As the person named did not fulfil this requirement she was not entitled to be paid premium under the 1992 scheme.</P>

      <P>INTERREG for Ireland includes a tourism sub-programme the objective of which is the development and marketing of the Border area, North and South, as a desirable holiday destination.  Total funding allocated for the sub-programme is £13.3 million of which some £9.5 million is available for approved developments on the southern side of the Border.</P>

Comparable figures for 1993 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>Figures for total investment, involving both the private sector and a range of public/similar bodies in tourism development over the last ten years are not available in my Department.  However, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table providing details of expenditure under the aegis of my Department, on tourism infrastructure, including funding from the EC, between 1983 and 1992.  Also, shown for the information of the House, are the amounts of funds provided to Bord Fáilte by the International Fund for Ireland since 1987 for tourism development in the Border area. This table does not reflect support for marketing and other aspects of tourism development including annual Exchequer Grant-in-Aid to Bord Fáilte, SFADCo and CERT.</P>
      <P>Total support for capital investment in tourism over the period 1983-1992 was £126 million, levering further investment of some £520 million.  Private investment outside State supported schemes would be considerable, and is not included in this figure.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of defining South East Asia I have taken the ASEAN group (Association of South East Asian Nations &mdash; comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines).</P>
      <P>ASEAN is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world with many of its countries having growth rates in excess of 6 per cent per annum.  Ireland's overall trade with the region has shown a steady increase, especially over the last five years.  Merchandise and service exports to the ASEAN region continue to grow.  Irish companies in the construction, aviation, healthcare and educational services have been particularly successful and overall prospects point to continued expansion with this region.</P>
      <P>I will circulate in the Official Report tabular statements which details Ireland's trade (imports and exports) with the ASEAN countries in each of the past ten years.  These figures refer to merchandise trade and do not include trade in services.</P>

      <P>Trade between Ireland and <Col N="549" /> the Peoples Republic of China over the last number of years has been disappointingly small and does not reflect the potential of both economies.  In particular, our exports to China have remained at a very low level resulting in a large trade balance in favour of China.</P>
      <P>In recent times China has been making efforts to move towards a market based economy and this, allied to the gradual opening up of their market will hopefully benefit Irish exporters.  In April of this year I led a group of eleven Irish aviation services companies on a trade mission to China.  I found that the market for aviation services throughout Asia and especially China is growing and Ireland, as a major international centre for the industry, is well placed to take advantage of this growth.</P>
      <P>I will circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement which details Ireland's trade (imports and exports) with the Peoples Republic of China in each of the past three years.  These figures refer to merchandise trade and do not include trade in services which I believe shows the greatest potential for expansion with the Peoples Republic of China.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Over the last ten years imports from Malaysia have doubled while our exports have trebled albeit from a lower base figure.  I am anxious that our trade with Malaysia should increase both in merchandise exports and in the services sector.  It was with this in mind that I accompanied the Taoiseach on an official visit to Malaysia from 27 to 30 May, 1993.  Nineteen Irish companies from the services sector with a particular focus on education, healthcare, engineering consultancy and aviation made up the trade mission part of the delegation.</P>
      <P>During the course of the visit, business worth $60 million was negotiated.  I am convinced that this market is one in which Irish companies can effectively and profitably increase their market share.</P>
      <P>I will circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement which details Ireland's trade (imports and exports) with Malaysia in each of the past ten years.  These figures refer to merchandise trade and do not include trade in services which I believe shows the greatest potential for expansion with Malaysia.</P>

      <P>The most important aspect of the Maastricht Treaty in so far as my Department is concerned is the inclusion of a new title on Trans-European Networks (Title XII) which provides for the establishment and development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures.  The aim is to promote the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to such networks.  Particular account is to be taken of the need to link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the centre regions of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to achieve these objectives the new Article provides that the Community shall establish a series of guidelines to identify projects of common interest. Discussions are continuing in the Council Working Groups on these draft guidelines and Ireland is participating actively in the work.  The projects already included in the guidelines must then be <Col N="556" /> approved by the Council of Ministers and may be eligible for assistance by the EC. Projects in the transport area have been submitted by my Department to the EC Commission for assistance under the new Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>In the energy sector, discussions to date on the draft guidelines for the development of trans-European networks have recognised the importance of connecting peripheral regions to the Community network and have listed an Ireland-UK electricity interconnector as a priority project.  Also listed are a proposed liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and a possible Ireland North/South natural gas link.  The feasibility of an electricity interconnector is currently being evaluated.</P>

    <P>The position in regard to implementation is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 1:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The delay in transposing this Directive is due to the complex nature of the transposing regulations and the necessity to consult with a variety of interests.  Statutory provisions for implementation are expected to be made by 31 December, 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 2:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Department is currently finalising arrangements for the implementation of this Directive following an extensive process of consultation with tourism and travel industry representatives.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 3:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The requirements of this Directive are being complied with.  Both ESB and BGE are supplying the necessary information and statistics by way of administrative arrangements.  However, statutory effect to the Directive will be given by a provision contained in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently being drafted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 4:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Measures implementing the Council Regulation have been undertaken on an administrative basis.  Procedures to transpose the Regulation into domestic legislation have commenced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 5:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Statutory provision for the implementation of this Directive are expected to be made by the end of September this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 6:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Statutory measures to give effect to this Directive will be taken within the timescale laid down in the Directive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other measures:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Single Market in air transport for passengers and freight came into effect on 1 January, 1993.  The Council Regulations giving effect to the Single Market are directly applicable in all member states.  Statutory Instruments are being prepared under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965 to bring existing domestic legislation into line with the provisions of the Regulations.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers for Transport at their meeting in Luxembourg on 19 June 1993, agreed to the progressive introduction of full road freight cabotage by 1 July 1988.  This agreement will enable Irish hauliers to carry out road haulage operations domestically within the territory of other EC member states. It is unclear until a final text of the agreement is available, what measures, if any, will require to be taken for its implementation.</P>

      <P>My office has been in correspondence with Wicklow County Council about the possibility of extension of the natural gas network in County Wicklow.  I would point out to the Deputy, however, that Bord Gais Éireann has a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis and proposals for the extension of the natural gas grid must be assessed by the Board in the light of that obligation.</P>
      <P>Bord Gais currently supplies gas to Bray.  I am advised by the Board, however, that the possibility of an extension of the grid to other parts of the county is unlikely in the short term as it would not be financially viable without grant assistance.  It is too early at this stage to know if EC assistance will be available for projects relating to extension of the gas transmission system.</P>

    <P>At EC level the final component in the full liberalisation of road haulage transport <Col N="560" /> was agreed, subject to adoption of legal texts in due course, at the Council of Ministers meeting of 19 June 1993. This agreement involves the admission from 1 July 1998, without quantitative restrictions, of duly qualified carriers established in one member state to domestic road haulage services in any other member state and also provides for progressive easing of the existing quantitative restrictions on such operations in the interim period.</P>
    <P>With regard to road passenger transport, I would refer the Deputy to Question No. 229 of 4 May, Volume 430 No. 2, columns 294 and 295.</P>

      <P>The Government is maintaining a strong claim for the location of the proposed European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in Dublin.  I have arranged for an up-dating of the brochure in support of Ireland's application.  The Taoiseach and I will be personally pursuing our case with our EC counter parts during the months up to the next EC heads of State summit meeting.</P>
      <P>A number of other countries have also expressed an interest in the siting of the Agency but I believe that there are substantial reasons why the community's interests and the interests of the pharmaceutical industry would be best served if Dublin were chosen.  Ireland has a longestablished and recognised expertise in medicine and science, including the evaluation, licensing and control of medicines. All the technical and other resources necessary to support the Agency are readily available in Dublin and generally at a lower cost than other Community capitals.</P>

      <P>The Government has approved a new four year Agreement between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on the price of drugs.  The Agreement will come into effect on 1 August 1993.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the Agreement include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a reduction of over 6 per cent in the cost of GMS drugs.  This reduction is achieved through an immediate price decrease of 3 per cent on all drugs and an increase in the rebate payable on drugs supplied under the GMS Scheme from 2 per cent to 5 per cent;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a price freeze for a period of four years.  The price will be subject to review, however, if during this time there is an average movement in cumulative currency adjusted price indices across a basket of European countries in excess of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Industry has agreed to make a once-off <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of about £2m to compensate for currency fluctuations over the last year of the current Agreement.</P>
      <P>The new Agreement sets the maximum price for all drugs prescribable and reimbursable in the GMS scheme and all medicines supplied to hospitals and health boards.  It provides that a minimum discount of 15 per cent shall be obtainable on supplies to hospitals and explicity recognises the right of such bodies to negotiate better terms with individual manufacturers, importers or agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Agreement the price of new products coming on the market will be <Col N="565" /> linked to the lesser of the currency adjusted UK price and the average price of the same product in a basket of European countries.  In an innovative clause, the price of New Chemical Entities will be subject to review after two years to ensure that the cost impact of such products does not distort the market.</P>
    <P>This Agreement is an integral part of my Department's overall drugs strategy aimed at containing the cost of drugs to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the cumulative effect of the price concessions could yield savings to the Exchequer of up to £15m per annum.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to approve the new Agreement was taken after careful consideration of all the options available.  It is the view of the Government that the terms proposed provide the best available protection of the interests of patients and taxpayers.</P>

The Treaty in so far as it relates to health, provides for joint action by the member states and the Commission and this will be more effective than individual action at national level.  Discussions are ongoing with our EC partners on the measures to be taken in this context. Progress on these discussions is likely to accelerate once the ratification process has been completed.</P>

    <P>&mdash;The freedom of movement of mental handicap, psychiatric and sick children's nurses needs to be covered by an amendment to the Statutory Instrument which implemented the general systems directive on the mutual recognition of higher education diplomas.  The amendment should also cover public health nurses and nurse tutors so that these nurses can practise in their specialism in other member states.  The freedom of movement of general nurses and midwives was the subject of separate sectoral directives which were implemented by the Nurses Act, 1985.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the potential for the development of international language learning and international education services generally, both in Dublin and in the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>Measures have already been taken to develop this potential through, in particular, the recent establishment of the International Education Board Ireland. This agency is representative of all institutions involved in the provision of international education services, including language schools, together with Government Departments, Bord Fáilte and an Bord Tráchtála.  It will provide expert marketing and promotional services for the sector.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> English as a Foreign Language is a major element in the overall provision and in this respect particular emphasis is being placed on the need for quality control.  For this purpose a new Advisory Council for English Language Schools is being established which will put in place the control mechanisms to ensure the highest standards in the industry.</P>

I will arrange for a copy to be sent to the Deputy and a copy to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>CONASC outlines Irish involvement in the EC programmes such as Erasmus, Comett, Lingua, Petra, Eurydice, Helios etc. in the education and training area as well as the programmes for Youth Exchanges and Young Workers.

      <P>The aspect of the Single Market which comes within the remit of my Department, concerns the two EC Directives on the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications.  Council Directive 89/48/EEC provides for a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years duration. This Directive was implemented by a Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 1 of 1991) on 2 January 1991.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 92/51/EEC is a complementary Directive to 89/48/EEC and covers all regulated professions requiring education/training below the level of three years higher education which are not already covered by sectoral Directives.  Directive 92/51 was adopted on 18 June 1992 and member states have until 18 June 1994 to transpose it into national law.  Preparations for the transposition of this Directive are at an advanced stage and I anticipate transposition before that date.</P>
