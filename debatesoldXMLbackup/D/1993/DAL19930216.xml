      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a detailed statement in the House on 16 December last on the Edinburgh European Council which I attended with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance, as well as the Minister of State for European Affairs.  I have sent the Deputy a copy for his information.  As the statement makes clear, we faced a very full and challenging agenda at Edinburgh, covering issues such as the future financing of the Community; the opening of the Community to new members; the question of Denmark <Col N="2" /> and the Maastricht Treaty; subsidiarity and the related issue of openness/ transparency; and the question of concerted action by the Community to promote economic growth and to combat unemployment.  The currency crisis was a major subject of a separate, parallel meeting in Edinburgh of Community Finance Ministers.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there was no sparing of effort in pursuing our concerns on currency matters either at Edinburgh or in every other appropriate forum and manner, including through diplomatic channels. At Edinburgh, the key agenda item for Ireland was, of course, the question of Community financing up to the end of this century and in particular the resources to be allocated to us by way of the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund.  As everyone is aware, <Col N="3" /> our negotiating efforts in the lead-up to Edinburgh and at the meeting itself met with enormous success, securing for Ireland over £8 billion over the period 1993 to 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for letting me have the statement again in which he said:</P>
      <P>The Edinburgh meeting has again underlined the commitment of the member states to implementing the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of solidarity and co-operation.  The exchange rate mechanism of the EMS is a central building block in that process, and the Government are satisfied that the full solidarity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one line left.</P>
      <P>&mdash;and resources of all participants are available to uphold the ERM in the face of unwarranted speculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is continuing to quote.  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that the united front still holds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been made clear by the Minister for Finance and others on many occasions that there are strict requirements on the ERM from member states that the country at the top of the band must support the country at the bottom of the band and that requirement was fully operational at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, did the Taoiseach seek a bilateral meeting with the German Chancellor, Mr. Kohl, bearing in mind that the French Government, at a very senior political level in bilateral political contacts with Germany, managed to get what our Minister for Finance <Col N="4" /> subsequently described as a &ldquo;sweetheart deal&rdquo; and which was reported here last week as having saved the French franc? Did the Taoiseach press at a high political level for such a meeting?  Will he accept that a one line reference to the ERM in 120 pages of conclusions from the Edinburgh Summit represents an utter and object political failure on his part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says in part and I am sure he would agree that at all times I made our problems in relation to the ERM clear to our partners as far back as last October when I visited Prime Minister Gonzalez in Spain.  When we met we both agreed to an early meeting under the presidency, the Birmingham Summit, which proved to be futile and unsuccessful in resolving the problems of the ERM.  Consequently, it was passed on to the technical monetary committee to look at the weaknesses of the system and report to Edinburgh.  During the lead-up to the Edinburgh Summit the presidency agreed with other members that the Finance Ministers as well as a technical committee should be also brought to Edinburgh for a parallel meeting to assess the situation in relation to the ERM. The weakness of the system needs to be rectified quickly &mdash; something we have pointed out at all times, albeit without success so far.  The devaluation of the Irish punt brought home to other member states, the fact that the system &mdash; not a particular currency &mdash; was under attack.  It is receiving a different type of attention now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Bundesbank represented at Edinburgh and, if so, did the Irish authorities make representations to it?  Secondly, what proposals did Ireland table in regard to the ERM at Edinburgh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, as a former Minister for Finance, should be fully aware of how these matters are handled.  He previously attended one such meeting and should be aware that <Col N="5" /> the Department of Finance handles all matters in relation to currency.</P>
      <P>Consequently, this topic has been high on the agenda of all meetings of central bankers, monetary committees and ECOFIN Ministers for a number of months.  We have spared no effort and lost no opportunity to voice our opinion in relation to the weaknesses of the system which have still to be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not continue unduly long on any one question.  I am calling Deputy Bruton for a brief question please, and I will call Deputy Austin Deasy for a final question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try again.  Did the Irish authorities make any representations to the Bundesbank at Edinburgh and did the Irish authorities table any proposals in relation to the ERM at Edinburgh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governor of the Central Bank is, I am sure, one of the authorities the Deputy has in mind and, without having a specific statement from him, the Deputy can take it from me that the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach took every opportunity at Edinburgh to let them know our position in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an answer to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be more forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be accused of repetition, although the question is <Col N="6" /> similar.  Did the Taoiseach specifically raise the matter of the ERM with regard to Ireland at that Edinburgh Summit and, if so, what response did he get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made clear all the efforts and the initiatives taken in regard to it and I have nothing further to add.  I raised the matter in Spain at a bilateral meeting, again in Birmingham and also at the Edinburgh Summit.  I raised it with Chancellor Kohl in November, during the election campaign, when I was there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What response did the Taoiseach get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I raised it at a private meeting <i>en marge</i> with Chancellor Kohl at Edinburgh itself whose best view at that time was that interest rates would probably come down at the end of January or the beginning of February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the Government provided for a range of improvements in social welfare services, including a 4 per cent increase in payments and special increases in the lowest payment rates.  These improvements increased social welfare expenditure by some £85 million in 1992 and £162 million in a full year.  Overall expenditure on social welfare services increased from around £3.1 billion in 1991 to an estimated £3.4 billion in 1992. A number of measures were adopted to make resources available for improvements. Where particular difficulties emerged in relation to certain measures, arrangements were made to revise them.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing the measures and any changes considered necessary in the light of that review will be provided for in the context of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the description of these cuts in the leaflet by Deputy Stagg, now Minister of State, as the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am surprised you have allowed this language here because it is not usual parliamentary language.  I have told the Deputy of the <Col N="21" /> extra amounts of money supplied last year for social welfare services and I have said that I am reviewing these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the words &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; are not parliamentary language.  They are not my words but the words of his colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal, Deputy Stagg, and of Senator Wall, who was nominated to the Seanad last week by the Taoiseach.  Is the Minister conscious of the great hardship that has been caused to many social welfare recipients by those cuts?  Will he assure the House that in keeping with their word, this new so-called partnership Government, which includes the Labour Party who said they were against the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts, will now reverse these cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to re-address the last general election.  Some of these measures were necessary in the development of the social welfare system.  Some may not have been desirable and in effect we are looking at their impact in light of the review that will take place.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will report on the progress made in the preparation of the charter on voluntary social services; and when the promised White Paper outlining the Government's proposals in this area will be published.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of a White Paper and charter on voluntary activity will be one of the most important developments in relation to the voluntary sector in this country for many years.  It will set out a framework for partnerships between the State and voluntary bodies and develop a cohesive strategy for supporting voluntary activity.  It is essential in this context that both the statutory and voluntary sectors have adequate opportunity to fully consider all the issues <Col N="22" /> involved and the implications for them of any proposals which may be made.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental task force has been set up under the chairmanship of my Department to assist in the preparation of the White Paper and charter. The task force includes Government Departments with major involvement with voluntary organisations.  The views of health boards, local authorities and other State agencies are being taken on board in the context of the work of the task force.</P>
      <P>An expert group drawn from the voluntary sector to mediate the views and concerns of that sector and to act as a resource to the task force has also been established.  The membership of the expert group has been drawn from people with wide knowledge of voluntary activity and with a detailed knowledge of the issues facing the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>Much of the preliminary work necessary for the preparation of a White Paper and charter has been completed within my Department.  The task force, with the assistance of the expert group, will shortly put together detailed proposals for the content of the charter for voluntary activity.  It is intended that the task force will report to Government by the end of June 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply is very long on aspiration.  The question relates to funding and I would like to know if the task has put any intellectual energy into distributing funding.  For example, has the task force any intention of supporting the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed?  Many voluntary agencies take up the slack for the Department of Social Welfare who should be doing the work.  This is at the coalface of welfare rights.  In 1992 the Department of Social Welfare made funding available for a welfare resource officer with the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed. Does the Minister intend to renew his commitment in this regard? Many of these organisations spend most of their time and intellectual energy fundraising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed know I have given them support and commitment over a number of years and they can rest assured that I will recognise their needs in this regard.  Recently they took part in the pre-budget forum.  Social welfare officers are very much involved at the coalface throughout the country.  One step that has been taken recently is the appointment of information officers in most of the main social welfare centres to ensure that there is a communications link for people who are dependent on social welfare.  The purpose of the charter is much more far-reaching.  It will deal with the relationship between voluntary bodies and the State, semi-State and local authority sectors and the basis to be adopted for the future working relationship, including the framework for financing. The matter of current financing is a different question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that Question No. 11 comes first.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme health boards are empowered to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  The intention was that such payments would provide a safety net for people at times when they cannot manage because of circumstances which are out of the ordinary.</P>
      <P>In recent years one of the main items for which payments under this heading have been made is electricity or gas.  In certain areas such payments have been made regularly to the same clients.  The fact that regular payments in respect of electricity or gas are made in certain areas and not in others has also resulted in considerable inconsistency between different health boards in the administration of this aspect of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Circular 14/92 was designed to introduce a degree of consistency into the administration of exceptional needs payments across health boards by offering guidance to boards in respect of such payments.  The circular did not remove the basic discretion or responsibility which health boards have to make payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Indeed it could not remove this discretion.  It is built into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circular 18/92 replaced Circular 14/92 as guidance on exceptional need payments for fuel debts.  It was issued to remove any doubts which might be expressed with regard to the discretion of health boards.  The circular offered <Col N="26" /> guidance on the circumstances in which exceptional needs payments might be used to help with fuel debts.  The circular advised that health boards should consider assistance only where exceptional circumstances, such as ill health, have given rise to higher consumption or where inability to meet a fuel bill arose from other exceptional circumstances. The circular also said that payment should be conditional on the client making use of schemes such as the ESB or gas easypay schemes or, where available, a card meter.  In general payment should not exceed £100.</P>
    <P>It was considered that the above guidance would cover the majority of exceptional needs requests.  However, the circular made it clear that a health board may authorise a payment in excess of £100 or indeed a further payment, if a board considers it justified in a particular case.</P>

      <P>An advisory committee, including representation from all the health boards, was set up in September 1992 with the objective of addressing the problem of inconsistency in decision making.

I am also reviewing the legislation and, <Col N="28" /> should changes be required to ensure greater consistency in the application of the scheme, I will bring forward appropriate proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>When the previous Government and the one before it wanted to introduce cuts they called them &ldquo;savings&rdquo;.  Now the Government is calling them &ldquo;introducing consistencies&rdquo;.

Reference was made to consistency.  Under the legislation, the health boards still have the discretionary power in this area. The purpose of the circular in the first instance was to introduce a degree of consistency across the different health boards and within health board areas. When difficulties arose with the circular, a meeting was held between SIPTU and the previous Minister.  Following that meeting the second circular was issued. That is how the second circular came about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, unlike other social welfare schemes, is administered by the health boards.  Under the legislation governing the scheme the determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board.  The legislation also provides for an appeals process and an appeals officer has been appointed in every board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I have recognised that there are a number of aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which require review.  In this regard an advisory group under the chairmanship of my Department has been established with representatives from all health boards.  The question of standardising practices in relation to appeals has been discussed by the group and the observations of appeals officers in the health boards have been invited.</P>
      <P>The object of the review is to improve consistency and to ensure equity for all appellants.  Of particular importance will be the provision of improved information to the client on the right to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the appeals system can be improved significantly by introducing better quality information for clients, standardising application forms and explaining decisions to clients.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is designed to offer immediate assistance to people in need and therefore a rapid and localised response to supplementary welfare allowance appeals is required.  Given <Col N="36" /> the context in which the scheme operates, the capacity of the scheme to determine appeals speedily and simply could be lost if a more formalised appeals structure were to be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, since this is a scheme of last resort, that it is important that appellants under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme perceive that they have an independent body to hear their appeals? At the moment health officers can hear the appeal from another health board officer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be greater accountability and perception by appellants of a better service if an independent body heard their appeals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, it is essentially a health board matter, but we are in discussion with the health board about the operation of the system as a whole including the appeals process.  Once those discussions have been completed, we will see what action it is best to take. There is one element which is important to maintain and that is the speed and simplicity of the appeals system.  I agree with the Deputy that clear information should be available.  We will make sure that the committee realises the importance of this kind of communication.  As Deputy O'Donnell may know, a social welfare appeals office was established in the Department of Social Welfare which, in general terms, has been working very well and was well accepted.  These are matters currently under consideration and we await the outcome of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the supplementary welfare system has proved its great worth in the past number of years because of the very <Col N="37" /> deep recession and the level of poverty and unemployment?  Would he not also agree that, while considering the necessity of an independent appeal, it would be very important to retain the essential informality and urgency of the supplementary welfare system?  Would the Minister assure the House that in bringing about any desirable independence for the appeals system he will not detract from either the informality or urgency of the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that both the informality and urgency are particularly important in the case of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  It is a very important scheme. As Deputies who are Members of the House for some years will know, one of the things I did in the past to deal with inconsistencies was to introduce, for instance, a national fuel scheme so that the vast majority of fuel payments are made by the Department of Social Welfare on a standardised basis.  Of course, there are still exceptional fuel needs which can arise and they are met, in relatively small numbers, by the boards. The back to school scheme was another attempt to achieve consistency in the boards.  The question of allowing discretion and yet ensuring a degree of consistency in treatment in different health board areas, even in different areas within one health board, can be a problem. In relation to appeals, I agree with the Deputy that in this case, they should be as informal and urgent as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that to use the word &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; and &ldquo;discretion&rdquo; are contradictory and that the whole purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance was to give discretion to the community welfare officer in particular to deal with individual cases at the coalface that were not covered under legislation?  Would he not agree that by using the word &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; he is endeavouring to turn the supplementary welfare allowance into another social welfare scheme?  There is clear evidence of this from the fact that community welfare <Col N="38" /> officers were recently given an instruction not to pay any ESB bills despite the fact that in many cases the community welfare officer wanted to use his or her discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two problems here.  We want to give them discretion and discretionary powers but we cannot end up with a situation where just down the road another community welfare officer is making very different decisions in relation to similar cases.  That is where the problem arises.  All we can do in those circumstances is to ask the people involved to come together to try to bring a reasonable degree of consistency into the approach.  Having said that, we are not directly responsible for the administration in any event.  We provide the funds &mdash; over £100 million in the year just completed &mdash; but, as the Deputies know, community welfare officers work to the individual health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not worried that expenditure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has increased from £40 million to £100 million in the last three years and that this scheme is fast becoming a bloated catch-all scheme, taking the people who are falling out of benefit from the mainstream social welfare system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure in a number of areas has increased.  I am not worried. Of course one has always to be concerned that expenditure is expended in accordance with legislation and the wishes of the House.  For instance, housing was one of the areas where expenditure increased considerably.  The increase in the number of unemployed and lone parents led to a greater demand on the scheme.  I would look at that to see if any elements in it could be standardised and applied in a standard way, but after that one is back to the discretionary powers of the community welfare officers.  We are reviewing it generally at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>My Department was informed by the Radioactive Substances Division of the UK Department of the Environment at 17.15 hrs on Friday, 12 February 1992 of a radioactive discharge from Sellafield which took place on Thursday, 11 February. Increased alpha discharges from building 204 chimney stack were detected.  The source is believed to be from building 203, which is known to be contaminated.  There are several ventilation lines from building 203 which are discharged through the building 204 stack.  Building 203 is an old, obsolete building which ceased operation during the eighties and is undergoing preparatory work prior to decommissioning. It was a plutonium purification plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the initial report, the current best estimate of the likely discharge is 1,000 mega becquerels; the permitted annual maximum is 4,300 mega becquerels. Further information was <Col N="41" /> received on Monday, 15 February, at 16.00 hrs from the British Embassy, Dublin, who had received this material directly from BNFL.  This information stated that activity levels returned to normal parameters by Saturday afternoon, 13 February, and that there had been no breach of existing statutory discharge authorisations.</P>
    <P>Preliminary assessments indicate that the discharge equated to 25 per cent of the annual stack discharge limit.  The Radiological Protection Institute in Ireland has a network of seven continuous air sampling stations in operation. Air filters from two of these stations, Dublin and Clones, have been analysed using total alpha beta counting and high resolution gamma spectroscopy. Whilst the analyses are continuing, no increased radiation levels have been detected and it is not expected that any will be detected.  There is, therefore, no risk to the health and safety of the Irish public.  The institute, however, will keep the situation under continuous review.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought more detailed information on the incident from the UK authorities &mdash; for example, the radionuclides involved in the discharge. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate visited the site on Saturday, 13 February, to investigate the background to the release.  Building 203 is a redundant building which has been shut down for ten years.  I understand that, as part of the preparatory work on decommissioning, a small amount of alpha emitting radioactive material was disturbed and emitted into the atmosphere. It is estimated that from the start of the incident to date about 1,000 mega becquerels of activity has been released. The most recent results show that emissions are down to about 20 mega becquerels over a 24 hour period.  According to the UK Minister for the Environment the incident is regarded as serious, although it is well within safety limits.  I understand that the incident will be the subject of a full investigation with further visits to the site by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the NII.  The UK Minister <Col N="42" /> for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food inspectors will also be taking samples around the site perimeter.</P>
    <P>I wrote today to Mr. David McLean, Minister of State, UK Department of the Environment, expressing my concern at the delay in BNFL reporting the incident to his Department, which in turn led to a delay in my Department being informed of the incident.  I have again reiterated my concern at the safety of the entire plant and again called for its closure.  This incident, like the leakage of plutonium from an evaporator at the Sellafield site which took place in September of last year, raises justified fears about the safety standards at Sellafield. This includes past, current and proposed operations.  I repeat that the policy of this Government is that we want Sellafield shut down.  Our concerns regarding its continued operation are and have been constantly raised at all relevant international fora.</P>
    <P>It is my wish and that of the Government that all discharges of radioactivity from Sellafield be eliminated.  The Government also objects to any extension to the Sellafield plant and in this context I am particularly concerned about the bringing on stream of the THORP plant.  The bringing on stream of this plant represents an additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the Irish population.  The Government is also concerned about shipments of spent fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea.  Thorp was originally given the go-ahead in 1977, when nuclear power was still generally believed to have a prosperous future and reprocessing was thought to be a key factor in the uranium fuel cycle.  Today the arguments are not convincing.  The anticipated expansion of nuclear power has not materialised and the plutonium and uranium recovered from spent fuel are no longer required for reasons of economy or security of supply.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have called for the UK authorities to hold a public inquiry on THORP which would deal with the basis for operating the plant.  I consider that the draft discharge authorisations <Col N="43" /> should incorporate crypton 85 gas removal technology and the proposed discharge limits for other gaseous and also liquid wastes are excessive.  The views contained in the Government's submission regarding THORP are without prejudice to the Government's wish to see all reprocessing at the Sellafield complex shut down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to be assured that there is no risk to health and safety and that the extent of the leak was within statutory limits.  I ask the Minister how we can be so sure of that, given that BNFL did not report the leak until 24 hours after it occured, that the report of the leak did not reach the Minister's Department until 26 hours after it occurred and that it was not inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate until two days after the leak occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, a full inquiry is being undertaken with the UK authorities in relation to this incident. Further information will become available at that stage.  I agree, as has been general Government policy, that we do not wish to see Sellafield continuing and we have made that very clear.  We have within our own Radiological Protection Institute readings which were taken from our stations and which show that the level is not such as to cause alarm.  That is not to say we will not continue to monitor the situation and seek further information.  When any further information becomes available we will make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that a quarter of the whole annual limit for discharge for a year should take place in a period of 48 hours or less?  Is he aware that the British propose to reduce the 4,000 per annum figure to 1,000, so what happened over that weekend is the equivalent of what will shortly be the annual discharge figure happening in a period of 48 hours?  On the question of our stations, it fortunately happened for us that the wind over the <Col N="44" /> weekend was not easterly.  If it were the story would be very different indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, as I said in my reply, this has been a serious incident.  I take the point that 1,000 mega becquerels is a discharge which would certainly have cause for concern.  I am also aware that the limits at present are 4,300 and may change.  The point I wish to get across is that, from our monitoring the situation is as I have given it: there is not cause for concern at this stage.  It would be wrong of us to be alarmist about it.  I take on board that it is a serious incident.  We have made our views on the matter very clear to the UK authorities.  It is an area of policy where there is unanimity on all sides of the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister established whether the Sellafield authorities were in breach of international law by waiting 24 hours before reporting the incident?  Furthermore, could he explain to the House why it took him until today to register a protest by means of a letter to the British authorities?  Does he consider this sufficient to protect the lives of Irish people?</P>

It is important that we take readings from our own stations before we do anything else. It is all part of the information that has come to us today from the British Embassy.  We have made clear, and I have made clear in my reply, the concerns we have in relation to that situation and we will continue to monitor it closely.

A case being brought in the High Court in London seeking to establish a causal link between Sellafield discharges and the instances of leukaemia in the Cumbrian region is being monitored closely by my Department. The outcome of that case would give us ideas how to successfully bring any such action.  The situation is under continuing review.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate the Minister's concern on this matter but given the delay by British Nuclear Fuels to notify the British authorities of the leak, would he discuss with his UK counterpart the possibility of establishing a permanent, independent, monitoring regime at Sellafield?  This is the <Col N="47" /> umpteenth occasion this has occurred. Second, given that permission to set up the THORP plant was granted 16 years ago under environmental conditions that were very different from those which exist today, will the Minister ask the authorities in Britain to have an environmental impact study carried out on the proposed THORP plant with a view to improving the conditions that will operate when it is open?  Since ships carrying spent fuel to the THORP plant will travel the Irish Sea very close to the Irish coastline, is the Minister satisfied that we have the appropriate emergency plans in place if an accident were to occur?  Will he discuss the possibility on getting co-operation and help from the European Community in relation to these matters as this would be extremely costly for a small nation like ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have called for more than an environmental impact assessment; I have called for a full public inquiry in the UK in relation to the THORP reprocessing plant.  Our concerns are such that that is a legitimate request to make.  We will continue to to seek that public inquiry before the THORP plant goes ahead.</P>
      <P>Clearly there are contingency plans within the Department in the event of any disaster happening during the shipping of waste materials to and from Sellafield.  It is important for the House to know that, the Department's record in terms of its vigilance has been well established down the years and we will continue to look at this matter and ensure as far as we can, that the fullest disclosures are forthcoming from everyone concerned and that everything is within safety limits. However, that in no way diminishes our concern or the level of representation we will be making.  We can satisfy ourselves &mdash; and I can satisfy the House &mdash; that all proper and appropriate steps are taken to ensure that this does not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking the Chair's permission for the suspension of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate the confusing and misleading nature of statements by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs after their devaluation of the pound.  These concern the alleged lack of European assistance for the Irish pound within the ERM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These statements conflict with the recent statement by Dr. Hans Tictmeyer of the German Bundesbank, which was subsequently confirmed by the Irish Department of Finance on Sunday, that the Bundesbank had given all the assistance requested by Ireland in this context. Dr. Tictmeyer's statement was made after the conclusion of the recent Dáil debate on currency policy.  It has created the impression that the Minister either failed to make any request at all or, if he did make it, made it in an imcompetent and misdirected way.  Consistency, clarity and credibility in international statements by Irish Ministers is essential to belief in Irish currency policy.  In the light of continuing turbulence on currency markets the matter is urgent and important <Col N="162" /> and, in accordance with the Standing Order, a debate would be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware from the explanatory memorandum already circulated, the purpose of this Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta by £22.5 million, that is from £77.5 million to £100 million, to authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares up to the new level of £100 million and to increase the company's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee by £20 million from the existing limit of £180 million to £200 million.  The text of the Bill is in standard format and should not give rise to any major difficulty.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years the company and its financial difficulties has been the subject of much attention and debate within the Oireachtas and I will now briefly outline the background which has given rise to the necessity for this legislation.</P>
      <P>NET was established in 1961 as a State-sponsored company to manufacture nitrogenous fertilisers at Arklow.  The company started in a relatively modest way but expanded to the stage where, after the completion of the Marino Point plant in 1979, it was one of the largest manufacturing companies and a major chemical undertaking employing over 1,500 people.  While the Arklow plant operated profitably up to the early seventies the growth of import competition pushed it into a loss making situation from 1974.  The construction of the Marino Point plant to produce ammonia for natural gas and the cost overruns which pushed the final cost of this project up to £137 million, largely funded by borrowings, left NET with a burden of debt from which they have never freed themselves despite extensive support from State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State support afforded has been of enormous proportions.  Initially the Arklow plant was funded by borrowings. <Col N="172" /> The Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 1963, had set the issued share capital at only £100 but provided for State advances of up to £6 million and a facility to borrow £1 million with a ministerial guarantee. In 1970 the company was put on a more commercial basis when the share capital was increased to £7.5 million including £3.5 million in the capitalisation of State advances and the limit for loan guarantees increases to £2 million.</P>
    <P>As the construction of the Marino Point plant advanced the share capital was increased in 1977 to £27.5 million and the limit for State guarantees increased to £30 million.  By 1981 it was necessary because of the company's dire financial situation to come back to the Oireachtas to provide another £100 million for NET, £50 million by way of additional equity and a further £50 million in State guarantees for its borrowings.  In 1987 with the setting up of the joint venture with ICI, the old core debt of over £160 million was left with NET and legislation introduced to increase the limit for ministerial guarantees on NET's borrowings from £150 million to £180 million to enable the issue of a State guarantee for the full debt.</P>
    <P>By the early eighties it was clearly recognised that because of the cost overruns and operating losses in the early years of the Marino Point plant, a substantial part of the NET debt was a sunk cost which could not be expected to be recovered.  The overall size of the debt and the costs of servicing it were such as to keep the future of NET's fertiliser business and that of its employees in constant jeopardy.  However, the future of the business was safeguarded with the formation of the joint venture with Imperial Chemical Industries in 1987 whereby NET's fertiliser businesses at Cork and Arklow and ICI's Richardsons Fertilizers at Belfast were transferred to the new joint venture company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited, with NET's old core capital debt, most of which was guaranteed by the State, left with NET.</P>
    <P>Under the joint venture arrangements NET took a 51 per cent shareholding in the new company with ICI taking the <Col N="173" /> remaining 49 per cent.  In addition, NET entered into a long term agreement with IFI for the supply of its gas allocation at an arm's length price to IFI.  The old accumulated NET debt, which was £164.6 million on 30 September 1987, remained with NET with the intention that NET would service the borrowings involved from its income from profits on the sale of gas to Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited and dividends from that company.  Since 1987, therefore, NET's primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI.</P>
    <P>While the new joint venture company, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited, has operated quite profitably since it commenced trading on 1 October 1987, the combined income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borowings.  As a result, the shortfall in interest has had to be converted into new State guaranteed borrowings with the result that overall borrowings have continued to grow and have now reached £180 million.  This is the maximum that may be guaranteed by the State under the provisions of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts.</P>
    <P>The following figures illustrate the situation. At the setting up of the joint venture in 1987, the debt remaining with NET, after working capital adjustments, was £164.6 million.  Over the ensuing five years ending on 30 September 1992, on a cash flow basis NET received a net income of £70.9 million from IFI but the interest payments on its massive debt over those five years amounted to £85.2 million &mdash; a shortfall of £14.3 million. The addition to this shortfall of operating expenses left NET with a closing debt of £179.9 million on 30 September 1992.</P>
    <P>The principal reason for the shortfall in NET's income and the consequential build up in its debt, has been the comparative weakness over recent years of oil prices in Irish pound terms on which the basic price that Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited pays NET for its supply of <Col N="174" /> natural gas is based.  While the economy at large has benefited considerably from the reduction in international prices for oil, in Irish pound terms, the reverse has been the case for NET.  NET's financial flow has been dependent on four very volatile elements: fertiliser profits, interest rates, the dollar/pound exchange rates and international oil prices.  The behaviour of the three latter elements over the past five years has proved less favourable to NET than earlier expected.</P>
    <P>There was a slight improvement in NET's financial position during 1991, with oil prices high because of the Gulf War and more buoyant prices for fertilisers. However, the position severely deteriorated from the beginning of 1992 with oil prices dropping to their lowest in Irish pound terms since 1987 and the basic gas price payable by Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited consequently the lowest in five years.  With only a marginal reduction in the purchase price payable by NET to BGE for gas, NET's profit margin on sales to Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited was severely reduced.  At the end of 1991, reflecting the buoyant conditions of 1991, NET's net debt situation on a cash flow basis, i.e., borrowings less cash reserves, had come down to £171 million.  However, by the end of September 1992 this had risen to £179.9 million.</P>
    <P>Since September 1992 the already difficult position of NET has considerably worsened because of the devaluation of sterling and the currency crisis.  NET was affected in two ways: first because over 55 per cent of its borrowings are at floating rates, the rise in interest rates greatly increased its interest costs and, secondly, because a substantial proportion of IFI's income is dependent on returns from the UK, both by way of sales in Britain and in the results of its Northern Ireland subsidiary, the devaluation of sterling impacted on the profits of Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited for 1991-92, and consequently NET's income from that company.</P>
    <P>Because of this worsening situation, NET's borrowing requirements reached £181.6 million by the end of November <Col N="175" /> 1992 and, as the excess over £180 million could not be rolled over into further bank borrowings because of the £180 million legislative limit on guaranteed borrowings, £1.96 million was issued to the company by way of repayable Exchequer advances.  This was the maximum that could be provided under the Exchequer advances provision of the Nítrigin Éireann Acts but was sufficient to maintain the solvency of NET to nearer the end of December when further major payments became due.  In order to enable NET meet these payments, a grant of £6 million had to be voted for the company in December 1992 to keep it in sufficient funds to meet interest payments due up to March 1993.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that over these five years NET's borrowings were covered by a ministerial guarantee as to payment of both principal and interest and if NET were to default on payment of interest on any particular loan or loans as they fell due, the State, as guarantor, immediately would have become liable to pay.  A default in any payment by NET would have immediate consequences on its future ability to trade and its solvency with direct responsibility for all its borrowings then falling on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>NET's financial difficulties can be traced directly back in time to the cost overruns, funded largely by borrowings in the late seventies, on the construction of the £137 million Marino Point plant to manufacture ammonia and urea from natural gas.  In retrospect, while as a result of this investment we have a strong competitive fertiliser industry employing in excess of 700 on this island, it has been at a very high cost to the taxpayer.  The current situation is that NET has debts in excess of £180 million with the realisable value of its assets probably now worth much less than that.  These assets are its favourable gas contract with BGE and its 51 per cent shareholding in IFI. It must, therefore, be recognised that a substantial proportion of its £180 million debt is a sunk cost which will not be recovered within NET's future income by way of gas price and dividends from <Col N="176" /> IFI.  With NET's income over the past five years inadequate to cover even the interest on its borrowings, the rolling over of each year's shortfall in interest payments into new guaranteed borrowings only further increases the debt which will ultimately have to be met by the State.</P>
    <P>An option that has been given consideration over the past year has been the sale of NET's shares in Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited.  Freed from the old core debt that remained with NET, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited has been trading very profitably.  The Government is interested in discussing with potential purchasers a sale of shares in this highly profitable company but only at the right price.  A number of parties have expressed an interest in that company, particularly since the time that the minority shareholder, ICI, indicated its intention to reduce substantially its fertiliser interests in the UK.  A sale of its shares in IFI on satisfactory terms could substantially improve NET's liquidity in the short to medium-term, but this would also necessitate the negotiation of a new gas agreement.  It would also remove any conflict that might arise between NET's need to maximise receipts from IFI to meet its short term debt servicing requirements and IFI's needs to retain earnings to fund future growth.  While NET has had discussions with interested parties, no definitive offer was made to them.  If such an offer were made it would be a matter first for the board of NET to consider but ultimately a matter for Government decision.</P>
    <P>In the meantime provision has to be made to enable NET to continue to meet its debts.  I must stress that unless this action is taken NET will be insolvent by the end of March leading to the prospect of responsibility for its £180 million in borrowings and the interest accruing, falling directly on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to inform the House today in view of the worsening debt position I am asking the National Treasury Management Agency to look closely at the debt aspect of NET.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Nítrigin <Col N="177" /> Éireann Teoranta Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Chair.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech makes grim listening for many in this House to learn that NET is technically insolvent.  The company has had a chequered history. The Marino Point construction which was costed at £63 million actually cost £137 million.  As the Minister rightly points out, that was the start of the rot as far as this company is concerned.</P>
      <P>This debate raises much wider issues about public policy in this area.  I am disappointed that the Minister skated very lightly over the direction of Government policy in this area.  At present NET takes 25 per cent of our gas, one of the few natural resources we have developed.  The price it pays for that gas is extraordinarily low.  The Culliton report, to which we all now refer deferentially, estimated the extent to which that cost was, in effect, a subsidy.  It showed that the ESB pays almost three times the NET price for gas and the ordinary customer, industry and domestic users, pay more than five times.</P>
      <P>This means that on paper NET pays £14 million for the gas it uses and buys from BGE but it would cost £42 million more if it were paying the same price as ordinary customers.  In other words, over a ten year period, 1982-92, through a hidden subsidy, we have been putting £400 million into NET without any corresponding benefit to that operation which, over that same period, accumulated losses of £222 million.  This is a very serious situation by any reckoning and deserves greater analysis by the Minister on the past and future strategy for this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, in 1987 the State guaranteed £160 million borrowing that has crept up to over £180 million and now, after the debt limit has already been exceeded by the company, which is not a satisfactory way to do business and does not illustrate a great deal of forward planning on the Government's approach to <Col N="178" /> this company, we are legislating to further extend those guarantees to £200 million. It seems that the holding company system we set up and which was welcomed by all Members of the House in 1987 is being used as a back door where the State is sucked into guaranteeing all these losses in a commercial enterprise about which we do not know very much. Their returns are not published.  We do not have access to these returns which are 51 per cent owned by the State.  We do not know what is happening in the fertiliser business.  All we can glean is from reports of the worldwide state of the fertiliser industry particularly in Europe, which is catastrophic.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the opening up of eastern Europe and the access of eastern European fertiliser plants to the markets has created an extraordinarily difficult situation for established operators.  The real price of fertiliser has dropped to half of what it was in 1985 in real terms. Obviously this has created huge problems within the industry.  Over that period we have seen a steady decline in employment in the industry in Ireland but we are not privy to the facts of this company for which we, as taxpayers, are responsible for more than half.  This is very unsatisfactory. The Minister did not offer a five year strategic plan for the company.  It is not even clear whether the Government has the company's five year strategic plan and where it sees the company heading.</P>
    <P>To add to the difficulties, ICI, the 49 per cent shareholder, has indicated it is trying to divest itself of its interests in the fertiliser industry in the UK.  It sought to sell these businesses and indicated if a buyer could not be found in the UK it would close them down unilaterally. The chairman of ICI was quoted as saying about the fertiliser industry in the UK that &ldquo;although it is making modest profits at present we cannot see any way of restoring levels of profitability which would justify reinvestment&rdquo;. The operator of less than the other half of the company seems to be more forthcoming than the Minister about the prospects for this industry <Col N="179" /> being a success.  He is not sanguine about the prospects in the UK.  We do not know whether Ireland's industry is much healthier than that but obviously it is disturbing to hear those views expressed by the other major shareholder.  It would seem that ICI is attempting to divest itself of 49 per cent of NET.  The Minister tells us today that the Government would want to privatise its 51 per cent share in the company.</P>
    <P>In relation to expressions of interest it is not clear from the Minister's speech how successful they are.  I am not satisfied with the Government's approach to privatisation which effectively is what this is.  I thought the approach to privatisation would be based on a more detailed white Paper approach, setting out the pros and cons of this strategy.</P>
    <P>My understanding was that Members of this House, before my time, saw this industry as of enormous strategic importance, and that was the basis on which State money was invested and an attempt made to sustain the industry.  It now seems that policy is being jettisoned &mdash; almost as an aside at the end of the Minister's speech &mdash; and because the problems are getting more difficult, we are going to try to get of the company.  I find it a far from satisfactory way of doing our business in the House.  We are dealing with a company whose accounts we do not see.  We see the shell company that is holding the debt and its continuing deterioration, with more State equity and guarantees being put into the company. I hope the Minister will be more forthcoming in responding to this debate by spelling out precisely what shape the Irish industry is in and how dependent it is on low price gas.  Is the IFI contract with NET a commercial arms' length contract? We have never seen the terms of that contract.  We do not know if the profits IFI are enjoying are the true arm's length profits or if they are &ldquo;false&rdquo; profits based on the lower than normal price of gas being available to them.</P>
    <P>This issue raises major implications for public policy which the Minister has not touched.  The Culliton report made a <Col N="180" /> number of recommendations in this area, the most relevant being on page 47 of the report: The continued supply of considerable volumes of cut price gas to the fertiliser industry at less than economic bargain price is inconsistent with getting the maximum national benefit from indigenous gas resources.</P>
    <P>It goes on to recommend that BGE should charge NET/IFI a more commercial price for the gas.  If they are not willing to pay such a price, then the gas allocation should be put to more productive use.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report clearly proposes a very stark option as to how we should use the gas.  Against the background of an effective £400 million subsidy on gas prices over the last ten years, this is a recommendation which cannot be let go without comment from the Minister today.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that this will be policy direction?  He mentions the necessity to negotiate a new gas agreement. Would that mean that the BGE contract at a knock down price would be forever at an end and that the Irish public would get full value for the natural gas being taken from the ground?</P>
    <P>The Culliton report recommends that there should be independently verified cost transparency on all pricing of gas. That was never a feature of the arrangement reached between IFI and NET acting on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In short, the House does not have many options as far as the Bill is concerned. It is clear from the Minister's statement that already we have exceeded the borrowing limits and the alternative to doing something today is that the company will be insolvent.  I ask the Minister to address in his reply the strategic future he sees for this industry; where its 750 employees will stand as a consequence of his proposals to sell off the company; how will their jobs be protected in the process of a sell off; and if he has full Cabinet support for this approach.  My impression was that the Labour Party was strenuously opposed to any such approach to dealing with State companies or State joint ventures of this nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I hope the Minister will elaborate on how he sees the future, apart from the very narrow response he has given of essentially having to put more money into the company or it will become insolvent.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for asking the Treasury Management Agency to look at the debt aspect of NET.  That is probably long overdue given that debts have been continually rising.  If the implication is that debt management has not been of the highest calibre, that is a worrying feature.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.  On behalf of our party, we give grudging support to this measure because the alternative is so bleak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is not here today to set out a wide ranging approach to the policy which will be adopted.  No disrespect to the Minister who is here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1993, raises more questions than it gives answers about the future of NET.  It would have been better if the Minister were here outlining Government policy on the future of NET and if this legislation allowed for the implementation of that policy.  Regrettably, that is not the case.  I sincerely hope this Minister will lead his Department in a development role ensuring that all legislation will have a clear policy direction underpinning it. It is clear that notwithstanding the circumstances, there is no policy direction underlining this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of the new Department of Enterprise and Employment brings with it wonderful opportunities but there are also great challenges in facing the onerous tasks that lie ahead.  It is of the utmost importance that this Minister sets out, at an early stage, the policy initiatives and the developmental role that his new Department must play in tackling the jobs crisis.  The Minister must pursue a clear policy line which embodies a legislative <Col N="182" /> approach which gives vent to the implementation of new policies.</P>
    <P>The type of legislation before us today, which is simply a means of shoring up a situation without tackling the underlying problems, should not be brought before this House again within the lifetime of this Government, particularly from this Department.  This Bill is clearly designed as a short term measure allowing the State to put more money into a company which has the capacity to absorb huge amounts of scarce resources while at the same time providing very little return to the general taxpayer for his or her investment.  The crisis which exists in NET cannot continue to be dealt with in this manner.</P>
    <P>To date, the State has invested £77.5 million and guaranteed borrowings of £180 million in NET, bringing the total investment, one could say, to £257.5 million. This company, as the Minister has more or less acknowledged this afternoon, will never have the ability to repay this sum.  I understand that some of this money will be recovered on any potential sale, but exactly how much remains to be seen.  This is an enormous investment by the State, which must be seen as a questionable area of State activity and one in which continuing State involvement gives rise to very serious concern.</P>
    <P>The formation of NET to have an indigenous fertiliser industry, had a certain logic to it.  At the time, Ireland's largest industry was agriculture and therefore there was a large ready made market for fertilisers.  That market has changed dramatically since the establishment of the company in 1965.  In 1970 our nitrogen requirement was a mere 80,000 tons of nutrients, by 1986 the nitrogen requirement had peaked at 375,000 tons.  However, the introduction of ceilings on output and recent restrictions on stocking rates will mean a static, if not a declining, market for fertilisers in this country.  We are already aware of the decline in markets throughout the world and we are witnessing a major restructuring of the international fertiliser industry.  Major international players have retrenched in recent times.  ICI, <Col N="183" /> the joint shareholder in Irish Fertilizer Industries, is withdrawing from the manufacturer of finished fertiliser products in the UK and is alleged to be withdrawing from joint venture arrangements in Malaysia and Canada.</P>
    <P>In the context of this reduction in the activity of ICI surely it makes little sense for the Irish Government to commit itself to further investment without first having access to the detailed long term business plans for the company.  If there is no long term business plan, the Minister should certainly demand one.  That is a fair suggestion and should be taken on board by the Government.</P>
    <P>Even within a few years of the establishment of the company, the decisions taken by the State were seriously in question. Discovery, however, of the natural gas field off Kinsale Head gave a new momentum to the prospects for NET. The State company was given an allocation of gas from the field for the manufacture of ammonia.  The construction of a new ammonia urea plant at Marino Point in Cork was agreed and the project duly commenced.  This project was originally budgeted to cost £63.5 million but, as we know, after a long series of delays the project was finally completed at the staggering cost of £137.3 million.  This was disaster on a grand scale and made it virtually impossible, as the Minister has admitted this afternoon, for NET ever to become a viable commercial company.</P>
    <P>The millstone of debt around the neck of NET was at crisis proportions.  This led to further State investment in the company, in terms of share capital of £50 million.  Unfortunately this made little contribution to turning the company around.  The company has continued to make huge losses in the intervening years, apart from a brief respite in 1984 and 1985 when small profits were returned. However, by 1987 the total debt of the company guaranteed by the State, was just under £180 million.</P>
    <P>The search was now on for NET to find a partner in the fertiliser industry and, as we are aware, we saw the formation of Irish Fertilizer Industries, a joint venture <Col N="184" /> company owned 51 per cent by NET and 49 per cent by ICI.  IFI is one of the three leading suppliers of fertilisers on the Irish market.  However, with a total production of 2.5 million tonnes they are also key suppliers of ammonium nitrate to other Irish fertiliser blenders.  On the surface, this seemed a straightforward deal which would greatly benefit NET but the truth is different.</P>
    <P>NET's current main functions are to manage the debt and to purchase gas from BGE selling it on at a profit to IFI.  The real cost of this deal to BGE is staggering and, in my opinion, is an incredible form of subsidisation of NET by BGE.  According to the Culliton report the price paid for gas by NET is approximately one-third of the price paid by the ESB and only one-fifth the price paid by the industrial and residential consumers. This has already been referred to in the House today.  The Culliton report &mdash; in the section entitled Energy for Industry &mdash; a policy review, based on a report compiled by DKM Consultants Limited, outlines the facts with regard to this deal.  That report makes the point that if NET had been paying at least the same price as the ESB &mdash; which also receives gas substantially below the industrial market price from BGE &mdash; the income foregone by BGE since 1982 on this deal exceeds £200 million in nominal terms and £250 million in 1990 terms. There may be some disagreement or debate about how precise these figures are but I have no doubt they are probably correct in view of what has been happening since 1982.  This is largesse on a grand scale, and it is mind boggling when one adds this figure to the current indebtedness of NET.  One way or another, through a succession of complicated deals, one could say that NET has cost the State in excess of £500 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that over 25 per cent of indigenous gas supply has been allocated to NET since 1982.  One must ask what has been the corresponding benefit from NET for this incredible subsidisation.  To put this in perspective, as Culliton pointed out, reserves used by NET could have deferred the need for a natural gas interconnector <Col N="185" /> to the UK by up to four to five years.  This knock down price gas deal is an industrial scandal on a grand scale which has brought few benefits in real terms to the companies involved or in particular to the Exchequer which is ultimately responsible to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We must not overlook the vital importance of the employment provided by NET and IFI but the level of subsidisation must be called into question. We would be remiss if we did not point out the obvious in this regard.  Given the unemployment crisis nobody wants to see deterioration in that regard, but one has to look at realistic and reasonable values in terms of the cost of providing employment. When I studied all the figures in the reports of the Minister's colleague, the present Taoiseach, and what he said in the Dáil debate in 1987 it appeared to me that serious questions had to be raised about the benefits this country got in the last five, six or seven years.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that we are behaving as if we had billions of uncapped reserves and natural resources, an extremely sound economy and a budgetary situation that requires no borrowing.  The opposite is the true picture.  I would love to know the real cost to the taxpayer of every bag of fertiliser produced in this country.  I am sure it would be absolutely staggering.</P>
    <P>The structure of IFI is such that ICI, with 49 per cent shareholding annually receives a return on its investment and it gets a dividend.  The return in profits to NET, on the other hand, is enough to pay the interest charges on its debts.  NET also makes a profit on the sale of gas to IFI but what is the cost in real terms to our Irish gas reserves and the substantial losses of revenue to BGE?</P>
    <P>What is the real strategic benefit now to the Irish State, of being involved in the production of fertiliser?  I suggest since 1993 there has been none and the Government should move to disengage itself from this activity.  I have no doubt that to do so will involve a considerable loss to the Irish Exchequer.  However, to continue the approach to NET that has been maintained by successive Governments over the last decade would be an <Col N="186" /> enormous folly, the cost of which this country cannot bear.  The Government has few choices and hard decisions must be taken.  To do nothing would be to abdicate Government responsibility and that would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On occasion, we have heard about other companies interested in purchasing NET and its subsidiaries &mdash; the Minister mentioned this fact this afternoon.  It is interesting that he should do so and that the Department should be looking at the options which may be available with regard to the future of this company.  I would like to ask the Minister if any such proposal is being considered by his Department at present?  Is there a potential buyer?  I appreciate the confidentiality of the matters involved but perhaps the Minister could tell us if that is the case?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his speech &mdash; as I interpret it &mdash; that interested parties did not come up with the right price.  I wonder if the right price, in the Department's view, was weighed against further investment in the company and the continuing cost to the Exchequer.  These are realities which will have to be faced and which, in fairness to the Minister, he has outlined on the position of the fertiliser industry and market worldwide.</P>
    <P>The sale of NET will undoubtedly mean a substantial loss to the State as the sale price is likely to be a fraction of the NET debt which is guaranteed by the Government.  However, I believe this option must be vigorously pursued by the present Government.  I can see no strategic need for the Government, on behalf of the taxpayers, to be directly involved in fertiliser production.</P>
    <P>I do not say this from an ideological point of view.  The resources available to this State are scarce and they must be managed carefully and utilised to achieve their maximum potential.  Any reasonable politician will have to ask themselves how we can best utilise and maximise the scarce resources available to us.  While we would all like to have the money to fund every project &mdash; and I am sure we could make an argument for the funding of every project &mdash; the reality is that we <Col N="187" /> have not the luxury of being able to do that.  Therefore, there is a responsibility on all of us to ensure that these scarce resources are maximised so that their full potential can be realised.</P>
    <P>The NET Group workforce are entitled to a more secure future.  In recent years they have been deeply concerned about the situation in these companies. They fully realise the difficulties in the market and the uncertainty of their position. There is a responsibility on the Minister, particularly the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to state a clear policy position in this regard.  The Minister has indicated this afternoon that the sale of the company may be the best way forward.  However, decisions will have to be taken to place the company on a sounder footing and these will have to be implemented sooner rather than later.  In my view, the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today has two objectives: the first is for the State to increase its investment in a company from £77.5 million to £100 million and the second is to increase the borrowings of the company guaranteed by the State from £180 million to £200 million.  The fact that the Minister wants to make available to NET an extra £42.5 million does not give one much confidence for the future and brings into sharp focus the crisis which still surrounds this company.  I believe the amount of potential moneys which the Minister is requiring here today is too great and will remove from the Minister the responsibility of making a substantial policy decision or, indeed, taking a serious look at whether the State should continue to be involved with NET.  The fact that not all the money may be required immediately is small comfort given the company's track record.  It is clear &mdash; and one has seen the succession of Bills since this company was formed &mdash; that it will not be long before the limits of the present Bill will be fully reached and the Minister will be back to square one, forced to produce a similar Bill to find more share capital and another increase in the moneys that can be guaranteed by the State.  The Minister's <Col N="188" /> response is wholly inadequate and I am not prepared to give him <i>carte blanche</i> to spend taxpayers' money.  The reality is that the Minister cannot and should not be allowed to walk away from his responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>This is a very poor start by the new Government and has very strong shades of the usual attitude of the Labour Party in Government &mdash; throw enough money at a problem and hope it can be solved that way.  Given our current economic crisis, which has been greatly exacerbated over the last four months by the currency problems, one would have hoped for a fresh approach to these matters by the new Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Sadly, this is not the case and instead we have a Minister following a well worn and predictable path. The Minister sets down no policy position for this major State company.  There is no real investigation into what are strategic needs.  Indeed, there is a total absence of major and substantial policy decisions which will have to be taken by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I find Minister Quinn's references to Culliton being a key element in his economic strategy hollow, given what is in the Culliton report and what the Department proposes here this afternoon.  When it comes to making real decisions, it is not enough to speak of the Culliton report in glowing terms nor will it be enough to implement what might be termed the soft options contained within the Culliton report without implementing the hard options as well.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment will have to understand that Culliton is a total package and if it is not implemented in its totality, it cannot be said to have been implemented at all.  All the Culliton proposals are interconnected and are part of a much wider economic policy.  This does not allow for picking and choosing bits and pieces and disregarding other parts because the Government has not the courage or the vision to take the underlying decisions which may be difficult, but which are necessary for success in the future.</P>
    <P>I will be tabling amendments to this <Col N="189" /> Bill to substantially reduce the type of funding the State should be making available to NET.  My party and I fully understand and appreciate that further funding must be made available to overcome the short term crisis, but I believe £42.5 million is excessive and removes the responsibility for urgent action to be taken.  I urge the Minister here today to concur with this point of view thereby staving off the immediate crisis but making it essential that a long term decision will have to be taken with regard to the future of NET. If the Minister fails to do this then we are only making a bad situation substantially worse.  It will be better for all concerned if the Minister takes tough but realistic action now rather than later when the situation has worsened immeasurably.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board what I said here this afternoon, in particular my view with regard to the type of funding he wants to make available to NET.  It is not necessary to provide the volume of funding suggested by the Minister today.  The type of funding I will suggest will be substantially less and will give the company, the Minister, the Department and the Government ample time to take a proper look at this company.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about the National Treasury Management Agency looking at the debt NET is managing.  Given the very difficult international situation with regard to interest rates and currency crises at the moment, I can understand how difficult it is for any company to manage its debts and ensure it is being cost effective.  I am sure the experience of the National Treasury Management Agency will be a very great help in this regard, but that will only solve the problem in the short term; it is not making a definitive policy statement or long term decision regarding the future of this company.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Department and on the Government to get off on the right footing, as we face into difficult times on a wide range of economic issues. We must establish clear markers in the marketplace.  Leadership and responsibility must be seen to exist within the <Col N="190" /> Department of Enterprise of Employment otherwise, the Department and all of us, will be open to being constantly harangued by every group in the country which has a case to put.  Many of these cases will be genuine but, as the Labour Party has found out in its short time in Government, we simply cannot answer every call; it would be impossible to do so.  We have scarce resources, and we must maximise the potential of these scarce resources, particularly given the opportunities that will now arise with regard to the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund over the remainder of this decade.  Every decision must be carefully analysed, thought out and have a clear underpinning policy application that can bring real benefits to this country, and the real benefits will be creating jobs in the long term.  We can maximise and use resources in such a way as to have real effect.  I sincerely hope the Government will take that approach in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well.  I hope he will be successful for his own sake and for the people.</P>
      <P>He made two points that are of serious concern.  First, he has exposed the underlying effects of the Government's mismanagement of the currency crisis which has had a knock-on impact on the fortunes of NET and on other businesses around the country.  Indeed, it is threatening jobs in many companies.  That aspect must be taken on board in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister has indicated that this is a softening up process towards the privatisation of IFI.  The sin IFI committed was that it was successful.  The Minister described it as a highly profitable company, although he does not mention the jobs involved and makes no reference to the lives and hopes of workers who contributed towards its success. By way of thanks they are to be threatened with a privatisation deal which is non-specific.  This is an indication that the Government is falling back on the same old worn out formula that has served to add to the unemployment figures, <Col N="191" /> not only in Ireland but in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the increase in share capital and borrowing capacity needs to be spelt out and understood.  NET has had major difficulties mostly dating back to the construction of the Marino Point plant.  It should be noted that over-runs of such magnitude are not unusual on projects of this size nor are they restricted to public enterprises.  For example, the huge privately owned ALCAN development on the Shannon was to cost £326 million but ended up costing £620 million.</P>
    <P>NET was established to provide an indigenous fertiliser manufacturing capability to service Irish agriculture.  When it was set up agriculture was under-productive and badly in need of modernisation. It is important that we still retain a domestic capacity to produce fertiliser, even allowing for changes in Irish agriculture today.  Indeed there is still room for growth in providing for the domestic market North and South, apart from any possibilities of export markets. The company's sales of more than £140 million in 1991 show how substantial the market is.  If this Bill is a precursor to some sell-off move by the Government it should be remembered that any potential buyer for the public share of IFI would probably come from abroad, and it is most likely that it would be sales rather than manufacturing that would attract them.  The jobs at Arklow and Cork are too important to be sold off at a knockdown price.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that it is not only State companies which got into difficulties and had to receive support from the public purse.  Huge amounts of money were found to salvage PMPA and a similar rescue operation, involving the commitment of more that £100 million in public money, was mounted to bail out the AIB owned Insurance Corporation of Ireland in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is very likely that the big increase in interest rates has added significantly to the company's problems.  In 1987 the then <Col N="192" /> Minister said that an increase of 1 per cent costs NET £1.6 million.  Interest payments in the year ended September 1991 amounted to £21 million, more than wiping out the trading profit of £12.6 million.  The only people to have done well from NET and its difficulties are the professional moneylenders &mdash; the banks, with £20 million in interest payments in 1990 and £21 million in 1991 and the figures for 1992 and 1993 will be even higher.</P>
    <P>High interest rates are creating great difficulties for all firms but they are crucifying for a company like NET which has such a high level of borrowing.  Here we are again providing more public money for NET, not to allow for expansion, not to create more jobs, but simply to further enhance the profits of the banks.</P>
    <P>When will the Government and the European Community take steps to ensure that interest rates are brought down to a more realistic level?  When will some order be brought to the currency markets?  How many more companies will be strangled before something is done about interest rates?  Many people would like an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Article 45 of the Constitution pledges the State to directing its policy towards securing that &ldquo;in what pertains to be control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  High interest rates may be to the benefit of the banks but they most certainly are not for &ldquo;the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will need to clarify the position regarding the 49 per cent minority shareholding in IFI held by ICI through Richardsons in Northern Ireland.  In July 1990 ICI announced that it was selling its fertiliser business in the UK to the Finnish firm, Kemira Oy.  This deal was later blocked by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.  What is the current position?  Is it still the intention of ICI to dispose of its shareholdings and, if so, what are the implications for NET?</P>
    <P>The chairman of NET, in his last <Col N="193" /> report, said that any scale of ICI could have led to the restructuring of the group. He also said they were currently examining alternative proposals for such restructuring as they were reviewing all possible means of reducing the level of indebtedness in the long term.  What is the position in 1993?  What decisions will be made for the future?  What are the intentions of ICI and NET?  These important questions have implications for the future of an indigenous industry that has served Irish agriculture.  They are of vital interest to workers whose livelihoods are dependent on the future of NET and IFI.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been much criticism of NET, and we have heard more of the same today.  This has as much to do with the ideology of the right as a serious analysis of what went wrong.  We should be careful not to rewrite history in a way that distorts the truth and fails to acknowledge the successes as well as the failures of the project.</P>
    <P>Since it was set up six years ago, the off-shoot company of IFI has made an important contribution to our economic life.  The joint venture company employs 750 people North and South, and has developed an indigenous industry that exports on a substantial scale.  The success of IFI follows an earlier initiative when NET was set up to provide for a market that private enterprise was unwilling or unable to exploit.  The first fertiliser plant was built in Arklow at the modest cost of £6 million &mdash; good value for money considering the service it has done over the years.</P>
    <P>I speak with some knowledge on this point.  I represent a county that has been devastated by unemployment.  On average, County Wicklow has the eighth highest level of unemployment in the country yet we do not receive the special assistance given to Border counties nor are we given assistance from the Western Development Fund which helps western counties nor have the special designation incentives been extended to us that apply elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in County Wicklow has suffered more than the town of Arklow. <Col N="194" /> Arklow has been brought to its knees in the last 15 years.  This is not the special pleading my Progressive Democrats colleague argues against, this is reality.  The loss of jobs in Arklow has been massive. For example, in the potteries, job losses have totalled 1,100; the closure of Avoca Mines meant approximately 400 job losses.  We have had other closures, such as Brennan's Bakery, and the reduction in the number of workers in NET, now run by IFI, means there are just over 200 workers at the fertiliser plant.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago Arklow was a thriving seaside town and NET enabled a whole generation of Arklow people to rear their families and to live with an optimism in the future.  I can remember when the town was full of young people. You could go into any pub and people would be five deep at the counter.  They may not have spent their money wisely but they certainly spent it well and Arklow boomed as a result.  Now that industrial base is practically wiped out. The population of the town has shrunk and the biggest loss is the number of young men and women who have had to go elsewhere in search of work.</P>
    <P>The recent publication from the harbour commissioners makes a strong case for EC investment in expansion of the port which is used by IFI to a considerable extent.  The by-pass of Arklow is due to start and will have a knock-on effect on the commercial life of the town. Efforts are now being made to establish an industrial park and to protect existing jobs.  The close relationship between IFI and Iarnród Éireann has been of mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>In Arklow the jobs being provided by IFI are of critical importance.  Since its inception IFI has successfully modernised parts of the plant.  In 1992 the environmental problems that had been a cause of concern were being tackled at last.  The introduction of new environmental controls will deal with most of the air quality problems.  When commissioned, the new £10 million absorption tower will eliminate much of the air pollution.  Consideration is being given <Col N="195" /> to the environment, and rightly so.  These days we are all becoming acutely aware that our environment is a finite resource and needs to be protected, but we need to recognize too that the greatest environmental threat most of us will ever have to face is that of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment makes you sicker, sadder, poorer and more prone to an early death.  Carrying out an environmental impact assessment on the hazard of worklessness might give us the complete picture when it comes to determining the factors that really do damage our health.  I hope that is something the Government will take on board when they look at privatising IFI.</P>
    <P>The establishment of NET was geared towards meeting the needs of Irish agriculture. The efforts of NET resulted from a desire to create jobs and wealth, an important aspiration and one that needs to be put at the heart of any Government programme.  Since the currency crisis began last year it has become increasingly clear that whatever has been at the top of the Government's agenda, it has not been the creation and maintenance of jobs.</P>
    <P>A naive Europeanism coupled with a failure to accept the geographic reality of our relationship with Britain &mdash; and in this example our interconnection with Northern Ireland &mdash; has led to incompetence in the management of the crisis. The recent divergence of views between Herr Tietmeyer and the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, is just the latest example of the failure to assess correctly what has been going on.  The Minister for Finance maintains that the Bundesbank did not act on his requests.  I have no reason to disbelieve he made efforts to lobby for help.  I am just surprised that he thought the Bundesbank would act in anything other than in the German interest.</P>
    <P>The result of such naivety by the Government has meant job losses, the introduction of unsustainable interest rates and deep anxiety among ordinary people about their future.  Today we are debating how higher interest rates are <Col N="196" /> creating major problems for NET and, by implication, for the State as a whole. They are the same banks, and the same rates that are squeezing the life-blood out of the companies, public and private, up and down the country.  What we are debating today is only a symptom of a more serious malaise.</P>
    <P>The success of IFI is now proving to be a threat rather than an achievement. Privatisation will be a plum for some future investor but if it is proceeded with, it will be a bitter fruit for all those workers in Arklow and Cork who contributed to the success of our fertiliser industry over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be the best time to congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment knowing your long years of service with NET.  It must be sad for you to see the company is in serious financial straits. Everyone in this House hopes whatever is needed to keep it going will be done as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister put it very succinctly and bluntly when he said:</P>
      <P>In the meantime provision has to be made to enable NET to continue to meet its debts.  I must stress that unless this action is taken NET will be insolvent by the end of March...</P>
      <P>This is an urgent debate as one of our State companies is in such perilous straits.  This is particularly so when over the last five years this company has made a profit of £70 million and continues to trade profitably.  The real problem is the accumulated debt of £164.5 million which had accrued before the joint venture with ICI and NET took place and which was handed over to the NET company to manage.  Since IFI, jointly managed by NET and ICI, had nothing to do with the management of the debt which had accrued before the joint venture, the company was able to continue to trade and maintain existing employment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I listen to somebody like Deputy Cullen telling us what should be done and what should have been done with NET, I find it very hard to believe that <Col N="197" /> the Progressive Democrats were part of a coalition Government for two and a half years which could see what was happening in NET.  Now they are on the Opposition benches they tell us how we should proceed and how this problem should be handled.  I wish Deputy Cullen had told Aer Lingus employees his policy on privatisation, etc., and told them exactly what he thought should happen to Aer Lingus, but he did not.  He called on the State to come to the aid of Aer Lingus workers.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how anyone can suggest, as has been suggested by Deputy Cullen, that we consider dissociating ourselves from this activity.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The line the Minister is taking is both necessary and urgent.  He has the support of my party and he will continue to have this support to maintain this company which, in the last five years, has traded profitably in a very competitive and hostile market for fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to sell the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  We have been told that if we do not take this action today the company will be closed by the end of March.  We have been told that no definitive offer has been made for the company.  The right approach is being taken and I congratulate the Minister for that.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to ask some questions arising from the Minister's speech.  I am concerned that not enough information has been given about ICI. ICI owns 49 per cent of the company and it would be reasonable for the Minister to tell us what is its attitude to the company. Is it putting pressure on the Minister to sell?  Is it putting pressure on the Government to take a decision to privatise the company?  In the one paragraph the Minister said that ICI are reducing their dependency on fertiliser manufacturer in the UK.  We are not in the UK, we are the Republic of Ireland. Is that wish to reduce dependency also being applied to their 49 per cent share in the company?  A part of IFI's operation is in the North.  Therefore, one would have to ask the Minister if the decisions which affect us also apply to the subsidiaries across the Border.  Has any discussion taken place with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about the effect what is being proposed here today may have on trading in the North?  It is important for them because no doubt they are watching what we are doing here today.  The employees in that part of Ireland are also concerned about the future of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that the servicing of this debt falls on NET.  That was part of the deal agreed in 1987; we <Col N="200" /> took over the debt that existed then. However, given ICI's 49 per cent of the share capital we must ascertain ICI's attitude to the situation.  Can we alone take a decision to sell the company or put out feelers letting it be known that this company is for sale without knowing the attitude of ICI?</P>
    <P>I would be concerned if it was felt that the only long term future for the company is that it be privatised.  The company is trading profitably at present, although, even though the 1992-93 figures are not available, the company must be having a more difficult year.  The only accounts available to us in the Dáil Library are for 1991, a most successful year.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus spoke about the importance of the company to Cork and Arklow.  I believe it is also important to Belfast.  The top priority of the Government and of every party during the recent election campaign was job creation and the maintenance of employment.  There is not much point taking one step forward and two backwards by the loss of existing employment.  Therefore it is necessary that the fears and concerns of people I met last night in Arklow that their jobs may be in jeopardy would be lifted if possible and as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last night one employee asked me whether, in the event of an offer or redundancy being made, he should accept it. That was a difficult question to answer.  I told him I would have to look at the Bill before us today and question the Minister to get his assurance that this employment will be maintained.  The employment of the 200 workers in Arklow is our immediate responsibility as representatives from Wicklow but we are concerned about all 740 jobs.  That would represent a huge loss of employment, a huge loss of productive output and would inflict major damage on the agriculture industry if anything happened to this company.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Bruton &mdash; he will probably tell me I am not supposed to question what he says in the House but I know him a little longer than Deputy Cullen and that he is not as touchy&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the debate which will take place on Thursday and Friday, I hope we will be able to make the suggestion that the committees of the House should not only have access to the up to date accounts but would also have Ministers present to give their opinions first hand.  That would remove the pressure of having to find Dáil time for a debate when real problems have to be faced and Bills have to be rushed through.  A continuous overview by the committees would be a far better way to deal with our semi-State bodies and would keep everyone concerned up to date.</P>
      <P>It is not the best way to proceed when people who have given a lifetime service to NET, now IFI, in Arklow are concerned about what is going to happen next month or the month after, and if they will have their jobs.  We need to ensure that people engaged in productive work are guaranteed that their jobs are safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Arklow has been briefly and accurately outlined by Deputy McManus.  In its heyday NET had over <Col N="202" /> 1,000 employees in Arklow.  Because of the rationalisation over years, as the industry had to meet the pressure of competition here and from outside, the workforce has diminished to the still sizeable number of 200 workers.  This is still a big and important industry in Arklow where we have seen so much economic devastation over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>It was necessary for the Government to move with speed and bring in this Bill. I applaud them for what they have done, although there are unanswered questions about the future.  I hope the Minister will assure us that this company is not up for sale to the private sector, that there is a future for it and that this Government believes there is a necessity for a fertiliser company to service our biggest industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>We listened today to a Minister who is concerned about the situation, who wants to be helpful and who wants to see employment maintained in Arklow and in Cork.  That is what I take from the Minister's speech.  I hope in his reply he will give assurances, not only to those who represent the workforce in Arklow but also to those representing the Cork workforce, which is much larger, that the people who have given a lifetime service to this company will have a future in this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you Leas-Cheann Comhairle on your appointment.  I hope your tenure will be long and fruitful.  This is a Bill I hoped would not come back to this House for many years.  We must provide funding for NET.  In Cobh, where I come from, we have one of the most efficient, up to date fertiliser plants in Europe, which has been operating efficiently and profitably for the last number of years.  The holding company, NET, has not had favourable results over the past five years due to the circumstances, outlined by the Minister &mdash; the downturn in fertiliser profits and increases and changes in interest rates, the dollar-pound exchange rates and international oil prices.  The about-turns <Col N="203" /> in those elements have worsened the debt position of NET.</P>
      <P>Despite that fact, what I am concerned about are the jobs at Marino Point, in Cobh, in Arklow and throughout the country.  There are more than 700 people dependent on the fertiliser industry for jobs.  Not only must we take into account the 700 people directly employed by IFI but we must count those who are dependent on spending by NET and IFI in Cobh and surrounding areas.  We must also take into account Iarnróid Éireann, the hauliers and other ancillary industries which depend on IFI.  In that context the Minister's proposals are acceptable.</P>
      <P>We could look at the reasons for this problem but it all falls back to the overrun in the construction of the plant in the late seventies.  It would be advisable and educational for Deputy Cullen to see who was in charge of the Department in the late seventies.</P>
      <P>IFI supplies the agriculture industry. We are mainly an agricultural country, whether it is our prime industry, or downline work in agri-industries.  If we were to lose IFI in Arklow and Cobh, Irish farmers would be at the mercy of foreign companies who would exploit that at will. It is incumbent on the Minister and the Government to ensure that no element of our industry is put at the mercy of foreign companies.</P>
      <P>In this case we have a profitable company in Arklow and especially in Cobh which deserves to be kept open.  I urge the Minister to carry out the plans he has outlined here this afternoon to ensure that the plants at Marino Point in Cork and Arklow are kept open and that the 700 plus workers are kept in permanent and profitable employment.</P>

      <P>First, let me offer my congratulations to you a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.  I was not in the House on the day of your appointment but as my constituency colleague, I would like to express my sincere congratulations on your appointment and wish you well in the years ahead in that role.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister for the assistance which hopefully this Bill will provide for IFI.  As previous speakers have said, there is no doubt that the fertiliser industry, and the farming industry as a whole, have suffered a downturn in recent years and IFI has felt the brunt of the storm in reduced input costs by the farming community and therefore reduced sales by the fertiliser companies.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on us to ensure that we remain in control of our destiny as far as the fertiliser industry is concerned.  In too many fairly small industries, such as the fertiliser industry, we have given the impetus to foreign based companies to supply our needs.  There are many instances of how we export jobs.  This is happening in other areas but I am referring specifically to Wicklow because IFI is based in Arklow.  In too many instances we do not give the necessary backing to our great natural resources which on this occasion is IFI.</P>
      <P>I would like to lend my voice to that of the previous speakers, to support the Minister's plans to help the Irish fertiliser industry and maintain the 700 people employed in Marino Point, Cork and in Arklow.  I believe the upturn in farming is around the corner and that will mean an upturn in the fertiliser industry and a return to profitability.</P>
      <P>I congratulate IFI for their efforts in maintaining standards, particularly in the area of environmental control.  That industry can be environmentally difficult, to say the least.  IFI has done everything that has been asked of it, particularly in the Arklow plant, to ensure that the standards the EC and the Irish Government require have been met.  They are to be congratulated on that.  I too support any steps the Minister takes to maintain and support our fertiliser industry in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which increases the share capital of the company by £22.5 million, not a very substantial figure when you take into account the capital base of the company.  It increases the guarantee of borrowings by a further £20 million.</P>
      <P>This company has been subject to a great deal of controversy since established in Arklow in 1962.  The real controversy began in 1977-79 with the setting up of the Marino Point plant in Cobh, County Cork.  That was the first major industry manufacturing chemicals in the Cork area.  During its pioneering days it was seen as a model industry.  Overruns in capital expenditure have been a problem but imported competition has been one of the main reasons for its loss-making on several occasions.  We are in a fluctuating business where Third World countries can often undermine manufacturers and create a world surplus.</P>
      <P>The capital cost of the Marino/Cobh plant was in the region of £137 million and there was a huge overrun in capital costs.  This was the main reason for the company's failure to make a profit in the early years.</P>
      <P>It had to be bailed out by the Oireachtas in 1989 with another £100 million, £50 million by way of equity and £50 million in State guarantees on borrowing. Some time after that it ran into further difficulties and a joint venture was proposed in 1987 &mdash; 51 per cent of the shares held by NET and 49 per cent held by ICI.  I believe it was a good move by the Government to get an experienced partner for NET.  ICI brought in international expertise to market the product and introduced new product technology which produced new types of fertilisers.</P>
      <P>The use of natural gas has further lowered the cost of production.  I appreciate that it is provided at a price below that paid by other users.  This is an efficient form of fuel; it is clean fuel, and provides a saving in costs.  IFI is an excellent employer in the Cobh area and is important for the Cork region generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of the currency crisis on NET and IFI are frightening.  We have to examine the currency question.  My view <Col N="206" /> on the devaluation issue, although many people may disagree with me, is that, as a country that has to export, we have to be vigilant.  At all times we have to be cost effective.  The UK is our nearest market and while 40 per cent of our business is with the UK our exports to the UK are mainly foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser industry is contracting with less fertiliser being used by Irish farmers because of the cutback in livestock numbers and cereal growing.  Circumstances have changed considerably since NET was established.  We have seen a major contraction in agriculture because of new technology, quotas being imposed and cutbacks in production.  For the first time, terms like &ldquo;set-a-side&rdquo; are being used.  That is going to create further problems not alone for NET but also for other fertiliser manufacturers.  We are seeing a change in the structure of ICI in the UK.  I understand the company is to be split in two, chemical and otherwise. I would like to know what effect that will have on the existing company.</P>
    <P>I compliment the company in the Cork Harbour area for a clean environment where little is heard of spillages or leakages.  That is a great tribute to the existing workforce and management.</P>
    <P>It is important to maintain employment in the Cork area.  The last thing we want is change that would bring about any type of redundancy.  I welcome the Bill for that reason.  The company must, of course, survive otherwise our agricultural industry will not be competitive. If we have high cost fertilisers the agricultural industry will suffer.  IFI has to be vigilant in the marketplace.  It has to deal with competition as the market is shrinking not alone in this country, but worldwide.</P>
    <P>Over the years the main product in the Cork area has been urea for the agriculture industry and calcium ammonium nitrate from the Arklow plant.  The company has broadened its base of manufacturing product which has helped it substantially.</P>
    <P>ICI's involvement has also given us an input into Richardsons in Belfast which is part of the original ICI group which <Col N="207" /> brought onto the market two very prestigious brands of fertiliser &mdash; Pasture Sward and Cut Sward a great deal of which are used in the southern part of the country.  There has been increased use of net nitrogen in those fertilisers, and this cocktail has proved very popular.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish NET and IFI every success.  I congratulate the Government on coming to their rescue because it would be very difficult for NET to continue without this assistance.  I congratulate the Minister on his initiative and I wish him well.</P>

      <P>My thanks also to Deputies opposite, from all parties, who contributed to this Second Stage debate.  I listened very carefully and I value greatly what they had to say.  Often it does not appear that Ministers do that, but it is important to do and to say we do it.  I have learned from listening to the debate today.</P>
      <P>It is important that I say a few things very clearly lest the wrong impression goes from this House.  I am concerned that in the reporting of the debate, for example, the workers at IFI might get a wrong impression.  It is not that Deputies have said anything incorrect, but the wrong impression may have been created by what a number of Deputies said.</P>
      <P>Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited is a very competitive and profitable company. It is not under any threat.  The workforce need have no worries about the present and, as far as one can judge, the future of Irish Fertilizer Industries. In response to Deputy Bruton, as I understood it, IFI has a three year strategic plan which is reasonably optimistic &mdash; it cannot go beyond that because of the uncertainty of gas prices &mdash; and the company is secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to understand and distinguish between NET and IFI.  IFI is <Col N="208" /> sound and is doing good business, NET is the one with the difficulty.  To pin it down, Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited in the year ending September 1991 had a turnover of £141 million, an increase from £133 million the previous year.  In that year it had a profit of over £10 million, compared to a £4 million profit the previous year.  I want to tell the workers in IFI that they are working for a very profitable, developing and well managed company that has a strategic plan.  It is important to say that very clearly today lest there be any misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware ICI has been winding down its fertiliser business in the UK.  It is no secret that they would be interested in disposing of their shares in IFI at the right price.  However, they have no intention of withdrawing from what they regard as a very profitable investment, just to get out.  They take the view, as most international companies do, that as it is a very good investment, they will seek a very good return on it and if they do not get it, they are not interested in pulling out.  I understand they are committed to the company and there will be no shabby treatment of IFI by ICI or NET and the company can be assured of that.</P>
    <P>I will spell out the position.  NET is now a holding company; it is not trading as such.  There is no bailing out today of IFI and I will pin that down firmly.  So far as bailing out is concerned, we are bailing out NET, because of a number of elements including managing debts, oil and the currency problem, the gas price and profits from the fertiliser company in the form of dividends.  There are a number of volatile elements which affect NET.  NET has two incomes; the dividends it receives from IFI and its sale of gas to IFI.  It has two expenditures; it buys gas from Bord Gáis Éireann and pays the interest on its enormous debt. As Deputies know, that debt stayed the responsibility of NET and allowed IFI to carry out its operating business.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here today is expensive but it is purely a financial measure.  We are not bailing out an operating company.  We are not making <Col N="209" /> up for poor trading performances, we are not concerned about the price of fertilisers, we are straightening out matters and allowing NET to continue to deal with those four elements which make up its profile.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Cullen about potential purchasers.  Let me say again, very clearly, that the State has taken no decision to dispose of its share in IFI. The reality is the State has a share in IFI. &mdash; a very valuable share &mdash; and like any shareholder from time to time it has to look at its assets and consider whether holding these assets is better than disposing of them and clearing its debt. Whether the State took the final decision to dispose of them, would not, in my view, affect the company.  Whether it is owned by the Irish taxpayer or by, arguably, an international fertiliser company with a very high performance should not affect the worker in IFI.  It really is a matter of ownership at that stage.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that no Government decision has been taken.  I regard it as an option we have to look at very carefully, and that option is being looked at.  In that regard, a number of firms have been talked to, but there have been no definite offers on the table.  I want again to stress that the Government would not treat something as important as this in a shabby manner.  The option of holding the shares will be looked at and the option of disposing will also be looked at.  I want to stress that they are options and we would not treat any company in a shabby manner; that is not the approach of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen also asked about the sums involved.  It is not a once off £42 million.  We are talking about enabling money, which may or may not be drawn down.  It is a matter of judgment whether I come back in a month's time or once a month for 42 months.  That is the amount which will give them flexibility to carry on with their business.  I accept the Deputy's view that it could just as easily have been £32 million but our judgment is that rather than have to come back to the House on a regular basis, it is best to deal with it now.  This is our estimate of the <Col N="210" /> funds that will be required and, as I said, that does not mean this money will necessarily be drawn down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton asked me about the gas price.  NET is dependent on its profits from the sale of gas to service its debts and if that source of income is taken from the company the Exchequer will have to make up a shortfall.  I do not think it is clear if there will be better uses between now and 1999 for the 210 million therms of gas consumed annually by IFI other than, for example, power generation by the ESB.  If the ESB supplants all generation by gas generation, the Exchequer loses the excise duty on the oil.  The cessation of gas supply to IFI for what might be, at best, only marginally beneficial in the context of gas prices could have substantial damaging consequences on IFI.  It would have an adverse impact on our balance of payments and I think would result in a loss of credibility in long term agreements entered into by the State.  We should remember that the existing gas arrangements are cast iron legal requirements, fully signed.  We are contractually committed to the gas arrangement, I think, up to 1999, so there is not much point in us debating them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any change in the structure of IFI &mdash; the present structure, as the Deputy knows, is the ownership by NET and ICI &mdash; obviously a key part of that new structure would be the gas contract.  But, there is a gas contract to which we are legally committed and we cannot touch it until 1999. It might be no harm to review it and discuss it but the bottom line is that we are stuck with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, NET is a holding company.  It buys in gas and sells gas and it has to deal with other customers.  If you exclude the excise element which the ESB pay on oil the amount is only marginally different from the price at which the ESB buys the gas. Successive Ministers on all sides have not put a very firm figure on it because there are a number of customers involved.  If the Deputy feels the Government has options, even of making it pay the exact price, and if he feels that could be helpful to somebody, then it could be considered, but the view is that it is not particularly helpful to publicly declare the figure because there is a commercial relationship involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report confused the gas price paid by NET to BGE and that paid by IFI to NET.  NET buys and sells gas, it makes a profit on the difference; and the difference is a State profit used to support the NET debt.  To an extent the profit on the gas goes directly to the Irish taxpayer by reducing the NET debt.  The argument about the lower price is academic.  There is a lower price but the profit is transferred to NET.  NET makes a profit by selling on to IFI and uses the profit to service the debt.  This argument has been going on for years.  If all of the figures were made public that would be obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are into the argument of what is the best use of gas and whether it should be used more by the ESB side or whether it should be used to develop this industry.  At the time the deal was concluded, the fertiliser industry was in bad trouble and the State brought all resources to bear in solving the problem for NET.  It was quite an imaginative solution at the end of the day taking <Col N="212" /> the debt out into NET, trying to service separately and bargaining with the gas contract.  At the time the only option to the State using its resources would have been for the State to work away from NET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the taxpayer was not aware of the £250 million Culliton estimated was the effective hidden subsidy that went to the conglomerate NET/IFI.  If the taxpayer had been aware of that, different decisions might have been made.  It is the concealing of the facts that is at stake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only concealment is the gas price which successive Ministers on both sides of the House over many years have declined to give for commercial reasons.  The only subsidisation involved is the subsidisation of NET and some of that subsidisation is, of course, coming from BGE because of the profit it makes on the gas.  You can argue that NET should not make a profit on gas price, that BGE should be left its profit, but then you would have to turn around and support NET directly with Bills like this coming to the House.  It is six of one and half a dozen of another.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point about transparency. It is something I will look at closely but, I have only come to this Department in recent days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about that.  IFI has a strategy to develop its own business and that is all right.  A strategy for NET is really answering the questions, what is going to happen to interest rates, what is going to happen to oil prices and what is going to happen to gas prices?  When you answer these three questions, you can write a strategic plan for NET on the back of an envelope because there are only three or four people down there.  All that it is doing is <Col N="213" /> paying the debt.  Therefore, you do not need a glossy five year plan with the Minister's picture on the cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  One cannot separate the two entities but it appears one has no relationship with the other.  I take all the points the Minister made, and I even made them myself.  I understand that but you cannot deal with them as if they are totally separate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not totally, but IFI has a plan to develop.  The only real connection is that dividends come from IFI into NET.  That is an income from NET and then NET, in turn, sells the gas back.  Yes, they are connected in those ways because they have a commercial relationship and, of course, NET is a 51 per cent shareholder.  They are connected legally and they are connected in business but IFI has its own programme.  We must have a clear strategic view of NET but you cannot have such without answering the questions I have posed, regarding interest rates, gas and currency movements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that NET is a holding company; it is there to manage a core debt, following the events I set out in my speech to the House and IFI is doing very well indeed.</P>
      <P>To refer to a point made by Deputy McManus, I would like to tell her that Irish Fertilizer Industries has recently invested £10 million in a new nitric acid plant at Arklow which will be completed in May 1993.  I would emphasise, again, now that the Deputy is with us, the fact that IFI is a sound, profitable company. It has good plans, it is well run and there are no fears, either on the part of the Government shareholder of ICI shareholders as to employment of future prospects. It is doing very well and I would like the workers in the plants to know that.</P>
      <P>NET's problems are separate.  They are to do with servicing a debt and with the financing of the built-up hard core debt which has now become more difficult because of a number of elements to do with oil, currency, gas prices and profits.  I wanted to make that point to the Deputy because it is important from the point of view of the workers that they understand there is no threat to IFI; it is not involved in this legislation directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Mr. McManus Mr. McManus">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to that very briefly by saying there is no decision. There is but one option and the Government as a shareholder, like all shareholders, <Col N="215" /> will look at its shareholding and see whether it is in the best interests of everybody involved to dispose of those shares or to hold on to them.  There is no decision on that.  It is an option and one we would have to look at because if you have investments in a company it may be an option to do something with them rather than leave them there when they are very valuable and then turn around, and take Irish taxpayers' money, as we are doing today, to fund a debt which we could reduce if we had some funds from the shareholding which would not affect the operation of the company.  It would affect the ownership of the company but it would not affect the operation of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> These amendments go to the kernel of the debate about the role of the NRA.  The issues involved were debated in detail on Committee Stage.  For long there has been a call for a single authority to develop the national road network. These amendments now seem to suggest that the national roads authority should be given the task with one hand tied behind its back.  Deputy Gilmore's amendments would effectively remove its power of direction altogether, leaving it powerless in the face of a local authority who refused to co-operate with it.  As I said before, the buck has to stop somewhere and it is logical that the authority which has been given the overall responsibility for national road development should have the reserve powers necessary to implement the mandate given to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 does little more than transfer the Minister's directive powers under section 11 of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 to the National Roads Authority, a logical step since it is taking over his Department's management functions in relation to <Col N="217" /> national roads.  However, in order to allay the fears which were expressed that the authority could ride roughshod over local authorities, particularly in regard to the alignment of a proposed road, I am introducing an amendment to section 22 which will allow the elected members of a local authority to make representations to the NRA where they object to a proposed road alignment.  The authority would be obliged to consider representations and, if having responded to the local authority, the latter is still aggrieved, it can make written submissions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have a number of options open to him in such cases following consideration of the representations, including the following: he could reject the representations; he could issue a direction to the NRA under section 41; he could issue general guidelines to the NRA under section 41 (2) which would have a bearing on the case in question; he could intervene on a non-statutory basis and seek to resolve the differences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to make some move on this issue.  As the Minister rightly said, it goes to the kernel of the debate about the role of the roads authority.  I think he would have to recognise that taking, for example, the most recent debate on the eastern by-pass where there was a very clear difference of opinion between the local authority and what appeared to be the view of the Department.</P>
      <P>The right of appeal to a Minister is hardly going to reassure councillors that their objections will be given proper consideration. Would the Minister not feel it more appropriate that rights of appeal in relation to an issue like this should more properly be heard by a body such as the planning board which has a distinctive and independent mandate and would, therefore, give objectors the feeling that there was due process, that they had an opportunity to request oral hearings if necessary to hear the various issues teased out in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Under the amendment which the Minister is proposing the roads authority merely has the obligation to consider objections.  It seems to me it should be strengthened by saying they would be obliged to accept some of these recommendations if they were the subject of a local authority's development plan.  If councillors were raising objections on foot of a development plan which had been put on public display for the proper duration, on which public opinion in the local authority area had been duly sought and which had been duly adopted under the planning Acts, such a development plan should have the power to override any view of the NRA.</P>
    <P>There is the crucial issue of subsidiarity or domestic accountability at stake here and, while the Minister's proposal is an advance in that Ministers at the end of the day are accountable in this House and can at least be called to answer for their decisions, it seems to me accountability cannot be to a House such as this but should be to the people of the local authority area concerned.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider whether a structure similar to An Bord Pleanála or, alternatively, the legal respect for development plans would be an obligation upon the NRA.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> These amendments will severely restrict the powers of the NRA to issue directions relating to land acquisition.  The first amendment states that the NRA can only direct the local authority to acquire land by making a compulsory purchase order or by purchasing it by agreement where the consent of the local authority has been obtained.  This is nonsense.  In effect, the NRA is being told it cannot use its powers of direction without the approval of the local authority.  It is like telling a court it cannot order you to do something without your consent.</P>
      <P>The second amendment is ever more restrictive.  It proposes that the NRA can direct the local authority to make a compulsory purchase order with the local authority's consent but it cannot direct the local authority to submit the CPO to the Minister for confirmation.  This is even greater nonsense; it is rather like saying a judge can impose a fine on you but he cannot insist that you pay it.</P>
      <P>The third amendment would require the Minister to approve of any compulsory purchase order, if there was a dispute over the land acquisition between the NRA and the local authority.  I cannot see the reasoning behind this.  If a CPO is involved, the law as it stands requires ministerial confirmation.  Also, the NRA has the reserve power in section 19 to acquire land itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must oppose these amendments.  In my view, they make no sense.  We have <Col N="220" /> gone out of our way in this Bill to preserve a balance by giving the NRA adequate powers to do its job effectively, while hedging these powers with safeguards and giving local authorities an opportunity to have their views listened to and their interests protected.</P>

      <P>My colleagues, Deputies Flanagan and Dukes, are not available in this interim period of five minutes before we go into Private Members' Time.  I had tabled a considerable number of amendments on Committee Stage of this Bill and I have particularly fond memories of it.</P>
      <P>One of the jackboot tactics of the proposed NRA and the Minister is to disregard the opinions of local councillors. These amendments seek to put an element of local democracy into compulsory purchase orders and into areas of controversy.  For example, the eastern by-pass in Dublin was a controversial route for which there was no local support from residents' groups but if the NRA and the Minister were insisting that this go ahead then a CPO could be obtained.  I think the consent of the local authority is a commonsense provision and it should be sought.</P>
      <P>I know it is the policy of this Government where possible to downgrade the role of local councillors, to diminish their functions at every possible turn.  We have seen this with new executive agencies being set up, with the abolition of health committees, agricultural committees and so on.  We know the Government's thinking on this but, at the end of the day, the local public representative is accountable to the people who elected him in the first instance.  Public representatives must return for a local mandate again and whether they did right or wrong in regard to a particular route, at least they are accountable to the people.  The faceless bureaucrats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Yates, I believe the whole democratic element is being dropped in this Bill.  I think the Minister's concession on the last amendment where he agreed there would be the right of some form of appeal should also be considered in the context of this amendment, where local authorities would have recourse to some form of appeal.  It is not very satisfactory that the recourse should be to appeal to the Minister.  I thought it would be much better if there was recourse to an independent appeals procedure.  There is an obligation on the roads authority and on the Minister to devise a system whereby local authorities, the elected representatives locally, would have a real influence over these decisions, that they would not be railroaded through in the way that appears possible under this legislation.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its opposition to the proposed GATT deal as it is currently framed in view of the prospect of reducing gross agricultural output by 5 per cent and as it extends beyond the level of volume and value restrictions on agricultural output agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June, 1992, as part of Common Agricultural Policy reform; and calls on the Government to ensure that Ireland's vital national interest and employment are protected before these proposals are ratified.</P>
      <P>This GATT will have the single most recessionary impact on the Irish economy in the decade of the 1990s.  I cannot think of any other single measure that will have such a devastating and negative effect. Up to 20,000 of our most productive jobs will be lost due to reduced food production and additional food imports.  The Government must vote against the final ratification of this deal or obtain concessions in the share-out of production cuts in the EC to protect our vital national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the prolonged formation process of the Government following the election and the crises affecting the currency, interest rates and unemployment, public attention has not focused adequately on the fundamental significance to Ireland of the proposed GATT.  Irish agriculture and food accounts for 40 per cent of net exports, 17 per cent of total employment in this country, and is worth £3.5 billion annually to us.  GATT proposes three fundamental changes in our biggest industry. <Col N="223" /> First, between 1993 and 1999 the level of agricultural EC exports are to be cut in volume terms by 21 per cent.  The cut in the value over the same period of export refunds is to be 36 per cent and on the imports side we have to allow in initially 3 per cent and up to 5 per cent of food imports in each product sector.  This will cost the Irish economy at least £260 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Due to the complexities of the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT deal, it is necessary to study each sector separately.  The impact will be most severe in the beef sector followed by the pigmeat and dairy sectors.  Cereal production, poultry, sheepmeat and sugar will also be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered at the outset that the world price for beef is 40p per pound in Argentina and 50p per pound carcass weight in Australia.  EC beef output is about eight million tonnes of beef per annum.  Consumption stands around 7 million tonnes &mdash; 6.8 million tonnes is the figure I am advised.  This leaves a surplus annually of 1.2 million tonnes of production over consumption and this has to be exported outside the Community.  The proposed GATT limit of beef exports for 1994 will be less than one million tonnes and this means a reduction in exports of over 200,000 tonnes of beef compared to the 1992 level.  As the EC has taken the base period between 1986 and 1990, the average over that four year period, this is substantially lower than what we exported in 1992.  In effect, what we are talking about is a 38 per cent cut in beef production.  In terms of reduced opportunities to export beef in 1994 and with an annual reduction of 36,000 tonnes in exports up to 1999, the total cut at EC level is 440,000 tonnes less beef to be exported.  That is just the volume cut of 21 per cent over six years.</P>
    <P>If we look at the cut in EC refunds, the situation is even worse.  The proposal to cut export refunds by 36 per cent over six years will mean a cut of £32 on a 100kg live bullock or a cut of 24p per pound on beef sides.  If the EC has to live with a <Col N="224" /> beef export limit of 800,000 tonnes there will be horrendous consequences for this country.  At a minimum, there will be wholesale calf slaughtering and £88 will be offered for male calves eight to ten days old to slaughter them.  That is an enormous waste in terms of animal production, husbandry, agricultural output and of meat processing jobs.  We will also have early intervention for cattle at 150 kilogrammes and this will result in a direct loss of employment.  The assumptions are that the consumption of beef in the Community will remain as it is or increase.  The situation will get worse if there is a decline in the consumption of beef by consumers in the EC and as Ireland exports 80 per cent of its beef we will be the member state in the Community most affected.</P>
    <P>The EC beef intervention intake for 1992 was of the order of 900,000 tonnes. Under the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement of June 1992 this was to be reduced to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. Where will this unwanted beef go?  The stark prospect for Irish farmers is that there will be some unwanted 200,000 cattle and they will be unable to dispose of them.  This immovable surplus could devastate Irish agriculture and cause an unprecedented crisis.  There is no intervention for heifers as only good quality steers can go into intervention.  What will happen to the price of heifer meat when we have 200,000 unwanted cattle dumped on the market?  The price of heifer meat could go into freefall after 1994.  The full extent of these decisions have not been acknowledged by the Government in its response to date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dairy sector, the proposed 21 per cent cut in the volume of EC dairy exports will mean a 24 per cent cut to milk producers over the 1991 level of production.  The common Agricultural Policy reform for dairying outlined two 1 per cent quota cuts.  This will not be sufficient to meet the GATT requirements.  It is proposed that dairy imports will rise, that 5 per cent of the consumer market will have to be imported products.  The combination of extra imports and the volume cut in <Col N="225" /> exports will mean a 5 per cent cut in the national milk quota.  The position will be especially critical for cheese exports.  I am thinking of hard cheeses, particularly cheddar.  GATT may allow an increase in butter exports but there is little worldwide demand for this.</P>
    <P>What does this mean for the ordinary farmer?  Ireland is going to follow what happened to Denmark.  The history of the Danish dairy industry is of profound significance for us.  What we have seen over the past 30 years is that there were 185,000 dairy farmers in Denmark.  How many are there today?  There are a mere 15,000.  Their goal is to have one single dairy co-operative and already their most significant dairy co-op accounts for 85 per cent of dairy production.  That is the prospect we are facing: wholesale rationalisation, P.45 forms and redundancies in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances is it any wonder the New Zealand dairy board have welcomed wholeheartedly this GATT deal. Their price of 40p per gallon for milk is uneconomic here.  It must be pointed out that their production costs are 17p per gallon, leaving a profit for them of 23p per gallon.  I also note that land prices in New Zealand are now making £2,000 per acre because they can make a profit at 40p a gallon.  They have much lower wintering costs because of their different climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make it clear in this debate what confirmation, if any, has been given that America will allow Bord Bainne and others access to 5 per cent of the domestic consumption of dairy products in the United States.  As 50 per cent of our dairy exports go to third countries we are particularly vulnerable in regard to these proposals.</P>
    <P>Despite improvements in the efficiency of the pigmeat sector, a crisis currently prevails for pig producers.  Since last May there has been a 30 per cent reduction in prices.  Early 1992 saw profit levels for every fat pig produced for slaughter of about £7 per pig but that has changed to a loss of £8 per pig now.  The critical issue for the pigmeat sector is what is called the &ldquo;aggregation&rdquo; of imports.  This means <Col N="226" /> that if more than 3 per cent of the total meat market is supplied by imports, then pigmeat, poultry and beef can be put together.  As current beef imports stand at 9 per cent, this could avoid the need for any additional pig meat imports into the Community.  It is vital that we get aggregation, that we allow the existing level of beef imports obviate the need for any cut or any additional introduction of pigmeat imports.  The Government must clarify whether pigmeat is to be separated from beef, both on the export and the import sides.  The GATT changes could result in an extra 480,000 tonnes of pig meat being dumped onto the EC market.</P>
    <P>During 1986 and 1988 EC imports of pigmeat accounted for 0.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent of consumption which was the amount that was imported.  If this has to rise to 3 per cent by 1994 and 5 per cent by 1999 there will be a surplus of 480,000 tonnes of pigmeat.  I understand the Commission are proposing a massive 25 per cent reduction in the base price of pigmeat.  Further losses cannot be sustained by this sector if we are to ensure the survival of the Irish pig industry.  We all know the rationalisation process; the notion of a small farmer with a few sows is gone.  We are reduced to 4,000 pig producers in this country, we are down to a hard core efficient industry and its survival is at stake.</P>
    <P>While sheepmeat does not seem to have been extensively debated in the present round of GATT talks, we have a vested interest in minimising New Zealand imports of lamb.  At present there is a voluntary restraint agreement governing such imports but this is up for renewal this year.  At present New Zealand can sell up to 205,000 tonnes of lamb into the EC without tariff.  New Zealand has been filling its quota in the first nine months of each year and arguing for an increase in that quota.  Given there are reports today that the top-up ewe premium will not be extended to 1993 and there is no change in the method of calculation proposed, which is a fundamental injustice to the Irish sheep farmers, the Government must ensure that a very tough line is taken on these <Col N="227" /> New Zealand imports.  Otherwise, the viability of our 52,000 sheep farmers will be put in further question.</P>
    <P>In relation to cereals, the primary focus of attention has been on oil seed crops, not by the Irish but by the French.  The GATT proposal is that the European acreage cannot exceed 5.2 million hectares. This is only a future cut of the order of 750,000 acres of oil seed crops. The French have very little to lose in comparison with our huge overall losses; yet they are screaming about it.</P>
    <P>Under GATT the volume of cereals exported must be reduced by 21 per cent between now and the end of the decade. It is not yet known to what extent the Common Agricultural Policy set-aside programme will succeed in reducing grain tonnage terms.  The target of grain reduction at EC level of 17 million tonnes and the level of grain exports will depend on the level of internal consumption of Community grain for animal feed as against cereal substitute imports.  In other words, the surplus of grain will still be there if we continue to import the cheap cereal imports that are coming from outside the Community.  I must add that the wording in the rebalancing agreement in relation to such substitute imports is extremely vague to the point of almost being meaningless.  It is fundamental in the Irish interest not to have a cheap grain feed policy because we have a grassbased system and the last thing we want is the factory farm on the continent, benefiting from cheaper cereal inputs that will make their product more competitive against ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister must clarify what are the likely effects on the set-aside programme. Some experts have argued that the 15 per cent requirement on set-aside will have to be doubled to 30 per cent on tillage land left barren to grow weeds. This can only result in further imports and further job losses.  The Minister must clarify the likely effect on specific crops. Winter grain production will disappear, for example, if a national average is used for individual base areas.  If one takes a national average, that will not take <Col N="228" /> account of the spring and winter variation. We have much higher yields in the winter and they will have to conform to those lower yields.</P>
    <P>The effects on wheat and malting barley &mdash; both have potential for growth in this country &mdash; need to be assessed so that Teagasc can give the best advice to our most efficient producers.  I believe there has been a huge improvement in the efficiency of our cereal sector but that will be lost unless we can obtain the new markets that are developing.  Most galling of all is the fact that this year we are being asked to set aside 15 per cent of our land while in America in 1993 the set-aside requirement for wheat is nil and is a mere 5 per cent for maize.  We do not have the same rules for all farmers.</P>
    <P>The beef regime is due for a review later this year and I am advised that the prospect is for a reduction in the quota and for a price drop.  This must be thoroughly resisted as beef is one of the few profitable sectors of farming currently.</P>
    <P>While progress has been made on such matters as exempting direct income aid from GATT cuts, it is clear that market-related premia to bring it up to the guidance price such as the ewe premium will be affected by the cutbacks.  The green box exemptions should apply to all direct income aids for farmers universally. Whether it is a cheque for set-aside land, a ewe premium, a special premium, or a spring slaughter premium, all of them should be in the green box and should be exempt.</P>
    <P>Following the November US-EC bilateral GATT deal it was expected that there would be an early ratification.  The former EC Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, has done a particular job for the European Community.  He has played an historic role in relation to these negotiations and has discharged his functions on behalf of Europe, but it is somehow believed that because he is Irish and is a public figure in this country, that he was acting in the best interests of Ireland.  He was sworn, as was Pádraig Flynn today, not to act in the best interests of his state but in the best interests of the Community. <Col N="229" /> We have lost out because of the political connections and association of the past and present Government with Mr. MacSharry and have failed to take an adequately robust line like that of the French.  It is now clear that the US Congress will not approve the fast track procedure by 2 March.  We now have a new deadline and extension of time.  The Government must use this extra time to highlight Ireland's vital national interest.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should meet the EC External Trade Commissioner Leon Britton with appropriate briefing material on the savage effects on the Irish economy. It is abundantly clear that this GATT deal goes beyond the level of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The underlying assumptions are based on most optimistic forecasts for consumption and for production made by the EC Commission. I believe these assumptions to be basically unsound.  The EC Commission should have withheld its proposal to Geneva last December until all the studies into the GATT deal effects were completed. There is no point in analysis based on the most favourable assumption.</P>
    <P>The contradiction during 1992 between the Dunkel final draft and the EC position papers shows that the GATT authorities do not accept that the Common Agricultural Policy reform as agreed in the June 1992 restrictions is sufficient while the EC Commission is conveying to the member states that it is clearly within the Common Agricultural Policy limits.  This is not so and a close examination of the Dunkel papers and what happened in the Common Agricultural Policy reforms is evidence of that.</P>
    <P>With a new American President and a more dubious approach adopted by many EC member states, the time frame for finalising this deal is gradually extending. We must not lose any time in insisting that there be full compensation for any further reductions beyond the level of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and we must insist that the share-out of production restrictions be based on individual member states production levels proportionately rather than the contributions <Col N="230" /> to surpluses. That is a fundamental point.</P>
    <P>If one looks to any sector &mdash; take pigmeat, for example, while it is in surplus &mdash; Ireland accounts for 1 per cent of pigmeat; it accounts for a couple of percentage points in all the areas, but because we have the lowest prices in the Community and because we export about 80 per cent of our products we trigger the intervention mechanism.  We are dependent on intervention.  We are not like German farmers who can bring their product to the consumer markets in Berlin.  We are not in the &ldquo;golden triangle&rdquo;. Therefore our contribution to intervention is much larger than our proportionate contribution to the total production. In other words, those putting into intervention are going to bear the burden disproportionately to their total level of production.  We must get agreement that the pain will be absorbed in relation to the percentage of the total level of production, not just the surplus. That is a fundamental point.  It is, therefore, unjust that we should bear the burden disproportionate to our overall production level.</P>
    <P>Finally, given our unique dependence on agriculture it is not adequate that these matters are left exclusively to the Agriculture Council of Ministers.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs should immediately launch a major diplomatic initiative to seek a special deal for Ireland.  This has been done before.  Because it will be a number of years before the effects of GATT hit farmers' pockets, the necessary degree of urgency is not being given to this issue.  I attended and addressed the massive anti-GATT rally held in the National Stadium last December.  There is total unity of purpose in rural Ireland on the rejection of this GATT deal.  The Dáil now has the opportunity to reaffirm its position. Failure by the Government to act could result in the loss of up to 20,000 jobs and may mean a lack in growth of GNP because of a drop in our agriculture output.  This recipe for Irish economic stagnation in the 1990s is totally unacceptable <Col N="231" /> in the context of our historic level of unemployment of over 300,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed EC-US GATT agreement will have a devastating effect on Irish agriculture.  It will definitely lead to thousands of farmers leaving the land and will result in huge job losses.</P>
      <P>The proposal to put restrictions on the volume of EC exports that can be subsidised could decimate Irish agriculture. Over 80 per cent of our agriculture production is exported, with 50 per cent of total exports going to third countries. Therefore, 40 per cent of Irish agricultural production is currently placed on third country markets, all of which are covered by export subsidies.  If the new agreement is accepted, 10 per cent of Irish dairy production will have to trade at world prices compared to 3 per cent of the EC average.</P>
      <P>With regard to beef, 15 per cent of Irish beef production will be forced onto the world market with no support, in contrast to only 4 per cent of EC production. The impact of export restrictions will be more than three times greater on the Irish dairy industry compared to the EC average and almost four times as severe on the Irish beef industry, relative to the EC average.</P>
      <P>It is now almost definite that whatever shape the final agreement will have it will include some form of export restriction. Our Government must ensure that any concessions made in regard to agriculture by the EC as a trading bloc are spread evenly among all EC producers and are not carried in a disproportionate way by peripheral regions such as Ireland.  As pointed out by Deputy Yates our Government must ensure that our farmers will not have to carry a disproportionate share of EC concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The agreement will allow US farmers unlimited production while Ireland and other poorer countries in the EC will be subjected to further reduction in quotas and greater competition on the world market from US agricultural products. The US certainly stand to gain substantially. They will have more access to the European markets, combined with less competition on the world market, but they have also retained a structure which will allow them to give subsidies to their farmers at their own discretion. There is an innate danger for us in Europe.  What is now to stop the Germans, for example, from introducing their own subsidy scheme under this agreement?  I would like the Minister to refer to this aspect of the agreement in his reply.  Is this creating a new precedent?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to dairy and beef production in the context of the proposed agreement.  While the restrictions on exports will not impact on butter and skim milk powder directly, other products, particularly cheese, will be affected as pointed out by Deputy Yates.  The EC Commission claims minimum access plus the reduction in exports would amount to 3.5 million tonnes of milk equivalent or approximately 3.5 per cent of total EC production.  It further argues that taking into account the settlement of the Spanish and Italian milk quota problem, 2 per cent of production will be bought up. Therefore, the Commission concludes that the commitment on the EC-US agreement can be met within the framework of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  This conclusion by the EC Commission would appear to be rather optimistic. The commitments on access and restriction on exports will probably displace 5 per cent of Community production: 2 per cent from new import concessions; 3 per cent from export restrictions.  If this were to happen, quota reductions over the six year period of 5 per cent would be required to hold milk prices at approximately current levels.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement that a commitment on beef raises particular difficulties. Even the Commission estimates the export volume restrictions will be of <Col N="233" /> the order of 5 per cent of EC production. This will have profound consequences for Ireland.  The EC claims that this problem would have arisen in any event even without a GATT agreement and that corrective action would have had to be taken to reduce the volume of production.</P>
    <P>The Commission referred to a Council regulation of June 1992 which contained mechanisms to reduce production.  These include control measures such as male calf slaughter premium, limits on intervention volumes and limits on the maximum weight of animals brought into intervention.  However, I am convinced that apart from the above measures, reduction in individual premia quotas will have to be introduced to match EC production in the medium term &mdash; in the next three to four years &mdash; with the commitments given under this agreement.</P>
    <P>This agreement will have to be resisted.  It will result in drastic consequences for the farmers of Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government not to stand idly by as they did in the currency crisis.  They must get involved in this immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share the time remaining with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan.</P>
      <P>This motion is extremely well-timed because during our lifetime it is likely, particularly in so far as those in rural Ireland are concerned, that we will have an agreement foisted upon us which will have a profound effect on the livelihood of every farming family here.  The proposed GATT agreement is vitally important for people who are far removed from rural Ireland, both in terms of location and thought.  The ramifications of this agreement will be felt in every town and city of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody must understand the significance of agriculture to the Irish economy. In terms of actual jobs, 14 per cent of the total population is involved in agriculture, a higher proporation than in any other EC country.  This does not relate to downstream industries.  We must also take account of the foreign currency earned from the export of our farm products. <Col N="234" /> A statistic which the Minister should remember but which he has forgotten in the past, is that both beef and store cattle production here is eight times more important to Irish farmers than farmers in any other EC country.</P>
    <P>Will our vital national interest be protected by the EC-GATT negotiators? Events in the monetary area here in the last couple of weeks lead me to believe that the whole question of cohesion in Europe, as I understand it, is now well and truly shattered.  If one is big, one plays the big game but if one is small one is sidelined.  That was not one of the principles of the Treaty of Rome; yet, Ireland came out the wrong end of the scrum last week.</P>
    <P>Another concern of mine is that the Administration of the new American President, Mr. Clinton are ensuring that they assist Canadian, New Zealand and the Australian farmer to obtain a better share of the market throughout the world through the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Germans have not changed their position concerning the GATT agreement now that their country is reunified?  There is no doubt that this was a welcome development but is appears to me that their stance has changed greatly in the past five to ten years.  I do not have to tell this House that Irish farmers are going through a traumatic period.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform package was, in my view, agreed over our heads.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Taoiseach were not up to date with what was happening during the concluding negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I have no doubt that if we proceed with implementation of that reform we will have fewer families on the land.  That is as certain as night follows day.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Common Agricultural Policy proposals is to reduce the output of agricultural commodities both in terms of volume of product and type of product.  The reduction in volume will quickly show its ugly face by way of job <Col N="235" /> losses in our creameries, meat factories and livestock marts.  Similar job losses will occur on the supply side of farming. There will not be as much need for fertilisers. General stores and stores selling machinery will lose jobs.  As production declines so also will input volumes.  It is only a matter of time before the job losses affect the general processing and distribution areas.  That is why I said that every large town and city in Ireland will feel the effect of this should it continue.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the proposed Common Agricultural Policy reform is the so-called guarantee of compensation to farmers in the areas of sheep, cattle and cereals production by way of various premia and headage payments.  Various regulatory methods are proposed to penalise producers who stock over the proposed limits.</P>
    <P>A guarantee was given by the former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, who seemed to be almost knighted by various sections of the community here, concerning what went into the infamous green box.  I am sure everybody understands the meaning of the green box. Basically it meant that whatever was promised in the Common Agricultural Policy reform could not be tampered with in the GATT negotiations.  However, that is not the American or the New Zealand understanding.  Where does our Government stand if it discovers before the GATT agreement is finalised that the green box will be opened and rifled?  I genuinely believe the Common Agricultural Policy reform was a bad deal for Irish farmers, and I remain so convinced. If we are to have another full frontal attack on Irish farmers by way of the GATT agreement we are facing a very difficult time here.  Now is the time for the problem to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In so far as our influence in Europe and America is concerned, the onus of responsibility is not only on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry but on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that every contact possible is made with our friends in Europe.  Now is the time to identify our <Col N="236" /> friends because after the GATT agreement is finalised friends will mean little to us.  It is now we want the support.  The biggest single crisis facing Irish farmers and their families is just around the corner and it is up to the Minister to do something about it now.</P>

      <P>If the proposed GATT deal is implemented it will result in the loss of £900 million per year, or 60 per cent of the present farm income of Irish farmers, and major losses to the Irish economy.  The world price proposals of the United States and the CAIRNS group will sound the death knell of the Irish family farm.  Irish farmers are a long way behind their European counterparts.  For instance, Holland, which is only the size of Munster, has a milk quota which is double the size of Ireland's and a pig production 60 times greater than this country.  It is clear that if a new GATT deal is not renegotiated in time farmers will vanish from rural Ireland.  One factory farm in Europe today is producing more milk than that supplied to the Drinagh Co-Operative creamery in the Minister's constituency of south-west Cork.  If the production of agricultural products is to be curtailed it must come about by curtailing the factory farms in Europe, not the traditional rural farmer of the south-west and mid-west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I need not remind the Minister of the serious situation facing the agricultural community from Mizen Head to Malin Head.  Ten years ago in the Castletownbere peninsula there were 485 milk suppliers to the Drinagh Co-Operative and the dairy disposal company.  Today there are only 43 suppliers in that peninsula. The same statistics apply to the Mizen Head and Muintir na Beara peninsulas. There are three peninsula areas in the Minister's constituency where the rural population is fast declining.  The Bishop of Cork stated publicly in my parish of Goleen a few weeks ago that it was a dying parish.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dail Éireann fully supports the efforts of the Government in its defence of Ireland's vital agriculture and feed interests in the ongoing GATT negotiations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for having tabled this motion and the Members for their contributions to date.  As has been said, this is a timely motion which should be of considerable benefit at present.  While appreciating that Uruguay is a long way from muintir Beara, at the same time, it is very relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, these talks have been underway now for almost six and a half years, since their launch in Uruguay in September 1986.  In regard to agriculture the Ministerial declaration at Uruguay at the start of the negotiations stated that there was an urgent need to bring more discipline and predictability to world agricultural trade by correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions, including those related to structural surplus, so as to reduce uncertainty, imbalances and instability in world agricultural markets.  It directed the negotiations towards the aim of achieving greater liberalisation of trade in agriculture <Col N="238" /> and bringing all measures affecting import access and export competition under strengthened and more operationally effective GATT rules and disciplines. This was, of course, only one element of the global negotiations which cover 14 other sectors.</P>
    <P>A mid-term review of the negotiations in April 1989 agreed that the long term reform objective for agriculture should be to provide for substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection, sustained over an agreed time period, resulting in the correction and prevention of restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets.  As a result, agriculture for the first time through this round of multilateral trade negogiations is the subject of a serious attempt to reduce international protectionism and is being brought under the general rules and disciplines of the GATT.  This results from the fact that in recent years increasing budgetary costs, and ever-increasing disputes regarding trade in agricultural products between the major GATT contracting parties has created a consensus that some remedial action should be taken.</P>
    <P>The major difficulties experienced in the agriculture sector of the talks have been caused in the main by a a fundamental difference of interpretation and approach to the entire issue of agricultural trade reform.  On the one hand the US and CAIRNS group have been insisting for a major part of the negotiations on the objective of the total elimination of all agricultural supports, with particular emphasis being placed on the EC's export refunds system.  Even when they moved from that position, they continued to seek an accelerated level of support reduction in specific areas such as export support, as well as a substantial improvement in market access.</P>
    <P>The European Community has rejected this approach and has consistently contended that current difficulties in agriculture should be tackled by addressing all production and trade impacting policies, thus ensuring that agreed reductions in support are determined in an aggregate way.  Commitments, <Col N="239" /> related to individual areas, such as exports or imports, should be consistent with the aggregate commitment.</P>
    <P>The Community's aggregate or global approach policy has been dictated by the fact that the various support mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy are complementary and interlinked.  Undue interference with any of them could undermine its continued viability.  Border protection measures and export refunds are an integral part of the dual pricing system of the Common Agricultural Policy and inseparably linked to overall support.  The undertaking of separate and specific commitments on market access and export refunds could undermine the Common Agricultural Policy and lead to distortions in trade which would have adverse consequences for Community markets in particular, for economies such as Ireland which are heavily dependent on export markets both within the Community and in third countries.  Singling out export funds, for instance, for special treatment would have severe consequences for our farmers, processors, food industry and for related industries. On the other hand, the global approach would allow the Community flexibility in choosing the support mechanisms to be adapted to meet commitments and would have the autonomy to choose those that are least damaging to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Despite continued pressure in the many crucial negotiating sessions since the commencement of the round, the Community has managed broadly to defend successfully its global strategy on agriculture.  However, its negotiators &mdash; despite strong reservations from Ireland and others &mdash; in December 1990 indicated that, subject to certain conditions being met, we might be prepared to undertake some commitments on minimum market access and on the volume of products which would have to be exported with export subsidies.  Ireland has continued to argue that any such commitments go well beyond the Council's negotiating mandate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> In late December 1991, the Director General of GATT, Mr. Arthur Dunkel, presented his Draft Final Act to conclude negotiations, following which participants agreed a four-track work plan to continue the negotiating process so as to complete the Uruguay Round: This plan involved: (1) intensive negotiations on market access, including all agriculture elements; (2) negotiations on services; (3) legal assessment of texts; and (4) work at Trade Negotiations Committee level to &ldquo;adjust the package in certain specific places&rdquo;.  The Community indicated it had major difficulties with the text in a number of areas, including agriculture, and would be seeking a more balanced and global package.</P>
    <P>Some progress was made on the market access aspects in the first few months of last year.  All the major contracting parties submitted schedules of concessions to the GATT Secretariat in March.  The EC's agriculture schedules contain basic data in each of three areas but the actual level of reduction was omitted as this had still to be negotiated.  As regards minimum access, the EC schedule indicated the level of additional product which would have to be imported in each sector to meet the proposed commitment. Prior to submission in Geneva the schedules were the subject of heated debate within the Community.  Many member states, including Ireland, strenuously opposed the submission of such data, in particular that relating to quantities of product exported with direct export supports and on minimum access as it would be a clear signal that the EC was willing to undertake these commitments and the Council had not approved this.  However, the Commission assumed its negotiating responsibilities and submitted the schedules, albeit with the proviso, at the insistence of the Council of Ministers, that it was without prejudice to the position of the Community on the Draft Final Act. Other parties also submitted schedules, some incomplete, but there was little real discussion on this aspect as the overall issues remained to be resolved.</P>
    <P>After several fits and starts the US and <Col N="241" /> the Commission negotiators entered into a series of intensive negotiations in the autumn of last year.  These culminated in a meeting in Blair House, Washington at the end of November where an outline agreement on agriculture and oilseeds in the context of the Uruguay Round negotiations was reached.  These negotiations centred on agriculture on the premise that an agreement in that sector will enable an overall package to be concluded rapidly.</P>
    <P>Details of the agreement were presented in the form of a document submitted to the full Commission on 26 November, 1992.  The main elements of the accord are as follows: the Common Agricultural Policy reform compensatory payments/headage payments and similar payments elsewhere would not be subjected to GATT discipline; other internal supports would be reduced by 20 per cent over six years; the commitment would be in aggregate rather than in policy specific terms and credit would be allowed for action taken since 1986; border measures would be converted to tariff equivalents, based on a methodology suggested by the Community, which would be reduced by 36 per cent over six years; access commitments can be met through aggregation; average 1986-90 subsidised exports would be reduced by 36 per cent in budgetary terms and by 21 per cent in volume terms from 1994 over six years; a &ldquo;peace clause&rdquo; which is acceptable to the Commission has been agreed; this provides that where commitments on export subsidies are observed, there could be no recourse to GATT dispute procedures and on oilseeds, the Community has agreed to restrict support for production on a hectarage basis and to a minimum set-aside arrangement in that sector.</P>
    <P>The outline agreement between the Commission and the US negotiators and other elements of the overall GATT negotiations will have to be approved by the US Congress and, of course, by the other parties to the GATT.  Within the Community, the agreement will have to be formally accepted by the Council of Ministers.  The understanding is that if <Col N="242" /> the Congress and Council endorse the agreement, it is likely to be accepted in due course by all GATT participants. Following the outline agreement, the Commission again undertook its negotiating responsibilities and submitted revised schedules to GATT in Geneva based on the elements contained in the Washington accord.</P>
    <P>We now come to the heart of the matter regarding the general implications of the outline agreement and its effects on the European Community and the reformed Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Before turning to specific aspects of the agreement, I would like to make it clear that Ireland in the various negotiating fora has always recognised that a fair and successful outcome to the GATT negotiations would provide a valuable boost to the world economy.  Indeed the Irish position in relation to the round has been consistently positive and supportive and this stance was faithfully reflected in the statement by Dáil party leaders on the round on 6 November last.  Also a failure to conclude an overall GATT deal would not imply a return to the <i>status quo</i> in international trade.  This clearly will not be the case and the increasing recourse to unilateral actions and to challenges in GATT in recent years are worrying and growing trends in international trading conditions.  However, I have always stressed throughout these negotiations that any final GATT agreement would have to be balanced and global and take full account of our particular concerns.</P>
    <P>The Community's mandate made it clear that there could be no question of an agreement which in effect only covered agriculture or which required the Community to bear an unequal share of the burden of reform of international markets. In this connection it is also worth recalling the Council's position that any agreement must be compatible with the Common Agricultural Policy reform outcome which was only concluded after long and arduous negotiations last May. The impact of these reforms is only now being fully appreciated within the Community and it would be totally unreasonable <Col N="243" /> and irresponsible to expect European Community producers to make even further sacrifices in the context of GATT.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we have to assess the European Community/ US agreement.  We have, of course, examined the Commission's outline of the agreement and its assessment of its compatibility with Common Agricultural Policy reform.  We have also seen statements made by the US side on the outcome. However, we also need to have a more detailed explanation of the agreement and to have it evaluated at Community level with full particulars being provided by the Commission.  For these reasons I sought and obtained a Council commitment at the January meeting of Agriculture Ministers that this detailed evaluation should be undertaken immediately so that Community negotiators can be given appropriate instructions in the ongoing GATT discussions in Geneva.</P>
    <P>From my own preliminary analysis of the draft agreement, I accept that improvements have been secured on the Dunkel formula, in particular the apparent exemption of Common Agricultural Policy reform and disadvantaged areas payments from GATT disciplines.  These provisions contained in the outline accord with the US will, of course, have to be transposed into a GATT agreement &mdash; a very important feature to be pursued in the future negotiations.  The Community will also have to secure general acceptance of its approach to tariffication and access.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the improvements secured <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Dunkel approach, we have major difficulties with the overall agreement.  Our evaluation to date shows that the Community would be required to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of reform.  We also believe that the undertakings could not be accommodated within the parameters of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement in a number of sectors. Indeed, this assessment is accepted in the Commission's own analysis&mdash;specifically <Col N="244" /> in relation to beef and implicitly for some other sectors.</P>
    <P>Such an outcome would create major and severe problems for Ireland given the contribution which agriculture makes to our economy and I have brought this fact to the attention of the European Community negotiators.  Our concerns are exacerbated by our heavy reliance on export markets which makes us particularly vulnerable in an over-supplied market.  This matter has been raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Yates.  I accept we have major concerns and worries in this regard.</P>
    <P>From our point of view, the main risk arises from the proposed volume restraint on subsidised exports and the methodology to be used in meeting commitments. The 21 per cent reduction together with the access arrangements will, inevitably, require the Community to reduce production much further than envisaged in the Common Agricultural Policy reform in a number of sectors, particularly in the beef sector.  The problem is made even more acute by the requirements to reduce exports in the first year below 1986-90 levels and by linear cuts thereafter with minimum flexibility.  That is the front-loading which is extremely serious for us.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector, this would require the Community to reduce exports by more than 200,000 tonnes on current levels in the first year and by 500,000 tonnes in the final year.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform measures will not reduce Community output by these amounts and, even if we wanted to do so, we cannot now put measures in place to reduce beef output by 1994.  We also understand that the restriction on subsidising exports to East Asia is to remain in place.  This makes the situation even more difficult.</P>
    <P>While similar problems will arise in other sectors &mdash; milk is a major concern of ours also &mdash; the problem is most acute in the beef sector.  There is also a problem with cereals.  There are also other questions such as the precise terms of the peace clause and the way in which sizeable intervention stocks will be disposed <Col N="245" /> of before the commencement of the agreement.  The latter is raised as a problem in the Commission's analysis paper but a solution has not been proposed. This aspect is of particular concern given the level of current Community stocks of cereals and beef.</P>
    <P>The foregoing gives a flavour of our concern in regard to this stage of the negotiations but we need to be absolutely clear as to the full implications of this accord.  We can do this only by an examination on the lines I suggested earlier. If, as I believe, the commitments involved are not capable of being contained within the Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangements, then a totally new situation exists and this must be addressed.  For this reason the evaluation exercise of the compatibility of the outline agreement with Common Agricultural Policy reform now under way at expert level in Brussels, is of paramount importance to the next and possibly final stage of these negotiations.  I want to make it crystal clear to the House, as I have made it clear to our European partners, that I will not accept an outcome which goes beyond Common Agricultural Policy reform parameters unless such an outcome is accompanied by firm commitments that our vital interests will be protected in the further measures that would then be necessary.  If the agreement cannot be accommodated within those limits then that situation will have to be dealt with either by moderating the terms of the agreement in the further negotiations or by putting in place acceptable measures to defend our vital interests in the further measures which would then be necessary.</P>
    <P>The timing of the final stages of these negotiations is not too clear at the moment.  When one considers that every deadline in this round of talks has been broken, it is unlikely that there will be an early conclusion of the negotiations.  A lot will depend on the attitude of the new US Administration and our latest information from Washington suggests that the new US negotiating team will be seeking an extension of between six to nine months of the US fast-track negotiating <Col N="246" /> procedure.  This was due to expire at the beginning of next June and would have necessitated an agreement in GATT by the beginning of March in order to comply with Congressional examination and approval requirements.  These early deadlines now appear unrealistic and it looks as if more time will have to be provided to conclude the round.  Furthermore, recent comments from Washington suggest that the US side itself may have some problems with certain elements of the EC/US outline accord, on agriculture, and in other areas of the talks, which the new Administration will wish to take up in the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our position on the outline agriculture deal is quite straightforward and fully appreciated by our partners in Europe and I have availed of every opportunity to explain our concerns.</P>
    <P>In brief, these are that we would have major difficulties with any agreement which is not compatible with Common Agricultural Policy reform; volume restraints on subsidised exports pose a serious difficulty for Ireland and no one should underestimate the extent of the problem which this aspect creates for us, the agriculture aspect cannot be dealt with in isolation or before a complete analysis of the overall GATT outcome has been undertaken.  Ireland has always been committed to an early comprehensive and balanced result to the round.  Equally, we have been absolutely clear that our critical interests on agriculture, and indeed other areas such as textiles, should not be sacrificed on this particular altar.  That remains our position and only when all the issues have been negotiated to the point of maximum possible consensus, can the Government adopt its final position on the round.  In regard to agriculture, I would re-emphasise that in that final position we will not accept an outcome which goes beyond the Common Agricultural Policy reform parameters, unless it is accompanied by binding commitments which protect our vital agriculture and food interests.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it clear at the outset that the progressive Democrats Party supports the terms of the Fine Gael motion although its wording could give a wrong impression.  Deputy Yates's motion seems to assume that there is an agreement on agriculture within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade whereas there is only a bilateral agreement between the United States and the European Community.  This bilateral agreement was drawn up by two individuals who have since retired from politics and it related to one sector only.  It should be made clear that the Government cannot be bound to accept this deal drawn up between those two politicians as a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  When a major crisis confronts a key industry here, it would be helpful if all parties were seen to take a united stand on behalf of that industry.  Was it necessary for the Minister to alter the terms of the motion by putting down his own amendment?  On this occasion it would have been fitting to accept the amendment as it was put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a working party of the European Community's Council of Ministers Special Committee on Agriculture is investigating the compatibility of the MacSharry-Madigan arrangement with the decision made last June to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. This deal is of particular importance to Ireland.  Our agriculture and food sectors are more export dependent than those of any of our EC partners.  Approximately 42 per cent of our net foreign earnings and 26 per cent of our exports are generated by Irish food products, whereas the average for the Community as a whole is just 9 per cent.  It is fine for the United States to talk about liberalising agricultural trade when only 2.5 per cent of their labour force work in that sector; we are seven times more dependent on <Col N="248" /> agriculture.  Obviously, with the spate of threats and counter-threats of imminent trade wars, GATT needs to be replaced by a more effective global agreement. There are very few angels among the main protagonists in the new GATT round.  US Government spending accounts for 25 per cent of the total earnings of American farmers and the relevant figure for the European Community is well over 30 per cent.  It is incorrect to say that the US does not support its farmers.  It is interesting to note that there are 2.4 million farms in the United States, whereas there are nine million in the Community.  However, the average size of an American farm is 175 hectares and the average size of a European Community farm is only 13 hectares. Therefore, it is clear that US farmers have a competitive advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> EC farmers.</P>
    <P>We must put the trade talks in their proper context, particularly in regard to important areas such as the dairy sector where a mere 7 per cent of world milk output is traded.  The problem for our food industry, for our farmers and the economy as a whole is that Ireland is such a major exporter of agricultural produce. Over 70 per cent of what we produce on our farms has to be exported.  Our dairy industry has expanded and is now a major motor for development in our economy. Irish dairy companies have developed into international food companies with processing plants located as far apart as Budapest and Wisconsin.  Significant advances have been made in the white meat sectors &mdash; pig and poultry meat &mdash; by our major dairy processors.  For 20 years output remained stagnant but, as a result of the IDA and FEOGA supported programme, we have experienced a 25 per cent increase in pig meat production since 1989.  We are one of the most efficient producers of pigs in the European Community and even in this relatively non-subsidised area more than 50 per cent of produce has to be exported.</P>
    <P>Discussions in Brussels on a deal that will fundamentally alter the terms of trade are critical to our economy, our farmers, our food exporters and <Col N="249" /> employees in the food industry.  The key elements of the MacSharry-Madigan package are improved import access to the Community, primarily through increasing imports from 3 per cent in 1994 to 5 per cent in 1999, reduced internal EC support culminating in a 20 per cent reduction in internal Community supports and a reduced commitment to exports, with export subsidies to be cut by 36 per cent.  The volume eligible for subsidy will be reduced by 21 per cent. A key issue that confronts us is the base period against which these cuts are to be measured.  The choice of a base period of 1986 to 1988 means that the cuts proposed seem lower than they actually are. The 21 per cent cut in the volume of products that can avail of export refunds translates into much higher figures in reality.  For instance, in the beef sector, the volume of products will have to be reduced by 33 per cent in relation to 1991 export levels.  The same figure in the white meat sector is a cut of 40 per cent in subsidised exports.</P>
    <P>A second critical issue for Ireland is our particular level of dependence on exports.  We export 80 per cent of all dairy products and one-third of our total production is exported to third countries. Under the proposed deal approximately 10 per cent of Ireland's dairy products could be forced to trade unassisted while, for the remainder of the Community, this figure would be as low as 3 per cent. In the beef sector, 15 per cent of Irish production could trade at world prices while the average for the rest of the Community would be 4 per cent.  The impact of these proposals goes far beyond the reforms agreed under the Common Agricultural Policy reforms last June.  To take the dairy sector as an example, the net effect will be to increase import of dairy products into the Community from 1994 to 1999.  For example, imports of cheese are set to double in that period.  Given the already painful adjustments in the dairy sector brought about by the imposition of milk quotas, any measures which will have the net effect of creating an imbalance in the dairy market must be vigorously opposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> A recent study by the ICOS analysed the impact of those measures.  The total amount of extra imports proposed is equivalent to 3 per cent of our national milk quota.  The decreases in the volume of products supported on the export market is equivalent to a further 2.4 per cent of the quota.</P>
    <P>Therefore 5.4 per cent of our milk quota will be jeopardised.  This is significantly greater than the cuts agreed last June.  The Commission's estimate is that we should have a Community surplus of 5 per cent in the beef sector.  This could translate into a much higher cut of up to 10 per cent of production in Ireland.  The combined effect of the GATT proposals and the Common Agricultural Policy reform will put approximately 452 jobs at risk in the dairy sector.  A further 440 jobs will be put at risk in the beef sector. Those figures do not take into account any further reduction in farm employment as a result of the measures.  This runs counter to the Government's stated objective in the Programme for Government of maintaining the maximum number of viable farm households and of maintaining employment possibilities in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The two major farming organisations, the IFA and the ICMSA, put the cost of the proposed deal at £318 million and £250 million respectively in terms of the cuts in the value of agricultural outputs. This will seriously affect economic activity here.  It is clear in the present circumstances, with some 302,000 people unemployed, that the proposed GATT deal is a further and totally unacceptable threat to existing Irish jobs.  I ask our Minister to take a very firm stand and fight, using all the available resources, the deal as it has been worked out to date to ensure the protection of our agricultural industry and those employed in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with care and attention to the Minister's contribution and I am uneasy about it because its tone was passive.  The Minister in the course of his address referred to the European Commission being prepared to undertake <Col N="251" /> commitments on minimum access, non-subsidised exports and so on and stated that he outlined our concern about this.  However, our concern did not prevent the European Commission doing something that will land us in the soup in some months' time, perhaps later this year.  The Minister said the Irish Government and others opposed the submission to Geneva of the relevant figures for consideration under GATT.  However, the figures were submitted and it did not seem to make any difference because all the things we hoped would not happen have come to pass.  If this continues we will have to get tougher in our tone, diplomacy and substance in terms of our interests.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if the GATT reform goes beyond Common Agricultural Policy reform and if it costs more we must be compensated for it.  I have one basic problem in this regard; following the Edinburgh Summit some weeks ago, we are party to agreeing a financial perspective for the European Community which sets the ceiling on spending for the entire Community for every area of policy up to 1999.  We got a commitment of £8 billion for Structural Funds, but the price was an agreed financial perspective with a ceiling.  If we fail &mdash; and so far the Minister has failed in the GATT round to hold back the Commission &mdash; where will the compensation come from?  The perspectives and budgets are in place but compensation is not provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in a very difficult position politically and I sympathise with him, but if we get it wrong this time, as we got it wrong relying on others to intervene in the currency crisis, our farmers will pay a horrendous social price which we cannot afford.  In respect of GATT and Common Agricultural Policy reform, we all agree they are interlinked and in a sense inseparable.  In regard to rural society and protecting family farms, the fabric of rural life, the main criterion is what they can generate in agriculture from farming.  Of course we want agri-tourism and the Leader programme but <Col N="252" /> all those put together are penny halfpenny schemes in comparision with the basic income derived from agriculture.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a special case.  We do not need to reiterate it here but it is worth observing that we depend more than any other member state on trade in beef and dairy products.  We have a beef dependence in terms of our overall agricultural output nine times the European average and a dairy dependence seven times the European average.  We could complete with the United States &mdash; if we got rid of four-fifths of our farmers, the efficient one-fifth could compete with anyone but we do not want to do that.  What may we now expect?</P>
    <P>As a member of the European Community we have quotas on output and further quotas on the way in some sectors. That is self-evident from objective analysis of the figures.  However, other countries may continue to increase their output and are not subject to any quota. How did this come about?  It resulted from the EC and the United States doing a bilateral deal within GATT.  We now have no long term protection and although we had tough things to say about what we wanted along the way, after the MacSharry-Madigan meeting in Dromoland Europe went soft and gave everything in terms of agriculture; the United States in net terms has given nothing but have gained a lot.  Of course, it is not a final deal but if it is not modified it will be disastrous for the net vital national interest of our farming industry and the economy.  What will it mean? Ireland, the most trade dependent country within the EC, will export less and import more under Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The Minister is aware that at the tail end of that reform process, we who are heavily dependent on intervention will sell half a million tonnes of beef less into intervention than at the beginning.  It is our job to sell it to the consumers in the market but under the minimum access requirements under GATT another half million tonnes will flood in.  There will be a further one million tonnes of beef in circulation in the <Col N="253" /> Community together with an increase in supply but no increase in demand.  We all know how markets operate.  If supply increases in a market where there is a fixed level of demand, the bottom falls out of the market and the price falls.  If we agree to Common Agricultural Policy reform and add an equivalent amount by way of minimium access condition for others, the dramatic scale of the price fall will mean a cleaning of the land of farms similar to what happened over the past two or three decades in the United States.</P>
    <P>To a lesser degree, but to a significant and worrying extent, the same concern applies in regard to the quota provisions that will arise in dairying.  The implications of this are magnified for Ireland because of our greater relative dependence on those product areas and on trade.  Overall the Minister talks about trying to hold the line with the European Commission but experience should teach him that he is losing.  The Commission will go to Geneva with figures the Minister did not want submitted and will grant concessions to the United States.  It is a battle that the Minister is already losing and in regard to the possibility of compensation, there is already a ceiling on the financial perspective of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister should adopt the policy he referred to with a tougher tone, attitude and vigour.  That approach should also be adopted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Irish diplomatic service has a big battle on its hands and if it is lost the fabric of Irish rural life will be diminished.  It is a battle that requires toughness in all respects.</P>
    <P>I will finish as I began by saying that there is a certain passive tone to what I have heard, we must now learn lessons here.  I am a very committed pro-European but after the past few weeks, like everyone else, my eyes have been opened.  There is no point in being committed but naive.  If GATT reform goes beyond Common Agricultural Policy reform, I do not know where the compensation will come from and I do not know what the Minister proposes for the fabric of rural life besides providing a <Col N="254" /> few initiatives which will come from the Structural Funds, the Leader programme and agri-tourism which are all fantastic add-ons if you have a basic income.  If there is no basic income there is no basic fabric to rural life and that is what is at stake here.</P>

      <P>The implications of the GATT proposal for our farmers is the most serious problem we have ever encountered.  The technical details have been clearly stated by my colleague, Deputy Yates.  The real problems here in relation to the meat industry cannot be over-emphasised.  How did those problems arise?  They resulted mainly because of German unity and the free access of meat and livestock products from Eastern Europe about which very little was done.  Suddenly we had massive intervention stocks and the consequential problems.  That has helped to increase the power of the US to force us to make commitments to curtail our meat outputs in the years up to the end of the century. That commitment cannot be met unless farmers' incomes are dramatically reduced resulting in subsequent losses in output, jobs, the agricultural industry and our economy.</P>
      <P>Since we joined the quota regime in 1983 the position in the dairy sector has been similar.  That quota has been lowered almost every year since 1983.  Our quota in 1983 was brought about not just by the Minister for Agriculture fighting for us in Europe but by the then Taoiseach, Garett FitzGerald, travelling from country to country to ensure we got the best possible deal.  The position in relation to this GATT is similar and our Taoiseach should support the Minister to ensure that we get our fair and proper share.  However, if we are to go by what happened in the currency crisis in the last few weeks we have little hope of such support in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked to curtail our output from now until 1999.  What have we got in return?  Have the US or New Zealand been asked to make any cuts in their outputs?  I am not aware of any agreement relating to New Zealand, <Col N="255" /> Australia or America agreeing to quotas or to cut back output.  History has shown that each time Europe curtailed its quota output, two years later output increased in the US and New Zealand to take up the slack which meant that, once again, we had to curtail our output.  We have an extremely serious problem in that, unfortunately, an Irishman acting on our behalf in Europe accepted all the cuts with no guarantees about future quotas. The consequences of the curtailment of output here will be a major reduction in farm incomes, subsequent job losses and a lowering of our output.</P>
    <P>Much of the income is supposed to have been replaced by Common Agricultural Policy reform by means of subsidies. The Minister will recall that there was great enthusiasm to expedite those subsidy payments last November. When documentation reached the local office in Ballybay cheque payments were issued.  That is not the current position. Those who were not paid then continue to wait patiently while their bank managers pressurise them in regard to their loan repayments.  This change is the result of Common Agricultural Policy reform and it will be the procedure for the future.  If there are any small technical errors farmers will have to wait indefinitely for the subsidy payment.  Media reports have highlighted small technical problems within the Department.  I hope jobs will not be lost over that as farmers who fail to meet every technicality have suffered losses in their income for two years.  That is only a minor detail, the reason for this debate is that the GATT is extremely important.  We must generate enthusiasm in the negotiations. The Minister and his team of civil servants, who no doubt will do their best, must be seen to have the active support of a united Government.  The Taoiseach and all the diplomats must make a stand once and for all to ensure our vital national interest is upheld and preserved and that farmers right across the country get their entitlement.</P>
    <P>In regard to the poultry and pig sectors it is considered that GATT reform will <Col N="256" /> be advantageous and will mean cheap grain and food inputs but that is not so. History has shown that if the Americans have a surplus they will sell it to Europe at any price, but as soon as any crisis occurs, for example, resulting in a shortage there, they will increase their prices. Having been involved in farm organisations some years ago I recall an official of the American Embassy travelling around the country advertising the value of soya beans and that we should pick up their soya bean surplus which provided protein for animal feeds.  Less than 12 months later that product or the official promoting it could not be found. Weather conditions in the US caused scarcity of the product &mdash; and we could no longer buy soya beans at a realistic price.  That is the position in which we will find ourselves if we stop grain products and we depend solely on the US for cheap products.  Our poultry, pig and other animal feeds producers will suddenly find themselves totally dependent on a small number of importers, wheeler dealers will put prices up and we will no longer have the supposed adge as a result of the lowering of grain prices promised in this famous Common Agricultural Policy and GATT deal.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Minister to fight this issue and to make the strongest possible case to ensure the interest of farmers here are fully protected.  Forty per cent of our output comes from the agricultural sector and that figure is based on natural production, not on imports.  If farmers' interests are not protected the Minister and his Government will have a major problem when they face the electorate. If the Government fails to provide the proper basis for our agricultural production and if we accept the GATT proposal as it stands people will not continue farming and we will have serious problems. Having been involved in the dairy industry in the past the Minister is aware of the importance of dairy farming.  My colleague pointed out the number of farmers who have got out of that business in the south and the same applies to Cavan, Monaghan and parts of the west. We want to ensure that as many people <Col N="257" /> as possible remain in production.  That can only happen if the Government takes GATT seriously and protects us in the present negotiations.</P>

      <P>With regard to the devaluation of the Irish pound on 30 January 1993, it is becoming increasingly difficult in recent days to figure out exactly the &ldquo;whodunit&rdquo; dimension and who, if anyone, let us down in Ireland.  It appears to be the &ldquo;Government dog that did not bark&rdquo; who is responsible for this particular tale.</P>
      <P>On 6 January the Minister for Finance was reported as being critical of what he called a &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deal between France and Germany to protect the French franc, a deal not available to countries such as Ireland.  In his contribution to this House on 10 February, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge that on two occasions last year the German authorities went beyond their obligations in providing assistance for the French franc.  This led to the understandable perception that the dominant partner in the European monetary system was differentiating between currencies.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister and the Government were deeply concerned at this discriminatory process, although the French intervened politically to secure advantage from the Germans for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend the Department of Finance expressly confirmed that the Bundesbank was not asked for specific support for the Irish pound.  This is fully consistent with the reported comments of Herr Hans Tietmeyer, the Governor-in-waiting of the Bundesbank.  The Irish Government in terms of a potential vital &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deal from the Germans to uphold its exchange rate policy got precisely what it asked for from the Bundesbank. <Col N="258" /> The Minister asked for nothing specific and that is precisely what he got in the end.  In the past two days that uneasy truth has been recycled to suggest that a &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deal was sounded out on more than one occasion by the Governor of the Central Bank and separately by a senior official of the Department of Finance.  These overtures were rebuffed by the Germans.  Politically the buck stops with the Minister, the Taoisearch and the Government.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the General Election and subsequent negotiations to form a Government, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that nobody was minding the shop.  The Government appears to have confined itself at a political level to a single letter from the Taoiseach to Chancellor Kohl of Germany.  This whinged about &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deals but, incredibly since they worked so well for the French franc, the letter is reported in the national media to have stopped short of seeking such a remedy for the Irish punt.  The Minister and the Taoiseach should confirm that this is the case and be accountable to this House.  If we are to accept the Minister's recycled version of events it follows that the Germans were in no doubt about separating the wheat from the chaff in currency terms.  In such circumstances it was grossly irresponsible of the Government to plough on regardless with its currency policy in the full knowledge that no special comfort would be granted to Ireland as a means of steadying market sentiment.  The Minister stated that it was not possible to telephone the Bundesbank or to get in touch with them by direct means.  Why? This was a crisis affecting every person and business in this country.  Would direct contact not have underlined the very importance of the matter to this State?  If Protocol was so important then, why is it not important now when the Minister was engaged in a whingeing war of words with the Bundesbank after the event?  It is reported that the Government felt it would be in breach of ERM rules for the Bundesbank to provide special help for the Irish punt.</P>

      <P>It is a disgrace that the Government chose to play by the Marquis of Queensberry rules while whole sectors of the Irish economy and our national reserves were threatened with extinction.  If there is a political lesson to be learned it is that passive politicians, particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, must accept full responsibility for a debacle which they could have addressed if they went about their business as confidently as their French and Danish colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made clear in recent statements the approaches made requesting support for the defence of the Irish pound in the crisis since September.</P>
      <P>The approaches made were directed mainly at the German authorities because of the necessity for the backing of the Bundesbank if any support moves were to be successful.  As a Minister, I could not approach the Bundesbank formally since no mechanism is available for such approaches.  We were in new territory and there was no precedent for this on our part.  In addition, the whole EMS was suffering unprecedented strains.</P>
      <P>Against this background a number of soundings were taken to ascertain the position of the Bundesbank for intra-marginal support for the Irish pound.</P>
      <P>In September, the Irish Central Bank asked the Bundesbank for support similar to what had been given to the French authorities in regard to the French franc. The Bundesbank was not prepared to render such assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the autumn both at ECOFIN level and in the context of meetings of the monetary committee, I and my officials sought to encourage the German authorities to take greater steps to defend the ERM and the Irish pound than they were obliged to do under the ERM rules.  In particular, we, in common with other member states pressed for an early lowering <Col N="260" /> of German interest rates since such a vote would have the most beneficial effects in lessening tensions in the whole EMS, thereby reducing the need for currency support.</P>
    <P>In November, the Irish representatives on the monetary committee informally approached the Bundesbank representative to again suggest that we should be afforded the same assistance as the French franc.  However, this was refused on the grounds that this would be a fundamental change to the ERM and that other members would look for similar treatment.</P>
    <P>At the Edinburgh Summit, I raised the issue of the EMS crisis.  I felt it had not been treated with a sense of urgency and that greater solidarity was needed to solve the problem.  I pressed for greater co-operation from all our partners, including the German authorities.</P>
    <P>In the first week of this year the Governor of the Central Bank approached the President of the Bundesbank about the issue of intra-marginal support. However, the Bundesbank did not offer any prospect of such support.</P>
    <P>On 11 January, the Taoiseach wrote to the German Chancellor about the Franco-German arrangement and pointed out that this was damaging for the Irish pound.  In our view, the absence of such an arrangement for us was open to misinterpretation and could be seen as a lack of commitment to our currency by our EMS partners.  The Taoiseach asked for the Chancellor's assistance to promote Community wide initiatives to help ease the ERM tensions.</P>
    <P>I might remind Deputies that in response to my request the Council of Ministers on 18 January issued a public statement indicating their support for the stance of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Immediately prior to our devaluation, we received intimations from the Chairman of the Monetary Committee that he was prepared to work to put together some type of support arrangement. However, as I have said before, at that stage we considered it too little, too late. There was no mention of a reduction in German interest rates at the time.  After <Col N="261" /> we devalued, the Danish crown came under pressure but there was co-ordinated action by European Central Banks and a reduction in German interest rates which helped stave off this attack.</P>
    <P>I might also add that in the period since September, it was quite clear to all concerned that our currency and other currencies were under sustained pressure. Despite pressures on the German authorities they felt that new initiatives outside the ERM rules were not required.  For domestic reasons they felt unable to cut interest rates until February this year.  I would point out that there has been no intra-marginal support for several other currencies in difficulties during the crisis; and that despite pressure from several member states since September a German interest rate cut did not materialise until early February.</P>
    <P>We cannot dictate to the German Central Bank their response to situations. Their perspective is different from ours. This is a matter where one must put forward one's views as strongly as possible in the hope that in the ensuing dialogue it may be possible to convince the other party to change its mind.  I consider that the Government and the officials involved took all possible steps to get assistance for the Irish currency from the German authorities over the period since September.</P>
    <P>I welcome the belated co-operation signalled by the support for the Danish Crown.  I hope this is a sign of greater co-operation by the ERM partners for the future.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cox for the opportunity to reply to this issue.  I have done so on three consecutive days.  As far as I am concerned it is unhelpful to pursue this matter any further.</P>

      <P>The <i>Celtic Pride</i> report into the tragic deaths of Catherine and James Tomlins confirms that their deaths on 12 August last were a tragedy waiting <Col N="262" /> to happen.  It is clear that the vessel on which the Tomlins family was travelling was chronically defective and that the defects had been a cause of complaint by passengers for some considerable time. It is clear that the complaints were well known to the board of the Swansea-Cork Ferries and to the Polish-Baltic Shipping Company from whom the ferry was on charter.  Paragraph 8.15 of the report states:</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the <i>Celtic Pride</i> has had a long history of problems with the sewage system on board.  It appears that those involved did not realise the dangers associated with a badly functioning system and their various efforts were attempts to treat the symptom rather that tackle the cause of the problem. When this problem was finally tackled, unfortunately precipitated by the deaths of two children, the core faults were quickly established and rectified. In the opinion of this investigation, the status and condition of the sewage system on the <i>Celtic Pride</i> was &ldquo;an accident&rdquo; waiting to happen.</P>
      <P>Following the tragedy I expressed the view that the total incompetence and criminal negligence which resulted in the death of the two Tomlins children warranted the bringing of criminal charges of manslaughter against those responsible. The published report confirms my view that such criminal prosecution should be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, following the publication of the report &ldquo;that the report comprehensively fulfilled its purpose&rdquo; is extraordinary having regard to the fact that the report fails to address the issue of responsibility for this tragic event and does not, as the parents of the deceased children state, &ldquo;explore the human factors surrounding the decision-making process that allowed a potential hazard to continue to exist without adequate resolution&rdquo;. The fact that the brief given to the marine surveyor did not allow him to address the issue of responsibility smacks of an attempt at an official cover-up.  The exact responsibility in this appalling affair <Col N="263" /> of the Minister for the Marine, the Department of the Marine, Swansea-Cork Ferries Board, the captain and crew of the ship and of the Polish-Baltic Shipping Company should have been fully investigated and clearly spelt out.  It is now clear that the brief given to the marine surveyor by the Minister for the Marine for the preparation of his report was too narrow and too restrictive.</P>
    <P>I am also appalled by the statement made by the board of Swansea-Cork Ferries who seek to pin sole responsibility for this tragedy on the owners of the ferry.</P>
    <P>The board was responsible for chartering the ferry to travel the route, they had a public duty to ensure the ferry was safe and that the complaints about defects on board were properly redressed. Unfortunately, since this tragedy, the primary objective of the board has been to carry on business as usual and not to face up to and confront its own appalling failures.  The board had a public duty to investigate and assess whether passengers were in danger and to ensure that complaints were properly dealt with. It failed tragically in that duty and the members of the board should now resign.</P>
    <P>On 19 August last I wrote to the Garda Commissioner expressing my concern at the limited nature of the Garda inquiry being conducted into this tragedy and requested that the fullest report be made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions. By letter dated 19 October 1992 I was told that the Commissioner, having carefully considered all relevant material available to him to date, decided that the conduct of a criminal investigation was not warranted.  There should now be a full and proper criminal investigation.  I call on the Government and the Commissioner to commence a full investigation and ask that the fullest and most comprehensive report possible be made without delay to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I also want to know what communication, if any, took place between the Minister's office and the Garda Commissioner following this accident with regard to the nature of the <Col N="264" /> inquiries the gardaí should make.  It has been brought to my attention that local members of the gardaí expected that there would be a full criminal investigation but, in fact, there was an inquiry, not a full criminal investigation, as expected.</P>
    <P>The Tomlins family have suffered an appalling bereavement.  They are the victims of events that should never have taken place.  They are now faced with a full civil trial in the High Court in which there are contentious matters at issue to determine where the full responsibility lay for the tragedy.  The only merit that can be attributed to the board is that liability is being admitted but the damages payable to this family have not yet been determined.  Nevertheless, in the context of their being a party to the court proceedings involving the ferry board and the shipping company, they will incur substantial legal costs and the minimum the Government should do is to indemnify the Tomlins family in respect of those costs and expenses.  It should not be necessary to have a full civil High Court action to determine where responsibility lay.  This should have been the subject of a Government inquiry and should now be the subject of a full criminal investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise at the outset that the purpose of the investigation into the <i>Celtic Pride</i> accident was to determine the cause of the accident and to recommend measures to prevent a recurrence. It was not the function of the report to apportion blame or liability.  The report has been forwarded to the Garda authorities and the Chief State Solicitor for their consideration and any action which they deem necessary on foot of its findings.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline for the House the steps which were taken following this tragic occurence on foot of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary examination of the vessel by marine surveyors of my Department immediately following the accident <Col N="265" /> revealed the vessel's sewage system as the cause of the accident.  Immediate modifications were effected and some days later the vessel was taken out of service to allow permanent technical modifications to be carried out.  These modifications involved, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision of two new permanent sewage vent pipes, the cleaning of all sewage tanks, modifications to the internal structure of the tanks and the fitting of new aeration system to ensure a positive aerobic operation of the system.</P>
    <P>All ferry companies operating into Ireland were immediately requested to review and report on the sewage systems on their vessels, in line with detailed guidelines and to review the operational procedures for crews in the detection of and response to smells and gases.  A special meeting of the national ferry safety committee, on which all the ferry companies are represented, was convened to review the accident and the lessons to be learnt from it.  The ferry companies indicated that the safety systems on their vessels were safe.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, marine surveyors of my Department conducted a thorough examination of the sewage systems on the vessels. No major deficiencies or problems were identified.  No trace of lethal gas could be detected on any vessel.  The examination of sewage systems on board passenger ferries is now an ongoing feature of inspections being carried out by my Department.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, which is the international forum for dealing with matters of ship safety, should be furnished with the report in order that the information therein may be disseminated to all other maritime administrations. The report was forwarded to the secretary general of the IMO on 12 February.</P>
    <P>The Irish authorities had already requested the IMO, last October, to introduce requirements for the standards of design, construction and operation of sewerage systems on ships and for periodic inspection of such systems.</P>
    <P>The 61st session of the maritime safety <Col N="266" /> committee held in London in December, 1992 accepted the need for standards in relation to design and construction of sewerage systems.  The matter was referred to a specialist IMO sub-committee on ship design and equipment which will meet next week.  The deputy chief surveyor will be attending that forum and I am meeting the secretary general of the IMO next week in order to underline to him the importance which we attach to the need for international regulation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, the report recommends that a Marine Notice should be issued by my Department in order that those concerned with shipping, including the owners, operators and crews of all types of vessel, passenger or cargo, may be made aware of the dangers which can exist with sewerage systems on ships.  The Marine Notice which is circulated to mariners, shipowners, brokers and agents and other marine interests will include the guidelines and information which have been circulated already to the ferry operators but will also take on board any expert advice that may emanate from the ship design and equipment meeting next week.</P>
    <P>The Government also approved the establishment of a new ferry users' forum to deal with passenger complaints about safety matters on ferries on Irish waters. The new forum operates under the aegis of my Department and includes representation from the ferry companies and a range of consumer and passenger interests.  The second meeting of the forum, which I took the opportunity of attending in person, took place this morning.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to take the opportunity to give the House a brief outline of general ferry safety procedures currently in force.</P>
    <P>Irish-registered passenger vessels are inspected annually by my Department's marine survey office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates. The vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and operated to the highest international standards and in particular to those laid down in the International <Col N="267" /> Maritime Organisations's Safety of Life at Sea Convention, known as SOLAS, which contains provisions concerning life-saving appliances, stability, navigational facilities, fire protection, construction, surveys, radio installations and the carriage of dangerous goods.  The SOLAS Convention is given legal effect in the State by various statutory instruments and the law in this area is constantly being strengthened.</P>
    <P>Foreign-registered passenger vessels operating from Irish ports are also inspected at least once a year by marine surveryors under the provisions of an agreement on port state control.  This agreement aims at ensuring that ships comply with international safety, pollution prevention, crew welfare and other standards.</P>
    <P>The safety of sea passenger transport is kept under review by the National Ferry Safety Committee.  The committee is an expert technical group chaired by my Department's chief surveyor.  The committee reviews safety procedures and standards and makes recommendations to the Minister on how those procedures and standards might be improved.</P>
    <P>All procedures and standards currently in place are aimed at achieving the highest possible level of safety on ferries operating into Irish ports.  I want to assure this House that I intend to see that this objective continues to be met and that additional measures will be taken to reinforce safety standards where these are identified as necessary.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, came to Tallaght on 6 November 1992 and announced the starting date of 14 April 1993 for the long-awaited regional hospital, most people, including the other political parties, were prepared to accept his word.  He said: &ldquo;Work will commence on the Tallaght regional hospital on 14 April 1993&rdquo;.  That was announced at the Tallaght Person of the Year Award ceremony on 6 November last.  Approximately two months later, that commitment was one of the very few specific undertakings in the Programme for Government.  It said: &ldquo;Funding is being provided to enable the construction to start in the spring of 1993&rdquo;.  The ink was hardly dry on page 28 of the Programme for Government when word leaked that work on the regional hospital would not commence in April.</P>

If the Taoiseach's pledge, underwritten in the Programme for Government, becomes only the latest in a long litany of broken promises on this issue, who can the people believe? What standing will politicians have if a project so major and vital to almost 250,000 people whom the hospital is designed to serve can be advanced and withdrawn in such a cavalier fashion? Government spokespersons were anxious to point out that the 6 November announcement was planned months in advance and that it was not merely another election promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, has now revealed &mdash; I am very sorry he cannot be present in the House tonight &mdash; that on entering the Department, he discovered that not even the <Col N="269" /> required tendering notices had been placed in accordance with EC regulations. In what kind of light does this place the Taoiseach's undertaking?  Was the Taoiseach's statement in Tallaght no more than an election ploy in a vain attempt to win a second seat for Fianna Fáil?  According to the new Minister for Health, no further action was taken after the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Health and his Minister of State returned from Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In what manner does this disgraceful episode reflect on the negotiating talents of the new Minister for Health and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who represents the constituency? They were two of the authors of the Programme for Government, and presumably inserted the specific commitment on page 28.  Did it ever occur to either of them to query their opposite numbers as to whether the most basic procedures had been complied with?  Was the Taoiseach's statement made to cover a different blunder?</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that neither the Taoiseach nor the former Minister, Deputy John O'Connell, is present to answer these questions tonight because I find it very difficult to believe that when the Taoiseach made the announcement on 6 November the Department did not swing into action to put the normal procedures in place.  If the order was countermanded I would like to know who did so because all we have had so far is what I would regard as an unprecedented public assault on the airwaves by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on his own Government backbencher, Deputy Flood, who is the former Minister of State at the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght hospital is not the only issue at risk tonight; the credibility of the Government is also at risk on this issue and only the announcement of a clear and definite date on which work will start on the project will dispel the gloom and dejection felt by people who have waited almost 20 years for their own hospital.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, for allowing me to raise <Col N="270" /> this matter this evening.  I was present on the infamous occasion in Tallaght when the Taoiseach gave the commitment on Friday, 6 November and I remember his words very well.  He said that he was not a man who gave approximate dates &mdash; Easter was not good enough for him &mdash; that he was a man of action and would give the precise date which was Wednesday, 14 April, the Wednesday after Easter.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach made that commitment, he should have been aware of the procedures necessary to make it a reality.  It would have been necessary for the Taoiseach to put the procedures in place almost instantly given that they are long and detailed and the scale of the contract and the tendering arrangements that need to be entered into at European level.  I believe that the Taoiseach did not intend to do anything and if an election had not been on the horizon, no such specific commitment would have been made.  I very much regret that.  After the election, when the Taoiseach's party had not taken a second seat in the constituency, perhaps the intention was to punish the people by not proceeding with the hospital.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday, like Deputy Rabbitte, I listened to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who will have to take his share of the blame because he was part of the negotiating team with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance who would have been aware of the exact position in relation to the Tallaght hospital.  I am also aware, having been involved in an indirect way in negotiations of this kind, that before such a commitment is put on paper in a programme for Government, official views are sought from various Departments.  I am sure that the Department of Health would have been asked for its view.  I wonder what its response was, whether it made the negotiators aware that this was an unrealistic commitment and that it was just not on to stick to a date in the spring of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that, contrary to the confidentiality rule, he was able to tell us on <Col N="271" /> Sunday that nothing happened between the date of the Taoiseach's announcement in Tallaght and the date he entered Government and that, if it had not been for him and the Minister for Health nothing would have happened.  I take a poor view of that statement.  Although he is not present this evening the Minister cannot begin his term in Government by simply walking away from his responsibility.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question to the Taoiseach in relation to his comments in Tallaght but he transfered it to the Minister for Health.  Neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Equality and Law Reform was present in Tallaght and the Taoiseach should come into the House to answer questions in relation &mdash; as the Minister for Health has said &mdash; to the unrealistic promises he made to the people of Tallaght. Will the Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Justice outline the precise timescale?  If dates are given, they should be realistic and dates that can be met because the people are tired of false and broken promises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital will have 467 beds with full state of the art support facilities and will, as the Deputy is aware, incorporate the Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.

    <P>This reassurance has been given by previous Ministers for Health on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it again tonight.</P>
    <P>I can again confirm that the construction of the Tallaght hospital is a top Government priority and will commence as soon as possible this year.  The project is proceeding at all possible speed.</P>

      <P>The Minister took up office on 12 January and during his first week he instructed his Department to start the tendering process with all possible speed.  The Department wrote to the Tallaght Hospital board on 22 January instructing the board to commence the tendering process.  Under EC regulations projects of this magnitude have to follow certain defined EC procedures.</P>
      <P>The prior notice advertisement which initiated this process appeared in the EC Journal on 2 Febraury which was the earliest possible date on which it could appear.  I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that three restricted procedures notices, for the main hospital construction, mechanical sub-contracts and electrical sub-contracts respectively, appeared in the EC Journal of 5 February which was also the earliest possible date on which they could appear.  In line with the procedures, advertisements also appeared on 10 February in the main Irish national newspapers drawing attention to the notice in the EC Journal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to hear that the Minister has arranged to meet on Friday next, 19 February, the Tallaght Hospital board and the three hospitals involved, the Adelaide, the Meath and the <Col N="273" /> National Children's Hospital to ensure that the necessary planning and tender documentation changes can be finalised as quickly as possible.  He will also be meeting the Tallaght community groups to keep them informed of progress on the project.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to confirm again to the House, to the nation at large and particularly to the people of Tallaght that the Minister has put in place a schedule to ensure that building commences at the earliest possible date in 1993 and to reiterate that the necessary capital funds for the project have been provided by the Government in the Health capital programme for 1993.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for expressing an interest in the Williamstown sewerage scheme and for meeting a deputation from the area last year.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter previously on the Adjournment.  For the people of Williamstown it is a source of serious concern that even though this scheme was first proposed in the late fifties sanction has not been granted by successive Governments since then.  I understand that the scheme will cost £330,000.  This money should be provided this year so that the sewerage scheme for Williamstown can be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The village of Williamstown is located in a low lying area and there are problems with soil percolation.  The national school, a seven teacher school, and facilities such as the community centre need a sewerage scheme.  There are six public houses in Williamstown and each of the publicans has been in contact with local representatives to have this sewerage scheme provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contract documents for the scheme <Col N="274" /> were submitted by Galway Country Council in September 1982.  I hope at this stage that all the documents have been submitted to the Department, including a report on the site investigation and the bills of quantities and that the Minister will be able to sanction the scheme in 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Environment approved a preliminary report for the provision of a sewerage scheme to serve Williamstown a number of years ago.  It was clear there was a need for the scheme because the facilities serving that area were totally inadequate.  Galway County Council submitted contract documents for site investigations in July 1992. The county council subsequently submitted the overall contract documents for the scheme in September 1992 and supplied the necessary certificate of completion of planning in December 1992.</P>
      <P>These contract documents are being technically examined at present.  It is clear from the documents submitted that the county council has expanded the scope of the scheme to serve additional premises and amended and extended the route of the outfall sewer.  These amendments, which were not approved by my Department, have had the effect of significantly increasing the estimated cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>A technical examination of these documents is being carried out at present.  I am well aware of Deputy Kitt's concern to ensure that funds are provided for the scheme this year and, as soon as the technical examination is completed, I will do what I can to ensure that finance is made available at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of extending the Ballymacward/ Caltra/Castleblakeney group water scheme to the townlands of Tycooley, Newtown and Breda.  I am very familiar with this scheme because I happen to be one of its consumers.  There are 550 consumers in all and the scheme is supplied from two sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> As I understand it, it is proposed that approximately one and a half miles of pipe be laid to serve over 20 houses and I hope that sanction can be given.  The trustees of this large scheme agreed to extend the water supply but are having problems in that the families at Ballymacward need to be developed.  They have proposed to the Department that the pumphouse should be relocated at the springs and that there will be a rising main from the new springs to the reservoir. I ask the Minister to consider undertaking this work at the same time, namely, the improvements at the source of the supply and the extension.</P>
    <P>This scheme represents good value for money.  Even though it is a large scheme the trustees are in a position to provide water over a distance of one and a half miles to a further 20 familes.  While there are 129 group water schemes in County Galway awaiting approval I hope the Minister will sanction the improvements and the extension as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>The proposed Newtown-Tycooley group water scheme is an extension of the Castleblakeney/Ballymacward group water scheme and is intended as Deputy Kitt has said to serve up to 15 households and farms.  Its development was delayed for a number of years because the group was unable to locate a suitable source of water supply. In 1992, the Castleblakeney/Ballymacward group agreed to make a supply available to the group provided their distribution system was capable of meeting the additional demand.</P>
      <P>The Castleblakeney-Ballymacward scheme is supplied from two sources.  The main source of supply at Alloon Cross is subject to quality variation.  High concentrations of dissolved calcium and related suspended matter result in a deterioration in water quality as well as reduced flows in the distribution systems due to extensive encrustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Castleblakeney-Ballymacward group have submitted outline proposals to upgrade the scheme headworks at Alloon Bridge and to provide additional <Col N="276" /> water treatment to overcome the problems associated with excessive calcium levels.  Water treatment in this instance is a complex matter and Galway County Council is assisting the group in examining effective means of treating the source.</P>
    <P>The proposed Newton-Tycooley scheme is located in the Caltra area which is mainly served from a deep well source and not directly affected by the problems at Alloon Bridge, the main source of supply.  However, the distribution system in this area has been extended beyond its original design capacity and existing pressures and peak flows are inadequate to facilitate an extension to Newtown-Tycooley without provision of booster pumps and possible storage.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised the Castleblakeney-Ballymacward scheme to make provision for the additional works needed in order to supply Newtown-Tycooley when making their overall proposal regarding the upgrading works now being considered.  In the meantime, my Department will be requesting the Newtown-Tycooley group to submit a design for the proposed extension.  However, I am sure that Deputy Kitt can appreciate that further progress must await developments on the Castleblakeney-Ballymacward scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern of members of the Newtown-Tycooley scheme to proceed with the development of their scheme.  I will ensure that the groups application will be considered further as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Group water scheme are a very important source of water supply for rural communities.  There is a strong local commitment and I will do my very best over the next few years, including at EC level, to have the finances available to me increased to permit many of the group water scheme which have been proposed to proceed.  I will sanction this scheme as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The general election of November last brought little joy in its wake, but I have to admit to one positive outcome in County Sligo &mdash; a start is to <Col N="277" /> be made on the west Sligo group water schemes.  This is not much of a start &mdash; just one phase of one scheme &mdash; and this decision was not made until the voters were about to go into the polling booths. It was faxed down to beat the deadline. This was an election ploy if ever I saw one, but the promise was made and I was glad to learn from the Minister last week in answer to my Dáil question that it is to be honoured.</P>
      <P>What about the rest of the schemes in west Sligo which are all equally urgent? The problem is well known to the Minister. Part of west Sligo is without piped water and is surviving on wretched alternatives. Yet, a superb source supply of 500,000 gallons a day exists in the pipeline stretching through the heart of the territory from Corhownagh Church near Ballisodare to Corballa Church near the Mayo border.</P>
      <P>The Minister, unasked and for some reason still unexplained, divided the Castleconner group scheme into three phases with promised funds for just one phase. When will work on phase two and phase three start?  Will the work be continuous? Will the division into three phases mean extra costs and, if so, who will pay?  When will the Minister provide funding for the Skreen-Dromard scheme?  When will he provide funds for the Kilglass scheme and the very small scheme at Cooga?  The Minister found it possible in November, with all the preoccupations of the time, to give the go-ahead and the funding for phase one of the Castleconnor scheme. Surely he knows there is an equal need for phase two and phase three, for the Skreen-Dromard, Kilglass and Cooga schemes.  I am now asking the Minister to give a promise that he will provide immediate funding for all the schemes, to complete the job and remove this major problem from a beautiful part of a beautiful county.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I am sure the Deputy is aware that I met the representatives from that area early last year after my appointment.  I indicated that those schemes would exhaust the resources at my disposal for the entire country having regard to the cost per house.  However I promised that I would look at the possibility of obtaining EC funds and subsequently I was able to make a start on the schemes.  Indeed I have done far more than anybody else, despite the pressures on my resources, to make a start on these schemes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, group scheme grants and contributions from members are insufficient to finance these schemes and a substantial contribution from the provision for the public water and sanitary service is required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the financing of sanitary services schemes generally, including large group schemes, will have to be addressed in detail when the 1993 allocations are published tomorrow.

      <P>Stage IV of Kerry central regional water scheme involves the townlands of Doon, Listollick, Lahern, Lissanearla, Guranne, Kileen, Ballyroe, Curravough, Ballintobeenagh, Lismore and Leith.  The residents of the townlands mentioned are very annoyed and, indeed, frustrated at the lack of progress on the commencement of Stage IV.</P>
      <P>In the Ballyroe area the local organiser collected over £7,000 over three years ago.  Small sums of money were collected in the other areas over six years ago and the expectation was that work would commence immediately.  The area that Stage IV will serve is densely populated. Several householders are involved in agriculture, agri-tourism and in the guesthouse business, all with a high dependency on the availability of quality water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the householders have bored wells.  However, the quality of water is most unsatisfactory as it has a high iron content due to the nature of the underlying <Col N="279" /> rock &mdash; pensil.  This iron water is not the most suitable for domestic use as it corrodes the water pipes resulting in continuous maintenance work and replacement of boilers, water pumps, etc. The water in most households has a most unpalatable taste.  The supply is also inadequate and unpredictable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give a firm commitment tonight that he will provide the necessary funds to enable work to commence on Stage IV immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Deenihan did not allude to the fact that this major scheme will serve 1,100 houses.  The first and second phases have been completed at a cost of £600,000 and serve 600 houses.  Work on the third phase is proceeding at present for which £500,000 was provided in 1992.  Outstanding grants will be paid when the scheme is completed.  The fourth and fifth phases are under consideration and will <Col N="280" /> follow when the third phase is completed and as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to group water schemes nationally is that we are unable to meet the demand from the resources available for these schemes and have had to devise a list of priorities but under no circumstances could Deputy Deenihan suggest to this House that we have not been mindful of the needs of the people living in these areas having regard to the fact that two very expensive phases have been completed and the third is nearing completion.  The cost of upgrading the pipe so that it can be integrated with the regional scheme has added enormously to the cost of the scheme but will ensure that the quality of water in that area will be greatly enhanced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly concerned for some time about the problem of moneylending both in rural and urban areas. This is a serious problem which has been with us for some considerable time and which particularly affects the unemployed and those on low incomes generally.</P>
      <P>I plan to introduce a household budgeting facility for social welfare customers by next May.  It is planned to introduce the new service on a trial basis in Dublin and to extend this facility as quickly as possible to all areas of the country.  I have already introduced the legislation to allow for decuctions to be made from social welfare payments with the claimant's consent.  The amounts can then be paid over to the ESB, the Gas Company and local authorities.  An Post has been asked to develop the household deduction facility as part of the development of their services to social welfare clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this service as having great potential to assist social welfare families who do not normally have access to the financial budgeting service provided by the banks.  The offices included in the initial phase are: (A) North Cumberland Street, Ballyfermot, Kilbarrack, Nutgrove, Tallaght and Werburgh Street.  The organisations which have agreed to participate in the scheme are: (B) the ESB, Bord Gáis Éireann, Telecom Éireann, An Post (TV licences), and Dublin Corporation <Col N="51" /> and Dublin County Council for rent and mortgage.</P>
    <P>In 1992, my Department funded the establishment of pilot projects around the country aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending. Five projects were set up in Dublin city west, west Clare, Cork city, Limerick city and Waterford city.  Under this scheme local groups who had already been involved in this work are expanding their efforts and are trying out a variety of new and different approaches to tackling the problems of moneylending.  The key elements of the projects include a general money advice element, targeted at families identified as having particular problems with moneylenders, a role for both statutory and voluntary bodies and an emphasis on practical, budget based measures that would have success over the long term in removing people from dependence on moneylenders.  The regional management of my Department and the local community welfare service are both actively involved in these projects.</P>
    <P>The work of these projects is being monitored by my Department.  I will be examining the results of this evaluation with a view to extending the scheme.</P>
    <P>This initiative builds on the experience of the loan guarantee fund which I set up in 1990.  This fund continues to be operated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which provides valuable assistance to families with problems of indebtedness.</P>
    <P>Credit Unions are co-operating in the work done by my Department and the community welfare officers.  Any further measures will be taken in the light of our experience with these initiatives.</P>

They carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare benefits, review claimants' means for assistance payments and monitor their ongoing entitlements to social welfare payments.  There are approximately 530 staff involved in this work.</P>
      <P>The work of these units has a positive and significant impact in reducing the level of fraud and abuse and thus helps to ensure that moneys are available for those genuinely in need.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to warn people who are currently abusing the social welfare system that all resources available to my Department are clearly focused on stamping out abuse and the full rigour of the law will be applied.  The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a significant number of measures backed by legislation over the years, including penalties with fines of up to £10,000 or up to three years imprisonment or both.  I will continue to ensue that any further necessary measures will be applied.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare <Col N="53" /> allowance scheme, unlike other social welfare schemes, is administered by the health boards.  Under the legislation governing the scheme the determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board.  The legislation also provides for an appeals process and an appeals officer has been appointed in every board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I have recognised that there are a number of aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which require review.  In this regard an advisory group under the chairmanship of my Department has been established with representatives from all health boards.  The question of standardising practices in relation to appeals has been discussed by the group and the observations of appeals officers in the health boards have been invited.</P>
      <P>The object of the review is to improve consistency and to ensure equity for all appellants.  Of particular importance will be the provision of improved information to the client on the right to appeal.</P>
      <P>I believe that the appeals system can be improved significantly by introducing better quality information for clients, standardising application forms and explaining decisions to clients.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is designed to offer immediate assistance to people in need and, therefore, a rapid and localised response to supplementary welfare allowance appeals is required. Given the context in which the scheme operates, the capacity of the scheme to determine appeals speedily and simply could be lost if a more formalised appeals structure were to be established.</P>

      <P>With effect from July 1992, the circumstances in which an applicant may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for a number of weeks were broadened to include persons who, on termination of employment, receive severance payments in excess of a prescribed amount.</P>
      <P>This measure was considered necessary to counter situations where the social insurance fund could, in effect, be used as a top-up for substantial redundancy packages which, in some cases, also involved seasonal work for fixed periods in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>The present position is that a person receiving a redundancy payment of more than £12,000 may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks and the overall duration of entitlement to that benefit of 15 months is reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, it is my intention to have the policy measures introduced last year reviewed with particular reference to their impact on certain categories of social welfare recipients.  Any decision relating to these measures would have financial implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 25, 68, 73 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>In April 1991, social insurance cover was extended to all employees earning £25 per week or more.  As a result, over 26,000 part-time workers were brought into social insurance and can now be eligible for unemployment, disability, maternity and treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>Changes in the benefits system were required to accommodate this group.  The 1991 and 1992 Social Welfare Acts provided for these.  Detailed provisions were set out in regulations signed by my predecessor late last year.  The new regulations came into force on 4 January, to coincide with the change in the benefit year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two aspects to the new arrangements.  First, there are graduated rates of payment for workers on very low earnings.  It would not make sense to pay <Col N="58" /> £53 per week, the current single person's rate of disability or unemployment benefit, to someone whose earnings, when they were working, had only been say £25 or £40.  A person in that situation would have an incentive to give up their job and claim benefit instead.  So, for people on very low earnings, benefit levels are related to the earnings they had when they were employed.</P>
    <P>The second feature of the new regulations relates to loss of employment.  The purpose of unemployment benefit is to provide a replacement income for people who have lost their jobs.  Now that so many part-time workers, some of whom normally only work a day or two per week, are covered for social insurance, it was necessary to review the conditions for unemployment benefit to ensure that they were in line with the scheme's objectives. In the new regulations the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit were changed to include the requirement that the claimant has suffered a loss of employment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is not affected by this change.</P>
    <P>I am monitoring the effect of these regulations and will advise the Government of my findings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced in 1977 and since then has operated as the safety net for the social welfare system.  When the scheme was originally introduced it was welcomed as a major advance which replaced the discretionary home assistance scheme with a statutory minimum entitlement based on need and a standardised means-test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is undertaking a comprehensive <Col N="59" /> review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the light of changes that have taken place in social welfare provision and the demand for social welfare services since the introduction of the scheme.  The aim of the review is to build on the strengths of the scheme, which include the provision of an immediate, flexible, personal and local response to need, and to address the weaknesses, which include perceptions of secrecy surrounding the scheme and lack of consistency in its operation.</P>
    <P>In this regard, an advisory group under the chairmanship of my Department has been established with representatives from all health boards.  The purpose of the group is to provide a formal structure for regular discussions between the Department and the health boards on the operation of the scheme.  It aims to review all aspects of the operation of the scheme within health boards with a view to achieving consistency in the operation of the scheme.  This group is developing, <i>inter alia,</i> comprehensive guidelines on all discretionary aspects of the scheme including supplements and exceptional needs payments.</P>
    <P>In view of the increasing role of supplementary welfare allowance in support for housing costs, a review of the guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation is a priority for the advisory group.  These guidelines are also being discussed with the Department of the Environment.  I intend to publish guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation later this year.</P>
    <P>The availability of good quality management information is a basic requirement for the efficient administration of any of my Department's schemes.  The information available in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme fell far short of the minimum required for this purpose.  To meet this need the advisory group has developed a statistical system which will allow boards to provide detailed statistical and expenditure analysis in respect of the various elements of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The system was introduced <Col N="60" /> in a number of health boards in January of this year and will be extended nation-wide in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Improving the quality and delivery of service to the customer is a fundamental aim of my Department.  In this regard it is my Department's policy to minimise customer inconvenience when seeking departmental services by introducing measures which reduce recourse to supplementary welfare allowance as an interim payment.  These measures include interviewing customers at local offices when they are making claims and using existing information on household income to speed up decision making.  In recent months recourse to supplementary welfare allowance, on an interim basis, has been reduced significantly in the Eastern Health Board area following the introduction of such measures.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the community welfare service needs the assistance of a modern computer system to provide the standard of service that customers now require. My Department is designing a new computerised system which will integrate all short term payments including supplementary welfare allowance.  These developments in computerisation will enable community welfare officers to make a speedier and more accurate response to customer needs.</P>

      <P>The free electricity and telephone rental allowances are payable to individual pensioners in their own right. Normally they are primarily intended for persons living alone but in certain circumstances, which vary depending on which allowance is in question, pensioners may qualify for an allowance where they have a spouse living with <Col N="61" /> them even though the spouses may not themselves be qualified to receive the allowances in their own right.</P>
      <P>In the event of the death of the qualifying pensioner, title to the allowances ceases.  However where the surviving spouse is aged 66 or older, he or she will usually qualify for one, or possibly, both of these allowances in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to give title to the allowances to non-qualified spouses in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy would have considerable financial implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Prior to the Social Welfare Act, 1992, the Department of Social Welfare operated two maternity schemes.  The scheme for women in employment covered women who qualified for leave from work under the Maternity Protection of Employees Acts, 1981 and 1991 and the general maternity scheme catered for women workers who did not so qualify, along with women claiming unemployment benefit or disability benefit who satisfied the relevant contribution conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992 rationalised the maternity schemes and made maternity benefit available for the first time to women in employments not covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Acts, 1981 and 1991. Arrangements were made at the same time for women on unemployment benefit and disability benefit, who had hitherto availed of the general maternity scheme, to remain on those payments for the period immediately before and after confinement.  New flexible signing arrangements in relation to unemployment payments were also introduced, which eliminated the necessity for <Col N="62" /> pregnant women and women who had recently given birth to attend for weekly signing at local employment offices.</P>
    <P>Finally, the minimum weekly payment for maternity benefit was reduced from £76 to £60, in order to cater for the fact that part-time workers earning £25 or more per week were becoming eligible for maternity benefit for the first time. The maximum weekly payment on the scheme of £154 was retained.  These rates of payments are currently being examined in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme which I introduced in 1990 provided £9.6 million to 257,000 childern in 1992.</P>
      <P>In September 1991, the then Minister for Education announced that a thorough review of the school books scheme had been carried out by the Department of Education and that new proposals would be made to link their scheme with the clothing and footwear scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the issue of this statement by the Minister for Education, difficulties emerged in the Department of Education in effecting the full implementation of the link in the year 1992-93.  As a result of these difficulties the Department of Education notified my Department that it would not be possible to establish the link fully in 1992.  The Department of Education has advised that the proposal is currently the subject of discussions with representatives of school managements and teacher unions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 36 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance, which was introduced in November 1990, provided, for the first time, for a direct payment to be made to the carer on a means-tested basis.  It is directed at persons who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.  In July 1991 the allowance was extended to carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards.  Persons caring for recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland may also qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of December 1992, a total of 4,437 carer's allowances were in payment, of which 3,134 were in respect of pensioners aged 66 or over, 247 were payable to carers looking after recipients of invalidity pension, and the remaining 1,056 were payable in respect of recipients <Col N="64" /> of disabled person's maintenance allowance and EC pensioners.</P>
    <P>The carer is not necessarily related to the person being cared for and my Department does not maintain statistics as to the number of elderly or disabled pensioners being cared for by relatives.</P>
    <P>I am having the carer's allowance reviewed by my Department and in that regard I will be consulting with my colleague, the Minister for Health, in regard to appropriate provision for carers.  I should mention that any change in the means test or its total abolition would have considerable cost implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.  Similarly, any relaxation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide full-time care and attention would involve substantial cost.</P>

      <P>The lone parents scheme in common with all others is kept under continual review in the light of changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>A significant increase in the number of lone parent households has been occurring in recent years in almost all OECD countries, with the households involved being greatly over represented at the bottom of the economic scale.  The trend in Ireland is in line with what is happening elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the scheme has increased from approximately £16 million in 1982 to over £79 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>If these trends continue, the implications for social welfare expenditure will be very significant, particularly in the light of the increased resources required to cater for other categories of welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>One of the issues which has arisen in the context of the ongoing review of the scheme is the desirability of encouraging lone parents back into the labour market. I am examining the general question as to how the social welfare system affects the incentive to work and what measures may need to be taken to increase these incentives.  I will be examining the lone parents allowance in this context.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the earnings limit for entitlement to deserted wife's benefit was intended to ensure that resources are directed at those most in need.  In this regard it was considered reasonable that in future women who earn in excess of £14,000 per annum should not qualify for deserted wife's benefit in addition and that the level of benefit should be reduced by reference to earnings between £10,000 and £14,000.  Any change in these arrangements would be a matter for consideration in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They are of course covered for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
      <P>However self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  However it <Col N="68" /> was found that the net cost would be prohibitive and financing it would be a major burden on those contributing.  In this regard costings made in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would have to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50-year period.</P>
    <P>The present contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions are being examined by the national pensions board and they will be reporting on this and other issues in their final report which is expected shortly.  The matter will then be considered further in this context.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in the 1989 Social Welfare Act to extend the widow's (non-contributory) pension scheme to cover widowers with dependent children. Prior to that there had been no specific schemes for widowers.

      <P>The social insurance schemes for widows and deserted wives do not apply to men.  The cost of extending to widowers and deserted husbands the present social insurance arrangements for widows and deserted wives is estimated to be in the region of up to £50 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Amendments to the qualifying conditions for treatment (dental, optical and aural aids) benefits were made by my predecessor in July 1992.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the condition requiring 13 paid contributions in a recent year did not apply to persons who had attained pension age.  In December 1992, the regulations were revised to extend a similar exemption to persons in receipt of invalidity pension or long term disability benefit.  This was in recognition of the fact that such persons were not in a position, at least in the short term, to resume insurable employment.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the measures yielded savings of the order of £600,000 in 1992 and affected 12,000 claims. However, overall expenditure on treatment benefits increased by £1.2 million in 1992 and therefore any savings were more than offset by improvements elsewhere within the treatment benefit scheme.  In particular, the full extension of dental benefit cover to over 300,000 dependent spouses, which had been delayed due to the opposition of the Irish Dental Association, was finalised and the full 300,000 spouses can avail of the complete range of treatment from their local dentists.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January, 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the time they started insurable employment if later.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable.  These were &mdash; national health insurance, widows and orphans pensions and unemployment insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, in order to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the contribution conditions including the average test.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973 that is twenty years after the unified social insurance came into effect.  From then contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying of the yearly average test.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of contribution conditions for social insurance pensions is among the issues being addressed by the national pensions board in its final report on a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report later this year and the matter will be considered further in this context.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free electricity allowance scheme is to assist pensioners who are living alone with one of their basic living expenses so that they can continue to live in their own homes rather than have them move into institutions. The current cost of the scheme is about £250 million a year.</P>
      <P>As regards the living alone condition, it is not necessary that entitlement should be limited to persons actually living alone.  The living-alone condition, as currently applied, allows certain persons to live with the pensioner without affecting his entitlement, for example, a dependent spouse or child or, in the case of an invalid, a carer.  In the case of pensioners over 80 years of age, the free electricity allowance continues in place where the living alone condition ceases to be satisfied by virtue of somebody moving in with the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any proposals to broaden the current <Col N="73" /> application of the living alone condition would have significant cost implications for the scheme and could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether means testing of applicants for old age non-contributory pension, widow's pension, unemployment assistance, small farmer's assistance and other such allowance is often unfair to the applicant where a small farm or small business is involved in that many items of necessary expenses are not taken into account and in many cases, national and inflation figures are put on value of sales or estimates output; and if he intends to reform this system.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the means testing arrangements, all individuals involved in small farms and small businesses are assessed on a purely factual basis.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means of an individual involved in a small farm or business, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the year from the date of the claim.  That assessment is generally based on income actually received during the preceding the date of the claim.  Allowance is made for the expenses incurred in earning that income.</P>
      <P>In the case of farming in particular, means are assessed by reference to sales of stock and farm produce in the past 12 months, as verified by receipts for sales, plus income from grants and subsidies. Expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income are deducted from income to establish the individual's means.</P>
      <P>The existing method of means assessment has the flexibility to cater for fluctuations in income, in that it is open to claimants who consider that they may be entitled to a higher rate of payment as a result of a significant reduction in their means, to apply, in the normal manner, to have their assessments reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current means test arrangements <Col N="74" /> therefore reflect the factual position by taking income actually received by the individual and the necessary expenses incurring in earning that income.  The operation of this method of assessment will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Owenmore-Arrow Catchment is No. 16 of 28 catchments on the priority list of major catchments &mdash; catchments over 100,000 acres in extent &mdash; being considered for treatment under the Arterial Drainage Acts.</P>
      <P>The field studies in connection with the environmental impact assessment have been completed and studies in relation to the cost benefit analysis were also undertaken. In the context of this analysis it was necessary to examine a variety of options before determining the optimum scheme.</P>
      <P>Early indications were that it would be difficult, and may be impossible, to formulate any scheme which would give an economic return for the investment involved.  In the circumstances, the local drainage committee was consulted by the Office of Public Works in an effort to ensure that all potential benefits were identified.  They subsequently listed a number of additional areas which they considered might benefit from the scheme and these areas have now been examined.</P>
      <P>The final stage of the analysis is in hand and the results will be available shortly. The current position is that the prospect of devising a viable drainage scheme is not good.</P>

      <P>Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1931, exempts from betting duty bets placed on-course on horse races or greyhound coursing or racing, in respect of contests taking place at the meeting.  However, a levy is payable on bets placed on-course with bookmakers in respect of horse and greyhound racing.  These levies are payable to the Racing Board and Bord na gCon, respectively, and both are currently fixed at 5 per cent of the stake.</P>
      <P>In relation to coursing, Bord na gCon has made regulations under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, exempting bets placed at coursing meetings from the levy.  The board is of the opinion that the imposition of the levy at such meetings would be impractical.</P>
      <P>As for imposing a tax on coursing, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be difficult to justify such a tax in isolation; I consider it would also be necessary to impose any such tax on all other on-course bets with bookmakers.  In this connection, I might add that, between 1980 and 1985, a stamp duty of 1.5 per cent was charged on on-course bets with bookmakers; however, this was abolished in 1985, (when the duty on off-course bets was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent of the amount laid), as it was considered to be giving an incentive to evasion which would also have undermined the levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in tabling this parliamentary question, the Deputy had a particular case in mind, details of which she has given to my Department.  Therefore, in answering the question, I will be referring to the particular case and will also be commenting on the wider issue involved.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of free telephone rental allowance is that the applicant must reside alone or only with children under 15 years of age.  A person may also qualify for the allowance if he or she resides with another person who is so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon help in an emergency. Medical evidence is required in support of this latter condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned applied for free telephone rental allowance in March <Col N="85" /> 1992.  The medical evidence which supported his application was referred to the Department's medical adviser who determined that his spouse was physically capable of summoning help in an emergency. In these circumstances, the application was disallowed.</P>
    <P>This year the free telephone allowance scheme is estimated to cost some £16 million.  This represents a 14 per cent increase over the actual cost of the scheme in 1992.  The scale of this expenditure is a considerable commitment of Exchequer funds to meet an important social need.  An extension to the free telephone rental allowance scheme could add significantly to the cost of the scheme.  Any such extension would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>I understand that the spouse of the person concerned will reach pension age of 66 years in July 1993.  If she qualifies for old age pension at that time, she may also qualify for free telephone rental allowance in her own right on the basis that only her husband, who is disabled, will be residing with her.  I have arranged for my Department to investigate her pension situation further to enable a decision to be made on her entitlements by the time she reaches pension age.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in the particular circumstances of the couple concerned, it may be possible to assist with the cost of the telephone rental by way of special support through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The couple have been advised to contact the community welfare officer at their nearest health board office.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to allowances such as free television licence or free electricity is contingent on being a recipient <Col N="86" /> of a payment from this Department.  As the person concerned is not in receipt of a qualifying payment he is not elegible for these allowances.</P>
      <P>More generally the question of allowing widowers the same pension entitlements as widows on the death of a spouse by enabling them to claim benefits on the basis of their late wife's contributions is being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of its proposals for a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report shortly and the matter will then be given further consideration.</P>
      <P>There may be a possibility in this case that the person concerned could be entitled to a means-tested old age non-contributory pension and the relevant form has been issued to him for completion. On receipt of this form consideration will be given to his entitlement to a pension and the ancillary schemes.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the particular needs associated with widowhood and widows have been afforded special recognition in our social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The rates of payment for widows compare favourably with payments to other groups and increases for dependent children in the case of widows are at the highest rates.</P>
      <P>In addition, the contribution conditions to qualify for a widow's contributory pension are not difficult to meet in that a widow can qualify for a pension on the basis of three years insurance on either her own or her husband's insurance record.</P>
      <P>A widow who is not eligible for contributory widow's pension can be entitled to a non-contributory widow's pension or a lone parent's allowance depending on their circumstances and means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows over 66 are also eligible for <Col N="87" /> the free schemes, subject of course, to the normal qualifying criteria.  A living alone allowance for widows over 66 and an over 80 allowance are also payable where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the free schemes or special increases to groups such as widows could have substantial cost implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The figures presented are full year costs expressed in 1993-94 terms and are estimates based on information currently available.  Abolition of the PRSI tax allowance of £286 would raise an additional £57 million in tax revenue. Applying full rate PRSI to public servants would raise an additional £137 million from employees and £305 million from employers in PRSI contributions.  This takes no account of the additional cost of providing social insurance benefits to those concerned.  Abolition of the PRSI ceiling, at current contribution rates, would increase PRSI contribution income by £49 million in respect of employees and £96 million for employers.  Applying employee PRSI to interest income, dividend income and income in kind would yield £70 million approximately in social insurance contribution income.</P>

      <P>The continuing high number of people who are availing of their statutory right of appeal has resulted in some delays in processing appeals.  I am confident that a newly completed computerisation programme at the appeals office will help to expedite the process.</P>
      <P>Examination of appeals files suggests that a proportion of appeals result from a lack of awareness of the statutory conditions. A new unit has recently been established in the Department to review the entire decision process, including the manner in which decisions are conveyed. I am confident that this unit will do much to help reduce the incidence of appeals and this, in turn, will result in speedier processing of cases through the appeals system.</P>

      <P>I am, of course, concerned about attacks of this nature and am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner about this and other issues relating to policing in the State.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, unauthorised taking of vehicles and ramming of Garda cars was a major problem in the early eighties, particularly in the Dublin area.  A number of measures were taken to counteract it which included significant legislative changes and effective Garda action.  These measures have proved to be extremely successful.  In fact the level of unauthorised takings for 1991 &mdash; the latest year for which official figures are available &mdash; decreased by 55 per cent since the problem peaked in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The Garda authorities have informed me that they are continuing to give the matter a high level of priority.  The strategies adopted by the Garda to deal with this problem include identifying and targeting areas at risk, intensive patrolling of such areas and the surveillance of persons suspected of being involved in such activity.  The Garda authorities also inform me that they liaise closely with local authorities on measures which can be taken by them to prevent high-speed driving.  In relation to the specific issue of how gardaí are best protected in relation to the ramming of Garda cars, I am informed that members of the Garda Síochána do not operate in isolation and may call on back-up from their colleagues within and outside the district in which they operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Association for Victim Support has produced a charter of victims rights and sought the assistance and co-operation of the Minister for Justice in having the proposals contained therein implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that progress has been made in regard to many of these proposals.  For example the Garda Síochána maintain close contact with the IAVS.  All gardaí have been instructed to inform victims of crime of the existence of the association and, from May 1992 there is an automatic referral system in areas where IAVS branches exist.  In <Col N="97" /> addition, the gardaí are instructed to give the injured party the name and telephone number of a garda who may be contacted by a crime victim for information or advice concerning their case.  In cases where the injured party has reason to fear harassment or retaliation, the gardaí are instructed to inform the court so that this fact can be taken into account in any bail application.  In the case of serious offences the gardaí are instructed to inform the crime victim if the accused has been granted bail.</P>
    <P>A Garda freephone confidential telephone service, introduced in January 1992, affords the public an opportunity of contacting the Garda in a way which some may perhaps prefer.  This service is widely promoted and I hope is of major assistance and encouragement to victims of crime.</P>
    <P>Accommodation has been made available to the IAVS personnel in the Four Courts complex for their court witness support service.  Similarly, accommodation is available to the association, when required, in the new Courthouse in Dún Laoghaire and the refurbished Courthouse in Letterkenny.  A witness waiting room has been provided in the Childrens Court in Smithfield.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 requires the provision of an audio-visual system in certain cases including sexual offences, to enable witnesses under 17 years to give evidence and to be cross examined outside of the courtroom setting. The closed circuit television system, which is being introduced on a pilot basis in the Four Courts and later in two provincial courts, provides an audio-visual link between the courtroom and a separate witness room thereby allowing court proceedings to be conducted as if a witness were giving evidence in the Courtroom itself.</P>
    <P>The scheme of civil legal aid and advice contains provisions whereby legal advice and aid in certain circumstances may be granted to persons who have been the victims of crime and who fulfil the eligibility and other criteria of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1992 would require courts, when determining the <Col N="98" /> sentence to be imposed for a sexual offence or an offence involving violence or the threat of violence, to take into account and, where necessary, to receive evidence submissions, concerning any effect &mdash; including any long term effect &mdash; of the offence on the victim.  The Bill also would give courts a general power to require offenders to pay compensation for any resulting personal injury or loss. This Bill, which lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil, will be reintroduced in the next week or so with certain amendments which are now under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has amended its scheme to permit the reimbursement of medical expenses incurred as a result of injuries criminally inflicted.</P>
    <P>The annual grant-in-aid provided to the IAVS by my Department has been more than doubled in the period since 1990.  Exchequer funding continues to be provided through my Department to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal for payment of compensation in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence.</P>
    <P>A major conference organised under the auspices of my Department, in October 1992, dealt with the issue of violence against women.  A week-end seminar on the same subject is planned for the Garda College, Templemore in July this year.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that voluntary bodies such as the IAVS which have experience and a good record in the provision of victim services are best placed to promote the case for establishing victims rights.  I can assure the Deputy that the Garda, courts and other services under the aegis of my Department will continue to support, insofar as is possible, the work of the voluntary bodies involved in the provision of victim support services.</P>

    <P>The improvement and repairs to Garda stations is tackled on an on-going basis. The work involved ranges from new facilities such as central heating, new kitchen facilities and shower facilities to improvements to cells, emergency repairs and painting and decoration.  The order in which stations are addressed is based on overall priorities and available finances.</P>
    <P>The amount of time which would be required to compile a list of all stations on which work was done in the three years in question would not be justified. However, the total expenditure on the maintenance of Garda premises during these three years came to approximately £6.2 million and work would have been done to a large number of stations during this period.</P>
    <P>At present new station accommodation is nearing completion at Togher and Glenties.  Work has recently commenced at Cahir and Roscommon, a contract has been placed for Milford and tenders have been received for Midleton and have been invited for Castlebar. Other projects will be progressed in the light of overall piorities and the availability of funds.</P>
    <P>A review of the Garda Building Programme is being carried out at present to assess Garda accommodation needs, having regard to changing Garda requirements and to make recommendations as to how these should be met on the most cost effective basis.

      <P>For the purpose of labour protection legislation generally, eligibility of motorcycle couriers or of any other persons depends on their employment status.  The scope of such legislation generally extends to persons who are engaged under a contract of employment or apprenticeship and who otherwise fulfil the eligibility requirements of the legislation concerned.</P>
      <P>As a rule, persons engaged under a contract for services would fall outside the scope of labour protection legislation. In cases of dispute or doubt, determination as to whether any individual falls within the scope of labour protection legislation would be a matter for the relevant adjudicative authority e.g. Employment Appeals Tribunal, or a appropriate, the Courts &mdash; in the light of the circumstances of the particular case. In this connection, the nature of the contract between the parties would be a central consideration.</P>

However, both my Department and the Appeals Panel are anxious to complete the job as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person named applied under the 1992 ewe premium scheme but not the 1992 sheep headage scheme.  In July 1992 the applicant was paid the first advance of the 1992 ewe premium based on the number of eligible ewes which he had in 1991.  On this basis he received a first advance of £628.50, in respect of the 64 eligible ewes he had in 1991.</P>
      <P>However, when the applicant's 1992 ewe premium scheme application was being processed it was found that only 38 of the 50 ewes on which he claimed premium were eligible for grant.  As the ineligible animals constituted over 10 per cent of the flock the person named does not qualify for any payment under the 1992 scheme.</P>
      <P>The advance payment of £628.50 must therefore be repaid to the Department.</P>

    <P>These figures may be subject to change as there are still some outstanding claims in respect of those years which have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>The introduction of quotas for individual farmers is a feature of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and is applicable from the current year. Ireland has selected 1991 as the reference year for establishing ewe premium quotas.  However, the regulations provide that in certain circumstances quotas may be based on ewe numbers in an earlier reference year; as my Department is therefore not yet in a position to establish quotas for individual producers, it is not possible to provide the remainder of the information requested at present.</P>

      <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, provides that a person who is the owner or tenant of a property can apply for a barring order where the applicant is the spouse of the person against whom the order is being sought.  The legislation does not extend at present to unmarried cohabiting couples.</P>
      <P>The question of amending the legislation in relation to the extent of its cover and to the granting of protection orders in their own right rather than as an interim measure will be examined in due course in the light of any response to the White Paper on Marital Breakdown and in the context of an overall review of family law.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 January 1993 is in the range £176.21-£186.83 per week. This scale is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies throughout the country and <Col N="134" /> the rates are determined by the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in individual cases rather than on a specific rate per hour.  The level of remuneration is reviewed by health boards in the context of the particular requirements and types of tasks undertaken in an individual case.</P>
    <P>In general, the home help service is operated as a &ldquo;good neighbour scheme&rdquo; by volunteers who are classified as part-time home helps.  The voluntary nature of the service, which involves a large element of social commitment, is underlined by the fact that a significant proportion of part-time home helps are engaged by voluntary bodies.  Indeed in the Eastern Health Board area the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recommendation contained in a report on Vulnerable Traveller Children on the Streets which was recently presented to Dublin City Council.  The report was drawn up by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which includes officials of the local authorities and the Eastern Health Board as well as representatives of the Garda and voluntary agencies dealing with travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends that an Outreach worker be appointed to assist with the identification and care of such children. The committee advised that the worker should be based in one of the voluntary agencies working with young travellers and that the post should be funded by the Department of the <Col N="135" /> Environment through one of the local authorities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report was before Dublin City Council at its meeting on 1 February last and that it has been referred to its Youth and Community Affairs Sub-Committee for consideration.</P>

      <P>While exact figures are not available, it is estimated that there may be in the region of up to 300 persons who fall within the category mentioned by the Deputy in 1993.  Additional facilities, which include a mix of day activation and workshop places, will be required in 1993 to cater for their needs.</P>
      <P>In 1992, 417 extra day places were provided for people with mental handicap from the additional funding which was made available for the development of services.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the mental handicap agencies in the South Tipperary Liaison Group are funded primarily through the South-Eastern Health Board.  The provision of additional funding for existing services is a matter, in the first instance, for the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In 1992 an allocation of £850,000 was made available to the south-eastern region to develop new services for people with mental handicap.  These new developments were agreed and implemented in line with the priorities identified by the South-Eastern Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, on which the County Tipperary Association is represented.</P>
      <P>The following additional services in South Tipperary were provided in 1992 with the additional funding allocated: six workshop and five residential places by the Tipperary Community Workshop; eight activation and eight residential places by the County Tipperary Association; eight residential places and one respite place by Camphill Community, Grangemockler and increased services in the Cashel Day Care Centre.</P>
      <P>The south-eastern board also increased their paramedical staff to provide a more comprehensive service to pre-schools, day care centres and residential centres, which benefited clients in South Tipperary.</P>

      <P>Although I have no immediate reason for believing that a serious problem exists, health boards have been asked to sample and analyse apple juice on sale in this country.  Officials of my Department have also met with representatives of Irish producers to ensure that their quality controls are such as to reduce patulin to the lowest levels possible.</P>
      <P>The recent publicity refers to a small study carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) in the spring of 1992 on the occurrence of patulin in apple juice on the UK retail market.</P>
      <P>Arising from media reports, my Department has been in contact with the UK Department of Health.  The authorities there have stated that consumers are not being advised to avoid or reduce their consumption of any particular apple products.</P>
      <P>Patulin is one of a group of chemicals called mycotoxins and is particularly associated with moulds, such as brown rot in apples.  Healthy sound fruit is unlikely to contain patulin at detectable levels.</P>
      <P>The study carried out by MAFF was part of an on-going surveillance.  It is understood that the results of the study will be published next month in a paper entitled &ldquo;Mycotoxins Third Report&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which was brought into operation on 1 <Col N="141" /> October last, has imposed, for the first time ever, a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children up to 18 years.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the commencement of this provision, a significant proportion of the special allocation of £1 million and £2 million set aside in the budgets of 1991 and 1992, respectively, for the development of child care services was used to develop new services and facilities for homeless children around the country.</P>
      <P>Over 40 extra hostel and other residential places for homeless youngsters have been developed in the Dublin area where the problem of youth homelessness is mainly concentrated.  An additional 30 places have been developed outside the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The new developments initiated in the Eastern Health Board area to assist homeless children include a new emergency hostel providing ten places for homeless girls at Sherrard House, Dublin 1; a new therapeutic unit for eight difficult adolescents (boys and girls) operated by the Eastern Health Board near Naas, County Kildare; a new residential unit for ten boys operated by the Los Angeles Society in Dalkey; the hostel for homeless boys at Percy Place run by the Catholic Social Service Conference has been relocated to refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street resulting in an increase from ten to 12 in the number of places; a new after-care service for up to four boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street; the establishment of an &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; social work service to deal exclusively with the young homeless; a carers for young people scheme&rdquo; to provide family care for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings; the recruitment of families to take young adolescents into their homes on an emergency basis; and the development of other short term accommodation such as digs, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is currently involved in negotiations with a number of voluntary groups in relation to the <Col N="142" /> development of further residential facilities for homeless children.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will accept from the various developments which I have outlined that considerable progress is being made in tackling the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two specific cases raised by the Deputy, the teenage boy has been provided with appropriate accommodation following a detailed assessment of his needs.  In the case of the teenage girl, a number of her previous hostel and other residential placements have broken down.  The only form of accommodation she is willing to accept at present is bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, as a result of a recent case conference convened by the health board and attended by representatives of a number of voluntary groups, a plan has been drawn up which involves the assignment of an Outreach worker to provide ongoing support to the girl.  It is hoped that this arrangement will in time lead to the girl accepting mainstream services from the health board.  In the meantime the board is continuing to provide a social work service to the girl and she is attending a day centre.</P>

      <P>The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, has a complement of 136 beds.  Bed closures are confined to periods when there is least demand for beds and when staff are on holidays, such as during the summer months.</P>
      <P>The hospital's casualty department is one of the busiest in the country, treating some 58,000 patients annually.  At times, pressure of admissions through the casualty department can lead to some elective admissions being cancelled.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, £20 million will be provided in 1993 for a major action programme to reduce hospital inpatient waiting lists in a number of specialties, including ophthalmology, ENT surgery and plastic surgery.  I will be announcing my decision in this matter in a number of weeks.  The objective will be to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>

      <P>Two sets of draft Regulations have already been discussed with bodies representing the elderly, nursing home interests and health boards.

    <P>The other sets of Regulations are the draft Subvention Regulations, which provide for the payment of subvention in respect of dependent elderly persons who require nursing care but who cannot afford to pay for it, and the draft Fees Regulations, which set out the fees payable by private nursing homes for registration with health boards.  It is my intention that consultations should begin as soon as possible with bodies representing the elderly and nursing home <Col N="146" /> interests on the Subvention and Fees Regulations.</P>
