      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 36 inclusive, 39, 40 and 41.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 1 to 36 shall be moved together and decided by one question without debate; (2) No. 39 shall be decided without debate; and (3) business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>It is agreed and satisfactory that Nos. 1 to 36 be moved together and decided by one question without debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to that proposal to add the following words:</P>
      <P>Save that Nos. 3,20 and 23 be moved and debated separately and shall be debated for a period of up to three hours today.</P>
      <P>Item No. 3 relates to the income levy, an across the board tax on work which takes no account of mortgage commitments, no account of the position of people with large families and no account of expenses of any kind.  The proposed introduction of this levy has jeopardised industrial relations and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> Item No. 20 provides for an increase in VAT on clothing and footwear, on tourism products and on construction.  If the Government was seeking to find the most job intensive sectors of the economy upon which to place a higher tax they could not have done better than put it on clothing, footwear, tourism and construction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal should be dropped.  Finally, item No. 23 provides for the introduction of the probate tax.  This is the first time here, and the only place in Europe, when death duties have been imposed on the poor.  This is a tax of 1 per cent on orphans and widows and it is double taxation in that it must be paid on top of capital acquisitions tax.  Only three days will be provided on Committee Stage for discussion of these issues.  It is important that before they are referred to committee they should be debated in this House.</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that the motion before us is that items Nos. 1 to 36, inclusive, be moved together and be decided by one question without debate, to which an amendment has now been moved by Deputy John Bruton to add, save that Nos. 3, 20 and 23 be moved and be debated separately and shall be debated for a period of up to three hours today. I am putting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This procedure is as has been adopted every year.  The last time an Opposition party sought something similar was in 1965.  Deputy Bruton, who set out to reform this Dáil, will be aware that all these matters are being sent to special committee.  This is a procedural way of getting these resolutions passed, to get on to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  As Deputy Bruton knows well, he will have all the time in the world to debate these matters.</P>

      <P>On a related matter, the matters encompassed by 1 to 36, apparently the Minister for Finance intends to <Col N="293" /> bring forward an amendment comprising an amnesty for hot money stashed abroad.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the amendment concerned will be published in advance of the Bill going into Committee on Tuesday next? When will we know the shape of what is, effectively, an amnesty for tax dodgers? We would need to know its precise terms before the Committee Stage debate starts.</P>

      <P>My understanding was that amendments Nos. 26 and 31 were withdrawn and all of the others were agreed. In response to the points raised by Deputy Molloy, Deputy McManus and other Deputies in relation to the timescale for the implementation of the provisions of the Bill, I had discussions with my officials and we are optimistic that we will be able to meet the deadline of two to three months suggested by Deputy Molloy.  I assure the House there will be no time lost in terms of bringing into operation all of the provisions of the Bill. I am sure all Deputies would agree it is very much in the national interest, in the interest fo the agricultural industry and individual farmers that we do this.  I hope that meets with Deputy Molloy's request of yesterday.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that every effort will be made to bring in the required <Col N="311" /> regulations within a two to three month period.  The Minister can go no further than that.  The point I was making last night was that this is merely an enabling Bill.  The effectiveness or otherwise of this Bill will depend on the regulations made under it.  The enforcement procedures and activities in relation to those regulations will determine whether the Bill will be effective when it is put into operation.  The Minister will appreciate that without the regulations the Bill is of little use.  The kernel of the intent in this Bill is contained in the power it gives under section 8 to the Minister to make regulations to ensure that we achieve the objective of establishing the strictest systems of controls on the distribution of animal remedies.  This will protect the reputation of our beef industry and enhance it in the marketplace and will give an absolute assurance to consumers regarding the product.  I am satisfied with the assurance given by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister give this assurance and I believe it will be a very productive avenue to follow.  However, I am not sure about the Minister's intentions in relation to the taking of Report Stage of the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will wish to have this as soon as possible.  Can he give us an assurance that on Report Stage he will clarify his intention in relation to these proposed regulations?  I do not know what timeframe the Minister has in mind but it might be useful if either formally or informally we could have some indication of the draft of the regulations the Minister might be considering.  This would be proper on Report Stage and it would help us to advance what we all wish to see implemented in relation to these substances.</P>

      <P>In relation to the spirit that has prevailed in this House during the course of this debate and the constructive comments from the far side of the House I assure Deputies that I will facilitate the House as best I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the introduction of regulations <Col N="312" /> it would be our intention to formulate these regulations as quickly as possible in consultation with the consultative committee which will be set up under the provisions of the Bill.  There will then be the involvement of the Office of the Attorney General which, hopefully will not necessitate any delay.  The Deputy can be assured that we will advance as quickly as possible the implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by Deputy Dukes, the regulations made under the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, are continued in force under this Bill. In addition, regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, relating to animal remedies are deemed to be made under this Bill and when the Bill comes into force the additional powers of enforcement and substantially increased penalties will be applicable to these regulations. The regulations under which controls are administered at present will continue in force until we introduce new regulations.  They will then be incorporated in the new provisions with the new penalties and the new regulations which will eventually be decided upon.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, certain legal issues arising from the wording of subsection (6) (a) and <Col N="313" /> the evidential value of the certification referred to in that provision are the subject of discussion between my Department and the Attorney General's office. I wish to signal to the House at this point that it may be necessary to make an amendment to the wording involved, in which case the matter will be raised on Report Stage.  Deputy Dukes asked what my attitude would be on Report Stage.

      <P>In relation to the methods of analysis is state of the art equipment available in the Department?  Does the capacity exist to carry out an adequate number of analysis and assays which are difficult and expensive to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities available to the Department in relation to the testing of the various substances, carcases and so on are the most up to date.  As the Deputy will know, we use the facilities of the State laboratory and in some instances the facilities of private laboratories.</P>
      <P>We approach this crucial area under a number of headings.  It has been acknowledged in the House that the whole question of distribution is a serious one and we are anxious to close all the loopholes in terms of the importation of these illegal substances.  Obviously, we want to deal also with the distribution of these substances, which is not a straightforward task.  The people who operate in this illicit area leave no stone unturned in their attempts to cover their tracks and to use all of the outlets available to them to bring into this country remedies which are detrimental to the good name of our beef and meat industry and detrimental also in terms of the long term effects on the incomes of individual farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not over state the level of this activity so far as the agricultural industry is concerned.  To the extent that this problem exists &mdash; it is at a minimum level &mdash; it is appropriate that this legislation <Col N="314" /> is being introduced.  I hope this legislation will enable us to eliminate permanently the current trafficking in these substances and alert farmers to the folly of using them.  The vast majority of Irish farmers do not give any kind of illegal substance to their animals.  I wish to protect the interests of the genuine farmers who have contributed to building-up our quality export meat trade.  Obviously I want to tackle the distribution area, and I believe the provisions in the Bill will strengthen my hand in this regard.  Of course, the Garda Síochána and customs officials are also involved in the efforts to eliminate the current trafficking in these illegal substances.  I acknowledge the role played by them in trying to eliminate their importation.  It is well known and recognised that the Garda and customs officials have been very successful in their efforts in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>The Department carries out field tests on animals which are suspected of having been given illegal substances and tests on carcases in various factories.  Evidence to date would suggest that these tests are very effective.  The Department is obliged under legislation to carry out two tests for the purposes of confirming that a substance is present in a product at a level which would warrant a prosecution. This Bill will enable a farmer to appeal a decision and have his own test carried out.  I am endeavouring to be fair while at the same time introducing stringent regulations which will control the importation, distribution and use of illegal substances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a question in regard to offenders who have given angel dust to their animals.  The Minister said that he is using current regulations to deal with this problem until the new regulations are put in place.  In view of the fact that they were successfully challenged in the Tipperary case, is the Minister in a position to enforce the current regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of serious cases are pending before the courts and they will be prosecuted when all of the <Col N="315" /> required evidence is on file.  The Deputy can take it from me that under the present regulations people suspected of the illegal importation, distribution and use of these substances can be brought to court and prosecuted.  There is no great difficulty in this regard.  I am aware of the circumstances surrounding the case to which the Deputy referred.  Obviously this case created some problems.  We should look forward to the consolidation of all the legislation in this area, which, of course, will be considerably strengthened by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the present tests which are carried out, may I ask the Minister if it is true that it can be very difficult, even with the most advanced technology, to detect these substances, particularly new drugs such as clenbuterol and various other agents which can be used to manipulate growth in animals? Can the Minister say if it is possible to use masking agents which can make it even more difficult to detect these compounds, even with the best technology? I agree with the Minister that farmers who give these substances to their animals are foolish.  It is absolutely necessary to get that message across to all farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The people involved in the importation of illegal substances, either for human or animal consumption, are very difficult to catch and are experts in the way they carry out their business. I am sure that that will always be the case.  The tests carried out by the Department are effective.  Technology is improving all of the time and we are trying to keep abreast of developments in this area.  The tests carried out on carcases in factories are as modern and effective as those carried out in any country. The Department is trying to keep abreast of developments in the technology which is used to identify the use of the various substances.  The effectiveness of the test relates very much to the amount of the substance given by the farmer to the animal.  Obviously it can be very difficult to detect the use of these <Col N="316" /> substances when a low level dose has been given to an animal.  The technology used to detect them is being improved all the time.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on section 10.  This relates also to section 17.  Section 10 provides that the Minister may appoint authorised officers to carry out certain functions which may be required for the purposes of the Act.  I do not have any problems with this; I think we are all in favour of using the resources which are there.  I am somewhat concerned that a whole series of different authorisations is apparently being envisaged.  I know that one cannot put tags on the ears of authorised officers which would uniquely identify them forever. It is proposed that the authorised officers should be given a card which is equivalent to a blue card.  It seems that some officers could be given blue cards while others could be given pink cards. Can the Minister explain why he believes it is necessary to have this variety of cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 (1) (a) requires that a document shall indicate that it is an identity document by reference to its being an identity card, warrant card, authorisation card or such other cognate expression as the Minister considers appropriate.  That is wonderful language &mdash; the word &ldquo;cognate&rdquo; is beautiful and expresses everything very clearly.  However, I should like to know why it is necessary to envisage all these different things.  One cannot put tags on the ears of authorised officers but there must be some kind of unique identification which would do away with any doubts in this regard.  I am not worried about the intentions of the Minister or the intentions of the Bill; rather I am worried that because there are different kinds of cards and warrants that some smart alec might challenge in court <Col N="317" /> whether a card was a warrant card, an authorisation card, etc.  The more complex these issues are the more danger there is that technicalities could upset cases in the end.  We want to avoid this as much as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1956 Act all authorised officers enjoyed similar powers.  Because of the very extensive nature of the powers provided for in the Bill it may be more appropriate to divide the tasks and to give limited authorisation in certain circumstances.  Certain duties which are very demanding in manpower, such as animal handling and sampling and entry onto premises for these purposes, can be readily carried out by officers with basic training under proper supervision.  The more extensive police type powers regarding entry into dwellings etc. and carrying out complex investigations may be more appropriately reserved for a smaller group of more highly trained officers.  This provision will enable such a distinction to be made. Provision is also made for the withdrawal of an authorisation in the case of a transfer to other duties, incompetence or abuse of position.  That was not previously provided for.  An authorisation will lapse on expiry, for a fixed period or on retirement of an officer.  The Bill provides a level of management flexibility in the Department so that various duties can be assigned to officers who are qualified to deal with limited aspects of the implementation of this Bill.  That is reasonable.  We should agree on that. It enables us and the staff management section in the Department to allocate manpower or womanpower resources to ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  I hope the House will agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very reasonable and I agree with the Minister's intentions. I would ask the Minister however to have a look at this between now and Report Stage.  There are several different kinds of authorisations and I understand the Minister's reasons for this.  It worries me that a case might come up where somebody <Col N="318" /> purported to have one kind of authorisation where another would have been more appropriate.  I am sure the Minister, like me, would have been half amused to read of a case under the Road Traffic Acts where a person was brought to a Garda station and instead of giving a blood sample he decided to give a urine sample, but as it turned out he was not able to give it and it was found that he was charged under a section which technically did not cover that case.  If the Minister needs to do all these things I will not argue with that, but is there any reason for going to such lengths in the legislation where there is a danger that by doing so we might give someone an avenue to get out of a charge on a technicality rather than on the substance of the charge?  I understand what the Minister is saying about management and use of resources but I would like him to reconsider this between now and Report Stage to see if it is necessary to deal with all this in the Bill or if he could satisfactorily deal with it in a more general provision which still leaves it within the compass of the Minister and his Department to decide now best they apply it in practice in the interest of good management and the best use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it is necessary for me to address the matter again on Report Stage.  I have clearly explained the background and the thinking behind this section.  The composite identity cards apply under some of the Acts already in force.  It enables the Department to structure the delivery of services in a more effective and beneficial way.  It is not a major issue.  This is included in the legislation to ensure that people will not find loopholes in order to take the Department to court to prove that an officer was not an authorised officer to carry out a specific duty on behalf of the Department.  Unfortunately, there are too many instances of aspects of legislation being challenged in our courts and our efforts in this House being totally frustrated in relation to the implementation of various provisions. While I accept the spirit of what the <Col N="319" /> Deputy says, it is not necessary for me to come back to this on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 10 the officer appointed by the Minister must have a warrant of appointment.  The next section outlines the very extensive powers the officer will have and section 17 refers to an identity document which the Minister may or may not issue.  In view of the concern of many people in rural Ireland about security, people will want an assurance that an officer coming to search the house is the person to whom a warrant was issued.  It should be a requirement that the officer should have an identity document containing a recent photograph of the officer.  Will the Minister indicate to the House if it is his intention that the officer must have a warrant to produce when it is asked for and also an identity document with a recent photograph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very relevant and important point.  Every officer from the Department of Agriculture has identification at all times.  In most operations it is not sought and it is not necessary to produce it.  With regard to the provisions of this Bill, each officer will have identification which can be produced in relation to the investigation of offences under this Bill.  Nobody need have any fear or worry that an officer purporting to be an officer of the Department will call with an ulterior motive on a farmer.  This is covered in the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill broadens the area of operations of the Department and considerably strengthens the hand of individual officers who will enforce the provisions of the Bill, even to the extent of carrying out a search without a warrant. We have clearly stated in the provisions of the Bill that that would be an extreme measure which would only be implemented where an officer of the Department felt that any delay in the investigation would result in the concealment <Col N="320" /> of evidence.  That is an extreme provision but it will only be implemented in very special circumstances as a last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not agree that the matter is covered adequately in the Bill I admit that this is not the appropriate section on which to deal with it.  This section deals with the way officers may be authorised which is by way of a warrant of appointment which they will have to carry and produce when asked to do so. In the next section we will be giving them powers which very few officers in any Department have outside of the Garda Síochána.  These include the power to stop vehicles, to inspect, examine, detain and seize.  These are extensive powers and in this case we are not giving them to an officer of the Customs and Excise or a member of the Garda Síochána but to a new category, an officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry who will be appointed by the Minister.  The only evidence of his appointment will be a warrant of appointment.</P>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister of State would give a quick reply and say that the officer concerned will have to carry an identity card which will carry a recent photograph, but he did not refer to this matter.  This would help to alleviate the concerns of those who are afraid that somebody will turn up at their door with a search warrant to search their house because they are suspected of using illegal animal remedies.  All the officer will have is a piece of paper; at least they should have an identity document stamped by the Department which would carry a photograph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), line 44, to delete &ldquo;There may be issued or cause to be issued by the Minister&rdquo; and subtitute &ldquo;The Minister may issue or cause to be issued&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, the purpose of this amendment is to make the meaning a little clearer and I suspect the Minister of State will accept it.  I hope he does because the language would run more smoothly.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Molloy said, this section deals with the question of identity.  A few minutes ago I invited the Minister of State to think again between now and Report Stage.  I know that he is an openminded man and did not mean it when he said that he did not think that he would have to think again between now and Report Stage.  I understand the reason the Minister of State wants to have the facility to give different powers to different officers is because they have different qualifications, skills and experiences.</P>
      <P>It seems that the more one specifies these matters in legislation the more one creates the possibility of loopholes.  The less one has to specify the clearer things are and there is less danger of complications. For example, in tax law the more one writes provisions into legislation to prevent loopholes the more one creates the possibility of loopholes.  The same applies, as the Minister of State is aware, in the case of the intervention system for beef.  The more categories one defines, be it for export refunds, private storage or intervention prices, the more one creates the need to change things slightly so that one can benefit in changing from one category to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas of the law there is a direct conflict between simplicity and fairness.  In this instance what we want to achieve is simplicity.  If the Minister of State has the power to authorise officers to do certain things he might think again between now and Report Stage and decide to make the definition of what individual officers may do a matter for <Col N="324" /> the internal administration of his Department and not a matter that can be haggled over in the courts.  If the Minister of State has officers who can be authorised to do certain things he will have to make sure that whenever a charge is brought under this Bill the officer who carried out the job had the appropriate authorisation, that the people drawing up the charge make the appropriate references to the appropriate officer, the appropriate authorisation and the appropriate powers. The more matters have to be looked after in drawing up the charge the greater the danger that something will go wrong technically.</P>
    <P>If it is sufficient to show that an officer had authorisation from the Minister of State, which could conceivably cover a multitude, and the charge relates to one specific matter, there is less room for argument in the court about whether it should be done that way.  It seems to me, on the face of it at least, not to be necessary to bring the detail of internal cuisine of personnel management of the Department into the legislation where it can be made a cause for argument, when it need not be so.  I am not asking the Minister to promise to change things utterly between now and Report Stage but to have his Department, the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General look at this again and to question whether it is necessary to specify all these details in the Bill and see if there is a simpler, more foolproof way.  &ldquo;Murphy's Law&rdquo;, as I reminded the Minister a few moments ago, should not be lost sight of. It is very simple: it states if something can go wrong it will.  The more details and specification in the Bill the more we are allowing to go wrong.  Many years ago when fuel injection cars first came into the country and I saw one of the first ones to come in I was very impressed.  I thought my father needed a new car and I told him about this great &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; which has a fuel injection engine.  His reply, which I think was very wise, was, &ldquo;that is just something else that can go wrong&rdquo;. I think these details in the Bill might be in the same category.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or perhaps I was not as clear as I should have been when explaining the section.  On the question of the allocation of duties to staff who are qualified to perform them, an officer may be qualified to carry out a range of duties within the scope of his qualification and for that reason the Department can issue a composite identity card which will cover the range of activities he is qualified to undertake on behalf of the Department. I would have thought that provision goes all the way towards meeting the point Deputy Dukes raised.  We are introducing a degree of flexibility in the performance of duties by specified officers in qualified sections in the Department. Let us consider an example, an officer may be dealing with a specific area of operation in the Department, if management now want him to carry out another function within his area of operation, a composite identity card will be issued to cover a broad range of activities.  I think that is the thrust of what Deputy Dukes is saying.  As I said my earlier explanation may not have been entirely clear.  In the spirit of generosity that has prevailed throughout the debate I am prepared to concede to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will return to the point I was making earlier.  Does the Minister accept that there should be an obligation on the Minister to issue an identity card of the type I mentioned earlier which would include a photograph?  Assurances from the Minister in the House are one thing but what goes on the Statute Book is the Bill and not what was said during the debate.  What the Minister agrees to in the course of the debate will have no legal standing unless the necessary <Col N="326" /> changes are made in the Bill.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister will make the necessary changes on Report Stage. Will the Minister make it a requirement that the identity card contains a recent photograph of the authorised officer?  I think it is essential that those two matters be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has made a very good point.  It should be beyond yea or nea that an authorised officer should have identification regardless of any other consideration.  That is very important given the way Irish society has developed.  Will the Minister look again at this matter and state if it is provided for in the Bill at present and, if not, perhaps he would consider including it in the Bill before Report Stage so that it is put beyond doubt that the authorised officer engaged in this type of work will have to carry an identification card that contains a photograph?</P>

      <P>I thought I had made it abundantly clear that each officer of the Department can and will be clearly identified when carrying out operations on our behalf.  I accept that it is causing concern and that Deputies are genuinely expressing their concern and I will look at the matter again between now and Report Stage to see if it is possible to meet the views being expressed. However, my personal view is that this is adequately covered in what I have already stated.</P>

      <P>I was about to thank the Minister but I became worried when he said he did not see the need for it and this makes me wonder whether the Minister intends to do something about it.  I fail to understand the difficulties the Minister has with this suggestion.  Is it not possible for the Minister to indicate that officers to whom very extensive and strong powers are being extended should be obliged to have an identity card because, as Deputy Upton stated, people living in remote areas are terrified by the possibility of callers coming and robbing them because of what is happening in modern <Col N="327" /> Ireland.  People are reluctant to open their doors at times and now another man can arrive at the door with a document saying he has a right to come into the house and turn everything upside down and there is no way of identifying him.  It is essential that they have identity.  There is no point in saying that officers of the Department have full identification.  I do not know what the situation is at present but they do not have these powers and when these powers are being extended to officers it is essential that they carry identification that contains a recent photograph.  I would be surprised if the Minister would not state that he would do this on Report Stage but when he said he did not see the need for it, that made me wonder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (1) (b) (i), line 34, to delete &ldquo;£50,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£100,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the Bill, as drafted, the Minister proposes that where a person commits an offence under section 20 (1) (b), on conviction on indictment, in the case of a first offence under this section he or she shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to both.  I tabled this amendment to increase that figure of £50,000 to £100,000 because I genuinely did not feel that the figure of £50,000 was adequate to cover all cases that might come before the courts and a person convicted on indictment.  While £50,000 may seem large in certain circumstances, as we know there have been many gangsters involved in the illegal distribution of various animal remedies.  It has been stated here in the course of the debate that the IRA have been involved in this, that the proceeds from their illegal activities from selling animal remedies could have been the cause of many people losing their lives, north and south of the Border, because they use their proceeds to purchase arms and ammunition with which to wreak havoc on the community. The level of profits these people have been able to reap can be quite enormous. I wonder what led to the Minister to settle on the figure of £50,000.  I also wonder what my colleagues in the other parties here in Opposition, and the Labour Party in Government &mdash; if they would offer a comment &mdash; believe is the justification for the insertion of the figure of £50,000 or whether it should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on this <Col N="330" /> but I do feel it may not be an adequate deterrent.  I feel that the judge should have discretion to resort to a much higher figure where the circumstances warrant it.  I wonder whether there is some particular reason for maintaining the figure at £50,000 in the case of a first offence and £100,000 in the case of a second offence.  The increases I am proposing are not enormous.  I noticed there was not much comment on the provisions of this section in the course of the Second Stage debate.  That may indicate that other Deputies who contributed were satisfied, or that it was merely one section of this Bill with which they did not have time to deal.</P>
    <P>My inclination would be to go for a higher figure still.  Anyhow, the Minister has inserted the figures of £50,000 and £100,000 and I am suggesting that those figures be replaced by £100,000 and £250,000 respectively.  If there are people who can make enormous sums way in excess of these proposed fines, surely the court should be in a position to adequately penalise them with the fines that might be imposed on them.  I shall await the Minister's response before saying anything more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, in a way, Deputy Molloy's amendment is a further indication of the level of support there is in this House for the purpose of dealing with what is obviously a very serious crime.  I agree that this is a critical section of the Bill.  The proposed amendments seek to double the monetary penalties for serious offences.  The penalties proposed in the Bill, coupled with the option of a ten year term of imprisonment are, in my view, already extremely high.  Furthermore, when legislation on the forfeiture of profits of criminal activities is introduced, offences covered under the provisions of this Bill will be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of this I contend that the penalties outlined in this section are a considerable improvement on the present position and are adequate.  For that reason I would prefer to leave the penalties at £50,000 and £100,000, as originally proposed.  There is no difference <Col N="331" /> between us on the objective in that we are seeking to achieve &mdash; I said this already in giving Deputy Molloy credit for his amendment &mdash; the same objective but it is simply a question of the tactics to be deployed.  I think the level of penalties proposed is adequate.  The real issue is what we can implement effectively.  As I said yesterday, the legislation will not be worth the paper on which it is written unless we can implement all of its provisions and receive the backing and support of everybody involved in the industry.  I indicated that I would have discussions at an early stage with all those involved, from the producers right up to the processors, in terms of seeking their backing, goodwill and support &mdash; which I know we will have anyway &mdash; for implementing the various provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am flexible in relation to this.  It is a question of interpretation of what is possible, what can be achieved in terms of the legislation.  But I would prefer that Deputy Molloy would accept for the moment &mdash; perhaps it is a matter that may be reviewed at a later stage &mdash; the broad range of penalties which are very substantial and which I hope will act as a total deterrent to the abuses that have taken place to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I might compliment the Minister on being flexible but I should like him to exercise somewhat more flexibility than he is doing on this issue and think about it again.  There are a few things to be said about penalties like these inserted in a Bill.  First of all, the penalties proposed in the Bill, and in the amendments tabled by Deputy Molloy, specify penalties not exceeding certain amounts &mdash; £50,000 in the Bill, whereas Deputy Molloy is proposing £100,000.  I would be very much inclined to support Deputy Molloy's amendment.  That kind of penalty gives a signal to two different kinds of people.  First of all, of course, there are the people who might be tempted to break the law and the higher the potential penalty, the more inclined <Col N="332" /> such people might be to think again about breaking the law.</P>
      <P>The second group of people to whom it is intended to give a signal are the judges who will sit on cases.  Of course, we cannot ever stray into the area of tying their Lordships' hands or instructing them what to do, nor would we attempt to do so.  Of course, judges are human beings just like everybody else.  If a judge is sitting in a case and finds there is a conviction and the provision is for a maximum fine not exceeding £50,000, he will operate a certain reply to that, a certain number of basis of judgment and, in many cases, will not apply the maximum fine.  He or she will apply the same kind of reasoning in the event the maximum fine being £100,000.  But the overall consideration is likely to take place at a higher level so that the fine imposed ultimately, even if not the full maximum allowed, might be higher. There is a consideration there which we should examine in terms of both the gravity of the offence and the level at which the fine is likely to be applied.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by what the Minister says about the Government's intention to ensure that future legislation on the confiscation of proceeds from criminal activity would apply to offences covered by the provision of this Bill, in the same way as they would to others.  I have to say two things about that.  The first remark is not directed personally at the Minister at all; it is directed corporately at him.  In the light of the experience we have had with this Government and, indeed, with its predecessor, I would not hold my breath awaiting legislation of this kind that the Government has promised.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that the proposal for legislation on the confiscation of the proceeds of criminal activity is not in the programme between now and the summer recess.  These things tend to get long fingered from time to time.  I am not impugning any dilatoriness to the Minister because he will not be introducing it, but I would not hold my breath waiting for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where in a case of any kind there is a provision for the confiscation of proceeds <Col N="333" /> it seems the courts will have an option. Much will depend on how that legislation is drafted and it may require a second action to confiscate the proceeds.  I do not think there is any difference for the State at the end of the day whether a bigger proportion of the proceeds has already been taken away by the application of a fine, as in the case envisaged here, or the State waiting until a later date to grab the lot.  If that is the road we are to follow I would prefer to see the largest possible amount taken away on their first bite of the cherry, so to speak, by having a large fine.  I will not anticipate what may be in the legislation, but one of the difficulties we will have with the further legislation the Minister talked about is in finding out how much of the proceeds are where and how to get our hands on them.  From that point of view the consideration that the Bill is coming along is not in itself an argument for not having a higher level of fines, it is only a question of timing.  If we add to the question of timing the disincentive effect on the potential criminal of the high level of fines proposed in the Bill and the incitative effect which a higher level of fines would have on the members of the bench hearing the case, there are very good reasons for increasing the levels of fines.</P>
    <P>I will say this in as uncontentious a way as I possibly can.  I did not detect in what the Minister said any great degree of passion or conviction on his part in arguing for the fines as they exist.  There is always a tendency to argue for what one puts in the Bill in the first place and there are varying degrees of passion and conviction in it.  Given the Minister's very calm exterior and delivery when speaking about this, I suspect he is arguing for the £50,000 and the £100,000 on the basis that they are what was put in the Bill and that there is no more compelling reason than that.  That being the case the Minister should give in to his own finer instincts and accept the amendments proposed by Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult to know how high to set these figures and decide whether the fine should be <Col N="334" /> £50,000, £75,000 or £100,000.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said he would be flexible.  I would have no problem in accepting the larger figure.  Something which has always puzzled me about fines which are put into Bills and so on is that they are not in line with inflation and accordingly they get smaller as time goes by.  Presumably some method could be devised whereby fines would be linked to the consumer price index and the adjustment would at least keep pace with inflation.  As every day passes those figures become smaller.  Perhaps that point would be considered in the context of the larger figures.  The other point I would make is that the abuse of these substances impacts on the industry.  The impact should be considered in terms of the damage caused to the industry.  The damage is enormous in terms of its impact on consumers' attitudes and so on.  That may be another reason for increasing the fines contained in the Bill.  It is really very difficult to decide whether the fine should be £50,000, £75,000 £200,000 or £300,000.  It is very much an off the top of the head value judgment.</P>

      <P>I detect from what the Minister has said that he would not have any great difficulty in accepting the amendments.  I thank Deputies Dukes and Upton for their support for the amendments.  I am advised that £50,000 <Col N="335" /> is about the value of a truck or two of good quality cattle.  We are talking here about people who have been selling the angel dust chemical to farmers as a result of which those farmers achieved very substantial weight gains and so-called improvements in the quality of their animals. There was a reduction in the fat content and they produced more lean meat which was more valuable on the marketplace and there were substantial profits to be made.  The intent of the Bill is to kill that once and for all.  A fine of £50,000 as the maximum for an indictable offence is pussyfooting with the project. Personally, I would impose a fine of £250,000 for the first offence and £500,000 for the second offence.  The figures are much too small when one considers the enormous profits that have been and continue to be made by people who succeed in illegally distributing these lethal chemicals.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the figures suggested in the amendment but I would prefer they were much higher. The Minister has not made any arguments to justify not increasing the fines to the figures I have mentioned.  We are not saying that everybody who is fined must be fined £100,000 but rather that it be the limit to which the judge can go. That point has been well explained by Deputy Dukes and it does have an influence on the judge.  In many cases judges have said: &ldquo;In view of the evidence put before me in this case today and the terrible crime you have committed, I would levy a much higher fine on you if I had authority to do so, but I am confined by the legislation that exists&rdquo;.  I do not think the fines should be confined to £50,000.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Molloy concerning a truck load of cattle being worth £50,000 and working on the assumption that treating those animals with angel dust puts about £100 on their value, the maximum fine is the equivalent of having treated 500 animals with this drug.  There are farmers who have that number of cattle on their <Col N="336" /> farms as we speak.  If we are talking about processing animals over a number of years the figures would on a risk benefit analysis, forgetting about all other considerations, make it worthwhile to have a gamble if one had that type of mentality, which of course would be appalling. Unfortunately, there are people out there who have that kind of thinking process.</P>

      <P>I have listened very attentively to the logic of the case put forward by the three Deputies.  I did not think Deputy Dukes would have any desire to increase my blood pressure by provoking my passion.  I can assure Deputy Dukes and the House that I feel very strongly about this issue and I think I demonstrated that on Second Stage.  In regard to the points being made, perhaps we should view this section with section 24 and amendment No. 42, which goes to great extremes in relation to the imposition of additional penalties.  It is always difficult to come to a definitive figure in relation to the fines which should be applied for particular offences.  I am never sure how they are arrived at except that they are always pitched at a scale which is regarded as being sufficiently prohibitive to deal with the offence being addressed.</P>
      <P>One of the factors is the view taken in relation to the implementation of the provisions of the Bill by the Judiciary.  I take Deputy Dukes' point that it would be highly improper for us to comment on the administration of justice, but in the past judges have commented that figures incorporated in legislation were unrealistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, a logical case is being made by Deputies in relation to the seriousness of this offence and the profitability of it for the small number of people involved.  I have considered it from that point of view and have no difficulty in accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy and supported by Deputy Dukes.  If it strengthens our hand and the hand of the Judiciary in the imposition of fines and <Col N="337" /> helps to prevent the commission of these offences, then I accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would have the effect, if the judge so desires, of enabling the powers provided for in the section to apply following the first indictable offence and not just in the event of a second offence.  Under the drinking laws if one exceeds the legal limit for the consumption of alcohol while driving a vehicle and is prosecuted, there is no second chance.  If the prosecution is successful the licence to drive a vehicle is withdrawn.  The disqualification is for a period of 12 months and cannot be appealed until six months has elapsed. This House had no difficulty in accepting that legislation.  As we know, a few social drinks can put people over the limit and they can be unfortunate enough to be asked to blow into a bag and be found to be over the strict limits that we rightly apply, with the result that their whole career is affected.  An innocent social event can turn into an absolute disaster, commercially, financially and personally. Here we have gangsters trying to make a fast buck by selling these chemicals to <Col N="338" /> farmers who have no conscience, who are trying to increase their profits illegally. We are saying that when they are caught they can continue in the trade unless they are caught a second time and the judge has not the right to disqualify them from engaging in farming or in the manufacture or distribution of these materials. We are leaving the door open for the illegal operators to dodge the authorised officers.  There are tens of thousands of farmers in this country and the illegal operators will continue to find clients who have not been prosecuted twice.  They have the assurance that if they are only caught once they can stay in the business.</P>
    <P>The legislation is, in a perverse way, encouraging people to take the risk.  If they knew that being caught would mean they would be disqualified from continuing in business they would be less inclined to take the risk.  We have already accepted that principle in regard to the drink driving laws.  Why can we not accept it in regard to this?  Why do we make it soft for these people and provide that only if they are caught on a second occasion on an indictable offence will they be disqualified?  We are not saying that they must be disqualified.  We want to give the judge who is to try the case the right to disqualify them as part of the penalty he can impose.  He should not be debarred from disqualifying in a serious case.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's logic.  It is a bit of pussyfooting.  It may be that when the Minister and the Department were putting this together they thought there might be difficulty in getting the House to agree to it.  There is no difficulty.  We are looking for this legislation.  My party are looking for this legislation and we fully support it.  It should be clear that the House wants to see the toughest possible legislation brought in.  The Minister has said that is his objective.  I cannot see how he believes we are doing that when a judge can only apply disqualification if a person comes before him for the second time.  He should have the authority to disqualify a person on a first offence, if he deems that the case is serious enough to warrant that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Molloy's amendment, largely for the reasons he has set out.  There are a couple of other things we should consider.  This provision would be available to the courts as the courts think fit and would not be mandatory; there is a degree of flexibility. Second, if one looks at the circumstances in which this disqualification can be operated, one will find that it is feasible to operate it.  Persons could be disqualified from having charge or control, directly or indirectly, of either or both any animal or classes of animal and any animal or class or classes of animal remedy or any ingredient thereof.  So far as having control of animals is concerned, there is already in most cases a very substantial set of practices and administrative regulations in force that would allow us to enforce that.  The fact, for example, that a person convicted on indictment of any offence under this Act could be deprived of a herd number would be a very effective means of ensuring that they could not carry on that kind of business.  If the Minister brings in regulations for the licensing of wholesalers and retailers, the Minister, the courts and the administrator between them could make a disqualification stick under section 1 (a) (2) without any great difficulty because if one does not have a licence to operate, one cannot operate.  It can be made to work.</P>
      <P>The only area where there would be a doubt is in relation to subsection (1) (b) which has to do with the manufacture, importation, preparation, handling, storage, transport, exportation, distribution, sale or supply of food intended for human consumption or for animal consumption and so on.  It is difficult to be sure that this could be made to stick in relation to manufacture where one does not have to have a licence.  There are substantial areas of food production where one does not require a licence.  The same relates to importation, preparation, handling and storage.  The difficulty might not be so great in relation to transportation; there may be a means of making it stick there.  Exportation would be difficult, as would distribution and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Even if the courts were to apply that penalty we could not be sure that the ban or prohibition would work in all circumstances. That appears to be just another argument for making the penalty and the threat of it as stiff as possible. For those reasons I support the amendment. It would have the same effect in relation to large fines.</P>
    <P>This Bill has received great attention in the farming press and the periodicals dealing with the food industry and the fact that the Minister accepted Deputy Molloy's amendment in relation to the fine will get further attention.  If the Minister accepts this amendment I suspect it will also get some attention and will be a clear signal to everybody involved that we are determined to make this Bill work.  By accepting this amendment the Minister would help to change people's perception of this House.</P>

Certain legal issues arise from the wording of subsection (1), particularly in regard to prohibited animal remedies, ingredients for animal remedies and the relationship of the subsection to regulations under section 8.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 32, before section 28, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28. &mdash;Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of such regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the regulations shall not have effect until they have been passed by resolution of both Houses.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and other Deputies have heard me refer to this matter before because it is an old hobby horse of mine. It is looked on with a degree of amused tolerance by those on the Government benches whenever I raise it.  It is entirely appropriate that I should raise it on this Bill because the Minister has had to go to the trouble of drafting this Bill to make sure that a number of measures we always considered were in force which derive their legal inspiration from the European Communities Act, 1972, continue to be <Col N="342" /> valid.  A major part of this Bill is concerned with ensuring that a number of matters that were dealt with under the European Communities Act, 1972 continue to be valid, notwithstanding the doubts raised by recent court cases.  The main reason that doubt arose was the determination of the High Court to ensure that Ministers do not have the power to change legislation and that if they wish to alter the provisions they must get the sanction of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister will recognise that many pages of this Bill deal with the question of putting matters beyond doubt.  I cannot claim I have carried out an exhaustive survey of the measures that are dealt with in that way in this Bill but I can say, without any fear of contradition, that a substantial number of measures have to be confirmed in that way and would not have to be so confirmed if they were brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for explicit approval.</P>
    <P>That is enough to open the case and identify it as something requiring consideration. There are many cases where important matters &mdash; some of which have been overturned by the High Court and on appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; are dealt with under a general power to make regulations on the basis that the regulations in draft form are laid before this House and unless both Houses of the Oireachtas overturn them within 21 sitting days, they are brought into effect.  I accept that that should mean that every Member of each House of the Oireachtas should examine carefully regulations laid before the Houses and if they are concerned about any of them, they should start the procedure of having the proposed regulations annulled, in the knowledge, that even if they are annulled nothing done under the provisions of those regulations up to the time they are annulled may be invalidated.  It is unconceivable that it would ever happen, but if both Houses rejected the regulations the Government would have the period covered by 21 sittings days of the two Houses to do what was proposed under the regulations.  That might be totally objectionable to the Members of <Col N="343" /> both Houses but nothing done up to then under the provisions of those regulations could be set aside by the Oireachtas because that is the form in which power is given in legislation.</P>
    <P>Regulations may also be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in draft form, but cannot take effect until both Houses actively and explicitly approve them.  Had that procedure been followed more often, many of the the matters that are now in doubt as a result of the High Court decision to which I referred earlier would not be in doubt because they could not have been interpreted as cases where Ministers took wide powers to change legislation without consulting the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is why I tabled this amendment.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment on the Roads Bill, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and many others which have come before this House.  In all cases the matters proposed to be dealt with in the regulations were important matters of policy.  I would be willing to bet that when I have made my case the Minister will tell me that it would be tedious and impracticable to require all the regulations to implement this Bill to be brought before this House.</P>

      <P>The Bill includes birds, fish, reptiles, molluscs, but I will not go into all that.  A Minister could at a later date propose a regulation to include some other variety of aphis under the provisions of this Bill though I know that is somewhat fanciful.  The Minister may say that we should not bother having a formal discussion about something as simple as that.  I know he will make that point, and it is a disingenuous one.  If the Minister believes there are matters about which the House should be burdened, he must be satisfied in regard to two points.  First, that the substance of the matter is not something that will change legislation already in place.  Second, that the matter is something that properly comes within the scope and confidence of our administrative system and is not one that requires a policy decision by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He will also tell me that if this amendment is agreed the time of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be taken up with many fiddly things. That may be true but it is not an answer. Many of the difficulties now facing the Government as a result of the High Court's interpretation of the European Communities Act, 1972 would not have arisen if the procedure I am proposing had been followed more often.  I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of our Departments of State, Ministers, parliamentary draftsmen and the Office of the Attorney General to separate the different regulations and subsidiary measures that must be taken between those that can properly be taken as a matter of administrative practice and others which require decisions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost every regulation that falls to be made under this Bill will be made according to the procedure which I call <Col N="345" /> the passive procedure.  I am sure the Minister would say the regulations are technically before the House.  I defy the Minister who has been here longer than I, to say that since he came to this House he has personally inspected every regulation laid in draft before the House that could become effective immediately and could be overturned by the Houses up to 21 sitting days after they were laid before the Dáil and that everything that had been done with respect to them up until then would continue to have effect.  If the Minister can show me even ten cases where he has personally inspected proposals of that kind I will be astonished. If he can show me even one case where he or any of his party colleagues or colleagues in other parties picked up regulations with which they disagreed and brought them to the attention of their Front Bench spokesperson or parliamentary party and asked that the regulation to be raised in the House to have it overturned, I would be astonished.  I do not think that has ever happened in the 12 years I have been here.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that it will cut no ice with me if he or those who advise him were to say that I was as frequent a user as he of this objectionable provision when I was a member of the Government. That is true, but that was on a basis of collective decisions.  I have always believed that this passive procedure for making regulations is wrong.  It requires some imagination to draw a clear dividing line between matters of execution and administration which should be dealt with outside this House and be properly provided for in legislation and those that require political decision.  If they require political decision it should require an overt expressed political decision of these Houses and not the type of <i>sub rosa</i> procedure of the regulations being laid before the Houses where nobody examines them and they pass into law.  This causes problems later when the courts tell us that Ministers do not have the right to do that.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to accept this amendment.  I will be pleasantly surprised if he does so.  He was in such an <Col N="346" /> expansive mood yesterday and is today that he might silence me by saying he will accept the amendment, in which case I will be delighted.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment I invite him between now and Report Stage to consider the various regulations that should be made here and reflect on the debate we had which has added substantially to the worth of this Bill.  He should consider that debates on regulations that fall to be made under this Bill in the future might improve the text of those regulations in the same manner as it has improved the text of the Bill before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the debate on Second Stage, and particularly on Committee Stage, the Minister has come here with an open mind and was prepared to listen to the arguments of Opposition Deputies and where he considered a reasonable case had been made he conceded the point.  I applaud him for his approach which has added greatly to the stature of this House and improved the Bill he introduced.  In this era all parties are supportive of the need to reform procedures of this House.  This, above all other matters, demands change.  There is an important principle at stake.  It is necessary to involve the House in a meaningful way in important decisions of which it is deemed to approve.  The existing procedures are less than satisfactory and not transparent.</P>
      <P>In practice many hundreds of regulations are being made from one year to another without the scrutiny of any Member because of the procedures in place, the manner in which business is done and the impossibility of securing time to bring forward a separate motion to seek to have a regulation debated.  The initiative must be taken by an Opposition Deputy.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the validity of the arguments made by Deputy Dukes in support of his amendment which I fully support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is agreement by all parties on the need to reform procedures and practices here.  New committees have been set up and matters will be referred to them.  We sit on different sides of the House from <Col N="347" /> time to time.  I am sure the Minister and his present colleagues in Government do not expect to be in Government forever and for that reason we want to ensure the procedures put into place are fair.  The changes introduced by this Government in the establishment of committees can be greatly strengthened and be more meaningful if we insist that the practice of requiring the Opposition or some other Member, to bring forward a motion to object to a particular regulation be stopped.  Otherwise, that regulation says in effect and all that was done under it since it was introduced by the Minister is deemed to have effect.</P>
    <P>In future, if this amendment is adopted and applied in all other legislation, with the new procedures available to us through the committees, it would not be necessary for all of them to be debated in this House.  That would not be possible or practical, but it would mean that all Members of the House would first be supplied with a copy of the regulation which the Minister proposed to introduce. If it required the approval of the House it could be done on Committee Stage.  Many of them would be passed without debate and I would see a procedure established whereby the Whips would be given copies of intended regulations which would then be distributed to the various spokespersons in each party to examine briefly.  In many cases they would indicate their agreement and it could be a matter for, say, the Order of Business, to have the House approve of particular legislation.  I have seen many regulations passed in that fashion.  Where Members of parties were not approving the Minister's intent in the regulations they would then be referred to one of the new committees of the House.  That would be seen by the members of those committees as a new and valuable role for them.  It would give meaning to those committees many members of which have serious questions as to their effectiveness as they are established at present.  Unless other changes such as are suggested in this amendment are adopted the idea of the committees will eventually <Col N="348" /> turn out to be a charade.  I do not believe that is what the Government wants. There seems to be a mood to introduce genuine reforms.  I would suggest to the Minister that by adopting an amendment of this kind, and if his colleagues in Government adopted such an approach in future legislation we could have a more meaningful role for Parliament here.</P>
    <P>The House is being ignored in many of the most important decisions made.  The House is deemed to have rubberstamped them, but they are never actually debated until the measure is in operation.  It is wrong that regulations can come into effect and can have a serious effect on people without the Dáil ever approving them.  It is only in the odd case, as has been outlined here, where one has to go to the enormous difficulty of having a special debate that the House is involved in giving its approval.  If the House rejects it, everything done up to that point is deemed to have been done legally.  I believe that is wrong.  I know the Minister's attitude will be that this would be impractical, that it would slow down the whole system, and would delay the implementation of the regulations.  That is not so; these are only excuses.  If the Minister believes that would happen he should introduce procedures to rectify that.</P>
    <P>In the case of this Bill it is essential that this amendment be accepted because it is only an enabling Bill.  It has no effect as it stands.  The regulations made under this Bill, particularly under section 8, will determine whether the Bill will deal effectively with the illegal practices in animal remedies that are taking place here.  It is the regulations that are important. We are now debating this Bill and giving the Minister power to implement these measures; yet it is the regulations that will determine whether the measures will be effective.  The House will have no role in this unless it goes through the difficult procedure of trying to initiate a special debate.  There is no chance of a special debate taking place on these regulations.  We know from practice that will not happen and the number of times <Col N="349" /> it has occurred during my years here is minimal, almost never.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accede to this amendment and accept the logic of the arguments being made.  I would ask him during this discussion to put himself outside of his Ministerial responsibilities. As an experienced Member of this House he must be aware that Deputy Dukes' arguments are valid, logical and will prove to be major improvement, that they will add greatly to the Government's plan for Dáil reform and will strengthen the new committee system.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies again for their contributions.  I become a little concerned when Deputy Dukes takes on the role of fortune teller predicting what I might or might not say in relation to specific aspects of the Bill. I listened attentively to the case he has made, but he has been making this case in this House over a long period of time. It relates in a more general way to the implementation of broad legislation and is not specifically relevant to the Bill, for reasons I will now mention.  The acceptance of this amendment involves deletion of the present section 28, which Deputy Dukes has identified.  This section already provides for the laying of regulations before the House and provides the Houses with an opportunity of annulling the regulations by the vote of either Houses.  The present section 28 is usual for Acts of this type and provides the Houses with adequate control over the regulations made.  Therefore, I do not feel this amendment will make the operation of the legislation any more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on another dimension to the amendment which in my view would not be in the interest of having what I would regard as a constructive debate here in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  The point was made several times during the debate, both yesterday and this morning, about how long it would take to implement the provisions of the Bill.  We all accept there is a great deal of urgency in relation to it.  Without taking from the merit of his arguments <Col N="350" /> Deputy Dukes' amendment in effect would take from my determination to conclude the legislation which is before us at present for the purpose of formulating the necessary regulations.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Molloy's question on the regulations, we have been clear in relation to the provisions of the Bill.  The amendments which I have accepted today highlight the urgency and seriousness which we attach to this Bill. The Deputy can be assured that the regulations, which will be the obvious followup what is being decided here today, will be very much in line with the spirit of the debate and the decisions which have been taken.  From the time I introduced this Bill I have responded as best I could to both the amendments and the views expressed by Deputies.  These regulations will be positive in addressing the problems we are discussing here today.  I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Dukes, but I am sure the Deputy had anticipated my reply.</P>

I cannot see why the Minister should be worried at my becoming a fortune teller because on the basis of what he has just said my score is 100 per cent.  The Minister has, very succinctly, replied using the very arguments which I expected him to make.  His passion concerning these amendments is no greater than that which he had for previous amendments.</P>

      <P>This provision which has been inserted here is a convenient one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> It has always been there and used for the making of regulations and it suits the Administration.  If one takes the time to inspect legislation one will find that this provision is used in a great many cases to mend the hand of the Minister and of the legislation.  It is a nice easy way out. A general power is provided to make regulations and, when matters become a little out of kilter and have not been properly thought out in advance, these regulations are brought in.  We know that the Dáil will not bother trying to upturn these regulations after 21 days.  We will not even have to explain to any great extent why we have to bring in more regulations or amend the regulations already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is administrative laziness. Members of this House, the Minister included, have to get themselves elected.  We have to persuade people that we are worth electing and are worth keeping here on the basis that we will legislate.  Yet the Minister proposes to hand over an important part of the process of legislation to an administrative system, the Civil Service, for which I have the highest regard, but which is not paid to legislate.  We should not hand the Civil Service the power to legislate.  We do this every time we pass one of these nonsensical provisions on regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want this House to take its responsibilities seriously.  I want the Civil Service to have a clear definition of what it does, where its responsibilities lie, the extent of its responsibilities and how far Ministers are entitled to go as the heads of Civil Service Departments, rather than as politicians.  Unless this House is very careful, passive regulations like these will give the Minister unnecessarily wide powers to hand over this job to civil servants. This will deprive Deputies of their proper function, which is to make political choices about policy matters.  The borderline between these two issues has never been properly addressed.  The provision <Col N="352" /> in this Bill dealing with regulations does not require anybody to think.  More importantly, it does not require Deputies to do the job for which they were elected.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the points made by the Minister.  He made the usual ceremonial remarks made by Ministers. They know this is a hobby horse of mine and that I can always be relied on to make the point.  Ministers normally say, &ldquo;I know you are very well motivated but this Bill is not the appropriate place to do this&rdquo;.  During my 12 years in this House I have never found an appropriate Bill in which to do this except on the few occasions when I was the Minister in charge of a Bill.  Then I was able to tell my Department and the parliamentary draftsman that I did not want this general passive provision in the Bill and that if we were to make orders under this provision we would do so in an active way. This required a bit more work.  In the case of this Bill, it would not have required much more work, but it would have required a great deal more work in the case of the Roads Act and the Environmental Protection Agency Act The fact that this requires more work is not a reason for not doing it.  It is an argument in favour of being more careful in the way we draft our legislation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has come into the House and said &ldquo;not I, Lord&rdquo;.  Somebody will have to make a decision on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody will have to decide that the Civil Service will do its job and the Dáil will do its job so that there is a clear borderline between the two jobs.  This nonsensical convention has got us into no end of trouble since the decision by the courts on the European Communities Act, 1972.  We have to take our responsibilities seriously.  I find it appalling that the Minister can be given and has taken advice of the kind he has indicated to the House today, only a few weeks after the High Court told us that much of the legislation introduced since 1972-73 is suspect.  Much of this legislation <Col N="353" /> is suspect because we did not go to the trouble of defining properly where politics ends and administration begins or <i>vice versa.</i>  The Minister has come into the House and said &ldquo;Not I, Lord; it is not appropriate in the case of this Bill.  It might be appropriate in another Bill. Deputy Dukes can pursue his amiable eccentricity in the debate on some other Bill, but he should leave me alone&rdquo;.  That is not an answer.  This practice will not be changed &mdash; and I hope it will be changed &mdash; by passing an Act in this House, rather it will be changed by a Government which makes it a rule in the drafting of legislation that we pay proper attention to what is administration and what is politics, the borderline between them and that we leave politics where it is.  In other words, we render unto the Dáil the things that are the Dáil's and we render unto the Civil Service the things which properly belong to that machine. This practice will not be changed until such time as every Minister is given the instruction by the Government that this is the way we should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I was asking too much of the Minister to be a pioneer in this regard. However, I do not think he would object too much to being remembered as an innovator.  I suppose it is not the kind of image a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, with all the weight of that magnificent tradition behind him, would like to get. I am disappointed that the Minister has given this benighted reaction to this matter.  I will keep raising it.  An old song &mdash; I know this is far too uncultured for the Minister &mdash; referred to a ram which kept butting a dam until it eventually broke.  If there is any concern for democracy or proper parliamentary practice in the Government, I hope the Minister of State and the Minister will, if they have any residual memory of what I have said this afternoon, bring these thoughts to bear on what is done from here on in.  As I said, I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  I will keep raising this matter. I am tempted to divide the House on this amendment but I will not do so.  I should <Col N="354" /> like the question to be put on my amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Dukes' diligence will be rewarded in due course. He chose the wrong Bill and the wrong day to raise this matter.  We have had a very constructive debate and I have been very flexible in regard to the various provisions in the Bill.  I have outlined in great detail the effects of the provisions in section 8.  I enjoyed Deputy Dukes' contribution.  I was pleased to see that he gained much pleasure from what he had to say.  I have to say that neither my officials nor I are afraid of work.  It is not because we want to shirk our responsibilities or not face up to the effect of the provisions in the Bill that we have not responded to Deputy Dukes in the manner he has requested.</P>
      <P>I am extremely anxious to have the provisions of the Bill implemented as quickly as possible.  I thank the Deputies opposite for their constructive and objective contributions during the past two days.  I wish to reassure them that no time will be lost in implementing the provisions of the Bill.</P>

That argument may in some cases be one of the best reasons for getting rid of something.  In case the Minister is under any misapprehension about this, and he noted with his usual perspicacity that I <Col N="355" /> was taking pleasure in making the case I was making, I would just remind him that it is entirely possible to take enormous pleasure out of doing things that are perfectly proper.  My tongue was anywhere but in my cheek.  I am warning the Government that I will keep coming back to this every time I see this kind of provision coming up in a Bill.  I will attack it because it is basically undemocratic.  It is bad for our parliamentary system and for our administration.</P>

      <P>I would hate to think that the tone of this discussion would suddenly take a dip because it has been very progressive and constructive and the Minister has kept on open mind on other matters.  I suggest that the Minister should carefully look at this type of provision and try to convince his colleagues in Government that there is a need to adopt a new approach in regard to regulations. They are a vital aspect of the work of the Dáil, an aspect in which the Dáil has a very minimal role.  The Dáil authorises the making of regulations and in many cases that is the last say the Dáil effectively has in the operation of these regulations.  This will have to change and I suggested that we could change it now because of the introduction of the new committee system.  My suggestion does not seem to have fallen on fertile ground. I hope the points Deputy Dukes and I have been making will be taken into account.  Deputy Dukes has not pressed <Col N="356" /> his amendment to a vote but if he had he would have had the support of the Progressive Democrats.  We will be seeking this kind of reform in all future legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as applying to those making independent television programmes this Bill should apply to those who wish to make independent radio programmes. The Minister agreed about the problems in relation to the production of drama for local radio.  We can see the difficulties in terms of financing in local radio stations. It has not been possible to do a great deal <Col N="358" /> of work in this area because of problems in relation to cost.  If this Bill applied to radio we would see this being remedied and there would be the possibility of independents making an approach in the same way as the Minister has suggested for independent television producers. This section could be extended to include those who wish to make radio programmes. The financial demands would not be enormous due to the different costs involved.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, tuigim go maith go bhfuil an Teachta dáiríre maidir leis an tábhacht a bhaineann le cúrsaí drámaíochta agus, chuige sin, le cúrsaí craolacháin chomh maith.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's sincerity in relation to the improvement of radio.  I share the concern expressed with regard to the importance of drama.  However, the mechanism proposed in the amendments we are discussing together is unsatisfactory. I regard what I am doing in this Bill as but one step in relation to putting broadcasting on a proper footing.  I repeat in this regard the commitment given in the Programme for Government to put local radio on a sound basis.</P>
      <P>The question one has to ask in responding to amendments such as these is whether this would be the best way to proceed.  The purpose of the amendments is to divert a proportion of the revenue raised by way of licence fee to the independent radio sector.  As I indicated in my speech on Second Stage, I regard local radio &mdash; I mentioned local community radio as well as local commercial radio which have evolved into a mixed entity &mdash; as a critical mix in the broadcasting services available here.  I propose to deal with their needs and make proposals when I bring forward comprehensive broadcasting legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the view was expressed that I was operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but one could express a similar view in regard to what is being suggested to me now, that the Deputy is guilty of ad hocery.  For example administratively, <Col N="359" /> if I were to accept these amendments, I would be required to pay grant-in-aid from the Exchequer to RTE with which RTE would set up a fund which would be administered by it for the independent radio sector on foot of certification from the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  With respect, this would not just be ad hocery it would be an administrative nightmare.</P>
    <P>I have had meetings with AIRS, and with other representatives, both individually and collectively, of the independent radio sector to deal with their proposals and their responses to my proposals in the context of a comprehensive approach.  I will be doing this in reviewing broadcasting legislation.  It would be wrong to seek to meet their needs in that way.  It would be best to let this Bill achieve its limited purpose and ameliorate the situation of local radio.  I will consider other structures in this regard in a more substantial way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment is valid and I support it. First, the Deputy makes the case in favour of the development of local radio and highlights the major deficiency of this Bill to which I referred at some length on Second Stage.  I said then that the broadcasting sector is a seamless garment and one cannot introduce a single narrow measure, such as the one proposed by the Minister, without considering the effect it would have &mdash; perhaps unintended but nonetheless adverse &mdash; in other areas of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>While I can support what the Minister is trying to achieve with this measure, which is essentially good, I am fearful of the effect it will have in other areas of broadcasting.  It is a great pity that the Minister has not introduced his comprehensive broadcasting Bill to enable us consider his proposals in the overall context of broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a previous Minister put a cap on RTE's advertising revenue he talked about the need to level the playing pitch but, unfortunately, this phrase has been discredited and will be forever associated <Col N="360" /> with that Minister.  Nonetheless, the principle is valid.  It is my fear that in making corrections to what has become known as the Rambo Bill this might prove to be as painful and as damaging, in some areas of broadcasting, as the original Bill.  That is the risk we run in introducing narrow legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald are valid.  However, she has been accused of ad hocery but I can see no difference between ad hocery on the part of the Minister and ad hocery on the part of Deputy Fitzgerald.  The Minister's response to a range of problems which will have to be confronted in the context of broadcasting legislation is not comprehensive or well thought out.</P>
    <P>As has been said, local radio has enormous potential for growth and development. It has shown that it can act as an energising force in rural communities and as a counter-magnet to the mid-Atlantic waffle we sometimes hear on other stations.  I would like to see this acknowledged in a practical way in the context of new legislation.  I have no difficulty in supporting the amendment put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised at the Minister's comments about the procedure I suggested because amendment No. 23 mirrors section 4 under which direct finance will be provided to the independent television programme sector and thus will directly be of assistance to the independent radio sector in maintaining a quality service.  It would give effect to the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government in tandem with the repeal of the cap on RTE's advertising revenue. Indeed, this is the only part of the programme dealing with this area that the Minister is not attending to.  If the amendment is accepted the threat of up to 100 job losses in the local radio industry, which has considerable potential for job creation would be removed.  I agree with my colleague that it would lead also to equity in the national broadcasting sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in this situation because the <Col N="361" /> Minister chose to approach broadcasting in this way as opposed to adopting an overall approach and looking at many sectors, including the newspaper industry. Although the Minister said earlier that he has no direct responsibility for the newspaper industry I am sure he would agree that the Government need to consider several issues and respond to the crisis facing that industry at this time.</P>
    <P>The amendment would also give more substance to the role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and enable it to expand and develop as an advisory and development body as well as a regulatory body if it had access to the extra funding suggested in the amendment. I will raise questions later with the Minister about the mechanisims he has suggested, in regard to independent film production, as to whether these are the appropriate ones in, for example, commissioning productions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be as positive as I can but there is a difference. Let me take the point made about the relationship between the independents which will prepare products in the television sector and RTE which will commission these products.  We are talking here about the preparation of television programmes to be broadcast on a televisual medium.  Standing above RTE is the RTE Authority and their relationship is specified in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to local radio, if one wanted to assist local radio, one should look at the Independent Radio and Television Commission and ways in which one can address the real needs of local radio.  I do not know how often I have to say it, and I must repeat it, that, because I introduce this legislation, the assumption is I am doing nothing else.  AIRS met me for over two and a half hours in a formal meeting which was preceded by several meetings between my officials and their executive about practical proposals in relation to local radio.  The meeting that took place with me for over a couple of hours was succeeded by other meetings. They know we are following an agenda on how they may be assisted in relation <Col N="362" /> to their needs.  I know that a number of Deputies met them and gave them assurances that they recognised that their needs were urgent.  I accept that they have great difficulties but, at the same time, people want me to wait for one comprehensive Bill and do nothing about anything else.</P>
    <P>At the time I examined the circumstances arising in relation to the cap &mdash; and I appreciate Deputy Quill's views this afternoon because, unlike her, I voted against the cap &mdash; I appreciate that if one was caught badly once by having voted for an <i>ad hoc</i> measure in 1990, one would like not to make the same mistake again and would approach one's new position with a fervour that would be beyond the ordinary.</P>

      <P>Let me face the point. People have raised with me section 3 of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1990.  I wonder do people really know what was its effect.  Let me finish my point about the people I met.  I have met the chairman and executive of the Independent Radio and Television Commission; I have met the members of AIRS and I have met individual radio station operators.  I have also met the provincial and national newspapers, their managing editors, and I have listened to all the views.  I do know that what happens <Col N="363" /> in relation to one sector is linked to the other.</P>
      <P>What is important to state here is that I was dealing with job losses in advertising agencies, job losses in RTE, real and threatened, also job losses in relation to other areas that were dependent on advertising, such as the film sector involved in the preparation of advertising. What the provisions of this Bill are doing, if you like, is simply lifting the consequences of section 3 of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1990 from the televisual sector.</P>
      <P>I must reiterate that the whole media mix I will have to address, when preparing the fundamental legislation, will have to address conflicting demands.  For example, people speak on the one hand about the newspapers and, on the other, about the demands of local radio.  There are local radio operators who have said to me that they want assistance.  There are representatives of the provincial newspapers who have said they do not want certain kinds of assistance going to local radio operators.  Then there is the view of the national newspapers in relation to what should not be given to local radio.  Again, there are views in relation to both, if you like, in relation to forms of advertising that have their source outside of the State altogether.  I intend to deal with all of those in the legislation I am now preparing.  I hope I do not appear to be ungenerous.  I respond at times in the spirit in which the odd shaft is fired at me; I have to fire spears back before they grow in my garden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made a point about the Independent Radio and Television Commission in respect of which I will be very forthcoming.  We should examine the role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission &mdash; which derived from the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 &mdash; not as an attachment to this Bill, but in terms of the fundamental broadcasting review.  When Deputy Fitzgerald holds that the amendments she has tabled would enable the Independent Radio and Television Commission <Col N="364" /> to take a role in development beyond monitoring, supervision and so on, quite frankly I would have to say I always thought the provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 limiting.  Even if it was a limited Bill it contained scope for development that may not have been used, or could have been used much better.</P>
    <P>In regard to the legislation I am planning, when I say I am looking at structures I mean I am going to look at the Independent Radio and Television Commission and at the operation of the provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  This is a better way of approaching the needs of radio, of continuing the discussions I have had, than by the mechanism of attaching these particular demands to this legislation which, as I said, is quite limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not really make too much of the point that he uses to criticise people who want everything done in this Bill.  We do not want everything done in this Bill.  The fact is that we are now dealing with the cap on RTE advertising.  There is a problem in relation to local radio.  Indeed, Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment was tabled to allow us to deal with the local radio issue at the same time as we deal with the cap on RTE.  I do not think that is at all unreasonable or illogical.  Local radio stations are in some difficulty in ensuring that they remain, as they want to remain, stations that have a subtantial element of public service broadcasting. They have difficulties with news gathering, difficulties with other aspects of public service broadcasting and are seeking some remedy for those difficulties &mdash; I would have to say, a modest enough remedy &mdash; but they are seeking a remedy. We should assist them in seeking that remedy.  We are dealing with broadcasting, we are not dealing with all of the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE has available to it the amount of revenue it gets from licence fees and advertising.  Local radio stations have available to them only the amount of revenue they get from advertising, which <Col N="365" /> has proved to be less than sufficient to meet their perceived needs.  For many reasons, some of which have nothing to do with broadcasting, there is an insufficiency of revenue there to run local radio stations and ensure the continuance of the kind of public service broadcasting in which they are involved.  Personally, I should like to see a lot more of them giving more of their time to public service broadcasting.  But I was very impressed recently &mdash; the Minister had meetings with them too &mdash; by the determination of local radio operators not to become, as they said themselves, provincial jukeboxes. That is not what they want to be. The matter is urgent and cannot wait until the Minister has time to get around to another, perhaps more elegant, Bill whose provisions will address that issue. It is relevant to the issue of what we do following the removal of the cap on RTE.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister really has thought much about what he said.  The reason the proposal from the local radio stations &mdash; to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred &mdash; involves the Independent Radio and Television Commission in the loop is very simple; it is not to render life more complicated for the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the Minister or anybody else; it is so that there will be a body involved there that will be seen to be impartial and also knows about broadcasting. It is not there just for the fun of it; it is there because the Independent Radio and Television Commission has a position and a status in our broadcasting complex to which the local radio stations attach considerable importance, which gives it a standing in the regulation of the kind of things it is proposed to hand to it.</P>
    <P>It may be awkward to do this.  The Minister, in his first response to Deputy Fitzgerald, criticised the procedure underlying these amendments as being a cumbersome one.  Perhaps it is, but the reason it takes that form is in order to have, within the operation of the system being proposed, an independent commission that can have its own status, clear independence, that will be listened to and <Col N="366" /> whose decision will be accepted.  If the Minister considers that too cumbersome, then it appears to me it is incumbent on the Minister to propose a better system, not to await some other Bill, rather to propose it now because this is the context within which the opportunity arises to deal with a specific problem obtaining in the case of local radio.  I do not have to go over the remainder of the fears of the local radio station.  The Minister knows them perfectly well.</P>
    <P>By taking the cap off RTE advertising there is the prospect that the advertising minutage will drift upwards.  This will inevitably allow RTE to look again at the rate it charges for advertising and may create a situation where the local radios will be unable to compete.  Again, this is one of the reasons for the amendment. They are parts of a piece.  The proposal being made is one that becomes necessary to make when the Minister is taking the type of action he is on RTE.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that we should not lump irrelevancies into the Bill because it is relevant.  This is the opportunity to do so because the mechanisms open up as a result of the principal provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Let me repeat again that broadcasting is a seamless garment.  I am very concerned about what is likely to happen to independent radio between the enactment of this Bill and the introduction of the promised legislation by the Minister.  I am very fearful about what may very well happen to local radio in that period.  I do not know how long that period will be &mdash; it could be as long as a piece of string.  We have no idea when the further legislation the Minister has promised will be introduced in the House.  But this lacuna may very well be the period where legitimate gains made by local radio are lost, audiences are lost, the potential for production lost and as a result jobs are lost.  That may very well be the valley period.  That is why the Minister has to address the problem of local radio in the context of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This very narrow legislation may have <Col N="367" /> unintended effects.  We do not know the unintentional effects it may have on RTE, local radio or newspapers.  The Minister correctly said that he has no responsibility for newspapers, but it must be of concern because the health of democracy must be his concern.  It may not be his responsibility directly, but it ought to be his concern.  Newspapers are a vital organ of a healthy democracy.  The Minister cannot say to us that he has brought in a measure that he can stand over unless he can spell out the likely effects of this measure on newspapers. The Minister told us he has been talking to the newspaper people and has been listening to what they have to say.  I hope the talking and the listening is now over. At the end of the day politics is not about talking or listening alone but about making decisions.  The decisions have to be made in this House and we on this side of the House are very right to counsel caution in the enactment of this Bill.  My fear is that this Bill will have adverse effects on RTE, on local radio and on newspapers.  If that were to happen it would be a bad day for democracy in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  The removal of the cap is more than welcome.  We all argued for that when the Bill was introduced in 1988. However, I am disappointed that the Bill is not dealing with the totality of broadcasting in the country.  The Minister had the opportunity to look at local radio as well as the national broadcasting network. As we all know, legislation moves very slowly through the House and it takes time to draft it.  Many local radio stations have a problem in funding their further development.  This Bill provides the opportunity for the Minister to address that problem.  There is the additional concern about newspapers but I think that is a totally separate issue.  I agree that several of the provincial newspapers are under pressure because of competition from local radio and the removal of the cap from RTE will put further pressure on them.  There are <Col N="368" /> other solutions that could be put forward for the provincial newspapers and the reduction of VAT is one possibility, especially when one considers there is no VAT on their competitors from England.</P>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to local radio.  There are 21 local radio stations operating relatively successfully in this country.  Thankfully, only a few are under threat at present and some are operating very successfully.  I take this opportunity to compliment the management of Radio Kerry on their marvellous contribution to broadcasting in the county and to the development of the county.  If the Minister needs an example of how a local radio station should be run successfully he need look no further than Radio Kerry.  Local radio makes the case for funding because if it had the funding proposed in Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment it could make further advances and develop its service to the public.  There are several areas where it could develop if it had sufficient funding &mdash; for example, it could provide a better news service, both local, national and international.  It could also play a more major role in community development, and Deputy Quill referred already to the possibilities that local radio opens up to community development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are immense opportunities that are not being exploited because of the lack of resources.  Indeed, in an area that touches on the Minister's own brief &mdash; cultural development &mdash; there are opportunities for exploiting the vast reservoir of cultural resources through the medium of local radio.  Local radio has the opportunity to bring its resources to bear on a local level, as it has been doing, and this type of work energises the community.  If local radio were given some share of the licence fee it would be able to do this work.  It is only right that people should pay for a service.  If the public is listening to local radio it is only right that some part of the licence fee being paid to RTE should be given to local radio, which is providing an essential new service for the public.  There is justification for refunding a portion of the licence fee paid to RTE by assisting local radio.  This is a <Col N="369" /> very important issue and the Minister should give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment presents the Minister with an opportunity &mdash; he may not get the opportunity of doing something like this again for some time &mdash; and he should not allow it to slip by on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few, if any, Deputies in this House who would not support the development of local radio and specifically community radio, which is not quite the same thing in the terms of what is being discussed here today.  What is being argued for by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats is the subsidisation of commercial radio stations at local level.</P>
      <P>The whole question of local radio is one which was debated at length when the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, was introduced.  I argued at that time that there were far too many commercial radio licences at local level.  I could not see how the revenues would be available to maintain them and felt it was inevitable that a number would go to the wall.  At that time I stated that I did not see how the commercial national television station proposed would ever get off the ground &mdash; it did not &mdash; or that there would be room for a third national commercial radio station.  That station got off the ground but unfortunately disappeared.</P>
      <P>We are attempting to ensure that RTE survives as the national broadcasting service and that provision is made for some of the resources they receive from advertising to be used for independent programme making.  That is an entirely laudable step to take and one which should not be confused with the broader debate on local or community radio broadcasting.  For that reason I would not be supportive of the amendments which are attempting to introduce the subsidisation of local privately-owned commercial radio stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing against the survival of these stations.  I am simply saying there needs to be a much more comprehensive debate about what precise kind of service <Col N="370" /> local communities need.  I get a lot of representation from local groups seeking to establish community stations which would not be commercially based, which would not depend on advertising and which might be dependent on some kind of subvention from local authorities, who have not yet entered into this debate and would have a significant role to play. Obviously that would depend on the whole question of funding and the powers of local authorities being changed.  I am not opposed to the idea of local radio; it is an excellent development, but we have to be careful that we do not give a particular group a certain amount of money in order to survive when in fact we may be blocking a much more worthwhile development at local community level when we would have time to address that issue.</P>
    <P>I have argued previously in relation to other matters in the broadcasting area. We need a real debate on this issue and the Minister should use the new committees to generate that debate in this House.  I am not opposed to the development or the survival of local radio in principle but I do not see that the amendment put forward is the vehicle by which that should be done.  Issues concerning local radio, how it is to be funded, kinds of programming and how stations should interact with each other need to be addressed much more comprehensively. It makes little sense for areas of small population to have a number of stations competing with each other for scarce revenue from the commercial sector.  There is an exciting future for local radio provided we tackle it in an innovative way and not by trying to tag it on, so to speak, at this point.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to newspapers and their survival problems in the current climate.  All the newspapers, whether in the Tony O'Reilly stable or the <i>Cork Examiner</i> stable, are commercial enterprises whose bottom line is to remain in the black and make a profit.  They have done so quite successfully primarily because Irish people generally are voracious readers of newspapers, books and magazines.  The range of newspapers <Col N="371" /> available is extraordinary compared with other countries and the extraordinary low circulations which newspapers have in, say, France.  It is a question of private business arguing for subsidisation, whether by way of reductions in VAT or transferring some of the advertising revenue from RTE to them or, as they argued successfully previously, for the capping of RTE advertising so that they could get a share of it.  As it turned out they failed to do that because the ethos promoted by newspapers is one of choice and of the free market.  I have never read an editorial in any of the newspapers, either national or provincial, which promoted anything other than the level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Although it is the Broadcasting Bill we are dealing with, the provincial press will also be affected.  My case is for the provincial papers. The provincial press plays a major role in keeping people properly informed.  In my constituency <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>, a well known journal, is read from cover to cover in every household.  They are finding it extremely difficult to compete, not with local radio but with regional radio.  We were promised local radio in the original Bill, but that has failed and we now have regional radio with the local news element being lost.  We are therefore back to the provincial press who are finding it extremely hard at present.  All the problems involved in libel cases, with money having to be lodged in court and so on, come under what we are discussing. Now, because the cap is being removed, one broadcasting station will be able to grab all the business.  That should not be supported.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention and it would not have the support of this House.</P>

      <P>I am an advocate of local radio and, having listened attentively to Deputy De Rossa, I believe there is no intention to create a situation whereby local radio stations are subsidised. All they are looking for is a levelling of the playing pitch, and it is far from level at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of local radio stations in 1988 a chapter in broadcasting history was written.  I know they are commercial radio stations, but the setting up of such stations did not not turn out to be the licence to print money that people <Col N="373" /> thought it would be; most of them are losing money.  The area that I represent is as entitled to a local radio service as any other place, irrespective of population density.  There is no problem in major towns and cities which have the infrastructure to keep radio stations going. However, the input of news in areas like parts of County Mayo, County Sligo and County Galway is very small simply because it is too costly to gather it.  What I am trying to do here today is to bell the cat and find out who pays for what.  I will not stand for a weakening of what we thought we were entitled to in 1988 and we are not getting that.</P>
    <P>I have no axe to grind with RTE apart from the fact that their regional coverage is not as good as I would like to it to be. They are very professional and, if I am not out of order, I would like to congratulate them on what they did in Millstreet.  I was glad to be Irish looking at that programme the other night.  I do not know any place in the world where technical input is better.  We more than held our own in Millstreet and I would like that to be conveyed to RTE.</P>

      <P>Christmas is too far away.  I had occasion to speak to many radio personnel in the last few weeks and one thing I have told them is that I will not stand for cross-subsidisation of a lame duck outfit.  If they cannot produce the goods I see no reason why anyone should subsidise them.  In my view local radio stations are very professional but there are certain aspects of their business that will suffer because of the removal of the cap on RTE advertising.  RTE has a hard business nose and will go after extra business, and the only way to do that is to drop advertising rates.  That will have a ripple effect all around the country and will put more pressure on the already pressurised commercial radio stations. <Col N="374" /> Perhaps the Minister has great ideas to include in his next Bill; but, allowing for the fact that such Bills take a long time to get to the floor of this House, the local radio stations have been handicapped and RTE will have a three-furlong start. As the Minister knows, if people in the business world believe they are getting a good service in one area they tend to stay with it.  The local radio stations will then have more problems trying to coax back that sort of business.</P>
      <P>What my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, is trying to do is very relevant and encompasses all the opinions we are hearing from right around the country. She is very much in tune with the trends of the moment.  Nobody has more of an interest in this business than the Minister and surely he must see that this is putting unnecessary pressure on the very local radio stations we would all like to help. It is against that background that I have made my remarks.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that we need a debate on community radio also and I look forward to such a debate, but I am now concentrating on the public service obligations of the local radio stations, which are very important.  Local radio is very much an arm of democracy.  The development we have seen is very positive in terms of the quality of much of the programming and of the role local radio plays and can play in local communities. That role could be developed and expanded even more.  However, there is always a danger that they will broadcast nothing but wall to wall music and we do not want to see that.  We really do want to see quality services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would allow support to be given to local radio in areas where it is necessary but that would not be unconditional support.  As can be seen from section 6, it is tied to the provision and development of training facilities, the news service and transmission costs. I am sure the Minister is aware that startup and ongoing monitoring and transmission costs are very expensive for local radio and this amendment proposes to <Col N="375" /> address those issues.  The public service broadcasting remit is important and should be developed and supported as far as possible.  The role of radio here is very important in maintaining a healthy democracy as is the role of other sections of the media.  The amendment would allow local radio develop that mandate to the benefit of local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point in response to Deputy De Rossa.  He incorrectly suggested that those supporting this amendment were seeking cross subsidisation of newspapers when nothing of the kind is being sought. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a member of the Progressive Democrats I want the legislation to create and maintain conditions of fair competition and, in this instance, fair competition between various sections and sectors of the media.  That is all I am asking.  It is a very threadbare line of thought that does not take into account the impact of the removal of the cap on advertising and the imposition of an increased VAT rate on our newspapers.  It is fairly perverse logic to suggest that a reduction in VAT is somehow a subsidy to newspapers.  It is a type of logic that I have not heard advanced in this House since I became a member six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is valid that we should take into account the predicament of the newspaper sector as a result of the two measures enacted in the past three months.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, the ultimate sufferers will be those who believe in democracy.  People of my generation learned how the political process works through reading newspapers and listening to the radio.  Television was introduced much later.  Anything that would put the price of newspapers beyond the reach of ordinary people would be a backward step and we must be conscious of that.  I am certainly not calling for the subsidisation of newspapers, but I expect that legislators would take into account the overall impact of the measures they implement here on the availability of newspapers to the literate <Col N="376" /> citizens of this country.  I do not want that factor overlooked despite the fact that it does not directly relate to the provisions of this Bill.  I apologise for taking up so much time because this matter does not arise on the Bill but I felt I had to respond to the point made by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify some points.  When I met the advertisers they told me that one of the consequences of placing the cap on advertising was that less time was available for television advertising.  Advertising on television became more expensive and was occupying a greater proportion of advertising budgets.  They cut back on advertising in the print media and on local radio because they had less money in their budgets to spend as a result of the higher cost of advertising on television.  Because it was more costly to advertise on television, new firms and procedures found it difficult to purchase the time to launch new products on television.  In addition there were less shoots per month from 1990 to 1993.  This resulted in job losses and the flight of advertising revenue and earnings from advertising from the Irish system.  In addition the figures for the film companies involved in the production of such advertising initially froze and then began to decline.</P>
      <P>In this legislation I am restoring the position to that which prevailed prior to 1990.  In addition, I am creating opportunites for the independent film sector which can easily be related to obligations that will arise anyway in a European sense on the televisual broadcast of RTE regarding proportionality in commissioning from the independent sector. I have built some flexibility into its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not fall into the trap of resuming a Second Stage debate on this matter. We are discussing a batch of amendments which deals specifically with the issue of radio.  The matter is not about whether the Minister recognises the difficulties facing local radio.  I do.  How often have I to say that?  If I meet them I am accused of indulging in meetings and words, and if I do not meet them I am still wrong, <Col N="377" /> unless I rush legislation through here. Representatives of AIRS have told me they are glad I am not rushing legislation on radio through the House and that I am addressing the position comprehensively. I am looking at the cost of news gathering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply fairly to all the points.  For example, the debate on community radio is not a separate matter for another day.  For example, if I allow local commercial radio to go on the air and deal with community radio in a few years' time when I have concluded my commercial radio list, what chance have I given community radio?  Community radio is part of local broadcasting as is local commercial radio.  Let us live in the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public here decided they wanted public service broadcasting.  This does not have to be seen as a case of threatening wall to wall music on people.  Some stations started with wall to wall music and the listeners told them they did not want it.  Some of the better stations that have been referred to had a strong news, current affairs and documentary basis from the start.  They covered news broadcasts mainly, then current affairs programmes, to a lesser extent documentaries and they are among the stations that fared best.  Other stations started out on another road, but were quickly converted.  To an extent, the listeners define the quality of what is broadcast and today there are three groups, the first making minuscule profits or merely balancing its books, the second seeking mergers to avoid difficulties and the third resisting any merger.  I have examined this matter in detail for the first time and not only have I taken their agenda of proposals on board, but I have made <Col N="378" /> further suggestions to them which are being examined.</P>
    <P>I have not neglected the needs of radio and neither have I neglected the needs of newspapers.  One of the most fruitful meetings I have had was with members of the provincial newspapers association who had some interesting things to tell me, including, for example, the conditions of work which prevail in them and for those in local radio.  Some are paying trade union rates and carrying the cost of that and others are not.  It is a very complicated issue.  I met representatives of the national newspapers of Ireland and a number of other people.</P>
    <P>I am not labouring under any misconception but it is becoming clear that the whole structure of the media is very important.  I am committed to pluralism in the media.  I agree with Deputy Connaughton's point.  One is not defined in terms of one's broadcasting access rights, what one can spend or the number of people involved.</P>
    <P>In my Second Stage speech I stressed the communicative order and laid down clear philosophical principles guiding me in broadcasting.  The second fundamental issue is whether this is the way to deal with the needs of radio.  I believe it is not. I can deal with it much better when I have an opportunity of looking at the balances.  Lest people think this is just my view I will refer to evidence.  It is not accidental that the 1988 Act dealt with radio and set up the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the 1990 Act dealt with RTE, particularly in relation to the cap.  It is time to review the 1988 legislation.  I do not accept that it was not possible for that Act to have a development role.  Narrow and all as that legislation was, there was a capacity there.  It is another issue as to whether it has been used sufficiently.</P>
    <P>People want community radio and Deputy De Rossa is right in stressing the need for it.  People are entitled to look back and see if they got a fair share since 1988.  I propose when considering the introduction of fundamental legislation to examine the whole structure of broadcasting in relation to the structures to <Col N="379" /> which I have referred.  This will include examining the relationships between RTE, Telefís na Gaeltachta and local radio.  Local radio which would deal with local issues must be considered also and I will do that.  I have explained this to the interest groups involved and they are willing to accept this strategy.  I will not breach confidence with those groups but people had said that all would be right with local radio if a share of the licence fee was allocated to it.  However, a large group has said the last thing we should do is allocate a share of the licence fee to local radio without discriminating as to standards and so on.  It is necessary to consider the quality of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan made the point that proposals in relation to local radio must be considered in the context of the balance of media locally, including local papers.  I propose to do that.  I believe that is the right path to follow and it is preferable to amending a Bill that restores the position to that which prevailed prior to 1990.  It will create opportunities for the independent film sector and define a relationship between it and the RTE authority.  I have covered most of the points raised by Deputies.  I appreciate the Deputies who have paid tribute to those who have provided an excellent local service.  I have noted the points made.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for a general broadcasting debate and I accept that issues are related.  It would be wrong to follow the path of establishing a complicated relationship with the RTE authority in this legislation.  It is best to deal with all the issues regarding radio including those of structures, representation, costs relating to the structures, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, transmission, costs of gathering news, forms and mechanisms of sharing news, the role of the Irish language, the nature of documentaries, the sheer number of stations and so forth.  I must consider all that, but regardless of what proposals I make, it will be impossible to please everyone. If one please the local radio people one is certain to offend some local newspaper <Col N="380" /> owners and if their agenda was considered another group would be offended.  I am interested in the best mix of reformed broadcasting.  This can be achieved by a through debate and I will introduce legislation towards that end. For that reason I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

The Minister's discussion has highlighted the point I made on Second Stage that it is impossible to extract the two areas to which the Minister has referred and put the Bill through without that having consequences for the other sectors.  It would be better to approach this matter in a comprehensive way.  This amendment deals with local radio and provides it with the opportunity to pursue its public service broadcasting remit and provide support for that.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the wider effects the amendments of the <Col N="381" /> Minister or Deputy Fitzgerald may have. It appears that the removal of the cap will have an effect on the revenues of newspapers.  One of the suggestions made in the course of the discussion was that reducing the VAT rate would be one way of assisting the newspaper.  It has been the experience in relation to newspapers that when VAT was reduced, its reduction was not incorporated into the newspaper price.  Effectively, the reduction in VAT was a subsidisation for newspapers.  The newspaper owners were no longer obliged to return X amount of VAT to the Exchequer.  They were returning an amount of X minus Y and keeping Y and putting it in their own pockets.  That is a subsidy.  The myth created in the eighties that there is a level playing pitch in a market economy is total nonsense.</P>

      <P>The only moneys received by the Department from the European Community arises from the EC Fisheries Council decision in November 1989 providing for funding for fishery surveillance in member states for the period 1991 to 1995.  A programme for the purchase of one used CASA aircraft and two new maritime patrol aircraft for use in fishery surveillance was lodged with the EC in June 1990.  Ireland's programme which will be completed in 1995 qualifies for a contribution rate of 50 per cent and to date £7 million has been refunded by the EC.</P>
      <P>I am also arranging to examine the question of the provision of assistance from the European Social Fund in respect of the retraining of personnel discharged from the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals at present in regard to availability to Cohesion Funds in the military area, I will be glad to have the committee informed of any developments in the future involving European Community funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's Department obtains funding from the European Cohesion Fund.  Prior to any Government decision being taken this House, through the committee system, should have an opportunity of discussing the Minister's proposals.  This would make the committee system more meaningful. Is the Minister aware that I have requested that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security should deal with marine matters so that his portfolio, which includes both Defence and the Marine, would be covered by one Dáil committee.  It is vitally important that we have the opportunity, both in the <Col N="384" /> Defence and the Marine areas, to discuss the opportunites for this country through the allocation of Cohesion Funds.  Did the Minister receive any indication from the Department of Finance as to the allocation to be made to his Department from the Cohesion Fund, particularly in the light of the fact that this country has to protect a higher percentage of the total coastline of the EC?  The figures the Minister supplied seem relatively small for that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure to deal with coastal erosion for this year, for example, is only £200,000.  In the context of the six year development programme we would be talking of a figure in the order of £16 million distributed over that period.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security I am as anxious as the Deputy to see that system work to the advantage of Oireachtas Éireann and the Dáil in particular.  From my point of view any issue of major importance which would require consultation with my colleagues in a global party context would be brought to the attention of the select committee.  The Deputy's question regarding the Department of the Marine being linked to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is a good one.  I will discuss that matter with the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Dempsey, who deserves much credit for introducing the principle of the committee system and I will be guided by his views in that regard.  I agree it causes a difficulty for me as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine to be required to switch from one select committee to another. The Opposition spokesmen would experience the same difficulty unless they are members of more than one select committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund, I am anxious, for the future not only of the Department of the Marine but the fishing tradition here, our ports and harbours whether primary ports, commercial ports, secondary ports or small harbours in rural Ireland, that we can maximise the amount of money obtained from the <Col N="385" /> intended allocation by the Department of Finance to the Department of the Marine.  I am very conscious of the need to obtain as much money as possible in the context of what may be on offer. However, the Deputy will appreciate that it is premature to give any indication as to what the final sum of money may be because over the past number of days and weeks we have been in the process of negotiating what will be hopefully a meaningful figure to realise the plans for badly needed work.  As an island nation we need to support the maritime tradition.</P>

      <P>May I begin by referring the Deputy to my reply to a question from Deputy John Browne on 24 February last in which I indicated that penalties under Irish legislation are amongst the toughest in the Community with fines of up to £100,000 prescribed under the fisheries Acts for fisheries offences in Ireland's economic zone.</P>
      <P>The Acts also provide for the forfeiture of the catch and gear and additionally, where persistent offenders are concerned, the courts have discretionary powers to order the confiscation of the offending boats.</P>
      <P>There is not, therefore, as the Deputy's question seems to imply any need for community legislation in this regard.  The requisite powers already exist under national law.  Within the framework of the legislation it is, or course, a matter for the courts to decide on the penalty to be imposed in individual cases and to date the penalty of confiscation has not been applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I advised this House on 6 April last <Col N="386" /> in response to a question from Deputy Clohessy, I have asked that the legal aspects of the matter be examined in consultation with the Attorney General's office.  When this examination has been completed, I will consider whether the relevant legislation could be amended so as to increase the likelihood that vessels guilty of a second or subsequent offence will be confiscated.  Of course, I would be anxious that in advance of that happening I would bring it before the relevant select committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister replied to a question last February I was making the point that there is a need for a common approach on the part of all EC members in dealing with the problem of countries who blatantly breach our laws by fishing near our coast.  The penalties applicable do not seem to be a deterrent.  Should we introduce a system similar to that in criminal law where a person who commits an offence can be extradited to the country where the offence was committed?  If someone who breaches our law slips the net, so to speak, it should be possible under EC law and with the co-operation of other member states, to have his boat brought back to this jurisdiction so that he can be tried in our courts.  In such cases confiscation would be an essential part of our punishment system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's question to have a different emphasis. However, I take the Deputy's point. He wants the owners of boats who escape, having committed a crime in this jurisdiction, to be brought back from the jurisdiction in which they have sought refuge.  I will look at this matter.  I thought the Deputy's question related to the harmonisation of European Community laws in the context of confiscation of boats, fines and the removal of fishing gear.  Harmonisation of those aspects of EC law would run contrary to the requirements of the laws of this island nation.  The reality is that the laws of other member states in this area are less stringent than our laws.  Our laws are <Col N="387" /> much tougher than the laws of any of the other 11 member state.  As I said, I will look at the first part of the Deputy's question.</P>

The Act defines such a force as an international force or body established for the performance of duties of a police character.</P>
      <P>The mandate of UNOSOM II is not confined to duties of a police character. Consequently a prerequisite of participation by an Irish contingent in this force is the amendment of the 1960 Act. The necessary legislation will be introduced shortly.  UNOSOM II will be authorised to carry out certain military tasks such as prevention of the resumption of violence between the various formerly warring factions, continued United Nations control of heavy weapons, seizure of unauthorised small arms and securing of ports and airports.  The Irish contingent will consist of a transport unit whose main duty will be to provide supplies to military components of the force.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael would support changing the legislation in this area provided each request was brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  I am sure the Minister would agree that this is a fundamental change in the role of our Defence Forces.  In <Col N="390" /> certain circumstances such requests could be in breach of our traditional stand in relation to neutrality.  Would the Minister not agree that it is somewhat galling for those of us who have been elected to this Assembly to read in the newspapers on a regular basis about a decision made by the Government to send troops to a certain country and that it will bring this request before the Dáil?  This highlights the disrespect which exists for this House. Before any commitment is given to the UN, each request should be brought before the House so that it can be debated and a decision taken to either accede or not accede to it.  In view of the statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, on 12 May that: &ldquo;The decision reaffirms our commitment to securing peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs also referred to the role of the Irish troops in matters of security.  This is a fundamental change which will have serious consequences for our Defence Forces, whose age structure is getting older.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every request to send a contingent abroad will be brought before the House by way of resolution.  In this context, I understand that the Dáil only will be asked to agree to the request.  I do not think the Seanad will have any involvement in this respect.  With regard to amending the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1960, both this House and <Col N="391" /> the Seanad will have a say in this matter. The Deputy asked a number of questions. I thank him for his support.</P>
      <P>With regard to discussions in the news and electronic media, when one is asked by a journalist at a press conference if something is happening based on informed information, it is then that the information gets into the public domain. It is difficult for a Minister or a Deputy to attempt to avoid a question by attempting to come into conflict with the intelligence of the questioner.  When a decision is made at Government the decision subsequently gets considerable publicity before the House has been made aware of it.  I would not want the Deputy to think that because that happens I am being disrespectful to the House.  I, in common with other Members, am conscious of our obligation to respect the House and its Members. As for the point made by Deputy Spring, perhaps the Deputy would put a question to him in that regard.</P>

Dublin County Council has submitted applications for land use and land reclamation under the Foreshore Acts in relation to the tiphead at Baleally, Rogerstown estuary, County Dublin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements to ensure the safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL are the subject of constant review by the Government.  Communications between the Israeli military authorities and the Irish contingent are conducted through <Col N="395" /> UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura, South Lebanon which maintains continuous contact with all parties.  This is the practice for all contingents serving with UNIFIL none of which is in direct formal contact with the Israeli forces.</P>
    <P>Irish commanders meet informally with local commanders, including Israeli representatives, in order to establish liaison with the various parties in conflict in the immediate operational environment of the Irish contingent.  It is also the practice for Irish commanders to meet Israeli officers in Israel in a social setting where matters of mutual concern are discussed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing procedures governing UNIFIL communications are effective.  Communications alone, however, do not guarantee safety nor should the safety of Irish troops in Lebanon be in any way dependent on the type of communications referred to in the questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the aftermath of serious incidents over the years there has been a perception that there is a timelag between the time of the incident and in communicating reports.  Will the Minister see to it that communications are improved?  Apparently, other countries with troops in Lebanon have better lines of communication to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that there is a timelag.  With the greatest of respect to the questioners, I have a good idea where the suggestion that other contingents in the Lebanon have better lines of communication comes from and it is false. The truth of the matter is that the communications centre for all contingents is located in Naquora.  The suggestion that there has been a lapse in regard to the bombing from the direction from which the suggestion, and indeed question, may have come or from South Lebanon is untrue.  The reality is that the United Nations has indicated that communications of this nature will be dealt with in Naquora and nowhere else and this applies in the case of all countries <Col N="396" /> with battalions serving in the Lebanon, including the Irish contingent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Where post traumatic stress disorder has been identified in members of the Permanent Defence Force it has usually occurred as a result of service overseas with UN missions.  All personnel are, accordingly, required to undergo a comprehensive medical examination before being selected for overseas service, or indeed for certain duties at home, and a further medical examination is carried out on their return from such duties.  The Medical Corps has an extensive network of trained medical personnel attached to all units and barracks. Barrack personnel support services officers are also available and individuals are encouraged to discuss problems of this nature with them.</P>
      <P>Where an individual is felt to be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder he is examined by and placed under the care of a civilian consultant psychiatrist. If the service of other specialists are recommended, these are also arranged without delay.  The psychiatrists determines the treatment that the individual requires and this is provided through the Medical Corps or, if considered necessary, in a civilian hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject matter was addressed at the PDFORRA conference in Killarney last night by the Chief of Staff when he gave a thorough resumé on what is being done in this area.  A <Col N="398" /> number of initiatives have been undertaken by the Director of the Army Medical Corps.  An Army doctor has just completed a five year post-graduate study in psychiatry with particular emphasis on psychological factors which may be specific to Irish military personnel in coping with stress.  I understand that this full time military psychiatrist will head the expanding psychiatric services available to our personnel.  The service will also increase the expertise of both the Medical Corps and military commanders in anticipating, recognising, managing and treating post traumatic stress.  With the Deputy's permission, the best way to respond to the second part of his question is to say that during the past 11 years fewer than ten members of the Permanent Defence Force have been repatriated from overseas for reasons of a psychiatric character.  To put the matter in context, there have been over 15,000 tours of duty in the Lebanon by Permanent Defence Force personnel during the same period.</P>

      <P>The decision to expand the psychiatric services was made in the recent past following consultation with myself and others.

      <P>Recent examples of issues involving policy development are the setting up of conciliation and arbitration schemes for military personnel following the establishment of representative associations for them; developments in overseas missions under the aegis of the United Nations; and, as just announced, the projected radical overhaul of the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces on the basis of an up-dated statement of roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>An acceptable bid was not received when Collins Barracks was offered for sale by public tender early this year. Accordingly, the Government decided on 9 March, 1993 not to proceed with the sale of the barracks and that the future of the premises should be discussed with the Ministers for Finance, Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and Education.  This process is in train and I intend to bring the matter back to Government for consideration as soon as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House any additional information on the timescale or logistics of developing Collins Barracks for the good of the community? Is he aware of the number of proposals that have already been aired publicly, as tends to be the case, ranging from proposals for its use as a museum or even as a prison?  Are the Minister to whom he referred in his reply planning to take any action in the near future, or when we might expect some concrete proposals to emerge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not really give a timescale within which some conclusion will be reached on the deliberations in train but it would be my intention to bring to the attention of one of the newly-established Select Committees any proposals that might be put forward in advance of any decision that might be taken elsewhere.  It is fair to say that there <Col N="402" /> was a tender offered, that there were a number of people who indicated an interest in the building, but the offers did not reach anywhere near the moneys being sought.  In the circumstances, the Minister for Finance consulted his colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, expressing interest in the possibility of the relocation of the National Museum.  This would be a good idea in terms of access.  Any endeavour to park at the existing location is a joke. The number of artefacts on display is limited because of the space available to them.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Dublin Institute of technology has evinced an interest in Collins Barracks and this is being examined. I am glad that the tenders did not succeed because I believe that the present embryonic proposals are good.  It is a matter of developing them to the advantage of the community at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House a commitment that the Government has dispensed with any notion of disposing of this property for other reasons, such as for development purposes? Can he assure the House that Collins Barracks will remain in public ownership, to be used by the National Museum or for similar purposes, bearing in mind the scarcity of available resources and property for the proper development of museums and other public facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might advert to Deputy Sargent's questions in that he indicated the barracks might be used as a prison.  That is certainly not on and will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself proposed the idea of a museum and indeed other uses for Collins Barracks, which indicated his concern along the lines expressed by Deputy Barrett.  The Taoiseach was the first person to do so.  The House can take it from me, not with certainty &mdash; because I might be returning to the House to apologise for misleading them &mdash; but with almost 100 per cent certainty that the <Col N="403" /> direction Deputy Barrett favours will be followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 26, 35 and 91, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided that <Col N="404" /> there is a need to conduct a fundamental and thorough review of the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  The review will proceed in two stages.  The Minister for Defence, will prepare for Government approval, an updated statement of roles and priorities for the Defence Forces.  The Efficiency Audit Group will then conduct a radical overhaul of the Defence Forces structures and systems on the basis of the revised roles. The first stage, the review of the roles of the Defence Forces, is already under way.</P>
    <P>The most recent formal statement of the roles of the Defence Forces dates back to 1981 when their primary role was defined as &ldquo;to defend the State against external aggression&rdquo;.  It is clear that in the changed circumstances of the nineties this formal statement of roles needs to be reviewed.  For many years, the operational focus of the Defence Forces in practice has been concentrated on areas such as the provision of assistance to the Garda, service with the United Nations, fishery protection and search and rescue.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to complete the review of roles as rapidly as possible and to report back to Government without delay.  Before completing this part of the review, the Minister intends to consult the Select Committee on Legislation and Security so that it will have an opportunity to express its views on this important issue.</P>
    <P>When revised roles are approved by Government, terms of reference for the review of the Defence Forces by the Efficiency Audit Group will be drawn up. This group will conduct a fundamental review of the structure of the Defence Forces and recommend such changes to the organisation as are necessary to prepare the Defence Forces to meet the roles assigned by Government as effectively and efficiently as possible.  This review will also take stock of progress achieved in implementing the organisational reforms recommended in the Gleeson report.</P>
    <P>The report of the Gleeson Commission suggested that management consultants could pay a useful role in any reorganisation <Col N="405" /> of the Defence Forces.  It is envisaged, therefore, that consultants may be employed to advise on specific aspects of the review should the EAG require outside expertise to assist it in its work.  No arrangements to engage consultants have yet been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the matter be discussed by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security prior to the setting up of the review body?  If that is the case, will the Minister outline the reasons he is considering appointing consultants before the committee has had the opportunity of discussing the matter?  If the Government decides to proceed with the appointment of consultants, will they come from civilian or military life?  Will this review take account of the provision in the Maastricht Treaty for an 1996 intergovernmental conference on a common defence policy? What role does he envisage for the Defence Forces if a common defence policy is agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having quite an extension of the subject matter requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's last question on the inter-governmental conference in 1996. Obviously, the review of the Defence Forces' role will have to take account of the revised role of the Army, but that cannot happen in the context Deputy Barrett spoke about until we know if there will be a change in the EC position on a common defence policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the appointment of consultants.  In my reply to Deputy Barrett's questions I mentioned the appointment of consultants. The Gleeson Commission suggested that management consultants could possibly play a useful role in reorganisation.  If the efficiency audit group decides it is necessary to employ consultants they will be employed and it will be a matter for the efficiency audit group to decide whether they will be military or civilian personnel.  However, if consultants are <Col N="406" /> engaged to review an organisation such as this, I imagine that both military and civilian personnel will be involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister is already in communication with the chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to ask him to convene a meeting to discuss the revised roles of the Defence Forces.  The appointment of consultants is not a matter for the Government but for the efficiency audit group.  It will decide whether it believes it will benefit from the advice of outside consultants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points.  First, the question of the changing role of the Defence Forces must clearly be linked to the Government's current decision on peace making operations in Somalia.  Will the Minister indicate when the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will be convened to discuss the review of the role of the Defence Forces? I think it would be putting the cart before the horse to have amending legislation of the Defence Acts before having had the opportunity to discuss the broader issue of the changing role of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Second, I want to question the Minister further on his reply to the question on the Maastricht Treaty.  When the Maastricht Treaty is ratified we will be obliged to participate in a common foreign and security policy development which obviously implies a common defence policy as distinct from common defence. I accept that post-1996 we will have to decide whether we want to be involved in specific issues of common defence. Will the Minister clarify his position on the question of whether the review of the role of the Defence Forces will include a review of our role within the terms of the common security policy under Maastricht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's intention that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will be consulted about the role of the Defence Forces, in addition to the amendments to the Defence Act, to take account of the UNOSOM mission.  As I said already, the <Col N="407" /> Minister has made initial contact through me with the chairman of that committee and will be formalising matters within a day or so.  It is intended that this matter be raised at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security within a matter of weeks.  I do not wish to pre-empt the decision the committee will make, but it is certainly the Minister's wish that this committee will meet soon.  It is not true to say that this is simply linked to the UNOSOM mission.  Members on all sides of the House have held the view that the role of the Defence Forces as outlined in the Dáil in 1981 is now outdated and needs to be reviewed.  One could say that the impetus generated by the UNOSOM mission has brought it forward a little bit sooner, but it is not solely linked to it and wider issues are involved.  The role of the Defence Forces is being reviewed, taking into account all aspects of what is happening around us including EC develpments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister referred consistently to the efficiency audit group having control.  This strikes me as a money saving exercise on the Government's part, because as far as I am aware the efficiency audit group was set up to try to save money in the various Government Departments.  Why should an efficiency audit group set the pace and organise a review of the structures and the role of the Irish Defence Forces? Will the representative bodies, as I ask in Question No. 26, be consulted in the process?  How can we possibly discuss the structures in the Defence Forces without the Government first deciding on its role, as different structures are needed for different roles?  Would it not make sense that the Government should begin the process of deciding the stance it will take at the intergovernmental conference three years hence?  If we do not take account of the possibility of a common defence policy when the review is being carried out, the structures in the Defence Forces may not match our requirements in the future.  The Government should begin the process of deciding what role <Col N="408" /> our Defence Forces will play in the European context before deciding on the structures in the Defence Forces.  Does the Minister agree with me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my opening statement and to jog his memory, I will state what I said &mdash; the review will proceed in two stages: first, the Minister for Defence will prepare, for Government approval, an updated statement of the roles and priorities for the Defence Forces.  That is what will happen initially.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out there would be no point in asking an outside agency, such as the efficiency audit group, to talk about streamlining systems and so on if the roles were not clear.  The roles will be decided on the basis of recommendations from the Minister for Defence to the Government.</P>
      <P>To allay Deputy Barrett's fears in this regard there will be consultation on the roles and the review not only with the Select Committee on Legislation and Security but with Department of Defence personnel, military personnel and representative bodies.  When the roles are decided by the Government it will be up to the efficiency audit group to bring forward their plan for administrative systems which will fit in with the revised roles.  As the Deputy is aware the efficiency audit group was set up in 1988 not only for the Department of Defence but for all Government Departments with a view to streamlining systems and ensuring efficiency in the administrative systems throughout the Civil Service. That is what is intended here also.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister make a statement to the House, or in public, on his Department's current policy on decentralisation?  There is growing concern that the current policy is simply a matter of shifting jobs from one part of the country to another, that there is no real net benefit and that there may well be a net cost to the economy? Is that policy under review?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If and when the matter becomes critical, in the sense of a decision arising, I will bring the matter before the House or the relevant select committee.  It is intertesting to note that the Department of the Marine is already decentralised with offices in Cork where there is a district engineer, a marine survey office and a mercantile marine office.  The accounts section is located in Castlebar.  In Galway we have a district engineer and at Dún Laoghaire, at the five fishery harbour centres at Killybegs, Rossaveel, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth.  In addition, the Department's sea fishery officers and fish quality officers are based at various locations around the coast.  We also have a marine survey unit tucked away at Eden Quay in the city of Dublin where there are approximately 20 staff.  Effectively the Department of the Marine is, if anything, over decentralised.  Almost one-third of its existing staff is outside dublin. Enough is enough so far as we are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans for the development of the aquaculture sector involve a target of some 1,100 additional jobs to be created in the period 1993-97.</P>
      <P>There will also be a significant number of jobs created downstream in addedvalue processing and marketing and in the supplies and services area.</P>
      <P>The projections for job creation are based on a proposed total investment of some £46 million over the period half of which will come from the private sector. Community funding plays a significant part in encouraging entrants to the aquaculture industry.  The objective, therefore, is to maximise Community support with minimum enabling Exchequer funds to underpin investment in the sector and to achieve employment and production targets.  I am confident that this objective will be reflected in the National Development Plan.  This investment strategies is being complemented by strategies to develop a more efficient and cost effective industry structure; to improve marketing structures and opportunities and to enhance technical performance and quality awareness.</P>
      <P>Work is underway to bring a significant proportion of identified projects and related jobs on-stream this year.  Up to 100 concrete proposals, mostly in the shellfish sector, are being actively assessed by BIM in discussion with promoters and community based co-operatives.</P>

      <P>In the light of his reply, and the fact that further investment will be made in this sector, does the Government propose to change the method of considering applications for grants?  For argument sake, will there be a greater role for local authorities in processing the recommendations attaching to Community type developments associated with the sea in their areas or will we have the same problem of a centralised decision-making process for Cohesion and Structural Fund grants? Will the Minister clarify if his Department will clear up the dispute which raises its head from time to time, whether the development of aquaculture is causing a lice infestation problem? Perhaps this problem could be dealt with once and for all without further damage being caused to the aquaculture sector?</P>

      <P>I shall take the last part of the Deputy's question first.  I am convinced that both aquaculture and wild fishing can survive together.  I understand that the technical officials are convinced of that also.  Certain restrictions will have to be made and regulations rigidly enforced.  It goes without saying that if we want to have a healthy aquaculture industry we must have certain restrictions. I assure the Deputy that every aspect of that issue is being investigated to ensure that lice infestation is reduced to a minimum.  I should say that the county enterprise boards will play a major role in the promotion of various projects which will come before the Department and will play a positive role in that aspect of job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a meeting which I had with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation on 21 April during which a wide range of questions of interest to the fishing industry was discussed.  One of these related to the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which was concluded in December last. The document to which the Deputy refers is the Irish memorandum on the review of the Common Fisheries Policy which was submitted to the Council of Ministers in April 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This memorandum set out the constraints under which the Irish fishing industry operates and suggested ways in which these could be ameliorated in the context of the review of the Common <Col N="413" /> Fisheries Policy.  The memorandum identified four areas in particular where the Irish Government felt attention was required.  These were the allocation of fish stocks to Ireland; targets for the size of the Irish fishing fleet; the protection accorded to coastal fisheries; and the amelioration of Ireland's burden of fisheries control costs.</P>
    <P>These issues were pursued vigorously all through 1992 with the full backing of the Government.  The campaign to improve Ireland's position, apart from the normal political and diplomatic processes, included the exceptional step of initiating a case in the European Court of Justice on the matter of fleet targets.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory outcome to the review of the CFP was reached at last December's Fisheries Council.  Ireland received a favourable outcome on fleet targets which will enable the existing fleet to be largely maintained as compared with the substantial reduction sought by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards protection for coastal fishermen, the existing 12-mile limit arrangements, which could have lapsed allowing access up to the beaches, were preserved. On the matter of the costs of fishery protection, the council made an important Declaration which opens the way for the first time for the support of the current costs of providing sea fisheries enforcement services.  This matter will, I hope, be advanced substantially at the forthcoming June Council.</P>
    <P>The key outstanding issue, however, relates to Ireland's allocation of fish stocks.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are not satisfied that these are fair or reasonable and have sought appropriate adjustments.  This would, of course, require other member states to give up some of their existing entitlements.  That is a very important point.  That is the sort of battle we have to fight.  If we are to get extending fishing quotas, we are asking other states to give up some of their quotas.  It is a very tall order, but we will do our best.  They have not been prepared to contemplate this to date but we are determined to press the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> In this regard, the major achievement made at the December 1992 Fisheries Council was the obtaining of a Declaration from the Council that the outstanding issues in the Irish memorandum &mdash; and the allocation of fish stocks was the major outstanding issue&mdash;would be considered by the Council before 30 June 1993 on the basis of a written report by the Commission.  This provides a framework and a basis for further pushing the Irish case, although no one should underestimate the difficulties which arise in this connection.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to meet with the EC Commissioner for Fisheries and the President of the European Council of fisheries Ministers with a view to emphasising the importance of this issue to Ireland.  I will also be contacting the other Fisheries Ministers in advance of the June Council.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a concern by the IFO that, should the Council be willing to accommodate Ireland, this could be technically ruled out by the terms of the CFP regulations adopted last December.  This concern is unfounded.  If additional allocations were to be made available to Ireland, this could be done without any amendment to the basic regulation which does not set out the specific allocation keys.  This is a political problem needing a political solution.  That is what I would like to think will happen.  The question of the fish quota is a very difficult one.  I have no doubt that it will be addressed at the Council next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that part of our problem relates to the bad deals done in the past?  Would he agree that it is an absolute disgrace that our fishing industry is in the state it is, given its potential in relation to employment opportunities?  We are way behind in terms of processing and it seems we are second class citizens when it comes to recognition within Europe of the vital part the fishing industry can play in generating wealth in this country and giving employment.  Given that we have one of the highest unemployment rates within <Col N="415" /> the EC, surely our Community partners must recognise that it is time to rectify the bad deal imposed upon us some years ago and see that we get adequate quota share and also take steps to deal with the ongoing problem of illegal imports from outside the EC into our country and into the EC in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the so-called deal we got in the past was not in Ireland's national interest.  However, since 1972-73 we have become members of a Community which has common cause and common case in so many areas. I agree that although we have 3 per cent of the total allowable catch in 16 per cent of the fishery waters, nevertheless we are obliged to commit ourselves to the Common Fisheries Policy, warts and all. There is a discussion in relation to its beneficial advantage to this country, but what we are trying to do at the June council is to get additional fish quota. That is an uphill battle because to get additional fish quota we have to request other countries to give up part of their quota.  That will be very difficult to do.</P>
      <P>As a general overview of the fishing industry, I agree that in our country the fishing industry has been low in the scheme of human evaluation.  We are an island nation.  I do not think we realise that even now-and I am not talking about the fishermen or the people in charge of the fishing organisations who are people of courage in the first instance and people of integrity in the second, and they know their business.  What I am saying is that as a people we have not come to realise the huge advantage we have around our coast in the context of our maritime tradition.  Not only do we have opportunities in the context of sea fisheries but in the context of inland fisheries, another resource that we are not properly protecting and that we have not come to see in the context of tourism.  I am very seized of the views expressed by the Deputies.  I am very aware of the problems.  The fish are sometimes not seen even in the context of a discussion on food.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate to what extent if any fish caught by Irish fishermen have been destroyed in the past year because they were surplus to the Irish quota? How soon does he expect progress on the breakthrough he believes can be achieved in regard to assistance for coastal protection? In regard to the review of the Defence Forces, which obviously includes the Naval Service, to what extent will that influence reform of the Naval Service into, for example, a coastguard?</P>

      <P>An allocation of £200,000 was made available for coastal protection this year.  This, of course, is derisory because parts of our coastline are literally being washed into the sea with every storm.  The fact that only £200,000 is available to protect our coastline is nothing short of a seagoing joke.</P>
      <P>I would be shocked to discover that fish are being killed in order to comply with quota levels and the Common Fisheries policy.  We are talking about sending troops to Somalia, but to destroy fish or food of any description is extremely unlucky and conceptually and socially wrong.  It is an outrage.  I will investigate the matter for the Deputy and if I find it to be true, I will either raise it at a committee meeting or correspond with the Deputy directly.  If the Deputy wishes to table a question on this matter again I will have the information for him then.</P>

      <P>Prior to Question Time I was holding fort on the silliness of the Thatcher-like speak of the level playing field.  That is not the type of criteria that should be applied to a discussion on broadcasting because we are talking here about values which go beyond the economic and crass commercialism that often pervades life in Ireland.  Therefore, any arguments which seek to introduce elements such as that into this Bill would be a mistake.</P>
      <P>There is a major distinction in the broadcasting area in that there are specific obligations on broadcasts on both radio and television to be fair and equitable in their treatment of news and current affairs whereas no such obligations apply to newspapers in that regard.  The primary concerns of those involved in newspapers relate to obscenity and libel. Therefore, even at that level we are not comparing like with like.  If one wants to use the level playing field approach in this area we should introduce legislation which would oblige newspapers to treat the public to a fair and balanced reportage of events in Ireland, in this House and around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to <Col N="479" /> the point about balance in the various sectors.  Of course, the Minister is correct in saying that it is difficult to get it right, but one must endeavour to do that.  There is a crisis in the media here in many ways.  It could be fairly said that we are swamped by trans-frontier competition which is impacting in many respects on the various sectors.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance recently regarding the amount of money collected by the Exchequer from national and provincial newspapers in the past three years and he stated that £70 million was collected last year.  The Government should examine VAT rates, but it should also examine changes that are required in the area of libel law, lodgments in court and so on.  However, as the Minister stated already, that matter is outside his remit.  The impact of the provisions of this Bill on the various sectors and the international position are matters which need to be examined so that we get the balance right and attract appropriate competition.  The matter of manufacturing relief needs to be examined also on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the 20 per cent is &mdash; to move away from some of the phrases used by Deputy De Rossa &mdash; to build in a balanced local radio system that will address the various requirements about which I have spoken and at the end of the day lead to a more pluralistic approach and greater representation of interest groups in local radio stations catering for the needs of the various sectors in the community.  This type of support would help local radio stations to do that in a positive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to do so.  I intend to address comprehensively the issues that have been raised by the Deputies opposite in fundamental legislation which I hope will <Col N="480" /> bring us past the end of this century.  I realise what is involved in terms of its complexity.  On Second Stage I attempted to indicate my philosophy in this regard.  There are two clear choices which can be made by a person responsible for media and broadcasting and I have made my choice clear.  One could view the population as comprising a set of market segments in which approaches to broadcasting media, film and newsprint are targeted entirely at the market segment composition of the population.</P>
      <P>An alternative view is to see acts of communications as rights in whatever medium.  I have taken that second view which departs from a democratic theory of media, which is a culture that is democratic requiring a media that is pluralist. Therefore, an older unemployed person who may have very little consumer power has rights to participate in the communicative order the same as a rich employed person.  I am following the second path and in my approach towards the legislation I am defending these norms.  I considered it was incumbent upon me on Second Stage to indicate what path I was taking.  The meetings I have had with different groups and the questions elicited have been informative. The argument about the viability of a pluralist democratic local radio are valid but it is best to consider the full agenda presented by those interested groups who came to see me.  They have accepted some further proposals I have made in relation to Irish language broadcasting. I have added matters to their agenda and they are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting point was raised by Deputy De Rossa.  He is right to emphasise that if one believes in a democratic communicative order some importance must be given to community television. This does not just relate to what the local market can deliver.  There is also issue of what is happening in the local community. Many people who began in a commercial vein have been pushed into the community vein by the power of the listeners who have requested specific <Col N="481" /> structures for broadcasting.  I am sure we all agree in regard to that.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies De Rossa and Fitzgerald have raised the issue of libel. While it is a slightly separate issue from the one we are dealing with it is one about which I am concerned.  I have discussed the implementation of the report of the Law Reform Commission with the Minister with responsibility in that area. There is also the issue of clearing up court procedures.  Another issue arises in relation to that.  While one might be anxious to protect newspapers from excessively litigious people one must consider the person who is offended by the libel.  If there is not a mechanism to address the rights of a person who has been libelled, is it not in the public interest for the Government to address the matter?  This is a matter that will engage my attention.  It arises in relation to radio also.  For example, where improper procedures are used to gain an interview or what might purport to be an interview and the interview is then broadcast on radio, this also involves the mechanism.  In this case there is an opportunity to consider what are malpractices in radio and television broadcasts.  These are valid points for fundamental review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> These amendments are not the way to answer the problems in respect of radio broadcasting, but I will consider the matter in relation fundamental legislation. There are some technical points about implementing these amendments. Reference to a radio set is not made in the 1988 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  The requirement of having a radio licence was scrapped a long time ago and the reason initially for including a reference to a television set was linked to that.  I am not arguing about the point.  The best way to address the complicated issues of radio is through the introduction of fundamental legislation which I hope will be the occasion of a major debate on broadcasting. We cannot introduce further legislation without having a good debate on what is meant, for example, by public service in public service broadcasting. Introduction of that legislation will not be delayed.  I cannot accept the amendment proposed but I can assure Deputies I will address the issues when I introduce substantial legislation in this area.</P>

    <P>When I looked again at section 4 I considered that there was need for some flexibility as to how RTE could spend the money in the account and vary the <Col N="485" /> amounts which must be allocated to the commissioning of independent programming. In the light of experience there is case for more flexibility than I originally envisaged.  Amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 15 have been tabled for this purpose.  Under amendments Nos. 7 and 9, RTE may spend up to 10 per cent of the annual amount paid into the account on programme support and development. This is to cater for situations where a programme concept or script appears to have some merit but needs to be developed further.  The amendment will allow RTE to provide funding to enable such development to take place.  The amendment will also allow RTE to step in to provide funding for the completion of a programme where the project has run into difficulties through, say, the loss of a backer.  In some circumstances the requirement under the definition of &ldquo;commissioning&rdquo; in section 1 (2), which requires 25 per cent of the cost of making the programme to be committed before work commences, would be inappropriate.</P>

This is why I tabled my amendments. The flexibility being provided in this amendment will mean that a great variety of independent productions can be catered for, especially in circumstances where difficulties may arise.</P>

This flexibility gives necessary impetus to this sort of initiative. I am glad the Minister realised that <Col N="486" /> he was tying the hands of RTE too tightly in this respect.

This amendment will give RTE a much better opportunity to promote its internal programme-makers and the flexibility to commission work from independent programme-makers.  The allocation of this money can be monitored. The Minister has also provided for a better reporting mechanism in this amendment.  If any changes or modifications are made to the amount of money allocated we will be able to find out if value for money was achieved in the annual report presented to the House.  We will learn if the programmes being made are up to a certain standard and if they are enhancing the already very high reputation of RTE.  This amendment will improve the Bill from every point of view.</P>

      <P>I regret I missed the Minister's introductory remarks.  I welcome this amendment.  On Second Stage I expressed concern about the apparent inflexibility of the section as originally drafted.  How necessary is the phrase, &ldquo;and for no other purpose&rdquo;?  It seems to be unnecessary in that the section specifies the activities on which the money may be spent.  Why does the Minister think it necessary to emphasise that the money may be spent for no other purpose?</P>

      <P>However, I welcome the amendment.  The proposal that the Authority may use moneys standing to the credit of the account for the purpose of &ldquo;commissioning the making of <Col N="487" /> independent television programmes&rdquo; is fairly straightforward.  It also proposes that such money may be used for &ldquo;procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by the Authority of the making of programmes as aforesaid.&rdquo;  Does this refer to independent television programme-makers? Is it intended that the Authority can employ people as consultants?  Finally, it provides that the moneys can be used in &ldquo;assisting the completion of programmes as aforesaid the making of which has not been commissioned by the Authority&rdquo;.  Is that intended as a means of bailing out independent film-makers who may get into trouble?  In the nature of things I would not have any great difficulty with this as the film-making business is not a precise science and problems can arise. Is it a means whereby the Authority can enter into joint ventures with independent film-makers?  The Minister may have covered these points already, but I would like to hear his response.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on putting down this amendment and I suppose that comes as no surprise to anyone.  He has acknowledged that the Bill as originaly drafted was not all-embracing and did not give sufficient guarantees to independent film-makers. His acceptance of this point will give the necessary stimulus to independent film-makers. Much concern has been expressed that many of the skills which have been built up over the years and acquired by film technicians may be lost to this country.  This amendment will ensure that we have a very vibrant independent programme-making sector.  I welcome this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been consistent in his attitude towards the broadcasting sector. He advocated the introduction of such a measure when he was in Opposition and he is now putting it into effect.  I compliment him on that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for the generosity of their remarks. Deputy O'Sullivan, probably more than anyone else in this House knows the shape of my thinking in relation to broadcasting and the film industry.</P>
      <P>Other sections in the Bill provide for flexibility but in this case I needed to address two very definite situations &mdash; the young film maker who needs a small amount of money to develop a concept and the other who might need a small amount of money to finish it.  I was very anxious to have the fund removed within RTE's accounts to a separate film commissioning account.  I have done that and have retained elsewhere in the Bill some discretion in relation to it.  When I say &ldquo;and for no other purpose&rdquo; it is to indicate unequivocally that that is where the money is to go.  Deputies should remember that this is a proportion of a total fund.  The issues relating to residuals that move from one year to another have been addressed later in the Bill.  The purpose of putting in that formulation of words was to focus on the needs of two clearly identifiable sets of circumstances.  I welcome the Deputy's response to my amendment in this regard.  I wanted not only to focus it to preserve that kind of creativity but because that links in to my total proposals for film which go beyond the Bill.</P>
      <P>If, out of the sums of money directed at independent film making, I specify a proportion that will go for this purpose, I would like to think that within RTE we will find an equivalent response and that many young and not so young creative people in that organisation will have a development unit headed by a senior member of staff.  This is not to say that they are not already spending their money on such matters.  They may well be, but if one wants to inculcate creativity it is necessary to give it a formal recognition and a formal place in the structure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment but paragraph (ii) is a rather odd formulation. It is for:</P>
      <P>procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by the Authority of the making of programmes as a foresaid.</P>
      <P>From whom will they procure it?  Will they procure it from already established film makers or is the Minister adding another layer?  From whom does the original idea come?  Is it from the Authority or from some other source?  When the idea has been formulated what will happen?  Does it come back to the Authority which will then pick out an independent film maker to do the work, or do the people who formulated the idea carry it to fruition?  If the Authority is responsible for procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for commissioning, then RTE ideas will be used. One of the very good things about bringing in the film makers, in addition to increasing our expertise and giving employment, was that they would have separate ideas from those of RTE.  If one watches RTE, there is a kind of sameness about programmes and that is something we want to break from.  While this amendment has its advantages, if it is accepted RTE will originate most of the ideas.  While this amendment will do a good job in a specific area and will provide the seed factor which will finally lead to films or to very good programmes, RTE will be inclined to use that in a very big way with a view to getting over the idea that the programmes coming through to them will be those they want on the air rather than programmes originated elsewhere.  I would not mind if there was a general fund through which outside people could apply to RTE but here we have the Authority procuring the formulation.  I welcome the Minister's amendment but, because of it, the originating people will appear to be RTE rather than other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is doing has a down side with regard to local radio.  I hope that with this new uncapping of RTE they will not exercise predatory type pricing <Col N="490" /> for their advertising with a view to knocking out the local radios who have now taken a larger part of their listnership. That is a diversion, but perhaps the Minister would look at the possibility of getting a better wording for this proposal.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the question in relation to the structure he needs to put in place to ensure that the commissioning of independent film production is done appropriately representing independents and RTE interests.  When we discussed this before the Minister said I was suggesting that the Minister would interfere editorially with RTE.  That is not a valid criticism.  We are speaking about a serious amount of money which will, no doubt, help independent film production but we need some mechanism at the commissioning stage to ensure that there is the sort of balance about which my colleague talked.  I am interested in the Minister's views on whether we need an independent unit in RTE representing RTE and outside people.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that RTE from time to time commission independent film makers to make a series of programmes.  I visited an independent programme making company on the south side of Dublin recently.  They were making a series of music programmes. Would that kind of programme which has essentially been commissioned by RTE because they did not have the facilities to make it themselves go into the log book as part of the money being set aside for independent film making?  Must the two gel before funds are handed out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I anticipated some of this discussion.  When one compares this with other legislation dealing with a similar problem it is obvious that I have gone to considerable lengths in addressing it.  Section 5 defines an independent <Col N="491" /> television programme while section 6 refers to a report on the way in which the procedure is operated.</P>
      <P>The Authority will be able to procure ideas from whoever it wishes, not just from the person with a completed product but also from the person with a product in embryo &mdash; a cumbersome form of words which relates to the formulation of proposals.  Those who have developed ideas for programmes will realise that this is very real; it is not in its finished state at that stage.  Those who wish to finish a programme can offer this to RTE which, equally, can generate concepts and feed them out to see what the response is.</P>
      <P>I wish to make three points in response to those raised by Deputy Nealon and others.  I have defined the distance between the commissioning entity and the independent producer and made provision for an annual report.  Deputy Dukes made a good point about the manner in which regulations are made. Changes to my Bill will have to follow the path described by Deputy Dukes. Further, I have made provision for a review not later than two years' time. Therefore, if something was going wrong this would become transparent every year having regard to the requirement to publish a report and if it repeated itself from one year to the next it would fall to be considered in review.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with what is available now and I am reluctant to put a structure in place which may not be necessary in the short term.  I am happy to leave it as it is at present and if a review is necessary, so be it.</P>

Let us suppose, for example, that the argument is made that some of the product submitted in any one year is not up to standard and unacceptable. Such a mechanism could be abused to reject material but if this happened I would retain the money in the fund, carry it forward to the following year and retain the right to speak about the manner in which it could be used.  I feel that it is necessary to do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted on my sixth attempt to have his opportunity to raise the matter in the House.  It arises out of a disastrous fire at the UMP meat plant in Ballaghaderreen about one and a half years ago, in January 1992.  It is estimated that the cost of the damage amounted to £50 million, £35 million of which related to the destruction of almost 12,000 tonnes of boned out frozen intervention beef.</P>
      <P>A relatively small amount of meat was destroyed in the fire.  In addition, only a small amount was deemed suitable for removal for rendering.  Therefore, about 10,000 tonnes of charred and water and smoke damaged meat had to be disposed of quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emergency discussions on disposal of this meat took place immediately.  Party to these discussions were Roscommon County Council, the Western Health Board, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and in particular the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Woods, who visited the site and promised <Col N="493" /> that &ldquo;everything possible would be done on the hour and by the hour&rdquo; to deal with the consequences of the fire.</P>
    <P>Two days after the fire was extinguished the meat and debris were removed to a temporary site at Rahanmore, near Kilbeggan, County Westmeath.  This gave rise to an immediate local protest as the site was a disused sand pit.  Under threat of a High Court injunction dumping at the site was stopped after about 400 tonnes has been buried there.</P>
    <P>It was then suggested and widely felt that the remainder of the meat and debris would be brought to the purpose built landfill containment dump at Ballydonagh, Athlone.  Instead it was announced that a new site had been found at Cregga Hill, near Strokestown. We were told then that the site has been examined by the county council, by the health board and a senior official of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, all of whom found it suitable. It is very difficult to understand how it could have been deemed suitable given the location of the Cregga site which is one of the highest elevations in County Roscommon with a highly sensitive, surrounding environment consisting of the Killglass Lakes, which are part of the Shannon system, approximately three miles to the east.</P>
    <P>Perhaps even more sensitive is the location approximately one mile south of the site, Lisheen Lake, which is used as an unfiltered source of water supply for the County Roscommon north east regional water scheme at present serving approximately 100 households.  On the northern and western side of the site, only a few hundred metres off, is the large commercial Laragon Stone Quarry where large-scale blasting takes place regularly.  These blasting operations, of their nature and because of their proximity to the site, cause underground disturbances, like seismic movements that are bound to affect the site.</P>
    <P>There have been many local protests about this dump since it was established. At a very minimum, locals felt that some form of environmental impact assessment <Col N="494" /> should have been carried out on the site, given its very sensitive nature, before such a location would be used for this dump.  I might point out that it is the largest meat dump of its kind in Europe. Last summer many surrounding water supplies were found to have been contaminated. It is difficult to link the contamination with the dump.  Nevertheless, this contamination has never been noticed before.  Naturally it gave rise to great concern locally in relation to health.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, was the first member of the Government to recognise the difficulty this is causing local people, on which I might compliment him.  Indeed, he visited the site on 19 April last when he had an opportunity of seeing its location, elevation, its surrounding environment and its contents.  All the relevant points were put to the Minister of State on the day he met local residents, myself and others.  However, the matter raised repeatedly with him was the lack of local consultation beforehand &mdash; perhaps that was a difficulty &mdash; and afterwards.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State agree to finance an environmental impact assessment of this site so that we can determine whether it is having a damaging effect on the surrounding environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy Connor for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>The disposal of the large quantity of meat damaged in the major fire last year at Ballaghaderreen, understandably, has given rise to certain environmental and health concerns.  The emergency which arose was unusual and necessitated prompt action by Roscommon County Council at a number of levels.  I consider it important to give a brief summary of the background and the sequence of events.  This bears out the view that the matter has been competently and responsibly handled by Roscommon County Council, that the locals, in particular, can take confidence from this and from the continuous monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> After the fire, an exceptionally large volume of charred meat required urgent disposal in the interests of public health. In view of the emergency nature of the situation, immediate action was required.  Most of the meat was disposed of by rendering but 4,500 tonnes approximately was considered unsuitable for rendering because it was contaminated by building debris and so on and was disposed of by burial in a site at Cregga.</P>
    <P>Roscommon County Council decided that the Cregga site, and the disposal arrangements proposed there, represented the option most likely, in the circumstances, to minimise dangers to human health and the environment following investigation of a number of sites in County Roscommon and neighbouring counties.  A subsequent survey by a firm of hydrogeological consultants engaged by the county council confirmed this view.  The need to monitor the environmental effects of the disposal operation was accepted by the county council and a monitoring regime was put in place.</P>
    <P>Leachate extraction and venting of decomposition gases is still continuing at the site as recommended by the consultants. Eight boreholes were drilled around the site.  Monitoring of these, and a number of other wells and surface waters in the area, is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that leachate from the site has caused contamination of surrounding groundwater. Monitoring by the Western Health Board of samples from boreholes indicated that some contamination did occur.  The health board has concluded however, that this contamination arose from the spreading of agricultural slurry in the vicinity of the site, not from the waste disposal operations.  The county manager agreed to set up a monitoring committee, consisting of representatives of the Western Health Board, Roscommon County Council and the local residents' committee to assess the results of monitoring, although the residents' committee declined to participate.</P>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for waste management and planning, including the <Col N="496" /> selection and operation of waste disposal sites, is vested in each local authority.</P>
    <P>The crucial point is that all aspects of the handling of the matter are the responsibility of the local authority and, desirably, grievances should be resolved at that level.  Of course, the need to monitor the effects of the disposal operation is without question.  This is being undertaken by the county council with independent advice from the health board. The council has always been available to meet the residents and to discuss their worries and concerns.  The Department's role is one of advice and guidance.  It is satisfied that Roscommon County Council has met their responsibilities in this case.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of local residents for reassurance that this site poses no threat now or will in the future to the health or environment of their area.  It is right that this reassurance should continue to be given for as long as necessary, through the rigorous monitoring regime which is in place.  If this monitoring discloses any adverse trends, attributable to the waste disposal, I can assure the Deputy that remedial action will be taken.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connor stated, I visited the site approximately six weeks ago and I met the residents and others.  I also met the county manager who has since forwarded me documentation, with reports from Mr. T. D. Fehily, a public analyst and Professor John Flynn, consultant bacteriologist, from University College Galway.  I intend to seek further reports from him within the next couple of weeks to ensure that the monitoring continues. I will keep Deputy Connor informed of developments.  I told the residents, when I visited the site, that they would need some evidence to demonstrate that there is a problem there because our advice from the experts is that there is not one. That must be clarified.  I will keep Deputy Connor informed as we receive reports from Roscommon County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Bosnia have been forced to flee their country by the appalling bloodshed there.  To date this State has allowed approximately 170 Bosnians to reside here on a temporary residential arrangement.  Those who are here are anxious that relatives, still in Bosnia, or in refugee centres in various parts of Europe, be permitted to join them in Ireland.  Permission should be extended by the Government to these relatives to come here without further delay.</P>
      <P>The atrocities taking place on a daily basis in Bosnia, nightly depicted on our television screens, pose a moral obligation on this State to do more to assist those fleeing that country than we have done to date.  The number of Bosnian refugees admitted to Ireland is extremely small compared with the numbers been admitted to other member states of the European Community.  Other States adjoining that tragic country have been invaded by tens of thousands refugees. There would be widespread public support in Ireland for the Government doing a good deal more than it has done.  As well as agreeing to relations of those currently here to be admitted, we could admit some more refugees.  As a minimum, I propose that we agree to receive here another 500 refugees from Bosnia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should also issue a clear statement of policy with regard to the future here of all of those who come from Bosnia.  I have no doubt but that they all hope that normality will return to their country so that, at some time in the future, it would be possible for them to re-establish a normal life there.  Many of them think that, in the short to medium term, there is little prospect of their being able to return home to live in safety. Those who wish to remain here permanently should be granted political <Col N="498" /> asylum in this State, as should their relatives, and should not be regarded as mere temporary residents.  Those who wish for political asylum here are entitled to the security of knowing that, if they wish to remain here permanently and want their children to continue to be educated in Ireland, they will be permitted to do so without difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should make a public commitment to allow the relatives of the Bosnians currently here to come to Ireland and to agree to the admittance to this country of a larger number of refugees than we have accepted so far.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who has refused to state publicly how many have sought political asylum and whether asylum will be granted, should now clearly state the position.  Under the United Nations Convention on the Protection of Refugees they are entitled as a legal right to such asylum and the Government's silence and prevarication on this issue is little short of disgraceful.</P>
    <P>In the context of what is happening today in Bosnia, the time has come for us to do more to help the innocent victims of this appalling conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleague Deputy Shatter in appealing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have a generous and open policy of allowing the relatives of Bosnian refugees in this country to come here.  We cannot continue to rest on our laurels of so many years ago when we gave refuge to Hungarians after the revolution and to approximately 400 people from Vietnam.  Every time this issue is raised we are told how good we were a number of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Irish people recognised the need to take our share of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  People believed that we should have taken more than we did, which was approximately 170.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs now has the opportunity to allow relatives of the refugees to live here.  It is distressing to read reports in the newspaper that parents and grandparents <Col N="499" /> do not know where their children are, one man spoke about not knowing where his 16 year old daughter is.  I appeal to Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs not only to allow the relatives to come here but to assist in whatever way he can to locate them and help them to make their way to Ireland.  That indeed would be a generous gesture.</P>
    <P>A number of refugees from the former Yugoslavia have found their way to this country in other ways.  I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to liaise with the Minister for Justice to ensure that those people do not live in fear and dread of someone knocking on their door, being stopped by a policeman and told they should not be in this country and escorted to the airport.  I hope an open and generous view will be taken of the applications, particularly in view of the commitment that the Government appeared to give last week when it refused to accept the Refugee Protection Bill.  I hope this will be the first opportunity the Government has to show its bona fides on this issue.</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by the Deputies, as I am sure do all Members of the House, at the appalling level of suffering being inflicted on the civilian population in the continuing conflict in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that up to 100,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 1991 and it has given rise to a refugee crisis of proportions not seen in Europe since the Second World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now over 3.8 million refugees and displaced persons within the borders of the former Yugoslavia, over 2.3 million of them in Bosnia.  In addition, some 700,000 people have found refuge from the conflict in other European countries.  Ireland has been playing its part in addressing this humanitarian crisis.  Since July of last year, the Government has allocated a total of £610,000 from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund towards the provision of urgently needed humanitarian <Col N="500" /> aid to refugees and communities living under siege.  The bulk of this money has been allocated to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, as the lead agency co-ordinating the international relief operation in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that we also have an obligation to play our part in addressing the enormous refugee problem caused the the conflict.  The main burden in tackling the refugee problem has fallen on the newly independent States of Croatia and Slovenia and on neighbouring states, such as Austria and Hungary.  All EC members states have agreed to accept a certain number of refugees.  Germany, for instance, has given temporary protection to some 250,000.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed in July 1992 to admit up to 200 refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  A group of 178, from refugee camps in Vienna, arrived in Ireland on 2 September and were accommodated for an initial period at the Cherry Orchard reception centre.  They have all now been found private rented accommodation in the Dublin area. While they remain extremely anxious about the situation in their homeland and the safety of members of their families who are still in Bosnia, they have by and large settled in well in Ireland.  The Refugee Agency has been co-ordinating arrangements for their accommodation and language-training and is currently working to ensure that they are integrated in the community during their stay in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government and its partners in the European Community are firmly of the view that the right of all refugees from the former Yugoslavia to return to their homes eventually must be maintained. The refugees themselves are adamant that they wish to return home as soon as this is possible.  In common with the Governments of other EC member states, the Irish Government has, therefore, agreed to grant them temporary protection status with all the rights to employment and social welfare benefits that are normally accorded to refugees. <Col N="501" /> There will be no question of any of the refugees having to leave Ireland unless or until they wish to.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the extreme anxiety on the part of many of the refugees in Ireland to be reunited with members of their families.  Some progress has already been made in this area, with the issuing of visas in December last to enable 22 immediate family members to travel to Ireland.  So far, 11 of these relatives have arrived in the country.  The remaining 11, all of whom are in Bosnia, are being traced with the assistance of the UNHCR and the International Organisation of Migration.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is implicit in any decision to accept a group of refugees that provision should at a later stage be made to enable certain close relatives to join them.  The anxieties being experienced by this group of refugees increase the urgency which should be attached to the question of family reunification.</P>
    <P>I have been examining what further assistance Ireland might give in terms of accepting additional refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  Two hundred visas have now been issued on the basis of last year's Government decision and a new decision will be required if further refugees are to be admitted, including relatives of those already in the country.  The possibilities and costs have been fully examined.  I have prepared a submission for Government to enable us to admit a further group of refugees and to give priority to close relatives of those already here.</P>
    <P>A decision to admit a further group is only the first step in a difficult process. Many of the relatives for whom requests for admission have been received are currently living in areas of conflict in Bosnia. They will have to be traced and arrangements made for their transport from Bosnia with the assistance of the UNHCR.  This process has in the past taken considerable time, despite the best efforts of all involved, in the most difficult and dangerous of conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that, in spite of Ireland's relatively limited capacity to absorb large numbers of refugees, <Col N="502" /> the Government is convinced that we have an obligation to make our contribution to alleviating the suffering that has resulted from the terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  I would also like to assure those refugees who have come to Ireland in the past year that I will continue to work to ensure that as many as possible of their close relatives can come to join them in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom a rá gur ceist an-tábhachtach í seo agus ceist daonnachta.  I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the care of elderly people in the Western Health Board region, particularly in the Connemara area.  The problem arises because of the organisational resources within which the health board operates. At present elderly people needing full-time care and attention are all channelled through St. Brendan's Hospital in Loughrea. Subsequently if they are lucky &mdash; there can be a long delay in this &mdash; they can be transferred to one of the other homes for the elderly in the county.  To highlight the serious problem these people face in practical terms I put it to the Minister that if he or I suggested that people in Dublin had to go to Ballinasloe for an extended period before a place could be found for them in a Dublin home for the elderly, there would be an outcry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Brendan's, Loughrea is 25 to 30 miles from Galway city and many places in Connemara are 50 or 60 miles on the other side of Galway.  Many old people are cared for in geriatric homes up to 80 to 90 miles from where their relatives live, if their relatives want to visit them it would entail a round trip of between 160 to 180 miles.  At a very conservative costing of 20p per mile the cost to somebody from Carna, Cleggan, Ballyconneely or Clifden of visiting a relative in Loughrea would be approximately £32.  If one were to make the trip weekly it would cost £32 which represents a huge proportion of income of someone on <Col N="503" /> social welfare of £57 or even £80.  If the person does not have transport, the cost of visiting relatives becomes totally prohibitive. It must be remembered that a great many people living in these areas are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The other problem is the social dislocation of people taken out of their natural environment and put in a totally different one.  I accept that St. Brendan's in Loughrea is an excellent home. Nobody who has any contact with the services would dispute that.  There would, however, appear to be a lack of organisation in putting people into homes so far away.</P>
    <P>A further problem I would put to the Minister is that faced by the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  These people often become disorientated when taken from their normal linguistic surroundings and when they have to deal with doctors and nurses, and people in general, through the medium of English.  Most of the old people in these areas have a certain amount of English but Irish is their first language.  A large number of people in the south Connemara Gaeltacht have only a certain amount of English and in times of stress revert to the Irish language. Therefore, the extension of the provision of care, through the medium of the Irish language, in the natural location is of double concern to them.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will accept this point and that in providing resources for the Western Health Board region these factors will be taken into account.  I mentioned Merlin Park.  For most people in Connemara the option of going to Galway as opposed to Loughrea is preferable. If there is to be a halfway house or an assessment centre &mdash; which assessment can continue for one or two years &mdash; Merlin Park would be far preferable than a town which is 30 miles at the far side of the area we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Ar an gCeathrú Rua, tá cúram anmhaith á dhéanamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga féin.  Tá comhluadar nadúrtha ansin a thuigeann fadhbanna na gcainteoirí dúchais agus atá in ann deileáil leo ina dteanga féin.  Déantar go <Col N="504" /> leor cainte faoin nGaeilge agus ar an gcaoi ar chóir í a chothú.  Feictear domsa gur fearr cúram daonna de sheandaoine a chur ar fáil ina dteanga féin seachas anchuid seirbhisí eile.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw to the Minister's attention a point of grave importance, that of the strict adherence to county boundaries within the Western Health Board region which causes people living one mile on the Galway side of the Mayo border to be sent to Loughrea rather than to homes in Castlebar.  I hope the Minister will see his way to providing the resources to ensure that proper health care for old people is provided within their own communities and that nobody would have to go more than 30 miles to have geriatric care in County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter and I apologise for the absence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the first instance responsibility for providing extra long stay beds in the Galway region is a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>Formerly the needs of dependent elderly persons were met by admitting them to long stay hospitals.  This practice is now generally held to be unsatisfactory. Greater emphasis is currently being placed on the development of community based services so elderly persons can continue to live in their homes, with assistance, if necessary, for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working party on services for the elderly, The Years Ahead, provides a blueprint for the development of services for the elderly. The recommendations of the report have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  Since 1990, the Government has provided substantial additional funds to the Western Health Board.  During this time the board has considerably improved services for the elderly throughout the region.  The home nursing, home care and home help services have benefited while liaison nurses have also been appointed.  A total of 17 additional long stay beds were provided <Col N="505" /> in Merlin Park Regional Hospital in 1992.  The Western Health Board also proposes to adapt a unit in the hospital for the care of elderly mentally infirm patients.  In Carraroe the board has provided an extension which has enabled approximately 15 extra elderly people attend the centre each day.</P>
    <P>The board is currently carrying out work on the provision of beds, for respite care in Arus Mhic Dara.  The board is also examining a proposal to provide ten extra long stay beds in Clifden District Hospital.  Overall, there has been much improvement in the services being provided for the elderly in the Galway region which the Minister hopes will be maintained in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister intends to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 in the very near future.  This Act provides a new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes and when the Act is implemented, a statutory duty will be placed on nursing homes to register with the health board in whose region they are located.  Also, a new system of subvention will be introduced for dependent persons who require nursing home care.  Under the new subvention system, a health board may pay a subvention to a person whose dependency, means and circumstances have been assessed by the health board in respect of care in a registered nursing home.  Draft regulations setting out the new conditions for the payment of subvention under the new scheme have been prepared and discussions have commenced with the nursing home interests on these draft regulations.  The Act, therefore, will provide and health board with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly locally and flexibly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise what is a very important issue for the people in one of the few last remaining genuine villages on my side of County <Col N="506" /> Dublin.  In St. Mary's national school, Saggart, on 30 September 1992 &mdash; which is the requisite date &mdash; the school roll was one pupil short of the necessary number to retain a fourth teacher.  The number necessary to retain a fourth teacher is 94 pupils.  There were 92 pupils on roll that day; one pupil has recently left the school but was eligible to be counted.  Therefore, the shortfall is one pupil.  Accordingly, the school is to lose a teacher because of being one pupil short of the required number.  This is bureaucracy gone mad.</P>
      <P>The numbers increased by two above the 94 within days of 30 September.  The parents have made numerous requests with the support of all local public representatives for the retention of the fourth teaching post.</P>
      <P>The INTO, which was wrongly cited at one parents' meeting as being an obstacle to the retention of the post, has, in fact, written to the Minister calling for the retention of it.  In recent years £70,000 was spent by the Department on refurbishing this four classroom school.  It is a nonsense that one of these classrooms should be empty because of the overstrict interpretation of regulations. Clearly there are exceptional circumstances here.</P>
      <P>In addition, both industrial and housing development plans for the environs of Saggart will inevitably lead to a growth in pupil population within a few years.  It is shortsighted in the extreme to allow this school to fall back to three teachers. There are precedents for Ministers allowing appointments or retention of teachers in such circumstances.  In Kingswood, Tallaght, last year, and in a school this year, under the Minister's own patronage, in Marlborough Street I understand that such concessions were made. Accordingly, I call on the Minister to meet with the parents of the pupils of this school &mdash; I understand a meeting has been set up for next week &mdash; and most expecially to meet the reasonable demands for the retention of the fourth teaching post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to why this should have arisen.  I am advised that <Col N="507" /> in circumstances where the numbers rise above the requisite figure within days of 30 September a certain amount of legitimate creative accounting might have been engaged in.  I am not sure why a crisis was allowed to develop but it is crazy that because the roll was one pupil short a very important school in a village community in County Dublin has been allowed to fall back to three teachers.  It is an area where a lot of development is planned in the immediate environs of Saggart and it should not be allowed to run down.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to meet the representatives of the parents next week and retain the assistant teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and again apologise for the absence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Mary's National School, Saggart, County Dublin, 105 pupils were enrolled in the school on 30 September, 1991.  This enrolment warranted a staff of principal plus three assistants.  The school also has the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 92 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus two assistants <Col N="508" /> for the 1993-94 school year.  An enrolment of at least 94 pupils was required on that date to retain the post of third assistant for 1993-94.</P>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the chase of developing schools or where my Departments's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have not indicated to my Department the expected increase, if any, in enrolments in the school as a result of the planned residential developments in the area.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that development has only commenced recently, and that it is too early to project what effect it will have on the level of enrolments in the school</P>
    <P>If the school authorities are approached by parents wishing to enrol their children in the school from next September, my Department will be happy to examine the school's position in the context of maximum class sizes and developing school status.</P>
    <P>The staffing arrangements for each year are made following negotiation between my Department, the managerial authorities and the INTO.  I regret that it is not possible for the Minister to depart from these agreed arrangements in the case of individual schools.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 May 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to a press release issued on 17 May, 1993 by Deputy Emmet Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, on the subject of the emergency hostel service <Col N="420" /> for homeless men at Grangegorman.  The Minister of State has special responsibility for housing including the accommodation needs of the homeless.</P>
    <P>In his press release the Minister of State indicated that the emergency hostel facilities for homeless men at Grangegorman will not be needed after this year.  A new 107 unit hostel at Granby Row is being provided by the Salvation Army and is due for completion in December 1993.  This facility is being fund-aided to the extent of £2.35 million by the Department of the Environment. Additionally, the Department of the Environment has also agreed in principle to provide funding through Dublin Corporation to keep open the Salvation Army Hostel at York Street with accommodation for over 90 people.  When the additional accommodation which these two facilities will provide comes on stream, the Grangegorman facility will no longer be necessary.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Department has no function with regard to recommendations for funding requirements for accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>The number of bed nights provided by the military authorities at the Grangegorman facility from December 1992 up to and including 17 May 1993 is 4,945. The total costs to date to the Department of Defence of providing the facility are estimated at £146,000.</P>

Barrack security and operations in aid to the Civil Power require groups of personnel to be on duty outside of those hours on a rota basis.</P>
      <P>Overtime is not paid to members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  However, to compensate military personnel for certain liabilities associated with military service such as long hours of duty they are paid, in addition to basic pay, a special Military Service Allowance and other allowances associated with the duties performed.</P>
      <P>The arrangements concluded recently for the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force provide for consideration of claims relating to remuneration.  While, due to the nature of military service, claims for overtime payments may not be entertained, claims for specific allowances for any type of duty, including those duties which of their nature involve long hours, may be submitted under this heading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the Gleeson Commission's report the Government immediately accepted the recommendations relating to remuneration and approved their implementation as recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly the increases in pay proposed by the Commission have been fully implemented and there has been further enhancement of those pay rates by the additions provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Commission recommended <Col N="425" /> Increases in, and extension of, Military Service Allowance, which, combined with rank pay makes up basic remuneration for military personnel and those increases have been fully applied.</P>
    <P>Military personnel qualify for a wide range of additional allowances &mdash; for example, for a variety of security duties such as those connected with cash escorts; for prison duty and for overseas service.  Increases recommended in those allowances have all been fully applied as well as subsequent additions under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The commission proposed the introduction of several new allowances, for example, for bomb-disposal teams, for instructors, for officers on substitution duty and for personnel maintaining essential public services.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission dealt extensively with non-pay aspects of conditions of service and proposed improvements to these.  Meals provided for soldiers now have a greater variety of food items and better nutritional value and more personnel now receive free meals and free accommodation.  Uncertified sick leave facilities for non-commissioned personnel are now in operation.  A new comprehensive welfare and counselling service for the Defence Forces, involving the employment of civilian specialists in social work, has been introduced and is working effectively.</P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendations in regard to military personnel on overseas service have been implemented.  For those in Lebanon this has meant, apart from increased allowances, free telephone calls home to relatives.  Charges have been waived for certain items of equipment which attracted a charge in the past.  Requests for repatriation on compassionate grounds at the Department's expense are sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>In addition a new scheme of promotion on merit for commissioned officers as recommended by the Commission is in operation and a number of competitions for promotion to Commandant and to <Col N="426" /> more senior ranks has been held in line with the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>From the begining there has been full consultation between the Department and the representative associations in regard to the implementation of the Gleeson report.  This consultative process was firmly established following the formal setting up of the associations in May, 1991.  The Conciliation Council in which both civil and military personnel of the department meet with the associations on a regular basis, provides the mechanism for the on-going monitoring of progress.</P>
    <P>As to the remainder of the Commission's recommendations, these relate in the main to the area of management; military structures, organisation rationalisation and deployment; manpower and personnel policy; and superannuation. These are complex matters and a programme to address them systematically and comprehensively is being pursued.</P>
    <P>The time-frame relating to the recommendations in the areas to which I have referred is dependant on the complexity of the issues involved and in many cases on the necessary consulative process with the representative associations. There has been sustained attention by the Department to the Gleeson report and progress with its implementation will continue to be made as quickly as possible. Constant monitoring of progress is an inherent function of the processes to which I have referred and the proposed new review of structures organisation of the Defence Forces which I announced recently will provide further opportunity to assess progress in regard to the Gleeson recommendations in general.</P>

      <P>Plans for the development of the aquaculture sector involve a target of some 1,100 additional jobs to be created in the period 1993-1997.</P>
      <P>There will also be a significant number of jobs created downstream in added value processing and marketing and in the supplies and services area.</P>
      <P>The projections for job creation are based on a proposed total investment of some £46 million over the period of half of which will come from the private sector.  Community funding plays a significant part in encouraging entrants to the aquaculture industry.  The objective therefore is to maximise Community support with minimum enabling Exchequer funds to underpin investment in the sector and to achieve employment and production targets.  I am confident that this objective will be reflected in the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This investment strategy is being complemented by strategies to develop a more efficient and cost effective industry structure; to improve marketing structures and opportunities; and to enhance <Col N="429" /> technical performance and quality awareness.</P>
    <P>Work is underway to bring a significant proportion of identified projects and related jobs on-stream this year.  Up to one hundred concrete proposals, mostly in the shellfish sector are being actively assessed by BIM in discussion with promoters and community based co-operatives.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a meeting which I had with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation on 21 April during which a wide range of questions of interest to the fishing industry was discussed. One of these related to the Review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which was concluded in December last. The document to which the Deputy refers is the Irish memorandum of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy which was submitted to the Council of Ministers in April, 1992.</P>
      <P>This memorandum set out the constraints under which the Irish fishing industry operates and suggested ways in which these could be ameliorated in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The memorandum identified four areas in particular where the Irish Government felt attention was required.  These were</P>
      <P>&mdash;the allocation of fish stocks to Ireland;</P>
      <P>&mdash;targets for the size of the Irish fishing fleet;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the need to maintain and strengthen the protection accorded to coastal fisheries; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the amelioration of Ireland's burden of fisheries control costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> These issues were pursued vigorously all through 1992 with the full backing of the Government.  The campaign to improve Ireland's position, apart from the normal political and diplomatic processes, included the exceptional step of initiating a case in the European Court of Justice on the matter of fleet targets.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory outcome to the review of the CFP was reached at last December's Fisheries Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland received a favourable outcome on fleet targets which will enable the existing fleet to be largely maintained as compared with the substantial reduction sought by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards protection for coastal fishermen, the existing 12-mile limit arrangements, which could have lapsed allowing access up to the beaches, were preserved.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the costs of fishery protection, the Council made an important Declaration which opens the way for the first time for the support of the current costs of providing sea fisheries enforcement services.  This matter will, I hope, be advanced substantially at the forthcoming June Council.</P>
    <P>The key outstanding issue, however, relates to Ireland's allocation of fish stocks.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are not satisfied that these are fair or reasonable and have sought appropriate adjustments.  This would, of course, require other Member States to give up some of their existing entitlements.  This they have not been prepared to date to contemplate but we are determined to press the case.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the major achievement made at the December 1992 Fisheries Council was the obtaining of a Declaration from the Council that the outstanding issues in the Irish memorandum, and the allocation of fish stocks was the major outstanding issue, would be considered by the Council before 30 June 1993 on the basis of a written report by the Commission.  This provides a framework and a basis for further pushing the Irish case, although no one should underestimate the difficulties which arise in this connection.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to meet with the EC <Col N="431" /> commissioner for Fisheries and the President of the European Council of Fisheries Minister with a view to emphasising the importance of this issue to Ireland.  I will also be contacting the other Fisheries Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a concern by the IFO that, should the Council be willing to accommodate Ireland, this could be technically rules out by the terms of the CFP Regulation adopted last December.  This concern is unfounded.  If additional allocations were to be made available to Ireland, this could be done without any amendment to the basic regulations which does not set out the specific allocation keys.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a control system applicable to the Common Fisheries policy is intended to address the current control needs of the Community, in the light of the evolution of fisheries policy in recent years, the major decline in many stocks and the difficulties of ensuring adequate and uniform enforcement across the Community.</P>
      <P>This very comprehensive proposal deals with all aspects of fisheries monitoring and surveillance, including the shortcomings of the current monitoring system which were identified in two reports submitted to the Fisheries Council of Ministers in the last few years.  The more important aspects of the proposal related to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the introduction of new control technologies, especially satellite monitoring and computerised data systems;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of the Commission's <Col N="432" /> competence with regard to inspection and access to data in Member States;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of sanctions and penalty co-efficient for control infringements;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a one-net-rule which would prohibit the carrying of nets of different mesh sizes on board fishing boats;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the application of the control regime to Community boats in third country and international waters.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome proposals that further effective supervision of fishing opportunities and safeguard the livelihoods of fishermen.  A number of proposals require detailed examination and this is being pursued by the Department in the appropriate fora.  Under the proposal the direct competence and operational tasks to control will remain with national authorities, with the Commission having supervisory powers in order to guarantee the efficiency and equity of the regime.  This should assist a more uniform and transparent application of control measures in all member states.</P>
    <P>The proposal which was discussed at the Fisheries Council on 18 March is still being examined at expert group level and will come up for further consideration at the Council scheduled for 24 June next. At this stage it is uncertain whether matters will have been advanced sufficiently to allow for its adoption at that Council. In any event, the Commission's intention is that most of the new Regulation should come into effect from January 1994.  Certain elements and especially the introduction of new technologies would be introduced at later dates.</P>

      <P>The option of challenging the legality of any Community policy is one which is kept under ongoing review.  A decision whether or not to challenge any particular policy at any point in time must depend on a balanced assessment of the likely outcome and, in particular, a judgement whether that outcome would bring positive benefits.</P>
      <P>While I have no immediate proposals to challange the legality of the Common Fisheries Policy, the initiation of such a challenge is not ruled out.  Last year, we did not hesitate to take the Commission to the European Court over its policy on fleet reduction and due in no small way to this action we were successful in securing a major reversal of Commission policy on the fleet.  I would not hesitate to take such action against if the situation warranted it.</P>
      <P>This matter will be kept under review, having regard, in particular, to the outcome of forthcoming discussions on outstanding aspects of Ireland's submission on the review of the Common Fisheries policy.</P>

      <P>The EC <Col N="438" /> aid which was available for port projects under the current Operational Programme on Peripherality covering the years 1989 to 1993 was approximately £34 million.  It was decided on the basis of this allocation that the optimum level of total investment in harbours would be best achieved by an aid rate of 50 per cent.  This aid rate allowed all the key priority -projects to proceed and achieved a balanced regional spread of investment. Had the aid rate been fixed at 75 per cent, the volume of investment would have been significantly lower.</P>
      <P>Our programme provides that harbour authorities and private project promoters can received grant aid (EC aid and, in certain cases, Exchequer aid also) of up to 50 per cent of their approved project's total costs.  Under the programme 11 ports (Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, Limerick, New Ross, Rosslare and Waterford) have had projects approved for grant aid.  If the programme had provided a level of EC grant aid comparable to that which obtained for some ports in Northern Ireland in the 1989-1993 period, fewer of our ports would have benefited from the limited EC funds available.  Responsibility for the EC aid rate made available to port projects in Northern Ireland rests of course with the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
      <P>The optimum rate of EC grant aid to be made available to port projects under the next round of Structural Funds is a matter for consideration by the Government in the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>In recent years difficulties have been encountered in the carrying out of development projects identified by the Department of the Marine, as the relevant local authorities have had problems in funding their contributions to the cost of development projects.  This is particularly so in the areas where the maximum grant aid is 50 per cent.  In view of the difficulties being encountered in relation to local contribution levels, the Department of the Marine intends reviewing the level of contribution that will be sought from local authorities in respect of a new Fishery Harbour Development Plan, which is currently being finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The Department of the Marine recently entered into an agreement with Cork County Council in respect of the planned development of Keelbeg Pier, Co. Cork, whereby it was agreed that the Council's contribution would be paid on a phased basis over a number of years. The funding of the planned development project at Kilmore Quay is currently under review and I can assure the Deputy that the Department of the Marine is prepared to discuss any appropriate local funding mechanisms with Wexford County Council, including phased payments.</P>

      <P>: I presume that the Deputy is referring to the reports of premature returns of sea trout with varying degrees of lice infestation in the Waterville and Kenmare areas.</P>
      <P>As part of the Sea Trout Research Programme for 1993 surveys on sea trout fisheries in the South West are being carried out with particular emphasis on the Kenmare, Currane and Inny rivers.</P>
      <P>Sampling and other data emerging from the surveys are being analysed at present.  I am advised that, pending a full evaluation of the data, definitive conclusions about this year's sea trout returns in the South West cannot as yet be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing research effort, improved management strategies for fish farms in the South West have been implemented.  Marine fish farms in the area are being regularly inspected under the Department's Sea Lice Monitoring Programme.  The inspection programme is designed to ensure that lice <Col N="441" /> loads on salmon farms are reduced to a minimum and that appropriate remedial action is taken where lice levels are shown to be high.</P>
    <P>I am advised that follow up insepections carried out in the last two weeks confirm that levels of lice infestation on salmon farms in the South West have been reduced substantially.</P>

      <P>Specifically, the Department's expenditure measures under the STRIDE Programme fall under three principal headings:</P>
      <P>(1) investment in the Department's Fisheries Research Centre (FRC) to provide essential equipment to support the fishing and aquacultural industries; (2) the provision of specialised equipment for the national research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i>; and (3) the establishment of a national centre for the management and verification of marine data.</P>
      <P>Expenditure to date on the Department's STRIDE projects amounts to £1.036 million.  This has already achieved a significant upgrading of the Department's marine research capability in line with international standards.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this welcome infusion of funding into marine research and technology is providing a basis for sustained development and management of the marine resource.

      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently implementing the final year of its Fishery Harbour Development Programme covering the period 1989 through to 1993. The programme's objectives included not only the infrastructural development of the State-owned fishery harbour centres, but also the development of a number of strategically placed secondary harbours at which significant catches may be landed and a number of smaller harbours catering for needs which cannot be satisfied otherwise, either because they would add to congestion problems at the larger harbours or because the landing facilities in question are located adjacent to fishing grounds or aquaculture sites.</P>
      <P>The development programme involved an expenditure of £15 million&mdash; 1989 prices&mdash;on infrastructural improvements at selected harbours, towards which a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £7.5 million, 50 per cent through the Operational Programme for Rural Development was secured.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently drawing up a new development plan for fishery harbours.  This plan will again address the infrastructural needs of the State-owned fishery harbour centres and secondary harbours, including separate provision for aquaculture landing places.  It is hoped that EC Structural Fund assistance will again be secured in respect of this plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the contribution levels required of the relevant local authorities towards development works undertaken at local authority owned harbours, the <Col N="445" /> Deputy may be aware that under a long standing policy the level of grant aid available from the Department of the Marine depends on the geographic location of the proposed project.  Projects undertaken to the east of a line from Lough Foyle to the Old Head of Kinsale may be provided with a maximum of 50 per cent grant aid.  Projects in other areas can receive a maximum of 75 per cent grant aid.</P>
    <P>In recent years difficulties have been encountered in the carrying out of development projects identified by the Department of the Marine, following consultation with local authorities as the relevant local authorities have had problems in funding their contributions to the cost of those projects.  In view of the difficulties being encountered in relation to local contribution levels, the Department of the Marine intends reviewing the level of contribution to be sought from local authorities in respect of the new development plan which is being drawn up.</P>

    <P>On the question of the criteria used when deciding on licence applications, current policy requires that, prior to a licence being issued, applicants must withdraw active capacity (in terms of both tonnage and horsepower) from the current fishing boat register at least equivalent to that of the proposed new boat. Special conditions apply to the beam trawler and pelagic fleets, where the capacity being withdrawn must be from the same sector of the fleet as the new vessel being introduced; the new vessel be safe and seaworthy; the skipper/owner is duly qualified under the relevant legislation in force; no decommissioning grant has been paid in respect of the vessel; and proof of ownership be furnished.</P>
    <P>I must also be satisfied that the economic and social benefits arising from the exploitation of the target species of the boat involved will accrue primarily to the coastal regions and communities which the quotas are designed to benefits.</P>
    <P>The Department is at present engaged in the process of carrying out a comprehensive review of the current licensing policy in the light, <i>inter alia</i>, of the recent fleet capacity targets set by the Commission.  It is hoped to finalise this review within the next two months.</P>

      <P>There is general agreement that island issues, problems and priorities need to be approached in a more structured way at national, regional and island level.  In that context I am currently considering the recommendatins of a recent study commissioned by Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The study, while primarily focusing on the question of European co-operation between small islands, makes a number of proposals on ways in which national development and support measures for islands can be better co-ordinated and enhanced.  The Department has had discussions recently with Údarás na Gaeltachta on ways and means of taking <Col N="450" /> forward these proposals, drawing on experience elsewhere in the Community.</P>
      <P>I have decided as a first step to establish a co-ordination group representative of the relevant Departments.  The group will review and prioritise development strategies and recommend on actions to ensure a co-ordinated approach to all aspects of island development including the question of structural relationships. In this context I understand that the formation of a representative islands body is being actively considered.  I would very much welcome such a development as being in the interests of the collective island community.  I can assure the Deputy that any such initiative will have my full support.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that the Commission's recent communication on &ldquo;A Common Policy on Safe Seas&rdquo; has been welcomed by all member states. The policy objectives and main initiatives set out in the Commission's communication will be formally endorsed by the Council of Ministers in early June when a resolution to this effect will be fully debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With coherent policy objectives firmly agreed, the way will now be clear for the implementation of an action programme of priority measures to enhance maritime safety and pollution prevention in Community waters.  The action programme will give priority to strengthening inspection and enforcement procedures to eliminate substandard operators, vessels and crews from Community waters.  It will also include measures to identify and protect ecologically sensitive coastal areas, to improve the safety of maritime navigation <Col N="451" /> and to enhance standards of training.</P>
    <P>I will be urging at Council for concrete proposals to give effect to these measures to be brought forward with all possible speed.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's question to refer principally to recent public statements about Ireland's present and future role in UN peacekeeping and, in particular, to the Government's decision of 11 May that Ireland would respond favourably to a request from the UN Secretary-General for the despatch of a transport contingent from the Defence Forces to serve with the second UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).</P>
      <P>UNOSOM II will be what is described as a peace-making force.  It has been given a strong mandate by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  This includes authority to defend itself and to disarm elements in Somalia in addition to its task of protecting humanitarian workers and facilities.</P>
      <P>Service by members of the Defence Forces in UN operations is governed at present by the Defence Act, 1960.  This Act allows for the despatch of contingents as part of United Nations Forces for the performance of Duties of a police character only.  Since the UNOSOM II mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter goes beyond this, it will be necessary to amend the Act to enable the Defence Forces to participate.  A resolution of the Dáil approving such participation will also be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When announcing the Government's decision, I stated that UNOSOM II marked a new departure in UN operations. <Col N="453" /> It is intended to complement and support the UN's political and humanitarian efforts in Somalia.  The Government's decision to participate reaffirms our commitment to the United Nations and our willingness to carry our responsibilities under the Charter in upholding international peace and security even in difficult and complex situations.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that the range of UN operations in which our Defence Forces may participate will be broadened once the necessary legislative steps have been implemented and Dáil procedures complied with.  There will however be no change in the basic position that participation will be confined to operations established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations.  The existing provision in the Defence Act requiring Dáil approval for despatch of contingents on UN service will be retained.  Furthermore, we will maintain the practice of assessing each request made by the UN Secretary-General on its merits and in the light of all relevant circumstances at the time.</P>
    <P>In so far as Eastern Europe is concerned, CSCE peacekeeping efforts are playing an important and developing role in a number of countries, for example in Moldova and Georgia.  Peace enforcement is specifically excluded from CSCE peacekeeping activities, in accordance with the 1992 CSCE Helsinki document.</P>
    <P>The only UN peacekeeping operation in Eastern Europe is in former Yugoslavia. The mandate of the UN force there does not include peace enforcement, but is directed towards humanitarian activities and the pursuit of a political settlement.  The international community is making a major effort to obtain the agreement of all three Bosnian parties to the Vance-Owen peace plan. The implementation of this plan will be an enormous challenge and will require the deployment in Bosnia-Hercegovina of a very large peacekeeping force under UN auspices.</P>

      <P>The Government fully support the principles contained in the International Appeal for International Supervision, Monitoring and Verification to ensure Free and Fair Elections in South Africa, which was launched on Sharpeville Day (21 March) by the Liaison Group of National Anti-Apartheid Movements in the countries of the European Community.  Free and fair elections must take place and be verified to have taken place for the new united, non-racial and democratic South Africa to become a reality.</P>
      <P>The European Community and its member states are currently examining ways in which assistance can be provided to ensure that the elections, which should take place in the first half of 1994, are free and fair.  We share the concern that some groups and movements may attempt to disrupt the democratic process and we endorse the calls for United Nations monitoring and verification of the election process from the registration of voters to the declaration of the election results.</P>
      <P>As I said in this House on 23 March, 1993, it is my intention that Ireland should play its own part in assisting South Africa in the transition to democracy. Already by our support for, and participation in, the EC Observer Mission to South Africa we are giving effect in a practical way to our commitment to assist in the peaceful transition from apatheid to a democratic and non-racial society.  I would envisage that Irish observers will participate in due course in the international monitoring of the election process.</P>

      <P>Tax clearance certificates are required under section 156 of the Finance Act, 1992 for any licence commencing on or after 1 October, 1992 which is a spirits retailer's on-licence, a spirits retailer's off-licence or a wine retailer's on-licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax clearance provisions have been very successful in <Col N="456" /> bringing the affairs of many traders up to date.  In the nine months since the scheme commenced, some 10,500 tax clearance certificates have been issued thereby enabling the applicants to renew their liquor licences and continue to trade in accordance with the law.  In the process some £34 million of apparent tax arrears has been addressed by applicants, including arrangements for payment by instalments over a period of time where the circumstances of the case warranted it.</P>
    <P>There are a further 2,200 traders who have applied to the Collector General for tax clearance but in whose case matters have not yet been finalised.  In some of these cases discussions are continuing and it would be hoped to reach a decision shortly.  In many other cases however, there has been no progress since the initial application.  The Collector General has therefore placed such applicants on notice that a final refusal of tax clearance will issue in the absence of action by them to progress the matter.  The effect of a formal refusal is to make the applicant liable to prosecution for trading without a licence, although it does not preclude the applicant from subsequently obtaining a tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>1,100 traders who formerly held licences have failed to apply for tax clearance, despite reminders.  The Collectors of Customs and Excise have initiated action against those who failed to apply for tax clearance and continue to trade without the necessary licence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should mention that the Collector General's Office is still prepared to meet with publicans who are in arrears and who are prepared to make realistic efforts to discharge those arrears over a reasonable period of time. However, such publicans are strongly advised to act urgently as failure to regularise their affairs may result in legal proceedings being instituted against them.</P>

      <P>Regulations were introduced in November, 1991 enabling people who have gaps in their records, as a result of having been insured for periods in public service type employment, to qualify for pension.  These arrangements provide that in cases of a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance record a <i>pro-rata</i> pension will be payable, which will be proportionate to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age/retirement pension purposes.  To qualify for a mixed insurance pro-rata pension a claimant must have, <i>inter alia</i>, 208 paid contributions or 260 contributions paid or credited, since 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable.  These were &mdash; national health insurance, widows and orphans pensions and unemployment insurance contributions.  These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the scheme under which they were paid.</P>

      <P>Applicants for unemployment payments are required to prove that they are available for employment.  Unemployment <Col N="459" /> is proved by signing the unemployed register and the person making a declaration to the effect that they were unemployed and available for work in respect of any day for which a payment is being claimed.</P>
      <P>Part-time firemen are not exempt from this requirement but, having regard to the public service nature of their role with the fire service, a code of practice emerged some years ago whereby attendance at fire drills and the occasional attendance at fires would not be seen as precluding availability for employment. This practice reflected the concessions afforded by employers to employees who were part-time members of the fire service.</P>
      <P>A number of part-time firemen are virtually full-time employees with annual earnings in many cases in excess of £10,000 and in some instances as high as £18,000.  The current practice whereby firemen have such earnings and claim full unemployment payments is inequitable compared with the position of other unemployed people.  The issue is currently being examined in the context of a review of the position of part-time firemen.</P>

      <P>The Free Travel Companion Pass, which I introduced in 1990, is aimed primarily at incapacitated people who are unable to travel alone and who would otherwise be unable to benefit under the Free Travel Scheme.  It is a special version of the standard travel pass which enables a <Col N="460" /> companion to travel free with the passholder.</P>
      <P>Free Travel Companion Passes are available to people in receipt of a Blind Person's Pension from my Department and to certain other people who are currently, or who were previously, in receipt of a Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance from the Health Board.

      <P>It is not true to say that pensioners who become blind cannot qualify for the Companion Pass.

      <P>Where an applicant for unemployment assistance is involved in self-employment the procedure is to use the income from the preceding year as a starting point and to update this in the light of current and any expected changes in the year ahead.  Each assessment involving self-employment is thus fully consistent with the expected out-turn at the date it is carried out.  If there are unexpected <Col N="461" /> developments which would render the assessment inaccurate then it can be reviewed and these exceptional factors taken into account.

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme since 3 December 1985.  She is also in receipt of invalidity pension at the rate of £85.80 a week.</P>
      <P>Her disablement benefit which was at the rate appropriate to an assessment of 40 per cent was payable up to 27 May 1993.  The outcome of the examination which was carried out by a medical referee on 30 April 1993 has now been reviewed by the medical adviser.  In view of the circumstances, it has been decided that the level of assessment which applied up to 27 May 1993 should continue to stand pending further review.  Payment of disablement benefit at the weekly rate of £31.40 is accordingly being restored from 28 May 1993.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be <Col N="465" /> aware, centralised price control under the Prices Acts generally ceased in 1986. The emphasis of the Government is on the development of competition in every sector of enterprise and encouraging consumer awareness of prices.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concern is expressed from time to time about the pricing of soft drinks sold by publicans.  However, in the absence of official information, I am not in a position to offer meaningful comment on profit margins or prices charged.  Given the wide availability of soft drinks in various outlets, I believe that there is every opportunity for concerned consumers to satisfy their requirements by vigorously exercising choice and supporting those outlets whose price fairly reflects the products and services which they provide.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that, pursuant to retail prices display Orders in 1976 and 1984 (S.I. 146 of 1976 and S.I. 213 of 1984), persons selling non-alcoholic beverages in licensed premises and catering establishments are required to display their retail prices in a specified manner. The Director of Consumer Affairs is charged with the enforcement of these Orders.</P>

      <P>Under the Copyright Act, 1963, songwriters and other owners of rights in musical works, records, or broadcasts have rights relating to the <Col N="466" /> public performance of their works.  These rights are enshrined in the Act which gives effect to the international copyright Conventions to which Ireland is a party, notably the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works, and the Rome Convention for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations. Copyright law is also governed by our EC commitments in this area.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to royalties for public performances of material covered by copyright is therefore a normal legal entitlement of rightowners.  The fact that RTE may have paid the rightowners for the right to broadcast material does not absolve a third party from the obligation to pay in respect of non-private use of broadcast material.</P>
      <P>Significant developments in the copyright area, at international and EC level as well as here in Ireland, require a review of the Copyright Act, 1963.  It is my intention, as I announced earlier this week, to carry out such a review.  My aim is to seek the correct balance between the protection of copyright owners and the users of copyright material.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Deputy O'Keeffe on 2 March, I am extremely concerned with the emergence over the last year of the practice of having secret holds on fishing vessels.  The Naval Service have detected 14 such cases in the last seven months.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Department of Foreign Affairs has conveyed our serious concern at this development to the appropriate authorities in both the UK and Spain, has asked that the practice be investigated as a matter of urgency and that appropriate action be taken to eliminate it in so far as vessels on their respective registers may be concerned.  In addition, the matter has been brought to the attention of the European Commission. I propose also to raise this issue at the next Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting in June.</P>
      <P>Pending a response from the Spanish and UK authorities, may I assure the Deputy that, on checking the capacity plans of vessels detained, the Naval Service will continue to exercise the maximum vigilance so as to detect and deter those engaging in this practice.</P>

      <Quest>the number of occasions within the past 12 months in which the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Service had to seek the assistance of RAF aircraft; the implications, if any, there are for the search and rescue service following the decision to close a number of RAF installations, including RAF Brawdy; and if he will make a statement, on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In the twelve months from May, 1992 to April, 1993, assistance was provided by the RAF in the Irish search and rescue region on one occasion.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that since the Department's Sikorsky helicopter came into service in July 1991, it has provided assistance on fifteen occasions to the UK authorities.  It is gratifying to have the resources to reciprocate the assistance we have so readily received in the past from the United Kingdom.  This mutual co-operation will continue.</P>
      <P>On 21 October, 1992, the United Kingdom Government announced revised RAF search and rescue coverage arrangements which will begin to take effect in April 1994.  These will put higher capacity faster helicopters into service and involve closure of basis including RAF Brawdy in South Wales, from where 24-hours Sea King helicopter coverage will be transfered to RAF Chivenor in Devon.</P>
      <P>The Department has an observer on the UK Search and Rescue Committee, which brings together representatives of all the main British search and rescue agencies, including the RAF.  We were aware that the provision of RAF search and rescue helicopters was being reviewed.  Prior notification of the proposed changes was conveyed through the usual inter-Governmental channels.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the proposed redeployment of UK resources has no adverse implications for search and rescue coverage in Irish waters.</P>

The callout-times for SAR helicopters are fully in line with accepted international standards which are airborne is not more than 15 minutes from 0730 to 2100 hours and not more than 45 minutes from 2100 to 0730 hours.</P>

      <P>The main focus of the document is on the fragmentation among fishing industry organisations and in the main is addressed at members of industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless the analysis in the document accords in many respects with my impressions of the structure of industry representation.  Of course the organisation of the industry is, a matter for <Col N="472" /> the industry itself.  I have no wish to get involved in the internal affairs of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It seems clear, however, that it may be worthwhile at this stage to review the representation structures.  My good offices would be available to assist in that regard.  Indeed, I would be open to consider suggestions, including the possibility of initial support which would assist in the creation of new structures.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of all elements of the fishing industry, including the Department of the Marine and the various State agencies involved, that a vibrant, integrated and professional industry representative structure be developed.</P>
    <P>The document also makes some interesting comments on the State's administrative structure and relationships with the fishing industry.  Again, these comments strike some chords with my own thinking.  I will be reflecting further on them.  It may be that a fundamental review is called for but our assessment of the factors involved is not sufficiently advanced at this stage to reach definitive conclusions in the matter.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the payment of health contributions.  The fact that health contributions are not deducted from social welfare pensions does not mean that all the pensioners concerned are exempted from the payment of health contributions.  Pensioners, other than widows who have income on top of their pensions may be liable for health contributions on that income.  I do not consider that the income of all pensioners should be exempted from liability for health contributions as the income in some cases could be quite substantial and this would give rise to inequities.</P>

      <P>This patient is on the urgent out-patient waiting list for assessment in respect of a cataract operation at University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel that his condition has deteriorated, he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of his case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, yesterday I launched the £20 million major action programme on hospital in-patient waiting lists which is specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  These include orthopaedics hip replacement and other procedures; ophthalmology, cataracts and other procedures; ear, nose, and throat; cardiac surgery, by-pass operations; vascular surgery, varicose veins; and plastic surgery.</P>
      <P>The overall aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these particular specialities and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  In the case of cataract operations for adults, the target set for additional cataract operation is greater than the number of persons on waiting lists for more than a year.</P>
