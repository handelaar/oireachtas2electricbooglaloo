      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3 and 4.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 3 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) the opening speech of the Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 6.45 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding 15 minutes. 2.  In the case of the resumed debate on No. 4, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes. 3.  Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 9, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I propose that we do not have the budget debate as the next <Col N="1314" /> item of business after the Criminal Justice Bill and that the Order be amended to eliminate reference to No. 4.  The House should as its next business discuss the situation in Aer Lingus.  We need to know what exactly is the position of the Minister and the Government in this matter. Have they handed over entire responsibility to one individual?  I propose an amendment to Standing Orders to delete the reference to No. 4 and to substitute a debate on Aer Lingus.  I hope the Government will agree to such an amendment. I would point out that if there is no business ordered for Friday the Government could certainly take this debate on that day if not today.</P>

The Government has no objection whatsoever to having a debate on this matter at the earliest possible moment.

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the House for accommodating the Government in its anxiety to bring forward this legislation as a matter of extreme urgency.  It is a comparatively short Bill, which has three main objectives. It will enable unduly lenient sentences to be reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal at the instance of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It will place an obligation on sentencing courts to take into account the effect a sexual or violent crime has had on the victim.  It will authorise criminal courts to require offenders to pay compensation to their victims for any injury or loss.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, a Bill to this effect was introduced last autumn in the wake of public concern about the apparent leniency shown in a particular case of rape.  It lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  This Bill includes some amendments to which I shall refer later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am introducing the Bill in an atmosphere that regrettably is very much akin to that which prevailed when the 1992 Bill was published.  Indeed, public concern about the absence of any provision for review of lenient sentences is even greater than it was then.  I do not propose to refer now to the case which has given rise to that concern except to say that yesterday I had a lengthy meeting with the victim and her mother.  Her greatest <Col N="1319" /> wish now is to be left alone to get on with her and her son's life.  All of us both inside and outside the House should respect her wishes.  It would be inappropriate for me as Minister for Justice to comment further on the case, but I have a responsibility which I share with the Judiciary to ensure that respect for the law and its institutions is not diminished. I will endeavour to fulfil my share of that responsibility by promoting legislation such as this Bill and other Bills in the criminal justice area to which the Government is committed.</P>
    <P>Since the events of last autumn it has become more and more the practice for sentencing courts to inquire into the effects of the crime on the victim and to explain any circumstances that would justify what otherwise might appear to be undue leniency.  The occasional exceptions should not be allowed to obscure that very welcome development.  I hope it will continue and be reinforced by the provisions of the Bill.  If so, the need to review unduly lenient sentences will seldom arise.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise the importance of the change in the law being made by the Bill in this respect.  It is true that at present the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal to the Supreme Court against a sentence imposed by the Central Criminal Court, but that right has never been exercised.  The long-established tradition has been that a sentence imposed by a criminal court cannot be disturbed except through an appeal by the convicted person.  That tradition is based on considerations of fairness to the accused, who is entitled to be assured that the sentence imposed will not be disturbed except for serious, compelling reasons, and also on a reluctance to intervene in an area of judicial responsibility. While therefore the Bill will allow certain sentences to be reviewed, the review will be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions, an independent authority, and will be carried out by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>The fact is that sentencing is not an exact science.  There can be an enormous <Col N="1320" /> variation in the circumstances in which an offence is committed and in the effect it has on the victim.  The sentencing judge must take into account any mitigating circumstances such as a plea of guilty, the offender's age and mental capacity, the possibility of rehabilitation and so on. The judge must reflect society's abhorrence of particular offences and bear in mind the need to deter others who may be minded to commit them.</P>
    <P>That is why it is not, and never will be, possible &mdash; or even desirable &mdash; to have uniformity in sentencing.  But what is possible and desirable is to achieve a reasonable measure of consistency.  By and large the courts have handled this difficult task with reasonable success and it is only in exceptional cases that public concern has been voiced.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the aim of seeking a measure of consistency, the Courts Act of 1961 empowered the President of the District Court to call meetings of district judges.  Those meetings take place at least twice a year.  There is no such provision as regards other courts, but the judges of those courts do in fact meet regularly for this purpose.  In doing so they have my full support.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that the powers of review which the Bill proposes to confer will need to be exercised frequently.  The Bill is concerned only with unduly &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;unduly&rdquo;&mdash; lenient sentences. In other words, before a question of review arises, the sentence in question must be seriously out of line with what a judge who had taken all relevant factors into account could reasonably have imposed.  As I see it, it is not a question of asking the Court of Criminal Appeal to review, say, a two-year sentence when it might be thought that a sentence of three years would have been appropriate. The trial judge would have to have made a serious error, a serious breach of accepted principles of sentencing.  That is a correct balance, both in the interests of the public and those of the offender.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provisions. Section 1 makes it clear that the Bill is not confined to reviewing sentences of imprisonment that are considered unduly <Col N="1321" /> lenient.  Orders such as probation or community service orders are covered.  So are orders postponing sentence, unless, of course, the object of the postponement is to obtain medical, psychiatric or probation officer reports for sentencing purposes. The Bill does not apply to sentences of detention required to be passed by law on accused persons found to be insane either during the court proceedings or at the time the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>The sentences that can be reviewed under the Bill are those imposed on conviction on indictment or on persons who have pleaded guilty in the District Court to serious offences and have been sent forward for sentence to the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Section 1 also provides that the Bill will not apply to sentences imposed on persons convicted before it comes into force.  To do otherwise would be unfair to the convicted persons concerned and would almost certainly be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 4 deal with the procedure for initiating a review.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has 28 days after a sentence is imposed to decide whether to ask the Court of Criminal Appeal to review it.  It is essential that this limit should not be so short that the Director would not have enough time to consider the matter thoroughly.  On the other hand, it would not be right that a convicted person, whose sentence may have been suspended, should be kept too long in a state of uncertainty as to whether or not the sentence will be reviewed, with the prospect of having to face a custodial sentence ultimately.  The period of 28 days in section 2 meets both those criteria.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court where it can be certified that a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved and that such an appeal is desirable in the public interest. As in the case of appeals from other decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the certificate can be given by that court or by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I <Col N="1322" /> would not expect that there would be much recourse to this provision, as a review of sentencing would be unlikely to involve any disputed questions of law. Legal aid will be provided for the convicted person for the review and for any appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 5 enunciates an important principle to be followed when courts are sentencing for sexual offences or for offences involving violence or the threat of violence. That is, that the court should take into account the effect, including any long term effect, of the offence on the victim.  At present, when an accused pleads guilty in such cases, the victim does not have to give evidence and there is no provision for formally bringing this aspect to the court's attention.  Even where a trial does take place and the victim testifies, evidence of the effect of the offence on the victim is not admissible because it is irrelevant to the issue as to whether the accused committed the offence charged.  Section 5 extends to sentences in both guilty and not guilty cases.  This provision will lead to fewer sentences having to be reviewed under the Bill by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>People have asked how the effect on the victim is to be brought to the attention of the court.  The answer is that it will be a matter for the court to decide in each case how it will discharge the obligation of informing itself.  The section says that the court may, if necessary, receive representations or submissions on the issue.  No doubt in many cases a report by a doctor will suffice.  In other cases a court may look for evidence from the victim's family and possibly from the victim though, in the latter case, I would imagine that the court would try to avoid inflicting on her or him the trauma of giving evidence, or further evidence, as the case may be, or the court may wish to have a report from the gardaí, a social worker familiar with the case or a psychiatrist. It will be entirely a matter for the sentencing court.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions for offenders to compensate their victims. Section 6 extends the present powers of criminal courts to award compensation <Col N="1323" /> to all cases where the victim has been caused personal injury or loss.  At present that power is available only in cases of criminal damage though, as a practical measure, courts have often had to resort to postponing sentence to enable compensation to be paid to the victim.  I regard that informal method of providing compensation as quite inadequate and that is why the matter is being put on a proper statutory basis.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should leave to the sentencing court the decision as to whether compensation should be paid, what its amount should be, what the convicted person can afford and so on.  These factors will vary from case to case and the court is in the best position to make an informed judgment on them.  Deputies will see that section 6 provides for a compensation order to be made for any injury or loss unless the court &ldquo;sees reason to the contrary&rdquo;.  In other words, the law will now be such that the making of a compensation order will be the norm rather than the exception.  Of course, if an offender cannot pay anything, that is sufficient reason &ldquo;to the contrary&rdquo;. However, there is provision in the section for payment of the compensation by instalments so that in most cases an offender can reasonably be required to pay an appropriate amount over a period.</P>
    <P>Section 6 does not apply to injuries or losses caused by road accidents by insured drivers who are subsequently prosecuted.  In those cases the victims are compensated by the insurance companies concerned.  But it does apply to injuries or losses caused by uninsured drivers, whether or not compensation is payable by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland or the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  Moreover, if a car is taken without the owner's permission and damaged, it will be presumed for this purpose that the person who took it caused the damage, whether he did so or not, so that he can be made to pay compensation for it.  I think the House will agree that these are reasonable provisions in a situation where uninsured driving and car-taking are all too prevalent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> The section also provides that both the convicted person and the victim will have an equal right to apply to have the compensation order reviewed where there has been a substantial reduction, or increase as the case may be, in the convicted person's means.  There are provisions for an appeal by the convicted person against the compensation order and about the effect on the order of any civil proceedings taken by the victim.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to changes as compared with the 1992 Bill.  The most important of these is section 7.  Under the 1992 Bill compensation was payable by the offender directly to the victim.  If there was default in payment, the victim would have to institute court proceedings to enforce the order.  The House will agree that it would be most undesirable that there should be any further contact between an offender and the victim of the offence, especially in physical or sexual abuse cases and also where payments would be ordered to be made regularly over a period.  That would only serve to increase the trauma the victim would have experienced.  As regards enforcement, I doubt if many victims would in fact be willing to pursue reluctant payers through the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that all payments of compensation are to be made through the local District Court clerk and that it will be the District Court clerk who will, on request, take proceedings to enforce payment under the order in his or her own name.</P>
    <P>A further amendment to the 1992 Bill is contained in section 11.  The background to this section is as follows.  As Deputies are aware, the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, made provision for making it easier for victims of physical or sexual abuse to give evidence.  It did this by allowing evidence to be given through a live televison link at the preliminary examination and enabling a video recording of the evidence to be admissible at the trial.  However, it was suggested recently that a technical amendment may be necessary to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, to remove any doubt as to whether a written deposition should also be taken <Col N="1325" /> in those cases.  That is the effect of section 11.  As Deputies will appreciate a written deposition is unnecessary when a video recording is available.</P>
    <P>I should say that video link equipment has been installed in the Four Courts and a witness room and waiting room have been provided.  I have brought into operation the provisions of the Act allowing evidence to be given by TV link at trials in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court.  When this Bill becomes law, I will bring into operation other provisions so far as they relate to preliminary examinations in the Dublin District Court.</P>
    <P>I propose on Committee Stage to move an amendment which will increase the maximum sentence which may be imposed for incest involving a girl of 15 years or over.  At present, the sentence is seven years, as provided in the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  It is time this limit was increased as it is clearly inadequate to punish serious and repeated instances of this despicable offence.  I tend to the view that the sentence should be of the order of 15 to 20 years.  I should like to hear the views of Deputies on what the new maximum sentence should be.  I can assure the House that those views will be fully taken into account before the amendment is tabled.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be found acceptable in principle by all sides of the House.  I believe its provisions are in accordance with the obligation imposed on the State by Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution, that is, to vindicate by its laws, in the case of injustice done, the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  I wish to assure Deputies that I will be open to any suggestions they may make for the improvement of the Bill during the course of the debate both on this Stage and on Committee Stage.  Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a gabháil leis an Teachtaí ar chuile thaoibh den Teach a thug cúnamh agus a cho-oibrigh linn le go dtógfaimid an Bille tábhactach seo chomh tápa sin inniu, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has been brought before the House today, but I am afraid I have to say that what we are doing today is yet another example of what can best be described as the appalling way in which we deal with parliamentary democracy in this country.  I welcome the Fianna Fáil Party's belated conversion to the need for this legislation.  I cannot but look with a cynical eye at the sudden recognition of the need for speed to address an issue which has been crying out to be addressed for a number of years.  Suffice it to say that when on 8 May my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the then Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, moved a Bill which provided for appeals against unduly lenient sentences &mdash; he sought in that Bill to give powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate such appeals &mdash; it received the same knee-jerk reaction from the Government of the day, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition, which most Opposition Bills get and it voted against it.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Justice, ably supported by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, came into the House and listed a series of spurious objections to that measure and two weeks later, on 16 May 1990, went into the voting lobby and voted down that measure.  If that Bill had been accepted on Second Stage and a constructive Committee Stage debate had been allowed to incorporate amendments which addressed worries Government Deputies had, it would have been law by the summer of 1990, the position which has arisen during the past year and which led to public outcry would not have arisen and Ministers would not have had to go through the charade of having media spotlight meetings with a number of tragic victims of sexual assault to portray a feeling of concern.  If this had been done there would have been absolutely no doubt, in cases where unduly lenient sentences were imposed by the courts, about the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring appeals against those sentences.</P>

      <P>I wish to put in context this belated recognition by Fianna Fáil of the need for action.  I am glad this action is now being taken.  However, the issue which has undermined politics in this country and what has turned this Chamber very often into nothing more than a debating Chamber is that successive Governments have refused to acknowledge that if legislative proposals come from the Opposition side of the House they are worth taking seriously and taken on board.  If a Minister is presented by an Opposition Deputy with legislation which appears to address a problem which needs to be addressed, it should not be seen as a means of politically putting down a Minister.  My experience is that when a Private Members' Bill is published every Minister gets a brief from his civil servants as to what is wrong with it, and most Ministers run with such briefs. Fortunately, on two occasions battles were fought in this House which resulted in two Private Members' Bills in which I was involved being successful.  It is a tragedy that the Bill Fine Gael brought before this House in 1990 to address this issue was not acceptable to the Government and not enacted into law.  If it had been enacted into law the necessary legal mechanisms to address those issues would have been available in the cases which have caused so much concern over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill addresses the issue of unduly lenient sentences and largely incorporates the Fine Gael proposals.  This Bill is initially a product of the sad and tragic <Col N="1328" /> case involving Lavinia Kerwick and the publicity which arose from the decision in that case.  During the summer following that case I again called for legislation in this area and told the then Minister for Justice that if he did not introduce such legislation Fine Gael would again bring a Bill before the House in the autumn to try to achieve what my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, had been unsuccessful in achieving because of the obduracy of the Government.  The Bill to which the Minister referred was an 1992 Bill which was never debated in the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in dealing with the issue of unduly lenient sentences, is addressing a problem which needs to be addressed but is only part of a problem.  What we need is a criminal justice system which is victim orientated.  For far too long the victims of sexual and violent crime have been ignored.  They are seen as sorts of adjuncts to the criminal justice system. They are called to give evidence in court and little regard has been paid in the past to the suffering they have experienced and little support has been made available to them either before or after court proceedings to help them come to terms with the trauma they have suffered.  That trauma is not just the crime of which they are the victim; it is often as traumatic for a victim to appear in court and give evidence in circumstances with which they are unfamiliar as was the original offence to which they were subjected.</P>
    <P>I am calling for a victim orientated system of criminal justice.  We need a charter for the victims of crime which will set out their rights and entitlements.  We need to realise that we have to stop simply paying lip service to the victims of crime.  Greater financial support should be provided to the Irish Association of Victim Support.  This year's budget appears to allocate to the Rape Crisis Centre no larger sum than it received last year.  This centre is crying out for additional funds.  It is not enough to provide for appeals against unduly lenient sentences; there is a need to provide a far greater support base for the organisations which seek to help the victims of serious sexual and other violent crimes.  Within <Col N="1329" /> the last 48 hours the spokesperson for the Rape Crisis Centre highlighted this issue. An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday, 8 March, states that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has accused the Government of hypocrisy in the wake of the Kilkenny incest case and that it was appalled that the centre had not received an increase in funds in the budget.  I similarly accuse the Government of hypocrisy in that while there may be funding it is inadequate.</P>
    <P>When talking about the perpetrators of sexual crime there are two problems which need to be addressed.  The first is to ensure that the sentences imposed reflect the gravity of the crimes committed by the perpetrators.  The second is to ensure that somebody convicted of rape, sexual assault or incest is not a human sexual exocet waiting to be released from gaol to pose a threat to the original victims when he is back in the community.  The former Government reneged on its obligations in respect of that problem.  There was a service in Arbour Hill to deal with the personality problems and psychological difficulties experienced by perpetrators of sexual crime so as to ensure that they would come to terms with the enormity of what they had done and would not pose a threat to the public in general or the specific people who had been their victims once released from prison.  Under the former Government this experimental scheme was brought to a halt.  A similar scheme is not currently in existence. I can remember the then Minister for Justice, Pádraic Flynn, promising the nation on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; that he would tackle this problem.  When I raised the matter by way of Dáil question last October I was told that another committee was looking at the matter.</P>
    <P>In the week that this Government has finally realised the urgent need to bring legislation before this House, it is instructive to refer to a report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> of another case of sexual assault and rape before the Central Criminal Court.  The report states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The absence of treatment and counselling programmes for sex offenders in Irish prisons has been criticised by a Central Criminal Court judge.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood told the court yesterday: &ldquo;Sex offenders are just placed in prison and left to rot.  Then they are tipped out onto the public again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the report, the court was told by a senior probation officer for the Limerick area that the only suitable programme geared to the treatment of sex offenders was at the Gracewell Clinic in Birmingham.  Nowhere in this State do we have any suitable and proper programme for sex offenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this context.  With respect, Sir, you misunderstand what I am saying.  In the context of that case, the trial judge was apparently told that the Government has plans to do something about the area and he greeted that with the same cynicism as most people would by saying he had heard of such Government plans before but that nothing is available and it is an extremely serious predicament.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about addressing the problems encountered by the victims of crime and sexual abuse, it is a matter of immediate necessity to put in place within the prison system a proper programme to counsel and deal with the perpetrators of sexual violence to ensure that on release they will not re-offend.</P>
      <P>Many of us watched with great distress the televised interview conducted last week with the tragic victim of the Kilkenny case.  Some of the things she said have been said by other victims of sexual violence.  I refer particularly to her fear that following the release of her father from prison he would return to persecute her and the fear, shared by her and her mother, deriving from the underlying threat they believed to be there.  Although a term of imprisonment has been imposed in that case and in other cases, the living nightmare of victims of sexual offences is that following the completion of terms of imprisonment the people who assaulted them will one day stand outside their front door and wait for them.  Nobody in this House should fail to acknowledge the reality of that fear.  One of the tragedies is the number of victims of sexual assault who do not report to the Garda or will not go to court because of that fear.  They are afraid that if they give evidence in open court the offender, even if convicted, will one day come back and pose a risk to their life and safety and that they could again be victims of sexual assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill could address that issue, but it does not.  When judges are passing sentence on the perpetrators of sexual or <Col N="1332" /> other types of assault the court should have available powers to make orders injuncting or barring the convicted person from attending at or near the place where the victim resides or works and from making contact of any kind with the victim of the assault.  Such provision is not contained in this Bill.  The court should be given those powers so that the victim of sexual assault will not have to live through a daily nightmare of fear waiting for the release of the offender from prison, facing the prospect of having to take legal action in a different forum to keep the perpetrator of the assault away.  In order to obtain such an injunction the victim would have to relive in court the events which resulted in the imprisonment of the offender.  The courts have not that general power and I believe it should be given to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said a great deal about the courts in the context of consistency of sentences.  I agree that we cannot ensure that exactly the same sentence will be imposed in every case, because there are varying circumstances. There is widespread public concern about lack of consistency, which seems to come to the forefront most often in the area of sexual crimes committed against women. It may be the case that some members of the Judiciary are not always aware of the enormity of being the victim of a sexual crime.  Perhaps in the past the full psychological consequences for the victim have not been fully understood.  I suspect that they are better understood now than they used to be.</P>
    <P>The State plays a rather odd role in Ireland and England in the prosecution of crime.  The role of the State Counsel is to present the evidence to the court to allow the court to determine whether a person is guilty or innocent.  Once the verdict of guilty has been brought in by a jury or determined by a judge, the representative of the State stands back and has no function in asking for a particular sentence to be imposed.  It is for the judge to determine the sentence and he usually does so having heard pleas for mercy on behalf of the perpetrator.  The victim is rarely heard.  On occasions in <Col N="1333" /> this House we are critical of the Judiciary, but when a judge does something worthy of praise it should also be noted.  It was Mr. Justice Budd in the Central Criminal Court who during 1992 started the practice of asking the authorities to make available to him, before handing down sentence, a report as to the impact a sexual or physical assault had had on the victim of a crime.  In the context of this legislation it is intended that that type of information be made available to the court.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at a number of areas.  There is a considerable case to be made for allowing a victim who so wishes to be represented before the court on the issue of sentencing following a conviction, for allowing a victim of sexual assault to have her own lawyer make a plea to the court as to the severity of sentence that should be imposed and make available to the court information about the impact the crime had on the victim.  There would then be what I would describe as an equality of justice.  There would be the plea for mercy, based on the description of the special circumstances attendant on the perpetrator, that is always made on behalf of someone found guilty of a crime to try to get the court to impose a less harsh sentence.  The judge would also hear, very explicitly, the other side &mdash; the plea for a harsh sentence and the reasons it should be imposed.  Then the judge can make a decision.  Too frequently judges find themselves making decisions on sentencing having heard only a plea that a lesser sentence than the maximum be imposed, because the State steps aside at that point.  It may be right that the State should step aside, but it means that the victim's position is unpresented.  I think the victim's position should be presented and that we should look very seriously at providing legal advice to the victims of crime, particularly in the context of sentencing pleas.</P>
    <P>This legislation is also designed to allow for compensation orders to be made.  It was last summer, when the Lavinia Kerwick case got so much publicity, that I sought such legislation and, again, this is why the 1992 Bill was published. <Col N="1334" /> I can recall, Sir, that when the Criminal Damage Bill was before this House amendments were proposed to that Bill by my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, in which he sought to allow the courts to provide for compensation for the victims of assault who had suffered injury and, again, those amendments were voted down by the Government. The view was that in criminal trials the courts should be allowed to order compensation in the context of property damage but not when people were damaged, that that should be left to a separate civil action.</P>
    <P>Again this is an example of an Opposition party bring forward a constructive proposal about which there should have been no political conflict, about which there is no ideological divide in this House; but there was a policy decision made by the last Government that there should not be provision made at the end of criminal trials for compensation orders in favour of the victims of violence.  That was a political policy decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, Sir, that that political decision is now reversed, but it should not have required the Lavinia Kerwick case for this legislation to be recognised as necessary.</P>
      <P>That is only a quarter of the problem.  I have said that we need a victim orientated system of criminal justice and the Minister quite correctly &mdash; and I agree with what she said &mdash; made the point that there will be cases where clearly compensation orders can be made but that there will be many cases where compensation orders cannot be made because the perpetrators of crimes of violence will not have funds, will not have assets and will not be people of means.  If we are to have a victim orientated criminal justice system we should restore to the criminal injuries compensation board powers to make compensation awards in favour of the victims of the violent crimes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that is badly needed.  It is my view, and has always been my view, that it was a mistake to take away that power from the criminal injuries compensation board when it originally had it; and it is a mistake that should be corrected.  The victim support groups and a number of other groups have all asked that the criminal injuries compensation board be again empowered to make compensation awards in favour of the victims of crime. I would take the view that where the perpetrator of a crime clearly has sufficient funds to be able to pay compensation, that is where the prime responsibility should lie.  However, if the perpetrator does not have funds then, for a very small financial allocation in the Government Estimates, we could again empower the criminal injuries compensation board to make such compensation orders.  Who in the country would argue that the victim of the Kilkenny case or any other victim of sexual or violent assault should not be entitled to receive such compensation?  I do not believe there is anybody who would disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say we need a victim orientated system of criminal justice I mean that we need to recognise, first, the need for a charter for the victims of crime; second, the need to put in place proper provisions to ensure the victims of sexual and violent assaults can receive compensation payments; and third, the need for a proper support system to ensure that those who are victims are given the social supports and help they require.  We need to put in place a system that will ensure that a victim who gives evidence in court does not become a victim again at a later stage when the person convicted of the offence is released.  We need to ensure that those who give evidence on behalf of the State in cases of sexual and violent assault do not themselves become the victims of fear, that they do not become people hidden in their homes behind drawn curtains, afraid to go out on the streets the day after the person convicted of assaulting them is released from jail.  We must release the victims of crime from the fear <Col N="1336" /> of being again attacked by the perpetrators of crime.  We must support more seriously groups like the Irish Association of Victim Support and the rape crisis centres.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is being taken today and that we are taking Committee and remaining Stages tomorrow. I hope the Minister will participate in that.  I look forward to her reaction to constructive criticisms that might be made of this Bill by the Opposition.

      <P>This Bill does not address the provisions contained in the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, under which the maximum sentence that can be imposed for incest is seven years.  It was that issue that gave rise to so much controversy in the Kilkenny case of last week.  In response to that case and the legal anomaly contained in the 1908 Act, I, on behalf of Fine Gael, published a Private Members' Bill on Wednesday last which sought to amend the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, and to extend the maximum sentence that the courts could impose for the offence of incest from seven years to 20 years.  It was after that Bill was published that the Government indicated that it now recognised the need to provide for a longer sentence.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that she is prepared to amend this Bill to make that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my view, Sir, in the light of the horrors that unfolded in the Kilkenny case, that judges should be given a very broad and wide discussion in the context of imposing very harsh sentences in cases that warrant them.  It would be my view that, except in very exceptional circumstances, the crime of incest should always warrant the imposition of a very harsh sentence, because it is a particularly evil crime.  It is particularly evil because the victims of that crime are the <Col N="1337" /> daughters of the perpetrators of that crime.  The victims are very often under the control of the perpetrators and the person who perpetrates it is abusing a parental responsibility in a manner that to many of us in this House is almost unintelligible.  People put in a position of trust who so abuse that trust very often, effectively, permanently destroy the future lives of their own children.</P>
    <P>As a public representative and also wearing my hat as an occasional lawyer working in the area of family law, I have frequently met adults whose marriages and personal relationships have been a disaster because of sexual crimes such as incest perpetrated against them in their childhood, emerging to create in adult life enormous psychological problems and mental trauma.  Very often the victims of incest have their lives destroyed, they never come to terms with what happened to them in their childhood.  In my view the maximum sentence should be increased to a period of up to 20 years. That would not mean that a 20 year sentence would be imposed in every case.  If this matter was not being addressed in the House today and tomorrow the Fine Gael Party would have, at the first available opportunity, introduced and sought to have enacted its Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>Due to the enormity of the issue, the seriousness attached to it, and because it is my understanding that there are other cases of this nature pending which may come before the courts in the next 12 to 18 months, we should make sure that this legislation is put on the Statute Book rapidly.  I am concerned that the Bill will not be taken in the Seanad next week because, as I understand it, the Seanad will not be sitting.  I am concerned that the Bill, having gone through the House, should not sit on a shelf for weeks before becoming law.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will acknowledge that the Bill published last week on behalf of Fine Gael was one that sought to address in a very speedy way an issue of great seriousness.  Certainly, it is the hope of Fine Gael that the Minister will take <Col N="1338" /> on board one suggestion about the maximum sentence.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the manner in which the Bill has come before the House, and the circumstances of the two cases to which I referred, many Irish women will be watching the way the House operates today.  Many men, too, who are equally concerned about this issue, will follow today's proceedings closely.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are dealing with only part of the problem.  All the other issues to which I referred need to be examined also.  Within our prison service we need to put in place the kind of treatment programme that is so badly needed and that the Judiciary cries out for.  On occasions we criticise the Judiciary for mistakes made but too often we are blind to the failures of the Government that make the work of the Judiciary difficult and very often make the position of the victims of crime impossible.</P>
    <P>The Bill has several technical problems and in the time available to debate Second Stage I have not had an opportunity to deal with those problems in detail.  I look forward to an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward so soon in the life of this Dáil.  I was not as keen as the Minister to have the Bill debated at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon but I am pleased that the debate is taking place today and that all Stages of the Bill will pass tomorrow.  In principle, I do not agree to the practice of rushing through legislation in that way because it has been my experience that legislation not adequately dealt with in the House, particularly on occasions when there is no gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage, often comes back in a short time to be changed.  The Minister, and the Minister of State, acknowledge that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the three main provisions of the Bill: first, to give the Director of Public Prosecutions the power to appeal what are regarded as unduly lenient sentences; second, to have the court take into account the effects, long term and <Col N="1339" /> otherwise, on the victim of a crime that relates to a sexual offence or violence or the threat of violence and, third, the payment of compensation.  Those provisions are a great addition to our criminal law.</P>
    <P>I am rather amused at the content of the Bill because of the attitude by the Government to another Bill before the House.  This Bill mirrors almost identically the provisions of the British Criminal Justice Act, 1988.  Other than the power being given to the Attorney General in Britain, as opposed to the Director of Public Prosecutions here, section 36 of the British Criminal Justice Act, 1988, is reproduced almost entirely in this Bill.  I express amusement at this because one of the Government criticisms of my Bill is that since it comes from the British Public Order Act it is a bit exaggerated, rather unnecessary and emergency type legislation.  Legislation passed in Britain is not necessarily wrong and, as Ireland does have a similar judicial system to that of Britain, and as most of our criminal law was on the Statute Book before Independence, it is appropriate that from time to time we take on board many of the very fine provisions implemented in Britain, often 20 years before being implemented here.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that when a case that could be regarded as exceptional and sensational comes to public attention there is often an automatic demand from the public, and the House, for new laws, new procedures or a new regime to put them right but after a couple of months everything goes back to normal and the need for change is almost forgotten until a similar case is brought to our attention. We can all recall cases, whether it is the case of Anne Lovett, the Lavinia Kerwick case of last year or the recent one.  They all provoked a great sense of public outrage. As a people we are compassionate and abhor such crimes.  On the one hand we feel a sense of guilt and on the other hand we feel hopeless and powerless to do anything about them.  Most ordinary people want to do something about those crimes and want to ensure that our justice <Col N="1340" /> system has in place the mechanism necessary to deal with them.</P>
    <P>A two-pronged approach needs to be taken in dealing with such crimes.  First, we need to deal with them in a fire brigade way by amending the legislation to make sure it is appropriate and that a just sentence can be imposed on those guilty of serious offences.  That is extremely important.  It is equally important to take a slow, more painful and longer term view about these matters in our society. They are very common and for so long have been swept under the carpet.  People have been frightened to talk about these matters even to their nearest and dearest. Four or five years ago a friend, someone I have known for many years, told me she was the victim of incest.  I regard that woman as a close personal friend yet it was only in recent years &mdash; she is now in her late thirties &mdash; that she felt able to tell me of her trauma.  She felt she could not tell anyone about this matter.  Her husband did not know about it nor did her close friends who had grown up with her through their teenage years.  I found it astonishing that my friend, a very intelligent and well educated woman, was for many years the victim of dreadful incest by her father.</P>
    <P>We need to have put in place a mechanism that gives confidence, care and support to women like my friend and people who come from probably more deprived circumstances than her and who might be further removed from the realm from which help could be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The most important person in all these matters is not necessarily the guilty party &mdash; and I shall deal later with the way society must deal with those who are guilty &mdash; but is, as Deputy Shatter said, the victim of the crime.  Unfortunately, because of the adversarial nature of our criminal justice system the victim is placed very much at the bottom of the heap.  All too rarely are the victim's concerns and perception and the effects on the victim taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to put to the Minister, whom I recognise as a reforming Minister and one who has for many years had a deep concern about these issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> The Minister was concerned about these issues a long time before she was appointed to the Department of Justice and I am delighted she has responsibility for that Department.  My suggestion is that we put in place a mechanism composed of a combination of the services of the Garda Síochána and the caring services of social workers and psychologists.  That mechanism could be an informal, <i>ad hoc</i> group, but it should be a well-known facility that people would have confidence to call on, knowing that they would receive the protection of the service, the assistance required and, if necessary, be taken out of dreadful circumstances. I can think of no better person to be involved in this service than Garda Agnes Reddy.  Were it not for her this legislation might not be before the House today.  Garda Reddy was the garda responsible for bringing both the Lavinia Kerwick case and the more recent case before the courts.  I complimented Garda Reddy last week and I know that the Minister, and others, have done so. We cannot do that often enough.  More fine examples such as those given by Garda Reddy are needed.  It is interesting that it was a women garda who took the time and patience to gain the confidence of the victim to tell her story so that a case could be prepared, something that is not easy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the media on bringing these cases to our attention.  The media need to tread very carefully when dealing with the victims of crime.  Most victims have never been in the public eye.  While the anonymity of victims may be protected in a national sense it must be recognised that we live in a small rural society.  It is extremely important that their anonymity be protected because most victims have long lives ahead of them and a most awful ordeal to live with.</P>
    <P>We must make sure that, in trying to inform the public, the first duty of any civilised and decent press is not to infringe the privacy of the victim to such an extent that people in bars, clubs and other places around the country know her identity.  Perhaps before the responsible media contact the victim they would talk <Col N="1342" /> to the member of the Garda Síochána handling the case, a social worker, or take independent advice, because they, too, have a big responsibility.</P>
    <P>Many people who come through ordeals like that are so shell-shocked immediately after the case that perhaps they make decisions in terms of publicity which they may regret aferwards, even though they do an enormous service to us and the public at large and help the process for reform and judicial fairness. In regard to the media there is a tendency &mdash; sometimes the only sin relates to sex &mdash; to think that the only crime relates to rape, incest or matters to do with sex. However, there are many other cases in which an inappropriate sentence is imposed and they do not receive the same kind of attention which is given to cases concerned with sex.  Recently two persons were convicted of stealing £100,000 and the sentence was something in the region of six months, which I thought was very lenient.  The Fr. Molloy case is another example.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see that the ICA believe that about one-third of women in Ireland have been the victim of incest.  If that is true it is horrific, indeed it is a problem of devastating proportions and amending the law will not deal with the social problems.  We need to put in place mechanisms through the educational system, health services and the other normal support services in the community to make sure that we deal adequately with the problem by way of the resources we give to solving it. Deputy Shattter referred to the Rape Crisis Centre.  I received a copy of the press release and they are appalled and feel there is a certain sense of dishonesty in showing concern on the one hand at particular sentencing and not giving enough resources on the other to those who do outstanding work to help the victims of these crimes.</P>
    <P>In any decent system of justice it is very important to take great care in dealing with the people convicted of serious crimes.  In various societies value systems are different and people have a different way of dealing with the victims of crime. <Col N="1343" /> Sometimes we look at communities in other countries and are appalled at how they deal with victims of a particular crime.  That is why I am happy that the Government of which I was a member got rid of capital punishment although most of us acknowledged it would never be used.  As a penalty it was inappropriate and in a civilised society one does not use penalties of that kind.  It is terribly important, particularly when there is a great demand, which I share and will push forward as much as I can, for tougher sentences, to deal with the many loopholes in the law and to codify and update it.  The law is so out of date, particularly when there is a demand for tough sentences; we must make it easier to get convictions and improve the mechanisms available to the Garda Síochána to help in the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>However, it is equally important to have the proper safeguards in place to deal first with those in custody, those who are being questioned by the Garda Síochána, those serving a sentence in our penal system and, of course, the same applies to those who have suffered a miscarriage of justice.  I note the commmitment in the Programme for Government to put the payment of compensation on a statutory basis.  We badly need to implement the recommendations of the Martin Committee in 1990.  The committee inquired into certain aspects of criminal procedure because science is not perfect and forensic science tests change over time.  Advances in technology can cast a doubt on a conviction in subsequent years and we do not have the mechanism in our system of justice or a statutory basis for the payment of compensation to redress the wrong.  As the Martin Committee recommended, we need to put a statutory body in place to review sentences where there is a doubt regarding a miscarriage of justice.  It is extremely important to do that at the same time as we are strengthening the law to make it easier to get convictions because the two go hand in hand.  It is terribly important for the protection of civil liberties and for the success of our criminal justice system that people have <Col N="1344" /> faith in it and particularly that convicted persons are dealt with in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she did not envisage that the appeals system will be used much.  I share her view because, generally speaking, the trial judge is the person who has listened to the facts and is in the best position to impose a sentence. However, I am extremely displeased with the sentence imposed in this particular case.  I do not like commenting on judicial sentencing and it is usually frowned upon by members of the Judiciary but it seems that we we do not need to change the law &mdash; and we did not need to in that case &mdash; to have a higher sentence imposed.  That seems to be the pattern in so many other cases and it is unfortunate that in the area of sex-related offences and family law there is a reluctance on the part of the Judiciary to impose what I would regard as appropriate sentences.  There seems to be a view that these cases are in some sense beneath the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>We need proper training for judges. We have often heard criticism that judges come from a certain background.  One would prefer if they came from a broader background but it is inevitable given what is required to be a judge and that they must have legal expertise and a legal background, that they will come from a particular background, just as politicians generally come from a certain background. It is important that there be training for members of the Judiciary, that younger members are appointed and in particular that more women are appointed.  I am pleased that there is a woman member of the Supreme Court and a woman member of the High Court but there are still far too few.  I want the Government to improve the ratio of women appointed to senior positions in the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Director of Public Prosecutions has at present, in relation to appeals, powers which have never been exercised and we cannot guarantee that he will ever exercise the powers given to him in this legislation on more than very rare occasions.  We need to say that because there will be a tendency <Col N="1345" /> to assume, when this legislation is on the Statute Book, that suddenly all will be well and that any time there is a perceived lenient approach &mdash; perceived by members of the public or politicians &mdash; the DPP will rush in and appeal a particular sentence.  We must be aware of the fact that that will not happen.  It may well be years before the Director of Public Prosecutions ever seeks to exercise the new powers we propose to confer on him under this legislation.  I share the Minister's view that the Director of Public Prosecutions is the appropriate person.  I say this because of the independent mechanism by which he is appointed in the 1974 Act.  He is perceived to be more independent than the Attorney General because of the association between the Attorney General and a new Government coming into office.  I do not want to question the integrity or independence of the Attorney General but in perception terms and in reality the Director of Public Prosecutions is the more appropriate person.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister intends to amend the 1974 Act to make it an offence to communicate with the Attorney General.  The 1974 Act makes it an offence to communicate with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General and so on in relation to taking a prosecution.  This will now be amended in relation to taking an appeal.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify what is meant by &ldquo;communication&rdquo;.  It does not say whether the communication will be by letter or telephone call.  Would it be an offence if a Member of this House urged the DPP to appeal a case?  Would it be an offence for an editor of a newspaper to suggest that because it was perceived that a sentence was unduly lenient the Director of Public Prosecutions should seek an appeal?  Would that be considered an inappropriate communication? Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the need to restore the element of pain and suffering when the criminal injuries compensation board are considering a case.  I share that view.  I know it is expensive, but it is <Col N="1346" /> awful that somebody can be maimed or badly injured as a result of an attack on the person and not be able to get compensation.  That is an awful reflection on our society.  I suggest that one way of funding such a system of compensation would be to increase fines.  The Minister has the power to reduce fines.  When people find it difficult to pay a fine they ask their public representative to intercede with the Minister to have it reduced. I would prefer if the Minister did not have the power to reduce the fine; indeed she might even prefer not to have it herself. Having said that, however, I believe we could fund from increased fines the compensation payable to those who have suffered pain and suffering as a result of a criminal injury.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for our comments on the appropriate sentencing in cases of incest.  I have mixed views on the length of sentences of five, ten, 15, 20 or 25 years, as I just do not know what is appropriate. I accept the Minister will make her judgment on the basis of the advice she receives.  However, I am inclined to accept the view Deputy Shatter expressed, but I do not favour mandatory sentencing for cases of rape or incest. If it were introduced there would be a tendency to impose no sentence at all. As the Minister rightly said in her speech, circumstances are different and there is a difference when somebody pleads guilty. Different circumstances have to be taken into account.  That is what our system of justice is about and that is why we have trial by judge and jury so that ordinary people are able to adjudicate in these matters.  I say that in the knowledge that many women's organisations feel compelled to call for mandatory sentences because the sentencing policy seems to be so inconsistent.  In my view, if we had mandatory sentencing in such cases there would be a tendency to lessen the charge of rape, for example, to a more minor charge in order that the mandatory sentence would not have to be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is not easy to get uniformity in sentencing but that what we need is consistency.  I certainly share her view.  We all know of judges &mdash; this <Col N="1347" /> happened more so in the past &mdash; who were associated with handing down tough sentences.  We know that counsel tell their clients that if they are before judge X they will get such a sentence but if they are before somebody else they will get an easier passage.  I share the Minister's view on consistency between members of the Judiciary, in so far as that is practically and physically possible.  I know that everybody is different, but it seems to me that there are enormous differences sometimes between the sentences imposed by one member of the Judiciary and another.  I know the Minister has to be careful not to jeopardise in any way the independence of the Judiciary; but if we can find a formal mechanism to make it known to the presidents of the various courts that we want to see consistency in sentencing by different judges, we should seek it.  I think a judicial system that is very much dependent on which judge you get is one that brings the system into disrepute.  The well known hardened criminals around town can tell you off the top of their heads which judge they should go before.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of our adversarial system of justice the quality of justice is very dependent on the quality of representation.  Without casting any reflection on members of the legal profession, let me say that all too often the best representation is given to those who can pay the biggest money, who can employ their own counsel.  Because of the scale of fees &mdash; and I hate to say this because the fees are always large &mdash; and the discrepancy between what the private practitioner may be paid and the fees paid by the State through the legal aid scheme to the prosecuting counsel, I am told that many of our leading counsel will never take legal aid cases.  Sometimes, therefore, the representation available is not of the same quality and the chance of getting a prosecution in some cases &mdash; this often applies in cases of rape and so on &mdash; and an appropriate sentence or a verdict of innocence or guilt does not arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that compensation can be paid to the victim, but <Col N="1348" /> I think it is important that this decision is kept from the jury.  The essential role of the jury is to decide on the innocence or guilt of the accused.  If the element of compensation comes before the jury and is a big feature of the trial, I believe the jury would be inclined to look more to the sympathy they have for the victim rather than the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It is important to realise that the essential duty of the jury is to decide on the guilt or innocence of the accused.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether cases that are dismissed on a technicality &mdash; unfortunately there are all too many &mdash; may be appealed?  Under the Bill as proposed it is only where a penalty, either a sentence or a fine, is imposed that there can be an appeal.  I know we have procedures to appeal on a point of law, but I am not talking about appeal procedures on a point of law.  What provisions exist to appeal cases that are dismissed on a technicality other than the existing provisions available to the Director of Public Prosecutions?  This Bill does not provide any new powers for the Director of Public Prosecutions in those cases.  Will the Minister clarify that point for me, please?</P>
    <P>So many areas of criminal law need reform that I worry when a Bill of this kind is enacted and becomes law that it will take a long number of years before major legislation in this regard comes before the House.  I wish to encourage the Minister and the Minister of State to take on board the new procedure to be put in place by the establishment of the new committee to deal with legal affairs and security related matters and to bring as many Bills as possible before the House and before that committee.  I encourage the Minister to bring such Bills before the committee in framework form so that such Bills can be improved upon by the committee rather than having to deal with the A to Z of what should happen.  I know Ministers are never very keen to do that, but if we have to wait for the A to Z we will be waiting for donkey's years.</P>
    <P>If the committees are to be meaningful certain powers will have to be reserved to them rather than everything having <Col N="1349" /> to go back to Cabinet if what is called &ldquo;substantial change&rdquo; is to be made.  Our Cabinet system of making laws does not work.  I know this from practical experience. Indeed, I know how difficult it is for a Minister to get a place on the Cabinet agenda to have a matter discussed.  The paraphernalia of memoranda to Government and seeking the views of other Departments, as well as the backlog in the draftsman's office, causes huge delays; and for all those reasons the process is extremely slow.  I would like to think that we would use the committee in a far more meaningful way than we have ever done before &mdash; to make legislation rather than minor or very technical amendments acceptable to Government. It would be in the interests of everybody &mdash; the Minister and the House &mdash; if that committee were to be given the clout to allow them to make the law rather than to rubberstamp the provisions that come from the Government of the day.  I am not saying that the Government should not decide the overall framework of the legislation &mdash; I do not necessarily disagree with that &mdash; but it should not be necessary to seek approval on every detail.  Given that the Government has such a huge majority, it will be able to do this through committee, but I am anxious that we get the Bills to the committee as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We should all feel ashamed that this sort of case could happen in our society in the early nineties.  Those who have brought it to our attention should be thanked and encouraged, but they should also be cautions.  The victim and society in general must be protected.  We must not highlight particular cases while allowing others to go unreported.  We must ensure that we do not encourage a type of lynch law where there is massive public outcry because a case is presented in a certain way.  When speaking to the victim, the media only hear one side of the case.  We must have a sense of balance if justice is to prevail.  A lynch law approach would not be appropriate, even in these extraordinary times.</P>
    <P>I note from the Bill that it is proposed <Col N="1350" /> to give the Director of Public Prosecutions 28 days in which to make a decision in regard to an appeal.  When will the transcript of the case be made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions to allow him and his staff assess whether or not to make an appeal? The Bill refers to the registrar sending documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions and so on, but I would like to know when the transcript will be available. Our court procedures and facilities must be updated in order to give the Director of Public Prosecutions full access to the transcript of a case before making a decision in regard to an appeal, rather than relying on media comment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my party will support it on Second Stage.  We will table some amendments tomorrow, but it is important that it be used cautiously but, nonetheless, where necessary.  I hope that the Director of Public Prosecutions will not be unwilling to instigate an appeal in cases where the facts obviously warrant a longer sentence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must reflect on the history of the Bill.  It is a product of the public outcry following the Lavinia Kerwick case.  That young victim called on the public authorities to do something about the fact that the offender in that case had, effectively, got off scot free and it was discovered that the legislative framework was not in place to enable anyone to do anything about it.  In fairness to the then Minister for Justice, he met with the victim and, consequently, introduced this Bill.  However, it is ironic <Col N="1351" /> that the Bill has not come before the House for debate and enactment until a similar case occurred.  Again, this case evoked a certain amount of public outcry and, consequently, this House and the Government responded quickly with the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the hasty enactment of this legislation as it should have been dealt with some time ago.  I do not accept the excuse that it was not dealt with earlier because of the general election and the change of Government. There was ample opportunity to deal with this legislation.  This House could have sat last September, or in the month beween the election of the Government and the resumption of Dáil business, to deal with non-controversial legislation such as this which had already been circulated. This House or the other House could sit next week in order to enact this legislation.  It is regrettable that it took a second highly publicised case to impress on the Government the urgency of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Is an emergency response to specific cases the best way to reform our criminal justice system or deal with sentencing policy?  Is this the proper way to deal with the problems of sexual assault, incest, rape and sexual crime generally?  There is a public perception that the Dáil, through the mechanism of this legislation, is addressing the problem of sexual crime. That is not true.  This legislation deals only with a minority of cases: where the case is reported, enough evidence is assembled in order to bring about a prosecution, where the case is brought before the courts and when a problem arises in regard to the length of sentence imposed. This legislation does not address the generality of sexual crime in our society.</P>
    <P>The Irish Country Women's Association estimate that approximately one-third of Irish women are sexually abused at some time during their lives and it is clear that a large number of those sexual abuses occur within the family.  A survey of 512 sexual abuse cases carried out in the Eastern Health Board area some years ago found that 20 per cent of <Col N="1352" /> abusers were under 15 years of age, 90 per cent were male and approximately one half were within the family circle. We all know that the vast majority of cases of sexual abuse against children and women are never reported.  Victims may seek their own remedy.  As a constituency politician I know women who, rather than report an incident of sexual abuse against themselves or their children and subjecting themselves and their family to the trauma of going through the courts, choose to deal with the problem by moving house, obtaining a barring order or by some other measure.  Therefore, only a minority of cases go to court and we must deal with the majority of cases in some other way.  I agree with Members who stated that a mechanism must be found to deal with the cases which do not go to court.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with sentencing policy in a narrow manner.  The Minister stated this morning that the victim in the most recent Kilkenny case has, understandably, requested to be allowed to get on with her life in so far as she can do so. However, in a television interview she expressed fears about the ability to lead a normal life in anticipation of what will happen when the offender is released. Many victims of this type of crime have fears about what will happen when the offender is released.</P>
    <P>A compartmentalised approach to this problem which deals purely with the criminal aspect of it, something that is dealt with through the courts with the offender being sentenced to a period of imprisonment and the victim being expected to carry on as normal, is not sufficient or adequate.  We must consider what will happen when the offender is released from prison?  Where will the offender live?  Will the offender be rehoused in the same flat complex as the victim or in accommodation down the road?  We need to build measures into our legislation to deal with this situation and which would require the Judiciary to do so.</P>
    <P>On the formula being used of considering the impact on the victim, it is not simply a question of attributing some <Col N="1353" /> value to the impact on the victim and then saying that it is worth an extra five years in prison.  That is not the approach we should adopt.  I agree with Deputy Shatter's point that the victims should be represented in court and allowed make an input in the sentencing policy. However, I suspect that if we reached that stage we would find that the victims of these offences would take a more pragmatic view as to the remedy than the Judiciary.  They would probably take a more wide ranging view rather than simply saying it is worth an extra five years in prison.  They would address the practical problems they would have to confront when the offender is released from prison.  A victim would bear in mind whether the offender would harass them on release.  Is he going to live in the same neighbourhood and have access to them?  Those questions need to be addressed in the context of what the victim expects.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the right of the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against what were termed unduly lenient sentences.  The Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; the Minister referred to this &mdash; has the power to appeal to the Supreme Court against sentences handed down in the Central Criminal Court but he has never exercised this right.  Can we have any confidence that this right which is being given to the Director of Public Prosecutions in this legislation will be exercised having regard to the fact that the signal is being sent to that official that it is only to be exercised where what are termed as unduly lenient sentences are handed down?</P>
    <P>We need to address to what extent sentencing policy is being decided in the courts and not in the Legislature.  We are making provision in this legislation for a maximum sentence and an appeals procedure. The Minister has invited us to comment on what we consider should be the maximum sentence in relation to the crime of incest.  However, we are not sending any signal to the Judiciary as to what we expect of them.  The imposition of mandatory sentences for particular crimes has been suggested.  I do not think <Col N="1354" /> that is the way to deal with the matter because effectively the sentencing policy would be like a computer programme whereby for a particular crime one could push a button to ascertain the appropriate sentence.  The Legislature should lay down guidelines for sentencing and tell the Judiciary what we expect of them in relation to different crimes; where, for example, we put the crime of incest or sexual abuse in comparison with the crime of shop lifting.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks I have heard of people being sentenced to 20 months or two years in prison for sex offences, the term of imprisonment one would get for theft.  There is no point in passing the buck to the Judiciary and then criticising judges when we are not happy with a sentence handed down.  As the Legislature we should lay down the guidelines we expect the Judiciary to enforce rather than specify maximum sentences.  I suggest that the committee of the House which is to deal with matters relating to justice and security policy should also deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>The victim in the Kilkenny case has expressed her fears in relation to the post sentence situation.  That issue should be reflected on because there is a view &mdash; this is a fallacy and it underlines much of what we do in this House &mdash; that prison rehabilitates people.  It does nothing of the kind and any victim of crime would tell us that they fear for their own safety after an offender is released.  Therefore, we need to address the failure of prison to deal with the question of rehabilitation, in particular in this case.  We have to accept that convicting sex offenders and dumping them into jail does nothing to ensure that they will not offend when released.  At present there are effectively no therapy or rehabilitation programmes in our prisons for sex offenders and orders made by judges that such treatment should be given are not complied with.</P>
    <P>This matter has been highlighted in the courts on a number of occasions.  In a hearing before Judge Michael Moriarty in the Circuit Criminal Court on 14 December, also an incest case, the court <Col N="1355" /> was told that a claim made at an earlier hearing on behalf of the Minister for Justice that the most advanced programme in the world for the treatment of recidivist sex offenders was operating in Ireland since last September was untrue.  A psychiatrist at the Central Mental Hospital told the court that this type of programme did not exist.  He said that 80 sex offenders were being held in Arbour Hill and that while a group therapy programme had been tried on a pilot basis for 18 months it had been abandoned in September 1990.</P>
    <P>We also have to acknowledge that the cases of incest and sexual abuse which are highlighted in the Dáil constitute only the tip of the iceberg.  We need to improve the procedures for the identification of people at risk and the prosecution of offenders.  The recent report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women made a number of suggestions to assist women victims of domestic or sexual violence and they should be implemented without further delay. These include the establishment of regional domestic violence shelters where they do not exist, the securing of multi-annual funding for all such shelters, the publication by each health board of confidential addresses for women in emergency domestic violence situations and the establishment of a 24-hour telephone service in each area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to deal with the question of compensation.  I am concerned about the proposition that compensation should be seen as an alternative to a prison sentence as I fear we could end up with two problems.  The first is that offenders who are well off may be able to avoid a prison sentence where a compensation order is made against them.  Ironically during the past week there has been much concern about whether justice is going to be evenhanded. The second problem is that if someone is the victim of an assault by a well off person they will be compensated while if they are the victim of an assault by a not so well off person they will not be compensated.  I agree with the <Col N="1356" /> comments that funding and flexibility should be restored to the criminal injuries board in order to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill but I fear it is too little too late in the sense that the incidence of incest, sex abuse and domestic violence is far greater than the number of cases coming before the courts.  Indeed, only a fraction of the people who commit these crimes are brought to court.  One must recognise that the legislation is only as good in so far as it is available to people.  The whole question of imposing heavier sentences is not a solution to the problem, although I welcome the Minister's approach in this regard.  My point that the legislation is too late is one that has been made by one or two other speakers.  It shows a double standard in terms of domestic violence and sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The Dáil was reconvened as an emergency when a crisis arose in the beef industry and Larry Goodman had to be bailed out.  But since last year the question of lenient sentences has been a matter of great concern, yet it has taken another case to highlight the problem before any action was taken.  That speaks volumes of the ambivalence and double standards that exist.  This Bill will not be retrospective.  Therefore, in the Kilkenny case there is nothing but cold comfort. There is no way the victim's difficulties can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that appeals will be considered only where a sentence is seriously out of line with what a judge might be presumed to have decided, or, in relation to the Supreme Court, where a point of law of exceptional importance is applicable.  I wonder how effective the legislation will be considering that there is a double standard in relation to the right of women to be safe in their homes. We live in an unequal society, and violence and sexual abuse are the cutting edge of that inequality.  When considering <Col N="1357" /> legislation to increase sentences or to change the method of appeal we must also consider how we as a society view the whole question of domestic violence.  The question is often put: why does the woman put up with violence? The question is never put: why does the man commit an act and how are we going to stop him?  That is the question that needs to be answered.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that very often victims are afraid to speak out.  These people can only be compared with victims of torture, because torture is what we are talking about.  When home is no longer a place of sanctuary but a place of terror and fear, a women's perception of the world at large is undermined.  There is no one more lonely than the battered and abused woman.  She is undermined, alienated and disorientated because of the battering. She is permanently damaged, physically, emotionally and mentally, by that experience.  When she has the courage to reach out, often the system simply spurns her.</P>
    <P>The adversarial format of the court is often inappropriate in dealing with domestic violence.  How can the right of a battered women be protected when our free legal aid system has fallen apart and voluntary organisations are operating on a shoe string?  These bodies are overstretched, understaffed, undertrained, underfinanced and cannot cope with demands on them.  I worked in a refuge for 15 years and it is only in recent times that these centres received State funding. They have worked on the basis of goodwill and commmitment to helping people who suffer domestic violence.  There has been no State support to underpin the work of these centres and to recognise that domestic violence exists and is a real crime.  The Rape Crisis Centre is very concerned that people who are referred to it have to wait in a queue.  It desperately wishes to provide for the need that so clearly exists.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill dealing with evidence of the offence against the victim is a good provision, but it does not recognise that very often such evidence is not available because it is not recorded. <Col N="1358" /> Women do not have the means of putting in place a record of abuse, particularly if that abuse has occurred over a long period.  The full extent of the abuse may never be recorded unless organisations are put in place for this purpose.  I was very angry that no money was allocated in the budget to deal with domestic violence and sexual abuse.  This is an indication that we are not facing up to crimes committed in Irish homes every day of the week.  This is a widespread and deep problem.  Unless we recognise that it is a barbarity that must be dealt with, it will continue.</P>
    <P>Much praise has been given to the garda in the Kilkenny incest case, and rightly so, but the real heroine is the victim who risked her life to come forward. It is astonishing that we can say what we like about the victim in this case, to whom my praise goes, but not about the judge.  That women is a model for other women to follow.  Her coming forward was a great act of courage.  At the end of the day the law and the legislators have failed her.</P>
    <P>If we do not recognise that incest and sexual abuse is a reality, this legislation will be passed without dealing with the underlying cause of the crime.  What needs to be devised &mdash; I know this is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice alone but of the Government as a whole &mdash; is a strategy that encompasses all the services dealing with domestic violence and sexual abuse.  There must be a recognition of the extent of this crime.  Changes must be made in sentencing, but there must also be a wide range of statutory supports not just in Dublin &mdash; we tend to see this as a Dublin problem &mdash; but throughout the country to deal with the perpetrators of violence as well as the victims.  If one is separated from the other, the victim will live in fear of reprisal at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is need for a community organisation in this regard, because very often this crime is known to neighbours, friends, family and local people but they feel helpless and are afraid or do not know how to get involved.  If we build up a consciousness among local communities <Col N="1359" /> that this is a crime, that it is anti-social, a barbarity that must be stamped out, we will ensure that women will not hesitate in approaching neighbours, family and friends.  Very often women are afraid, for example, to go to the social worker because they may fear that their children will be taken away.  In some cases the woman may wish to seek help but is afraid to go to those who can help her best.  Much can be done within a community to deal with this type of crime.  For instance, a publican who is aware of a person's violent record could refuse to supply another drink to a person whom he knows has enough taken. Simple things can be set in place in local communities where people are educated and understand how to resist the terrible crimes of incest and sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Before this case hit the headlines I spoke in this House and made a point which was sadly prophetic when I said, at column 29 of the Official Report for 26 February 1993:</P>
    <P>The right to feel safe in one's home has to be a fundamental right.  For the last 15 years I have worked with battered women, trying to provide a refuge for women who are escaping violence.  I have met women who have been battered to the point where they are punch drunk and they no longer have the ability or the will to even exercise their right of choice.  As long as that continues, as long as violence is used as it always has been used at the extreme end of the inequity in the relationship between men and women, that must be our first priority.  Unless we tackle this problem and say it is a barbarism that must be rooted out, and it can be brought to an end only by ensuring that the perpetrators are punished appropriately, we will be responsible for perpetuating that cycle of violence....  Whatever steps are taken will do nothing for the women with whom I am dealing because they have been damaged and battered to such an extent that they will never recover from their experience but, for their <Col N="1360" /> daughters, it may end up being a matter of life or death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>On this welcome Bill I will make some comments on crime against women within families and on sexual crimes within families.  The most depressing thing about incest is the betrayal of trust it represents.  A child who should grow and develop in a family atmosphere of love and attention is betrayed by one of the people who are supposed to care and to be in a position of authority.</P>
      <P>Much of the study done on incest and on violent sexual crimes against women indicates, that it does not just relate to sexual gratification but that it is an attempt to express power over the victim, either the spouse or the child.  It is not necessarily a sexual relationship but a power relationship.  To that extent it reflects on the relations between men and women in Irish society, on the position of women and on how men feel obliged to express power over women.  It is the most extreme form of the expression of power over women and children.</P>
      <P>In many cases alcohol, and alcohol abuse, plays a huge part.  I hope that will be given some attention in terms of research into the problem.  We should all consider how we deal with the use of drink.  Where there is a desire to express frustrated power the consumption of large quantities of alcohol seems in some cases to do away with inhibitions and these crimes are committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that part of this Bill focuses on the victim.  We as a society must consider how to restore to the victim a good quality of life after such a terrible crime.  In considering the improvement of professional services we must bear in mind that, because this represents a loss of power on the part of the victims, any help given to the victims should seek to re-empower the victims with regard to themselves and their place in society.  The self-help groups pioneered by the Rape Crisis Centres and various other women's groups are very interesting.  Here we have people with experience of this type of <Col N="1361" /> crime going out to help others.  In that context I am glad that later today the Minister for Health will make an announcement with regard to the funding of Rape Crisis Centres.  Deputy McManus regretted that this was not announced in the budget but that fact does not reflect a lack of interest.</P>
    <P>Last September I attended a conference on crime against women run by the Department of Justice in Dublin Castle.  At that conference the problem was talked about openly.  I know that at this stage we seem to do a great deal of talking but in relation to breaking the silence to which Deputy McManus referred, it is necessary for women to talk about their experiences of ten years ago, 20 years ago, or 30 years ago.  Growing up in Dublin I was aware of talk about crimes within families which was hushed up when I was around.  I am sure that is the experience of many other Deputies. We must talk openly about this.  Judge Susan Denham, who is now a judge of the Supreme Court, spoke at that conference about her experience in family courts and said that because of the <i>in camera</i> procedure in relation to such cases, there was a lack of awareness among the public of the number and kinds of cases with which the family courts dealt and that our education was lacking in this area. Without sensationalising such cases or breaching the confidentiality associated with them, I hope some way will be found to make us more aware of the types and number of cases which come up, about which Judge Denham spoke in September. I understand that the Department of Justice are setting in train a follow-up conference to the September conference, to be held in Templemore, and which will deal with the same matter.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McManus, the Department of Social Welfare for a number of years now has been piloting a series of initiatives in relation to locally based women's groups.  While a very few of those groups deal directly with the topic of violence against women, it is through the process of self-development that many women make contacts and find themselves able to talk about what may <Col N="1362" /> be happening to them or what may have happened to them.  In this year's budget grants to such organisations were substantially increased.  The object of this is empowerment of women.  If women are confident of their role and position within society the ability of others to abuse them and force them into silence will be reduced.  Four or five weeks ago there was much talk about the Fitzwilliam Tennis Club and its refusal to have women members.  Some of the comments made at that point were interesting because many people felt that women Deputies were being unreasonable in asking why women could not be members of Fitzwilliam Tennis Club.  The point which was made then, and which is borne out again by this case, is that this was a venue at which some of the leading lawyers and judges regularly convened on a social basis.  This was the social nexus in which these men met.  The argument which was made at the time was that if their contacts and their socialising are confined to other men and to a certain social network, how will such judges have sympathy and understanding of victims in cases such as these.</P>
    <P>While I would not have a punitive approach to sentencing I believe the purpose of prison is, first, to indicate society's abhorrence of a crime and, secondly, there has to be an equal commitment to attempt to rehabilitate the criminal.  If we continue to have these all male bastions such as Fitzwilliam what does it say about where women in Irish society are going?  In view of the fact that the majority of judges are male there is need for a greater gender balance at all levels in the Judiciary.  The appointment of more women judges would lead to a greater sympathy and understanding of the problems faced by women who are victims of crime.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Department of Social Welfare and our support for locally based women's groups, I know from my own area of Blanchardstown that the promotion of women's groups has led to a greater confidence on the part of women in talking about not only crimes against women but every aspect of their lives. <Col N="1363" /> That leads us on to the next stage, which is the need for more refuges, more help lines and spaces in which women can come forward and report this type of crime.  I would like to see this type of development being controlled by women themselves.  In other words, it is not a matter of simply offering professional advisers and professional help.  That is important, but what is more important is that women in local areas come forward, having identified their own needs, and that the State, local authorities and health boards are there to support them.  I know from my contacts with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre that women who have experienced the problem are involved.  This has made it more user friendly to women who wish to use the services of the centre.  The same applies in the case of Women's Aid and the refuge in Rathmines.  An important feature of that refuge is that there is an involvement by women who have experienced violence against women in the running of the refuge.  That gives a particular quality to the services available from those centres.</P>
    <P>In regard to the points made about an excessive legal format for the court proceedings, I should say that women's organisations have pioneered during the past 15 to 20 years an approach which is not excessively legalistic.  I would welcome any development which would concentrate on counselling and mediation in addition to the judicial proceedings which arise in such a case.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party and on my own behalf, I note the work done by Garda Agnes Reddy in the Kilkenny case and I compliment her.  In that case the victim, apparently over a number of years, attempted to draw attention to the problem.  Apparently, she made contact with differenct people and different agencies, but there was no response.  The victim was indeed very brave to finally come forward and confront her father in what was obviously an extremely violent family problem.  The gardaí in the case behaved in a very understanding and caring way and set a headline as to how <Col N="1364" /> gardaí should deal with such cases in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of the length of sentences for such offenders.  In that regard I should like to speak about the whole question of rehabilitation.  Deputy Gilmore referred to the rehabilitation pilot scheme which is in operation in Arbour Hill.  In terms of international literature, and from what I know of such centres, some are successful with some of the people who have been sentenced, but others are not. Clearly there is no easy solution to the rehabilitation of sexual offenders.  Much of the literature suggests that some offenders may be addicted to that kind of behaviour.  I would welcome an indication of the types of rehabilitation schemes which are successful.  There are some successes.  The rehabilitation schemes which have been successful in other countries involve working with the offenders over very long periods.  They involve an intensive amount of therapy, whether group therapy or one to one therapy.  That may appear to be the long road in dealing with such offenders and there may appear to be much shorter and sharper solutions, but I would not advocate those solutions.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, much of the research indicates that the offence arises not necessarily from a desire for sexual gratification but rather from a desire to express power over others, and the rehabilitation programmes attempt to address this offence.  I note Deputy McGahon does not agree with my view. In attempting to deal with these offenders we have to try to rehabilitate them. Simply feeling satisfied that we have sent somebody to jail for 15 or 20 years, and leaving the matter to rest at that, is not sufficient.  The contributions which have been made this morning, particularly by women Deputies, recognise that this is a very complex problem and is not capable of instant and immediate solution.  I would welcome any attempt to establish rehabilitation programmes for offenders within the prison system, difficult as those programmes are.  The jury is still out on whether they are successful and if <Col N="1365" /> offenders have been successfully treated on such courses.</P>
    <P>In general this is a problem which does not relate simply to justice.  As a parent, I welcome the initiatives taken by the INTO in making children aware of the problems of sexual abuse and the whole programme which operates in some schools.  I welcome the fact that booklets and information packs have been distributed and used in some schools.  In reading some of the comments on the Kilkenny case and the interviews by the victim it was clear that for a considerable period of her life she did not understand in sexual terms what was happening to her.  I hope that in any developing programmes within the schools we will try to give children the confidence to come forward if they feel that something is not right and hopefully somebody will be there to listen to them.</P>
    <P>I would urge that we do as much as possible in our schools to educate in relation to drink.  There is a strong correlation between the abuse of alcohol and the perpetration of these crimes.  I welcome the action being taken by the Government in relation to this problem. However, I do not think the problem can be dealt with merely by way of legislation. The answer resides within all families and communities.  The Government is tackling this problem in a number of different ways.  I hope this debate will give women and children who feel they are being threatened the confidence to come forward and tell their stories.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat surprised that reference should be made in this debate to Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club.  I wish to say to the Minister of State opposite that the attitude adopted by certain quarters to Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club is becoming a bore.  I am not a member of Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club and I do not aspire to membership <Col N="1366" /> of that club.  I do not have anything in common with the vast majority of the members of that club.  However, I respect people's right to freedom of association and to choose the company in which they wish to drink a pint of beer.  The only ultimate logical conclusion one can draw from the remarks made by people like the Minister of State and others is that they wish to deny freedom of association to people, a denial of the type seen in many European Fascist dictatorships during the past century.  I will leave my remarks at that.  As someone who served on and contributed significantly to the work of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights from 1977-79 and in the family law area before I become a Member of this House, I am beginning to feel that this entire campaign has gone over the top and that the cause of equality is not being helped by the remarks made by the Minister of State and her fellow travellers.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat regrettable that in the spring of 1993 the Minister for Justice and her Government partners have had to be almost literaly dragged screaming into this House in order to enact such a Bill as that now before us.  I do not have to remind the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, but I might have to remind other Members, of the debate on similar legislation proposed by Fine Gael in 1990, legislation which was rejected out of hand by the Government of the day.  I am glad the Progressive Democrats Party has seen the light now that it is not in Government and is prepared to vote today in favour of this Bill, which is broadly similar to the Bill it rejected for fairly flimsy reasons.  I recall the contribution of, I think, Deputy Máirín Quill &mdash; perhaps it was Deputy Harney &mdash; who stated that she agreed in principle with the legislation but could not bring herself to vote for it.  I am delighted that she supports this Bill now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no great problem in regard to the vast majority of judgments, but I share the concern of people throughout <Col N="1367" /> society at the frequency of sentences which give rise to very serious concern. It was because of such concern that in 1990 Fine Gael moved a Private Members' Bill and it is precisely because of this that we have no difficulty in supporting this Bill.  It is very regrettable that controversy of an extraordinary nature can blow up in our society every few months as a result of what can only be described as wrong decisions of the courts.  We should acknowledge that wrong decisions are made because, like the rest of us, judges are human and fallible.  It is regrettable that these mistakes can be made and it is outrageous that wrong decisions can be handed down.  It is precisely because of this that we need a vehicle of the type envisaged in the legislation which will allow the Director of Public Prosecutions, if he sees fit, to make an appeal to a higher court and have a second hearing on a case. There are sound reasons why the State should be entitled to appeal a decision. After all, a person convicted has the right to appeal, if not the conviction then the severity of the sentence.  We do not deny them that right; but it is only correct and proper that the same vehicle of appeal should be made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the State, as envisaged in the Bill.  I believe there is strong public support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who made some strange remarks in his contribution on the 1990 Fine Gael Bill.  He said that he disagreed with the Fine Gael Bill because it would increase the burden of work in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In other words, because the Bill would give rise to more work in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions we should not allow the State to appeal a lenient sentence and we should allow continue, cases like the Kilkenny incest case, the other Kilkenny case which arose last year, and the other cases which unfortunately explode into society from time to time.  He used the possibility of more work in the Office of the Director of <Col N="1368" /> Public Prosecutions as an excuse for not supporting the Bill.</P>

He said that the Fine Gael Bill would expose the Director of Public Prosecutions to public pressure and media campaigns and that there would be questions from Deputies to the Minister for Justice as to why certain cases had not been the subject of a review.  I said at the time that I did not think that would happen and I do not think it will happen now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill does not make sufficient reference to the plight of the victim within the criminal justice system. I hope the Government will accord greater status to the victim within the criminal justice system.  The funding given to the Irish Association of Victim Support is meagre.  The victim impact study introduced in some courts is a laudable process but it is not introduced across the board; it is only referred to by individual judges in individual cases.  I hope that victim impact reports can be used in all cases of a criminal nature so that some sort of inquiry can take place into how the victims are progressing or are being integrated into society after the horrific trauma they have endured in criminal cases.  Consultation with the victim is important before, during and after the trial.  On conviction of an offender, but before sentence is handed down, it is important that the matter of the victim be placed in perspective by the judge.  It is laudable that the question of compensation for the victim is recognised in the Bill.  The rights and needs of victims are extremely important.  Cases are frequently adjourned or transferred to Dublin from country areas without taking into consideration the wishes of the victim.  There may be evidence to suggest that there are some &ldquo;easy&rdquo; judges who may take a different view of a given <Col N="1370" /> set of criminal circumstances than a colleague.</P>
      <P>The whole question of consistency of sentencing is important.  It was stated a few years ago that meetings of High Court judges to discuss sentencing could not be held because the Department of Justice were not prepared to provide sufficient travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this welcome Bill which should have been produced years ago.  Horrific details about incest and rape which are now becoming known reflect the break up of society. One of the good points is that these awful cases are now becoming known and people are prepared to stand up and be counted.  One wonders why such cases have not been disclosed over the years. Perhaps the Catholic Church would have something to say on that.  In the light of their influence on society in general and on families in particular, they must have been aware to some extent of how deeply ingrained were these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more disturbing aspect is the awful increase in crime and ineffectiveness of society in dealing with it.  I am not a bleeding heart.  I am not interested in analysing why people commit crime.  I am only interested in punishing crime and in providing deterrents.  The absence of deterrents has brought us to our present sorry state.  In Dublin, gangsters control part of the city.  Is that a society we can accept or be proud of?  Policies emanating from the Department of Justice, regardless <Col N="1371" /> of who is in Government, are designed to contain and appease, not to defeat the criminal.  The criminal classes can only be defeated by providing suitable deterrents.  My views on this subject have been well documented over the years. Many people, particularly in the Dáil, would regard my views as extreme.  I am extreme and I believe my views are echoed to a large extent by the man in the street who wants security.</P>
    <P>Environmentalists are concerned if a river is polluted.  I suggest that Irish society is polluted by the influence of television.  We all like television occasionally so that we can watch rugby, football, boxing or, in my case, racing, but the incidence of violence and sex, particularly emanating from America is having a bad effect.  Recent statistics show that in America a person of 18 years will have seen 26,000 murders depicted on television.  That possibly accounts for the number of depraved and crazy people in that unhappy country and the level of violence there.  We are importing the same programmes which are being broadcast night after night.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, spoke about the prevalence of alcoholic drink in society.  Young children are brainwashed every ten minutes when watching television by blandishments in respect of Harp, Carlsberg, Furstenberg or whatever.  They cannot get away from it because they are a captive audience in their own homes.  Sex is used to sell drink in advertisements which show good-looking ladies or handsome young men.  That is one of the reasons society has all but broken down.</P>
    <P>The question of deterrents must be addressed.  Draconian measures are needed to deal with full-time, hardened criminals.  Recidivism is rampant.  In reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister indicated that almost 3,000 people committed offences last year while on parole.  That system is clearly not working.  Why continue with it?  Anybody who transgresses the terms of parole should be denied it for the rest of his life.  The system of bail should be <Col N="1372" /> examined.  Any person accused of a very serious crime should be denied bail.  If it is allowed, the bail should be put up by the judge.  People who are charged with serious crimes should not be let loose on society until proven innocent.  The whole system of bail needs to be overhauled and the system of parole absolutely abandoned.</P>
    <P>It is high time that some emphasis was given to compensating the victims of crime.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, said recently that we must have more concern for the victims of crime and less for the accused.  That is a very simple and practical statement and I wonder if he will put it into effect. People in the Minister's position should also take cognisance of that simple statement. The system that has evolved here over the years is the result of the approach of the bleeding hearts and the analysts who get some kind of solace from deducing that the criminal was deprived or was abandoned by his mother.  It is that kind of thinking that has helped the criminal into the commanding position he now occupies in our society.</P>
    <P>The provision for compensation for victims is very welcome and I congratulate the Minister on incorporating it in the Bill.  We pass tremendous laws in this country, we have a proliferation of laws, but do not implement them. The drink driving laws are a farce.  To implement them we would need a squad car outside every public house, including the Shelbourne bar.  Bringing in legislation to provide for compensation is pie in the sky, unless it is monitored and implemented.  Unless there is some system whereby the person who is to pay the compensation is made to continue the payments and not welsh after the initial payments it will be no use. Many unfortunate separated or deserted wives have to contend with such a situation. The husband makes a few payments and then decides he has done enough and that the State can look after his liabilities.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that some mechanism is built into the system to ensure that anybody who is <Col N="1373" /> required by a court to pay compensation does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill covers three different areas &mdash; unduly lenient sentencing, the effect of crime on the victim and the area of compensation.  We could sum this up by saying that we should lock the criminal away, hurt his pocket and always keep to the fore the appalling effect of crime on the victim.</P>
      <P>In my book, the crimes of rape and incest equate to murder and should be treated as seriously in our legislation and in our courts.  Like many Deputies I was particularly concerned about the disgracefully lenient sentencing in recent cases involving rape and incest.  Society has woken up to the enormity of these crimes and the Bill is a response to this. It is necessary that the Judiciary also wake up to the viciousness of these crimes and realise that it is no longer acceptable that such crimes should be treated leniently.</P>
      <P>It is an absurd hang-over from our inherited legal system that there has been no right to question undue leniency in sentencing.  When public policy decides on penalties to fit specific crimes, we should be secure in the knowledge that these penalties will actually be imposed. Unfortunately this has not been the case and we have seen that all too often.  Some cases have come to light but many never come into the public domain. There has been widespread public disquiet about lenient sentencing.  The introduction of a right to appeal against lenient sentencing is long overdue and is very welcome.  Society has asked us from time immemorial why the right to appeal lenient sentencing has not been there and we welcome the fact that it will at least be there for future cases.</P>
      <P>This week a judge explained himself by saying he had had a bad week.  My immediate reaction to that was that we also had last week a victim whose story came to light, a victim whose life has been ruined.  The whole country has been appalled by the ruination of this girl's life, first of all in her childhood, then in her teens and her later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> Previous speakers referred to the fact that in child sexual abuse cases particularly the children do not understand what is happening to them.  They do not understand the appalling crime that is committed.  They do not know what to do, who to talk to, or who to go to about it.  Minister Burton spoke about the programme that is carried on in schools at the moment, mostly in the Dublin area. I heard about it too from some County Meath teachers.  These programmes teach the children that it is okay to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that it is not their fault.  This message is being put across in primary schools.  This programme should be spread throughout the country through all the health boards to get it into the heads of children, no matter what their age, that if they are a victim of any type of abuse that it is not their fault, that it is okay to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that they should tell somebody in authority about it.  It should be got across to them that, if they speak to somebody in authority about abuse and are ignored, they should speak to somebody else and somebody else again until they are listened to.  The most appalling thing about incest, and child sexual abuse in particular, is that children do not understand, do not know who to talk to nor where to go when they experience it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to rape cases we must endeavour to establish the support systems for the victims of this horrendous crime.  Rape and incest equate to murder. Whilst there has been much welcome reform of the law and legal procedures relating to sexual assault victims, we should be moving in the direction of mandatory sentencing in this area.  I would have no qualms about saying that a minimum sentence of life imprisonment is the only one that is appropriate.  The Bill deals with the sentencing element and then moves on to deal with the element of compensation and the possibility for compensation plus a fine.  Certainly it is important that provision for compensation be included.  Victims can never recover from this crime; it remains with them for the rest of their lives.  At least if there is compensation it <Col N="1375" /> will hurt the pocket of the perpetrator of the crime.  For that reason the provision to compel the payment of compensation is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Our legal system frequently puts too great an emphasis on protecting the rights of the accused person.  This was said earlier by Deputy McGahon.  It leaves victims without any real vindication.  We must bear in mind that the person who should be vindicated is the victim.  That is the person we want to support and protect.  The Bill advocates three things: to lock the perpetrator away, to hurt his pocket and to keep to the fore the appalling effect on the victim that is there for life, whatever the age of the victim.  I hope that the new requirements in the Bill will go some way to redressing the situation.  However, the Minister must take immediate action to ensure the comprehensive and speedy implementation of the Bill.  There must be definite effective action to establish a means for systematically taking victim impact statements and collecting compensation. That was also referred to earlier.  Now that we have the legislation there has to be a monitoring procedure.  The Minister in recent speeches highlighted the need for this and it is extremely important to put it in place.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker talked of the necessity for suitable deterrents.  We have been talking about the crime of incest, which would usually take place behind closed doors, but the crime of rape, which we have also talked about, often occurs in public places.  The lack of gardaí on the streets could well have a bearing on the prevalence of the crime of rape.  Deputies have often called for more gardaí to be put on the streets. Increased Garda presence has been evident recently in O'Connell Street and other areas.  The bottom line is that more secretaries are required to do the office work in Garda stations and more gardaí released for duty.  Gardaí need to be seen on the streets to be an effective deterrent. It is no deterrent to have gardaí in stations or driving around in cars, they have to be seen.  An increased Garda <Col N="1376" /> presence will help reduce the number of horrendous crimes taking place on the streets.</P>
    <P>In my view the crimes of rape and incest equate substantially to the crime of murder.  That might not be the view of everyone.  Until we recognise the gravity of the crimes referred to today there is need for concern.  The crimes of rape and incest have a terrible effect on victims for their lives.  It is appalling that the perpetrator of such a crime can be imprisoned for a few years and then be released back into society.</P>
    <P>I realise that I should have made this request at the outset.  I should like to share my time with Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Like every Deputy, I was shocked and upset at the Kilkenny case that came to our attention.  That case has upset the general public and highlighted attitudes towards the crimes of incest and rape.</P>
      <P>The laws dealing with the crimes of incest and rape were prepared for different times.  These crimes may not be new but more of them are being reported and we are required to respond.  I agree that incest and rape are very serious crimes that require special sentences.</P>
      <P>There is concern in the community at how the sentencing policies of the courts vary.  The Bill attempts to bring about an organised approach to sentencing and that will be welcomed by the victims of all crimes, including the crimes of rape and incest.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the effects of crime on the victims have not been investigated in sufficient detail to give the courts, and the public, an understanding of what happens to them.  I am glad the Bill deals with that problem and I hope that as a result those who complain about an inadequate response will be satisfied that it goes some way to fill the void left by inadequate sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation is a very important element of criminal justice.  There is the question of whether a sentence is sufficient <Col N="1377" /> punishment for the crime.  Compensation usually affects the perpetrator of a violent act and it can cause offenders a great deal of difficulty.  Insisting on the payment of compensation is the best way to make some restitution to the victim. It signals that we are trying to tilt the scales of justice on the side of the victim.</P>
    <P>The question of access to the places where crimes, such as in the Kilkenny case, are committed is very important.  It seems there is some difficulty in passing on knowledge of how to gain access to places where such crimes are committed. That difficulty can be addressed in many ways.  When there is evidence that crimes are being committed there should be a process for collecting the evidence.</P>
    <P>The public will be reassured by the introduction of this legislation.  The reaction to the cases that have come to public attention seems to suggest that society is beginning to identify an underlying problem that was not clear in the past.  We all recognise that such activities are not new but it is good to note that the public is exposing such dreadful crimes.  At this time women, in particular, need reassurance that the justice system will give them protection.  We put the justice system in place to deal with and control the violent elements in our society.  I hope that the contributions made on this and similar legislation will reassure women, in particular those who were the victims of terrible crimes.</P>
    <P>Our young people are very vulnerable. We have to bear in mind that young people do not have the voice that adults have to highlight the problems that confront them.  There is a need to respond to signals from very young people and those who look after them, our teachers, community workers and so on.  We should try to establish a scheme to assure those who are most vulnerable, particularly young girls, that they have an avenue of approach.  Young people need to feel secure in making those approaches.  We need agencies to be able to respond to those who come to them in fear.</P>
    <P>At times many communities have felt helpless in regard to these issues.  The <Col N="1378" /> heightened public consciousness of the problem, the good will from all sides of the House, and the community should lead to a safer society for those who are suffering and the most vulnerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been one statistical review of the coverage of the live register in the past ten years.  The review was carried out during 1991 by an expert group established under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Its purpose was to enhance the value of the live register as a means of monitoring short term trends in unemployment on an objective statistical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the changes recommended by the review group was to <Col N="1386" /> reduce the live register count by 5,200 as and from May 1992.</P>
    <P>Persons opting for the pre-retirement allowance and credits schemes &mdash; PRETA and PRECS &mdash; have been excluded from the live register count since the introduction of the schemes in 1990 on the grounds that they make a declaration that they have retired from the labour market.  The PRETA and PRECS schemes currently apply to persons aged between 55 and 65 years of age and at the end of February 1993 a total of 16,800 were availing of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The categories of persons excluded from the live register arising from the most recent and previous reviews are explicitly shown by the Central Statistics Office in its monthly live register statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>EC statistical publications show that the statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office are comparable in range and timeliness with those of other Community countries.  No special international studies have been undertaken, but the National Statistics Board recently canvassed the view of national users and international agencies on the adequacy of Irish official statistics for the preparation of its second five year Strategy for Statistics covering the period 1993-97.  While certain shortcomings were identified by some there was general satisfaction with the current output of the Central Statistics Office and the improvements which have been made in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the most recent household <Col N="1389" /> budget survey, indicating the pattern of income and consumer power distribution, was carried out in 1987, that Ireland is virtually the only country in Europe that does not publish quarterly statistics on inflation but relies solely on annual statistics?  Is he aware that Ireland publishes economic growth statistics six or eight months later than most other European countries and has not yet published a growth statistic for 1992?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State accountable to this House for the Central Statistics Office?  If so, will he indicate if it is his opinion that publishing statistics in regard to inflation at that level of infrequency, publishing national accounts compiled from statistics so late and failing to publish any statistics in relation to energy is adequate?  Is he further aware that the Central Statistics Office, in regard to consumer expenditure, has had to revise its statistics so radically that its initial publications are not regarded as accurate?  For example, statistics in regard to consumer expenditure increases in 1985 were adjusted from a 1 per cent to a 4 per cent increase because the original statistics were not adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the views of the people using the statistics supplied by the Central Statistics Office were sought and time limits in regard to statistics were referred to, but there was a general level of satisfaction in regard to statistics.  If the Deputy wishes to raise questions in <Col N="1390" /> relation to particular surveys, I will be delighted to get whatever information I can for him.  The users of the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are generally satisfied with the level of frequency with which they are published and with the accuracy of the figures.</P>

I would welcome the views of anyone using statistics in regard to improvements which could be made in the compilation and publication of them.

      <P>It would certainly be more acceptable if there were more up to date statistics in this area.  However, there are other considerations and priorities to be dealt with by the Central Statistics Office.  We have a very limited budget and we have to make the best use of the resources available to us.  Yesterday a <Col N="1394" /> question was asked as to the number of people who left Gaeltacht areas to look for jobs abroad.  If one were to undertake a survey of that kind everybody leaving Gaeltacht areas would have to fill out a form to say where they are going.  Unfortunately we do not have the finance necessary to continually compile statistics over a wide area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to publish 1992 waiting lists figures as soon as possible.  These figures are being collected and collated at present.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery &mdash; hip replacement and other procedures &mdash; ophthalmology &mdash; cataract &mdash; ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery &mdash; by-pass operations &mdash; vascular surgery &mdash; varicose veins &mdash; and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is determined that these objectives will be achieved and is confident that this action programme represents a significant start in dealing with some of the problems facing our public hospital services.  A planned approach is being adopted to ensure that the extra resources will be provided only where satisfactory output targets have been agreed in advance with my Department. The intention is to reward those hospitals who are doing their everyday business well and build on their strengths rather than reward inefficient units.  The performance of hospitals will be monitored to ensure that the agreed increased activity targets are being achieved. Where targets are not met, the funding will be clawed back and redirected to <Col N="1396" /> other agencies.  My Department will be in touch with the boards and the other agencies in the coming weeks and I am confident that considerable progress can be made this year in alleviating the most pressing problems throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the fact that these figures are not yet available is a damning indictment on him or his predecessor because it was stated that they would be available early in 1993.  The figures at present being collated will represent a substantial increase on the 1991 figures, which show there is in the order of 40,000 people awaiting hospital treatment.  Would the Minister agree that this is a very sad reflection on Ireland as a society?  Will he be specific as to the implementation of this plan? In the Mid-Western Health Board area there are more than 10,000 people awaiting treatment and in the Midland Health Board area there are 750 people awaiting ENT treatment alone, more than half of whom are children, and the average waiting list is two and a half years.  How long is the Minister prepared to preside over this situation and will he set down a specific target&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To that end for the first time ever a specific sum of £20 million was promised and delivered in the budget over and above the normal allocation for acute hospitals and hospital boards.

      <P>It was not my fault that the Deputy tabled the question on a particular day.  In relation to the swingeing charges, the charges will achieve a modest income this year of the order I have already outlined.  All medical card holders, accounting for 36 per cent of the <Col N="1399" /> population, are exempt from the charges together with people who are exempted from both inpatient and outpatient charges &mdash; all medical card holders' dependants; women receiving services in respect of motherhood; children up to six weeks of age; children suffering from diseases and disabilities described in section 52 of the Health Act, including mental handicap, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy; children referred for treatment from a child health clinic or a school examination; persons receiving services in respect of infectious diseases described under the Health Act, 1947; persons deemed to have full eligibility by a chief medical officer under section 45 of the Health Act; persons in receipt of long term care in geriatric, psychiatric and mental handicap institutions.  Those other categories who are not covered in that general list, those who are over the limit for a medical card may be covered under plan P for all charges of the VHI at an annual cost of £10.50 per individual.</P>

      <P>I will be meeting the medical council to discuss a range of issues of interest to the council and myself.  As regard's the council's recent statement on ethical guidelines, it is a statutory function of the council to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  I have noted the statement and it will be one of the issues which I will discuss with the council when I meet them.</P>
      <P>Under the programme for partnership, the Government is committed to the introduction of legislation to regulate the position following the outcome of the recent referenda and the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  These are issues which must be addressed with care and sensitivity.  I will, of course, discuss the draft legislation with the medical profession at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the medical council statement has thrown us all into a state of chaos once again?  Arising from the X case there was a clear mandate in that the Supreme Court decided that a raped 14 year old girl was entitled to have an abortion. The wording was put to the people in a referendum and there was a clear mandate from the people for this House to legislate in this matter.  The Minister will agree that the medical council have preempted the legislators.  Was the Minister not aware that the medical council had been discussing this for the last six months?  There is a Department of Health representative, Ms. Jane Buttimer, appointed by the Minister to the medical council.  Would it not have been appropriate for the Minister, as the Minister with responsibility, to have taken the initiative to bring forward this promised legislation?  Would the Minister not agree that by his reluctance or fear to introduce legislation he has allowed the medical council to dictate the pace <Col N="1401" /> and introduce ambiguity and chaos back into the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a little bit much to expect legislation of the obvious complexity of the type involved in this case to be dealt with in the first six weeks of coming to office.  The Programme for Government states that the Government is determined to have the broadest possible consultation to deal with the matter sensitively.  That would be my approach. In relation to the role of the medical council, it is an independent statutory agency that has its own clear statutory duty in relation to devising ethical standards for the medical profession.  I have no role in interfering with their statutory duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 16 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the valuable work being carried out by the many voluntary organisations working in the health area who counsel and provide support to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1991 funding for the rape crisis centres came from a number of sources. This led to uncertainty about the level and source of funding from year to year. In July 1991 the Government decided to <Col N="1403" /> fund the rape crisis centres through my Department's allocation and to channel this assistance through the health boards.</P>
    <P>In 1992 a total amount of £277,000 was allocated to these organisations, comprising £148,000 funding from health boards and £129,000 from the national lottery.  I am allocating an increase of over 90 per cent in national lottery funding for the centres this year relative to 1992.  A total of £248,500 will be made available from the national lottery funds this year compared with £129,000 in 1992. This year's financial support will include an allocation of £15,000 through the Southern Health Board in support of services provided by the Kerry Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
    <P>I will be circulating to the Deputies a copy of the list of rape crisis centres which will receive national lottery funding this year.</P>
    <P>This funding is in addition to that being provided directly by health boards to the centres.  Health board grants to the centres amounted to £148,000 last year, bringing total funding for the centres from public funds to £277,000 in 1992. Health boards are currently drawing up their budgets and taking decisions on funding for the rape crisis centres.  The 1992 level of health board funding for the centres will at least be maintained in 1993, if not increased.  Funding for the rape crisis centres from the health services in 1993 will be £400,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>The health boards also provide assistance to a number of bodies which provide services for the victims of family violence. I recently received a report from representatives of the women's refuges and I am currently examining the proposals contained in that report for the development of additional purpose-built refuge accommodation for women and children fleeing from domestic violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I am glad to see that the penny has dropped during the past few days.  I would remind the Minister of the statement by his colleague, the Minister <Col N="1404" /> of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, last weekend when he said there were no resources available for any increase in funding despite the promises in the Programme for Government and the blow in the budget to many of these groups throughout the country. I put it to the Minister that in this day and age, and having regard to the important function of these bodies, it is ridiculous to expect them to survive by way of cake sales and flag days and that they should receive 100 per cent funding from his Department.  It is simply insufficient to await lottery disbursements which may be unreliable, as happened in the past. Would the Minister be prepared to make a commitment to oversee an adequate level of funding to these bodies?</P>

      <P>I am committed to the proper development of funding of services for victims of family volence.  It is an area that has had priority in my Department for the entire six weeks since I became Minister.  I was very happy to be in a position to increase funding by a factor of 90 per cent over last year at a time of very stringent and scarce resources.  That underscores the Government's commitment to support for victims of family violence.  I await the outcome of the investigation currently underway in the South Eastern Health Board, I will bring the report from the study group before the House at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's announcement there is still a shortfall of between £80,000 and £100,000 to cover the day-to-day running expenses of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The whole area of prevention of family difficulties is being managed with great success by these bodies.  Does he accept that there is a preventive role and function?  Does he accept the training and educational role of these bodies?  Rather than allow these bodies maintain their service by way of fire brigade action would he consider recognising these groups statutorily, <Col N="1405" /> since the State has been unable to cater for them during the past number of years?</P>

I have discussed this with representatives of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre this week and they are satisfied that we have advanced well beyond any contribution previously made.  I intend to have ongoing disucssions with all those involved in support groups for victims of family violence to see how services can be further improved.  Their input is recognised.  In fact there was a meeting in my Department this morning to see how best progress can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 9 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was included in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> edition of 5 February 1993.  Since that date a number of meetings have been <Col N="1406" /> held by officials of my Department with officials of the Eastern Health Board, representatives of the Department of Justice, an Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise and the authors of the report.</P>
    <P>The report was also considered by the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, under the chairmanship of my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Willie O'Dea, on 18 February 1993.</P>
    <P>At these meetings there was agreement that while the figures, which relate to an increase in the number of people attending for treatment, do not necessarily reflect an increase in the availability of the substances in question there was no room for complacency.  On the supply side, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, advised the Deputy on 17 February that she had been informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest any significant increase in heroin in the country. Specific measures have been taken by both the Garda and the Customs authorities which have resulted in an increase in the number of drug seizures and in the number of detections of drug related offences.  Both authorities will continue to develop surveillance and other demand reduction strategies.</P>
    <P>On the demand side, in addition to the significant developments which are taking place in the treatment services, I have directed that a Protocol on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone be finalised and circulated as a matter of urgency and that all doctors be advised immediately of the inappropriateness of morphine sulphate for the treatment of drug abusers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that his colleague, the Minister for Justice, indicated there was an increase in heroin seizures in 1992?  Does he accept, given the increased number of young people treated in 1992 for addiction to heroin, morphine and methadone, that there is a serious health problem related to the growing availability of hard drugs and opiates?  Does he further accept that the numbers attending drug treatment centres for addiction to methadone was <Col N="1407" /> five times greater in 1992 than in 1991 and that the huge increase in the use of MST morphine tablets, which are crushed and injected, is leading to major medical problems, including the increased risk of HIV transmission and the spread of the hepatitis C virus?  Does he accept that all of this constitutes a serious health emergency, which is not getting the necessary resources?  Can he indicate the additional personnel and resources he intends to make available in response to this emergency rather than that which is simply part of an ongoing inadequate programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's concern and I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to keep me briefed.  Indeed, I have details of the increase in seizures and detections to which the Deputy referred.  My Department is in contact with the sole suppliers of methadone to this country with a view to ascertaining the destination of their supplies to see whether it can be brought under more rigid control.  There are now three treatment centres offering services to drug abusers &mdash; the drug treatment centre in Trinity Court and satellite clinics operated by the Eastern Health Board at Baggot Street and Cherry Orchard in Ballyfermot.  A third satellite clinic, located in the north inner city at Amiens Street, is about to open.  I will bear in mind the concerns of the Deputy with a view to improving further the services to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the centre which is about to open in the north inner city has been planned for a long number of years and bears no relation whatever to the increased availability and the increased addiction to which I have referred?  Has the Minister any indication from where the huge quantity of morphine tablets and methadone is coming and whether much of it is obtained by prescription from individual doctors?  Can he indicate whether any action is being taken by his <Col N="1408" /> Department against individual doctors? Finally, may I ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have told the Deputy in the House that I regard it as a very serious matter and resources are being put in place to ensure that proper facilities are available for drug abusers.  I have outlined already what is being done in relation to methadone.  I would also inform the Deputy that an expert group has been established to produce a Protocol on methadone prescribing. I have asked that that Protocol be advanced and I expect to have it shortly.  I will watch carefully the sources of legal drugs available on the streets and see what improvements can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 10, 21, 30 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The use of indicative drug targets does not interfere with the right and duty of the doctor to prescribe as appropriate for each patient.  Accordingly, there is no question of unequal treatment for GMS patients as a result of their use.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme each doctor is encouraged to examine his existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any available opportunities to make prescribing less expensive and more effective for all his patients.  Assistance and support to doctors in the achievement of this objective will be provided on a monthly basis by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the individual health boards.  In addition, the IMO has established a co-ordination stucture which will provide information and support at both the individual doctor level and to groups of doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the scheme came into operation in January of this year, and prescriptions dispensed in January are currently being processed for payment, it is not possible as yet to establish the impact of the scheme.  The structure of the agreement <Col N="1410" /> means, however, that 50 per cent of all savings made by GPs on the target expenditure will be returned to the GPs for investment in agreed practice development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Is the Minister aware of the disquiet among many doctors about the ethics of this scheme?  Any money they save on prescriptions clearly has to be put back into improving doctors surgeries and so on.  Is the Minister aware that doctors are concerned that this policy will discriminate against the most socially disadvantaged in our society, that is, the GMS patients?  There is a risk that in order to make savings doctors will prescribe what are termed older drugs which are cheaper.  They may be able to prescribe more expensive and modern drugs for their patients, particularly for those who are suffering from depression.  Is the Minister concerned about this issue?  Will he keep a close watch on this policy as it is practised to ensure that no one is discriminated against and that they receive the very best and most appropriate medicine for their ailments?  The medical council has declared that it would be unethical for doctors to use the new indicative drug prescribing programmes as a means of making financial gains for themselves.  This is a serious concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the targets are purely indicative.  They do not interfere with the right, and obligation, of doctors to prescribe exactly the drug he or she deems necessary for the individual patient.  There is no threat or possibility of sanction against any doctor who precribes a drug he or she believes a patient needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point about the ethical view and the view of practitioners, I would remind the Deputy that this agreement was worked out by my predecessor with the full support of the IMO, the doctors' representative body.  I have not been made aware of any disquiet in this regard.  In fact, I have had meetings with the IMO on this issue and I hope this <Col N="1411" /> programme will improve the position substantially not only in regard to the cost of drugs but, more importantly, the regime of drugs available to GMS patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to patients who are sent by their consultants to a private practitioner with a prescription for a certain brand of drug, what will be the position for a doctor if he or she changes the drug to a generic drug?  Are doctors open to legal action by patients or their survivors if anything happens to them as a result of being given a different drug not by the consultant but by the general practitioner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am not a medical person.  A clinical decision on the most appropriate form of treatment or medicine is entirely a matter for the doctor concerned.  It would be totally inappropriate for me to try to dictate or suggest that a certain form of treatment would be appropriate in any particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his comments regarding inducements offered by drug companies, would the Minister agree that there is a danger that the same <Col N="1412" /> kind of ethos could build up in this scheme whereby GPs would be encouraged to prescribe cheaper rather than the most appropriate drugs?  In regard to the assessment of savings, does the Minister intend to assess the referral rate of GPs as well as the prescribing rate?  I suspect that these rates may be in inverse proportion to one another.  General practitioners who take the initiative to try to keep patients at home may end up prescribing drugs more heavily while GPs who tend to send patients directly to hospital may appear to be saving money and consequently benefit from the scheme but will cost the State more money at the end of the day.  Is there a system in place whereby the referral rate by GPs can be assessed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a very good point.  General practice units have been established in each health board area.  Since I took up office I have asked for these mechanisms to be put in place quickly.  I have received the co-operation of the IMO in achieving this. It will be the job of the general practice development units, together with the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and my Department to monitor ongoing developments in this area.  The whole thrust of the developments, and my thrust as Minister, will be to improve primary care so that people will not necessarily be referred automatically to secondary care if they can be better treated by their GP.  I hope during my term as Minister for Health to improve the area of general practice generally.  I have already taken a number of initiatives in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the targets not being met, can the Minister say if his Department will undertake to make up any shortfall which may occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Department is that it will plough back the savings into the development of general practice anyway.  Therefore, there will be no net saving to the Exchequer.  I hope that the targets will be met and the investment  <Col N="1413" /> will be available to bring about the improvements which most people realise are necessary at a general practice level. Because of the attractiveness and focus on secondary or hospital care in recent years, the general practice service has not received the attention it deserves.  I hope that resources will be available both this years and next year to make improvements in the general practice service.  I hope to establish one or two pilot programmes to improve this area over the next year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the package his predecessor, Dr. John O'Connell, agreed with doctors to prevent a strike in the GMS system indicated that a certain sum of money would be available, half of which was to come from this scheme?  If that portion of the money does not come from the scheme, will the Minister's Department augment the money which has been promised? Otherwise, he will face another threatened strike by doctors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Children from the Kerry area are seen by the Southern Health Board's school dental service and are screened for orthodontic treatment in accordance with guildelines issued by my Department.  Urgent cases, such as cleft lip and palate, are treated immediately. There is a waiting period of 12-18 months for remaining cases.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant improvement in the level of orthodontic services in the Kerry area as a result of the additional moneys made available since 1989.  A total of 412 children for the area are currently receiving specialist orthodontic treatment.  A further 163 children are on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>A full-time consultant orthodontist took up appointment with the health board in January 1992 and an orthodontic unit is presently being commissioned at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork.  The consultant orthodontist, when fully operational, will be engaged in the provision of training in orthodontics for the health board dental staff and further improvements in service levels and waiting periods will then be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there has been a marked improvement in this area in recent times. Would he agree that this has been due to the fact that parents have been forced to bring their children to private orthodontists rather than availing of the public service?  This resulted in a major imposition on them.  The numbers coming on the list are greater than the numbers being taken off.  There are 390 cases waiting <Col N="1415" /> for assessment and 150 waiting for appliances.  Does the Minister consider this to be a proper and adequate service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the first assertion that the recent improvements are attributable to more people seeking treatment from private orthodontists.  The figure for the net throughput is there to be seen.  A new consultant orthodontist will be available, together with new facilities which I have outlined.  In recent years a growing number of families have wished to have orthodontic treatment for their children. That is understandable.  It is a demand-led scheme and I have no doubt that here, as in other countries, the demand will put pressure on the services that they will not be able to meet in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that numbers have been reduced by a number of factors?  One factor is that the guidelines for the treatment of children have been changed, resulting in a large number of children being struck off the waiting lists?  Families are forced to pay £1,000 or £2,000 for treatment because of the extremely long waiting period. Would the Minister agree that the only way to deal with this appalling two-tier system is by the introduction of orthodontists working on a contract basis for the health boards?</P>

      <P>A number of improvements have taken place and I intend to continue making improvements.  We have provided £2 million extra in the budget to improve orthodontic treatment. Clearly there will be a huge demand and huge resources will be required.  It will not be possible to eliminate the waiting lists because more people will be coming on stream.  It is important that the most urgent cases should be given priority.  That is the object of classification.  In category A, the most severely affected children, there is nobody waiting in any county in the Southern Health Board region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 24, 42, 55 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>Concern for the most vulnerable in society is an underlying theme in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The dependent elderly are among the most vulnerable in today's society.  It is recognised that the current system for subventing dependent elderly persons in nursing homes is in need of rationalisation and improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate last Thursday, a provision of £4 million has been made available <Col N="1418" /> in my Department's Estimate this year to permit the phased implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  This Act creates an important new legal framework for nursing home care in this country.  The Act provides for the registration of voluntary and private nursing homes by health boards and introduces a new system for the subvention of dependent people in nursing homes.  The new system of subvention which will be introduced under the Act will redress many of the current problems in relation to subventions in nursing homes.  Drafting of the regulations needed to implement the Act is at an advanced stage.  I hope to commence the Act by 1 May, provided that agreement can be reached with the interest groups who will be consulted on the regulations.</P>
    <P>There are over 300 private nursing homes in the country with a capacity of more than 5,500 beds.  Just under half the private nursing homes are currently receiving subvention from health boards under sections 26 or 54 of the Health Act, 1970.  It is not possible to say at this stage what number or percentage of these beds will be occupied by persons in receipt of subvention this year under the new Act. The position should become clearer closer to the implementation date of the Act.</P>
    <P>I recognise that private nursing homes have an important role to play in the care of elderly dependent people.  I regret, however, that I have no funds available to help proprietors of such homes who may be experiencing financial difficulties because of the recent currency crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Year of the Elderly.  Will the Minister agree that it is an absolute disgrace that old and infirm people are being shuttled from pillar to post to find a bed in the latter part of their life?  The Minister's reply does not give them any great hope because it has not focused on the question of resources.  In Cork a private nursing home is closing down because of lack of resources.  Will the Minister guarantee that in this Year of the Elderly the necessary resources will be made available to <Col N="1419" /> ensure that old and infirm people will not be treated in this disgraceful fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that I have been six weeks in office and that this Act was passed in 1991.  I am determined to implement it with all possible speed.  To that end, included in the Programme for Government was the phased implementation of it and £4 million was included in the Estimates.  It will cease to be an objective and will become a reality, thanks to the commitment of this Government.  I am very much aware that this is the Year of the Elderly and I provided £440,000 for activities to underscore the Year of the Elderly and solidarity between generations.  Regarding the specific home the Deputy raised, that establishment was very significantly funded last year by the Southern Health Board.  It has received more funding than any other private nursing home in the Southern Health Board region.</P>

      <P>How many beds have been vacated in the acute hospitals arising from the first £500,000 made available? How many beds will be made available from the remaining £4 million?  How were the nursing homes picked to which these elderly long-stay patients were moved from the acute hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraneous question but I will be happy to answer it.  On coming into office I was most anxious to provide proper nursing care for elderly patients not in need of acute care in the general hospital service in Dublin. Within a fortnight of coming to office I provided £500,000 for nursing home care. This was done through the Eastern Health Board and the selection was a matter for them.  They found nursing homes and moved the patients in accordance with their own wishes.</P>

      <P>I do not have the figure in front of me.  I hope that the allocation <Col N="1420" /> has made a significant impact in freeing up beds in acute hospitals and improving the throughput.  It is something that I will be reviewing during the course of the year to ensure that the most appropriate type of accommodation is available to each patient admitted to the health services.</P>

Does the Minister not accept that £65 will go nowhere near meeting the average weekly cost of such homes of probably £250 a week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate the Deputy recognising the alacrity with which I approached this problem on coming to office.  The notion of setting a deadline for 1 May for the implementation is one that the nursing homes organisations regard as very optimistic. The drafting of the recommendations and negotiations are ongoing at a very tight pace and the nursing homes organisations whom I have met have been very appreciative of the speed with which I want to operate and spend this money.</P>
      <P>In relation to the subvention, it is individual patients who are being subvented as opposed to the bed which was the case in the past.  The level of subvention would be a matter for negotiation with the nursing homes organisation in the context of the funds available to me.</P>

Would he agree that it is one of the few nursing homes that deals with medical card holders, that patients, even those aged 99 years, are now, as a result of failure to fund adequately, in danger of being sent from pillar to post around our county?

Could the Minister tell me how many approximately fall into this category?  How much would it cost to provide institutional care in a public institution, public hospital or private nursing home for those?

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome the legislation and I do not want to pre-empt it, but it appears to be a reactive short term measure and I am rather surprised at that.  I thought the Minister would give us a longer term view.  In view of the ageing population which we have, and will have increasingly in the future, what long term plans does the Department have in relation to this whole area?  It seems that what is happening is that the Department is reacting to certain crises particularly affecting the elderly when it is seen that we must allocate money quickly.  However, the longer term implications of the demographic changes in our population are not being considered in any strategic way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is certainly not a knee-jerk reaction.  This Act has been on the Statute Book for some time and I want it implemented.  Notwithstanding that, there are a number of other initiatives. I am advised by a statutory council for the elderly who have a function to advise in relation to the ageing process and how to make preparation for that.  I would hope to address that with a longer view.  No later than last month there was a significant major conference on the whole ageing process, on the ageing of Europe, held in this city.  I look forward to reading the papers from that conference and there will be a number of other initiatives in like fashion throughout this important year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment if, in view of the announcement by Packard Electric, the major employer in the Tallaght region, that it is planning to shed 190 jobs he intends to intervene with the company or take any other steps to try to save the jobs in view of the potentially disastrous impact of such job losses for Tallaght and the surrounding area and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the two questions together since they are on the same topic.  Let me say at the outset that I fully share the concerns expressed at the proposed loss of 190 jobs at Packard Electric (Ireland) Limited from their plant in Tallaght and that I am keeping in close touch with the situation.  Packard Electric (Ireland) Limited are a subsidiary of General Motors.  It has an excellent track record in Ireland and has been manufacturing in Tallaght for the last 18 years.  It currently employs over 1,000 people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other auto component manufacturing companies, Packard have been affected by the ongoing recession in the automobile industry throughout Europe with predictions that sales and output of cars will be down in 1993 compared with 1992.  A range of problems confront Packard today, the main two being the ongoing recession from which recovery is predicted to be slow and competition from low labour cost centres which can maximise profits on the kind <Col N="1425" /> of products which are made in Tallaght. In addition to these problems I understand that there are other factors at play which compound the difficulties at the Irish plant.  These include demands for price reductions from customers, increasing labour and material costs and continuing difficulties due to currency fluctuation.  Obviously, these difficulties must be confronted if the enterprise as a whole is to remain and the company's current plans designed to ensure that they are continuing.</P>
    <P>Packard Electric has entered discussions with trade union representatives to agree the viability plan, which will, I understand, be implemented in the coming few months.  Unfortunately, it is the case that the plan proposes a reduction in staff numbers by 190 over a four month period.  It is proposed that those redundancies will be effected through a voluntary redundancy programme. The House will recognise that, as negotiations on this package are currently taking place, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on particular aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am happy at a more general level that Packard Electric has and will continue to have a strong commitment to Ireland and, in particular, to Tallaght.  The current plan is aimed at returning the company to a profit-making basis as soon as possible.  It has been fully endorsed by the directors of Packard Electric Europe, who will support the Irish plant in every way possible.  I am satisfied that what is now proposed by the company involves the best way forward for the company, the best way to secure the existing jobs of the very substantial numbers of employees remaining at Tallaght.  I have no doubt that once the general slump in the motor industry is turned around &mdash; as no doubt it will be, because this is an industry with definite cyclical trends &mdash; the position in Tallaght will improve substantially.</P>
    <P>The IDA has had a local presence in Tallaght for the past two and a half years. Working closely with community groups and other State agencies, it has brought a range of new foreign and Irish investment <Col N="1426" /> to the area.  The IDA will continue to promote the town vigorously until it succeeds in securing a major new project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that his Department did have earlier warning of this matter and did nothing to intervene, or is he saying that he did not know of the position evolving at Packard Electric in Tallaght?  Where is the job protection unit, which is part of the Programme for a Partnership Government and is designed to try to head off problems such as this?  Would the Minister urgently survey companies around Dublin in particular, which has lost one-third of its industrial base in the past ten years, to determine whether we are facing similar problems elsewhere? Would he arrange to have effective action put in place to find replacement industry in Tallaght, given that some parts of Tallaght have up to 70 per cent unemployment? Has the Minister specific targets and will the IDA report back to him on what has been achieved in targeting that area for replacement industry?</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked several questions.  First, I received very late notice of the Packard Electric decision &mdash; by that, I mean that I received notice in the past couple of days.  Secondly, the employment protection unit is in the process of being established.  The IDA does have an early warning system but that is essentially for companies in receipt of IDA type grants or assistance. Thirdly, as I indicated in my reply, the IDA has been in Tallaght for the past two and a half years and has a mandate from the previous administration, which I now confirm and repeat, to find a major project for the Tallaght region, having regard to the very high level of unemployment in the area as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to ask the Minister once again whether he is in a position to tell the House when the legislation that I understand will be necessary <Col N="1427" /> to establish the job protection unit will come before the House.  I should also like to ask the Minister whether he understands the growing demoralisation in the Tallaght area?  Directly, there are 7,000 people on the live register there, and indirectly there are another 5,000 on the live register in nearby Clondalkin.  The company is the major employer in the region.  Has the Minister yet had an opportunity to have work done to trace whether or not there might be any comparison between the position at Packard Electric and what happened with Digital in Galway in that in recent years the company has established a plant in England? Does the Minister recognise any prospect of the plant in England and the plant in Tallaght competing for a market share in Britain and, having regard to the devastating example of the position at Digital, could he assure the House from the information available to him that that is not a likely scenario in Tallaght? Finally, in the light of my understanding that the unions and the management are due to meet this afternoon, I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to meet a delegation from the trade unions concerned who wish to discuss this and other aspects of the problem with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reply to the questions as they were put to me.  Legislation to give effect to the agency restructuring as recommended in the Culliton report is being formulated, as the Taoiseach said this morning.  However, in advance of that legislation I intend to establish on a non-statutory basis the employment protection unit, drawing together the various components that exist at present and, it is to be hoped, tapping into the informal intelligence network that the trade union movement in particular has around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second question asked by the Deputy, that of a comparison between the plant in the UK and the plant in Ireland, I regret to say that there is now a 40 per cent negative cost differential in labour costs between <Col N="1428" /> Ireland and the UK.  That is compounded in the Tallaght case by an absenteeism rate of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent that increases to 13 per cent on Fridays and Mondays.  As the nature of the work in question is of a low-skilled, labour-intensive kind, the possible sources of competition from other areas within Europe is fairly high.  Finally, as regards the last question raised by the Deputy, as the Deputy is himself a former trade union official he would realise that dragging Ministers into detailed negotiations between employers and workers can on occasions cause confusion rather than find results.  I am quite ready to be available if my presence would be of assistance, but having regard to the skills of trade union officials and their ability to arrive at good solutions I would not dare to intervene unless formally requested to do so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that he did not give the full picture and that the position is much more serious in that the issue has the possibility of being even more catastrophic than that of the Digital plant?  There was a visit to the Packard Electric plant in Tallaght in February by three members of the head board of Packard Electric, including the finance director, and the company has been told that the whole plant in Ireland will go unless it achieves in 1993 cost savings of about £8.5 million, nearly 25 per cent of its turnover.  In the light of that and in the light of the fact that all of the competition does not come from low labour cost countries &mdash; Packard Electric are not even able to compete, as the Minister knows, with high labour cost countries such as Austria because of work practices in Ireland &mdash; will the Minister assist the company by either funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First, does the Minister agree with that analysis, is that what Packard Electric has been told and does the IDA know of it?  Secondly, does the Minister have any plan to help the company to even fund the redundancy package, which will come to £2.5 million, to help it achieve the £8.5 million savings in 1993?  Thirdly, is the Minister in a position to say whether or not he was aware of this matter before yesterday, and, if so, whether he had any discussions with the IDA?  Finally, would the Minister agree that the high cost of employing labour in Ireland is making it more competitiveness for companies such as Packard International&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I thought I had given a very specific reply to the supplementary question in respect of the negative labour costs relative to the UK, which are compounded by the figures for absenteeism for Monday to Friday.  The resolution of the problems is in the hands of the Deputy's constituents and their trade union representatives. I do not know what a Cabinet Minister can do.  I suspect that the Deputy has more influence than I have in that regard.  I have already answered the question in relation to when I heard about the matter.  I will certainly talk to the IDA.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  I am very pleased that the emergency Bill is before the House because it is extremely important to have its provisions enshrined in legislation. However, I am sure that the public would be far more impressed if we did not have to introduce emergency legislation; they would have preferred us to support the Private Members' Bill which was introduced <Col N="1521" /> to the House in 1990 by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  The Bill outlined the ways in which a review of sentence was possible and it should have been accepted then instead of reacting now to the outrage which people feel in relation to the Kilkenny case.  At any rate, I am pleased that the legislation is before the House.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious issue and, unfortunately, hardly a day goes by without yet another revelation of a horrific sexual crime against a woman or child.  Irish society is outraged and angry about this. There is nothing new in violence against women but I want to put it in context.  I believe this Bill is simply part of the move to redress this problem and is not the whole story by any means.</P>
      <P>I want to look at our approach to acts of violence.  There is nothing new in violence but what is new is the interest being taken in the problem and the attention it is receiving, finally, from politicians, the madia, organisations and the Legislature.  I very much welcome the breaking of silence that surrounds this problem.  Our awareness has increased, thanks to the courage of the women who have spoken out.  The greater awareness of equality issues is a move in the right direction but much remains to be done to change attitudes, our mentality and approach to this problem.  Let us make no mistake; attitudes are extremely important and it is the attitudes embedded in the various systems that has stopped us dealing with this problem before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rape and sexual assault are the forms of violence most often reported; but we must remember that the blight of violence against women is spread very widely and encompasses areas such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, prostitution and pornographic exploitation.  We are beginning only now to wake up to the reality in Ireland.  The scale of the problem is not yet reflected in our national statistics or concerns.  We must still strive to understand the taboos and social prejudices surrounding the problem which force most victims of violence to remain silent. Attitudes are changing, but yet only a <Col N="1522" /> few women feel able to break the silence. We must not forget also that many young men are victims of sexual abuse.  This issue must be highlighted and we must ensure that young boys are protected from child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms being put in place in the Bill will help the situation but other mechanisms need to be put in place.  I praise the Minister for the reforming intent behind this Bill.  I suggest that a monitoring mechanism should be set up in the Central Criminal Court to gather statistics on sentencing for rape.  If those statistics disclose an unacceptable discrepancy the Government should consider introducing a mandatory minimum sentence in rape cases.  The Bill suggests that, before sentencing, the victim should be entitled to bring forward evidence as to the effects on her of the crime.  I will comment further about the effects of this sort of crime on the individual.  Seminars should be organised on a regular basis for judges to keep them informed on the up-to-date knowledge of rape, sexual abuse and violence.  This would be extremely helpful.  Our knowledge in this area is growing at a very fast pace and we continuously get new developments and new understandings on the psychopathology, on the personality disorders and problems that lead to these offences. Our Judiciary must be informed of the developments in this area.  We can see very clearly the benefits of such training from the Kilkenny case; indeed the garda involved, Garda Agnes Reddy has been mentioned on many occasions.  The point to take from that is the critical importance of training not only for gardaí, but for teachers and professionals.  In this context may I welcome the development of the Stay Safe Programme and the move to provide it throughout the country. That is the back-drop to the Bill and these are the issues which we must address.</P>
    <P>It is simply not enough to address the problem through the mechanisms put in place by this Bill.  We must tackle the issues in a comprehensive way in the criminal justice system and outside it.  I also support Deputy Shatter's suggestion on the importance of women in such situations <Col N="1523" /> being able to get barring orders. The women concerned feel very often that when the offender is released from prison he will come back to harass them further.  I hope therefore that the amendment to the Bill will be supported tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The question of appointing more women to the Judiciary has still to be tackled.  We certainly need more women in the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that it is the public perception that there is a wide discrepancy in the sentencing for rape which is not readily explicable by the circumstances of the cases as reported.  It is important that society at large, and judges in particular as it is they who pass sentence, should be conscious of the fact that rape is a crime of violence and hatred against women and is not the result of an overwhelming sexual urge and therefore excusable in some way.  Date rape and rape by a stranger are equally traumatic for the woman and date rape should not be treated as a lesser offence.</P>
    <P>The whole question of multi-annual funding &mdash; this was discussed with the Minister for Health at Question Time today &mdash; is essential for rape crisis centres and women's refuges.  The health boards must be instructed to encourage the development of rape crisis centres and women's refuges throughout the country. Because of the situation that has prompted the Bill before us we need to put in place counselling services.  Counselling services must be available for victims and offenders in domestic violence. In the District Court I believe the court clerk should inform offenders and victims about the availability of counselling.  Of course, this means that organisations like the AIM Group for family law reform, which provides excellent information for people in these situations, need to be properly funded so that information about the legal system is available.  The point was well made this morning that even if the provisions are in place but access to information about the legal system is not available to people, it becomes meaningless.  It is critical that <Col N="1524" /> we tackle the whole area of information about the legal services and the law.  If the provisions that we will possibly enact tomorrow are to be relevant, this issue must be tackled.  We know there are many offences, particularly in the area of violence and sexual violence, which do not come to light and remain hidden. Again this problem was aired on the public airways and people were asking what they could do.  Information about the law is critical if people are to get justice from the system.</P>
    <P>I believe the Director of Public Prosecutions should separately brief a legally qualified person to attend a consultation with the complainant prior to the trial to inform and advise her on the court procedures involved and her participation in the trial with a view to rendering the experience less traumatic.  We now have a great deal of information about the trauma that victims experience when going through the legal system.  We must become more victim centred and this procedure would help greatly in this regard.  Unfortunately, we have many victims who end up feeling further traumatised by their experience of the justice system and we must make every effort to ensure this does not happen and that it is a positive experience so that the victim feels it is worthwhile to go to court and use the justice system.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that, immediately prior to trial and as a matter of course, the complainant should be given a copy of her statement to the Garda.  I think the Department of Justice should commission and publish a standard booklet explaining the circumstances attending the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences with particular emphasis on the role of the complainant as witness.  This booklet should be provided routinely to the complainant.  Again we are dealing with the question of information, accessibility, transparency and faith in the justice system.  These procedures will make victims more confident and restore their faith in the justice system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important; it is essential that unduly lenient sentences can be reviewed.  As I have said already, victim <Col N="1525" /> impact statements are important because the full horror of the effects of rape, sexual and physical violence have not been fully comprehended in the justice system.  We have been ambivalent in our approach and that is why we are dealing with this horrific case this week.  It has taken a crime of quite horrific proportions to bring this emergency legislation before the House.  It is horrific that we have allowed this to happen.  I would remind the House that a woman is blind in one eye, she has been physically maimed and people are rightly outraged.  A victim impact statement brings the seriousness of these crimes to light in the courts where sometimes the procedures can dull the sensitivities and the full horror and impact of what has happened.  As the Minister stated yesterday, it brings the law into serious disrepute if the average law abiding citizen begins to lose faith in the due processes of the law.  It is worrying for democracy when our laws lose the respect of law abiding citizens, but respect for the law must be earned and it must be earned in relation to the types of cases which this Criminal Justice Bill seeks to redress.</P>
    <P>Appropriate treatment programmes must be put in place for all offenders. Despite the comments of the previous Minister for Justice we are sadly lacking in this area.  There is one programme for adolescent offenders at present and we badly need to develop more comprehensive programmes in this regard.</P>
    <P>Sexual assaults are often of a very compulsive, obsessive and repetitive nature and it is extremely important that we intervene with young sexual offenders and change their patterns of behaviour before they become more deeply ingrained.  One such programme is currently operating in Dublin.  This work involves a great deal of time and resources and must be done in a multi-disciplinary way.  However, I urge the Minister to support the development of such programmes throughout the country. Research has clearly established that adolescents form a large proportion of offenders in this area and we are failing to give them the attention and treatment they require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> We must intervene at an early stage with these teenage offenders and put correct treatment programmes in place, so that the justice system can intervene effectively, and so that they know they are under supervision in group work.  They should also be confronted with their offence.  As we know from research carried out in this area, a huge number of offenders deny committing such offences.  They are not an easy group with whom to work.  Anyone who has worked with sexual offenders will tell you that they are an extremely complicated and difficult group to treat, but we must not despair about this.  The Minister raised the question of maximum sentences for incest cases.  Obviously, imprisonment is a mechanism which must be used but we must also set up treatment programmes within our prison system and I suggest prioritising the younger group, as I have already said.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this matter was not dealt with in 1990 when Fine Gael introduced a Private Member's Bill.  Reliable statistical information on the extent of sexual violence against women is needed to form Government policy and legislative proposals.  We need information and awareness campaigns at national level to deal with this topic and we must support the work of Women's Aid.  Sex and relationship education in schools would help to inform young people's attitudes to prevent future occurrences of such violence. The public should be encouraged also to assist victims rather than sheltering behind attitudes of non-intervention or even indifference.  We know that victims of sexual assault undergo a serious psychological crisis which may affect their lives for a long time.  A state of more or less constant fear is the most frequent emotional consequence of trauma caused by sexual violence.  We owe it to future generations to face up to this problem and the provisions of this Bill, particularly in relation to the impact statement, the right of appeal and compensation, are important measures which this House must put in place.  We will give the public confidence in the criminal justice system by implementing these measures in our laws.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on an issue that has, for a number of years, been the cause of widespread public concern, real concern that justice has not been seen to be done because sentences handed down by individual judges cannot be challenged, regardless of the circumstances of the individual case, by anyone other than the convicted person.  While I accept what the Minister stated this morning that cases involving exceptionally lenient sentences do not happen every day of the week, nonetheless, we have seen highly publicised individual cases, where sentences are so lenient that they in no way fit the enormity of the crime.  Not only is justice not done, but the sentence does not act as a deterrent and is in many ways counterproductive because the message it sends out is that the State and society do not regard the crime as particularly serious.  This in no small way encourages others to continue with the commission of similar crimes and leaves their victims traumatised with a feeling of utter helplessness.</P>
      <P>This was dramatically portrayed in the sentencing of drug pushers, particularly those involved in hard drugs, in the early eighties.  At that time there was a public outcry, culminating in protest marches to the doors of the courtrooms because the Judiciary seemed to have no conception of the horrendous effects involved from the large scale introduction of heroin to poverty stricken areas of Dublin's inner city.  However, the protest marches, and the public pressure they helped to generate, resulted in heavier sentencing varying between ten and 14 years in certain cases over a period of one or two years.  The Oireachtas followed suit with the introduction of life sentences for hard drug pushers.  As a direct result of public pressure and media attention the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984, was introduced, section 6 of which made provision for increasing the maximum sentence for a convicted drug pusher from 14 years to life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to that because since the Bill became law, to the best of my knowledge, no court has imposed a life sentence on <Col N="1528" /> any convicted drug pusher.  In recent years the sentences imposed have been more lenient and most of them were for periods which were less than half those imposed after the Bill was passed.  It appears that when the hue and cry has died down the sentences reverted to the earlier derisory penalties of little more than two years imprisonment for heroin pushing, even for those who were on their third or fourth conviction for the same type of offence.  As a result heroin pushing, and consequent heroin addiction, is again on the increase in Dublin.  Those working in our drug treatment centres recently warned of a marked increase in the number of new addicts contacting them for help.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that this happens because members of the Judiciary are at best out of touch with the major social problems afflicting not just families but whole communities as a result of the peddling of heroin.  Those involved will stop at nothing and callously inflict immense suffering on vulnerable young people destroying their lives out of greed for easy money.  At worst the Judiciary, who fail to see the seriousness of this crime, simply could not care less because this problem mainly affects poor communities. Yet, if the same heroin pushers peddled their evil trade in those affluent neighbourhoods where judges reside, exposing their children to the horrors of hard drug addiction, I have no doubt that the maximum life sentence would be regularly imposed.  This seems to be yet another example of one law for the rich and another for the poor.</P>
    <P>If members of the Judiciary were obliged to attend in-service courses, involving visits to hospital wards and drug treatment centres or attend the funerals of victims of AIDS or drug overdoses, their sentencing policy for heroin pushers might be dramatically different.  The Minister should convey this message to the Judiciary and urge it to take a stronger line more in keeping with the offence and impose heavy sentences, for example, the life sentence, which the Legislature provided.  Such sentences must be imposed not just for drug <Col N="1529" /> offences but for sex offences which we have heard debated today and other types of serious crimes.</P>
    <P>There should be some formal procedure for updating policy on sentencing on an ongoing basis involving the Minister, the Judiciary and the Garda.  This would be more satisfactory than simply responding to media pressure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the more serious crime of murder and draw attention to a murder case which is very relevant to the issues before the House.  I refer to the case of Tina Caffrey, a young woman who lived in my constituency of north inner city Dublin.  She was savagely murdered in her home on the evening of 4 November 1991.</P>
    <P>On the same day her aged father had been removed to hospital.  Significantly, this murder case received very little media attention.  The bulk of the coverage it eventually received directly resulted from the persistent efforts of the victim's family not to let her murder be forgotten.  The man who murdered her still walks the streets of the inner city perhaps capable of committing the same crime again.  I have no doubt that the reason Tina Caffrey's murder received so little media attention was because she was not a well to do middle class person living in an affluent area.  If she had been I am certain her murderer would not be free today.  She was a young woman from the inner city living in relatively poor circumstances.  Her murder was reported in the national papers and then largely forgotten.  As far as the middle class madia was concerned she was a nobody and they treated her as such.  I emphasise this point not simply because I believe this to be the case, as I do, but because Tina's family feel strongly that nobody cared about her murder.  They hold the views I have expressed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an article published in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 5 February 1993 as a result of the persistent efforts of the victim's family to draw attention to the case.  The article states:</P>
    <P>The family believe the media were <Col N="1530" /> not interested in the death of an inner-city woman.</P>
    <P>They say that no photographs of Tina were sought for the newspapers, no approaches were made to find out about her background and her last hours, no members of the family were asked about their feelings.</P>
    <P>The family are quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>We want the public to know about it and care about it... We don't want people to think that she was just a nobody.  She belonged to a family.</P>
    <P>The family's sense of hurt and frustration was increased all the more because Tina's murder happened more or less in tandem with the murder of another young woman which received massive media attention.  Both murders occurred within a relatively short time of one another, both were equally savage and brutal and one received sustained media coverage, the other virtually none. The question must be asked why?  Tina was poor and from the inner-city, the other person was affluent and the media were concerned.  The family of Tina Caffrey had no means of obtaining justice on her behalf.  The gardaí have no doubts about Tina's murderer.  It is possible that irregularities in the Garda handling of the case has prevented justice being done.  I will not misuse my privilege in the House by being more specific but the case is profoundly disturbing.  While the murderer is known to the Garda it has not been possible for justice to be done.</P>
    <P>This is not a case of too lenient a sentence but one of no sentence being imposed.  I have asked the Minister for Justice to meet with members of Tina's family.  I wrote to her on 5 February 1993 and pointed out that the family wished to inform her of some serious and disquieting aspects of the murder inquiry. I received an acknowledgement to that letter, but that is all.  There was no massive media coverage of this case despite the fact that it involved what presumably is the most serious crime of all, that of murder.  The questions have to be <Col N="1531" /> asked: is the public outraged?  Is the law in disrepute?  Is the Minister interested?</P>
    <P>Tina's family hopes to undertake civil proceedings but the costs involved are beyond their means.  Perhaps if they could do so they might feel they have achieved some justice.  They do not need the introduction of a new law; they need the financial support to pursue certain legal channels.  My question to the Minister, if she were here, or to the Minister of State, if he were here, is: should the State help this family with the costs involved?  I think it most certainly should. However, it is not possible to ask the question because the Minister has not the time to meet the family.  I hope the Minister will urgently have this murder case reopened and re-examined and that if there is a way of ensuring that justice is done the Minister's legal advisers will find that way.  I have to emphasise that every time there is an official response to a highly publicised matter, as is the case today &mdash; quite rightly there should be such a response to such a horrific case &mdash; the trauma of Tina Caffrey's family is made more terrible because they feel Tina has been forgotten, that they are forgotten or do not count and that her murderer is safe in the knowledge that justice will not be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a matter to which I drew the attention of the House in a debate last week on juvenile crime and which is very relevant to the horrific Kilkenny incest case.  A report on child care, child abuse and child sexual abuse states that in the eighties there was a dramatic increase in social problems on a number of fronts.  There was an eleven fold growth in the annual confirmed cases of child abuse &mdash; 156 confirmed cases in 1983 to 1,658 in 1989.  There was an increase in cases involving sexual abuse from 37 in 1983 to 568 in 1989.  These adverse trends, the report suggests, produce an unmistakable picture of unremitting social stress against which is pitted a band of community care social workers whose numbers have not increased in that time.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties there were 298 <Col N="1532" /> social workers and that number has increased to 309, a very small increase indeed.  Social workers and community care workers, who are charged with the responsibility of detecting child abuse and child sexual abuse, are now at a crisis point.  The report states that the perverse result is that problems are neglected until they have become a crisis which is costly and difficult to resolve.  It states that the sad reality is that currently health board child care services have no energy to devote to preventative work, given that all their resources are soaked up by crisis and fire brigade intervention.</P>
    <P>Those statistics and that statement are very relevant to the fact that the case which resulted in the introduction of this legislation was undetected for 16 years. The difficulty is that undoubtedly similar cases will go undetected, not because people are not doing their job but because this House and this Government are not making available the necessary resources to implement the provisions of the Child Care Act.  The total estimated resource required to implement the provisions of that Act in full is £58 million over a seven year period, commencing when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed in January 1991.  In terms of resources allocated to date, £1 million was allocated in 1991 and £2 million in 1992; I am not sure if any money was allocated in 1993.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a campaign group involved in community care and care of children at risk, a group that has come together to highlight the total neglect of child care.  They say there is no great value in devolving new functions to health boards under the Child Care Act, 1991, if the boards are not in a position because of lack of resources and staffing to carry them out.  If this Government fails to provide these resources to the health boards there can be no doubt but that there will be more cases such as the one that has resulted in this legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille seo cé go bhfuil sé mall.  Bá chóir go mbéadh sí againn blianta ó shin ach is dócha go <Col N="1533" /> mbíonn gach tosach mall.  Sa Dáil seo bíonn gach tosach an-mhall go minic.  Ach tá sé againn anois agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé maitheas don tír uilig.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that a case as horrific as the Kilkenny case had to occur before people were brought to their senses to bring in this Bill.  As has been mentioned, the Bill could have been introduced three years ago, but because of the system whereby only the wise people sit on the Government benches and the unwise sit in Opposition, nothing good can come from the Opposition.  A Bill, no matter how good or well intentioned, proposed by the Opposition is never accepted by Government because it is seen to be a sign of weakness.  It is time we moved from that position to the stage where good ideas from the Opposition are accepted.  It is because of this system that the Dáil on so many occasions appears to be irrelevant to the public who are looking at what we are doing.</P>
      <P>It would be strange if in the event of the Government falling and those people coming to the Opposition benches, they lost all their wisdom.  People gain knowledge and experience from being in Government and just because they may change sides that knowledge and wisdom should not disappear.  We are a couple of years late in dealing with this problem, but it is better late than never.  If this Bill helps to prevent injustice in the future we welcome it.  There must be a deterrent for crime.</P>
      <P>We live in a country that is reputedly more Christian than any other in the world and we convince ourselves that we have over 90 per cent practising Christians but one would begin to wonder if the quotation about lies, damn lies and statistics and everything going together is not true.  We should know Christians by their actions.  The outward show of church going means little if people do not practise their religion, and if people were practising their religion we would not have the crime we have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without deterrents we will not discourage criminals who seem to feel free to do what they like.  Setting standards <Col N="1534" /> for people who do not believe in standards does not work.  Very often thugs cannot take what comes to them afterwards. Bullies are often the ones who squeal most when they come under pressure. There is much discussion on the radio at the moment about bullying in schools.  This is a very serious problem. In my 30 years experience in teaching I found that bullies in the playground, if they thought they would get away with it, would have great fun at the expense of the children whose lives they were making a misery of.  If they were to get punished they would soon stop.  In the days when corporal punishment was allowed in schools it was far easier to stop a bully running amok in the playground. Nowadays teachers think they can talk to these people.  Invariably if one can talk to a person he will not act the bully in the classroom or in the playground.  One must be able to deal with the people to whom one cannot talk.  I very much regret the passing of corporal punishment in cases whereby one could deal quickly and effectively with bullying.  Very often the primary school bully is the person who grows up to be a bully.  When one reads about some of the crimes committed today one wonders what the perpetrators were like when they were young.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to offer some of my time to Deputy Durkan.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We must introduce deterrents because if we do not, the situation will be even worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was young and innocent I thought all judges were modern day Solomons who never made mistakes.  It was a long time before I realised that judges are very human and very arrogant at times.  Having limited experience of judges, I was amazed at the arrogance of one judge when he completely misjudged <Col N="1535" /> a case.  Of course, one would be up for contempt of court if one dared to say anything.  It is no harm that the Director of Public Prosecutions can call into question the judgments given by some judges. I am sure that most judges are reasonable and wise but they should never presume that they can form dogmatic views and be correct all the time.  Some judges can be extreme.  We had a very public case in Carlow some years ago where a poor girl was killed by a hit and run driver who got a very lenient sentence while for a much more minor crime there was a more severe sentence.  This Bill is tackling that sort of disparity in sentencing.  I hope the DPP will allow justice to be done and be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill which takes into account the effect of crime on a victim is welcome.  A rape can destroy the life of the victim and that must be borne in mind when passing sentence. While some rapist may laugh his way out of court, the laugh should be put on the other side of his face when the judge considers the effect on the victim of the rape sentence.  We consider rape as being a more horrific crime but there is a traumatic effect too, on a bank employee who has a gun put to his head or on an old person whose house is ransacked.  Thugs who commit these crimes should have to account for the long term effect of their activities on the victims and they should be severely rapped on the knuckles.</P>
    <P>I welcome the compensation provision. Some people would not think much about serving a month in jail but they would not like the idea of having to pay compensation.  The Minister said the Bill provides for a compensation order to be made for any injury or loss unless the court sees reason to the contrary.  I would not be worried about the case of a fellow who might not have enough money to go off drinking at the weekends.  I would be very severe on him.  I would keep him very sober for a long time and make sure he paid from his pocket, no matter how little he had.  He should be the one to suffer and I would not go overboard in looking after him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> People who use knives in rows are low types.  There is much to be said for settling a row by boxing.  There is something awfully wrong when knives are used, and in those circumstances sentencing should be severe.  We must try to protect the quality of life.  Many people have little except the freedom to go for a walk, leave the door open, go to bed in comfort or whatever.  We should do everytyhing possible to maintain the quality of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity to contribute. One reason all Members have taken an interest in this legislation is because it is topical.  It is a coincidence that it is topical now as it has been topical many times over the past number of years.  Unfortunately, opportunities to take action to deal with the situation were missed.</P>
      <P>I know of the problems we have in this House in relation to the <i>sub judice</i> rule and that this precluded us from becoming involved.  Perhaps it is a good thing that we do not comment regularly on decisions from the courts, but, whether we like it or not, we have reached a stage &mdash; I am not so sure that this legislation will deal with it entirely &mdash; where the victim pays, as opposed to the perpetrator of the crime.  That is the clear message that has gone out, whether in schools, the social or commercial areas.  There seems to be a general acceptance that the victim should pay.  There seems to be a perception that by fair means or foul, the perpetrator of crime will evoke sufficient sympathy or support at the right time to have his sentence or penalty mitigated. That is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>This legislation is years late.  We could have adopted something similar a couple of years ago, when a Private Members' Bill was prepared by this side of the House.  That would have helped us deal with the problem we now face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with one or two of the more noticeable crimes which impact on us at the time and then recede into the distance.  I have in mind the crime of permanent disfigurement, whether of man, woman or child.  When the particular case goes to court the court procedures <Col N="1537" /> have to be properly followed and pursued in such a way as to secure a conviction.  For some reason there appears to be a tendency &mdash; I am not making any criticism of the legal profession &mdash; to ensure that the perpetrator, the assailant, is given his or her rights; every constitutional means is found whereby the assailant gets his rights and there is little regard for the victim.  We have referred to this problem frequently in the House.  Various victim support groups have been set up throughout the country and we now have recognition of the need for compensation.  I often wonder what compensates for some of the crimes perpetrated against some unfortunate people.  I do not wish to go through the same litany which we followed a few weeks ago in naming the various potential victims of crime nowadays, but they are many and varied and go right through the social and economic strata.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we are supposed to be a caring and progressive society we have shown no sign of progress whatsoever in that area.  I wonder whether this legislation will achieve the kind of progress we need.  It is fine to say we are liberal, and I hope we are a liberal society.  There is nothing liberal about allowing an assailant who has wrought havoc on a victim to get off easily.  In fact, that is regressive, it is dangerous and it leads potential criminals to believe they have <i>carte blanche</i> and can continue in the role they have set for themselves. This legislation may deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>If there is need for legislation &mdash; and this has been clearly shown for some considerable time &mdash; then it is obvious that some time should be taken before the legislation is drafted and introduced and processed through the House.  Bad cases make bad law.  It was obvious to all of us for some time that there was a need for this legislation.  If that was established why did we not have the legislation before now?  Why do we have to bring it forward at short notice and dispatch it in the shortest possible time, because that is simply responding to a fire brigade <Col N="1538" /> situation.  That is not a good thing.  It would be better to have put more care and thought into the legislation.  That is not in any way to denigrate the Minister or the drafts people who have prepared the legislation.  In my time in this House &mdash; and there are people who are here much longer than I &mdash; I have noticed that legislation enacted quickly in response to emergency situations does not always cater for all eventualities which it is supposed to do, in the final analysis.</P>

      <P>At the outset I welcome the legislation before the House today.  I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, and also the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for the speed with which she has responded to the issues being addressed in this legislation.  As this is the first time I have contributed on new legislation since she became Minister, I should say that I take great confidence from the fact that, for the first time ever in the history of the State, we have a woman at the helm in the Department of Justice.  That is encouraging.  The particular lady in question is strong and straight and will tackle the great backlog of law reform that needs to be tackled with a sense of urgency.  That is not to take from my confidence in the Minister of State present, Deputy O'Dea, in regard to his capacity and his professional ability to be of enormous assistance in that Department, where so much remains to be done. Much of our criminal law is out of date, many of our institutions are out of date, many of the personnel are over burdened and there is a great need for a range of urgent reforms throughout the whole judicial system.  I am confident that there will be a major speeding up of reforms <Col N="1539" /> under the present Government under the two people to whom I have paid tribute.</P>
      <P>The immediate events that prompted the legislation here today are harrowing and horrendous.  I will not go into any further detail, because much has been said about this matter already today, except to say that like every other citizen, male as well as female, I am deeply wounded and very hurt at what has happened in Kilkenny in two cases during the past year.  Much suffering and pain has been inflicted on this young girl in the Kilkenny incest case and on a great many people throughout the country whose cases do not receive the same degree of publicity.  That situation must cause us all to examine our collective conscience.  It is an established fact that the perpetrators of incest and child abuse are in a great many cases the victims of child abuse in their own youth.  That being so, if we are ever to confront the horrible problem of child abuse we will have to put in place a better system of child abuse prevention that will help to protect as fully as possible the children of this generation and prevent this terrible cycle of sex abuse spilling off on to the next generation.  In this respect I pay tribute to the members of the INTO who, in conjunction with the health boards, have developed the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme in schools.  I hope that programme will be extended to all our schools and, if it proves satisfactory, will be extended to second level.  I put a lot of faith in the implementation of that programme.  Prevention has to be the key.  It is very difficult to reverse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to take 20 minutes, I think we could extend some generosity in the matter and perhaps we could extend the same facility to Deputy Keogh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very kind of you and I appreciate it.  At the end of the day prevention is the key.  The damage done to victims is so horrendous that we have to harness all the resources of the community, whether within education, the <Col N="1540" /> home, the Church or the media, in a proper programme that will prevent and eradicate the terrible scandal of child abuse from our society.  Once the damage is done it is very difficult to reverse it. The damage done as a result of incest and child abuse spreads into many subsequent generations.  It is horrendous, it is part of the dark and ugly side of our society and it is one we must confront with all the professional advice we have at our fingertips.  Goodwill on all our parts would help to put in place a proper framework to stem it at source and prevent it happening in the first place. When it does happen we should ensure there is early intervention to reverse the damage and cure the symptoms.</P>
      <P>Essentially we are dealing with legislation, which is our primary function as TDs in this House.  I fully support the principle of putting in place an appeals mechanism as advocated in this legislation and I compliment the Minister on responding so quickly.</P>
      <P>The young, innocent victims of incest and child abuse must receive all the necessary support, professional and otherwise, which we can harness within the community to enable them to confront as successfully as possible the consequences of the crime which has been visited upon them.  However, sympathy, support and understanding are not enough.  We must also put in place good, strong and fair law which in its application will act not alone to protect all our citizens and fully vindicate their rights but which will provide appropriate compensation for the victims of crime.  Above all, good law should act as a deterrent to would-be criminals and sentences deriving from the law should be sufficiently severe to cause a would-be abuser to stop in his tracks.  To put it simply, if they think they can get away with it abusers will continue to abuse but if they know and it is clearly communicated to them from this House that there is in place good strong law which will be fully implemented and that sentences will be rigorously and fully enforced they will be deterred from committing abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect I hope that all sex abuse <Col N="1541" /> cases which have been validated by social workers in health boards, reported to the Garda and subsequently reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions will be fully responded to by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in every respect.  If young people who go to the trouble, in conjunction with their parents, of reporting cases to the appropriate health board and it subsequently transpires that they never hear another word about that case they will get the feeling that the law is not working on their behalf, that the law is not offering them the protection they believe they need. This, in turn, will send them into the adult world with a very jaundiced impression of the law.  That is not a proper environment in which to raise young people.  What I am saying is that all cases which are validated and reported have to be appropriately responded to.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>This legislation envisages giving power to the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide when an appeal is justified.  That is the correct decision, this is the correct way to proceed.  Because of its independent nature, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is the appropriate office to deal with this matter.  However, both the Director of Public Prosecutions and his office should be given extra assistance to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to adjudicate fully in cases which become the subject of an appeal. I do not have any cast iron idea as to how this might be done, but I wish to outline what I have in mind.  The Minister might take my suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>It is important to put in place some kind of advisory body to whom the Director of Public Prosecutions could refer in the case of an appeal.  If such an advisory body was set up it would be important that there would be a strong input from women somewhere in its mechanism.  I believe all of us now realise that there is a remarkable absence of women in key areas of the law and that when an opportunity presents itself to put a new mechanism in place we should use that opportunity to involve properly qualified and suitable women.  It is most regrettable <Col N="1542" /> that there is not a stronger input by women into this vital area of law and its application.</P>
    <P>If the Minister considers accepting my suggestion to put in place an advisory body to assist the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; I appeal to the Minister to do this &mdash; it would give us an opportunity to involve more women in that area of law, particularly as it relates to cases of child abuse and incest.  It is very important that there is balanced representation on any panel and that we do not exclude women who have the necessary experience, instinct and intuition from deliberating on how our law is worked out.  If an opportunity presents itself, we should make provision for the involvement of women on such an advisory body.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to consider putting in place a code of practice which would permit the Director of Public Prosecutions to make submissions to a sentencing judge in the first instance in relation to what he perceives to be the appropriate sentence in a given case.  If, as a result of the enactment of this law, we require the Director of Public Prosecutions to make a judgment on these matters in the case of an appeal, it would seem to be entirely consistent that we would require him to make an additional recommendation in relation to the hearing as it happens in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It very often happens that the case for the prosecution in court is very weak in comparison with the case for the defence. This happens because those who can afford to pay for an expensive and extensive defence counsel have a disproportionate advantage over the other party in court.  Any measure which can be taken to redress that imbalance ought to be taken now in the context of this legislation.  I will be framing amendments along these lines which I hope the Minister will look at sympathetically.</P>
    <P>When there is an imbalance in court very often the general public perceive that our courts are more courts of law than courts of justice.  This is a bad impression to give as it will lead to a jaundiced view of the judicial process and <Col N="1543" /> will breed disrespect for the law among our citizens.  This cannot be healthy or good and any measure which seeks to remedy this situation should be built into this legislation.  Nothing erodes public confidence in the judicial system more than the spectacle of well-known criminals getting away with it, so to speak, because the law in many respects is too weak to deal with their crimes.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is very disheartening for members of the Garda Síochána who in many cases go to enormous pains and, in some cases put their lives at risk, to bring a case before the court only to find that the sentence is totally out of proportion to the gravity of the crime or, as sometimes happens, the case is thrown out on a mere technicality.  This is very disheartening for the gardaí involved and anything which can be done to remedy this situation will be a step in the right direction.  I have watched this trend developing in recent years, and I would very much like to see it confronted and remedied.</P>
    <P>The sentence imposed should at all times and in all cases reflect fully the gravity of the offence and take fully into account the impact, psychological and otherwise, which the crime has had on the victim.  It has been said by many speakers here that we must build into our laws a better balance between the rights of the victim and the rights of the perpetrator. This balance has gone out of kilter and we must build it back into our laws.  Accordingly, not alone should we put in place an appeals mechanism, as is now recommended, but we should also seek to put in place a better system of mandatory compensation for the victims of crime.  There was a semblance of such a system in place up until 1984-85 when it was dismantled.  We need to put in place a proper system which will compensate the victims of crime in a correct fashion.  If this means that we have to impose more fines as sentences &mdash; I wish we would do this for more reasons than one, one of the reasons being the scarcity of places in prisons &mdash; it would be proper and in line with justice if those moneys <Col N="1544" /> were put towards a fund which would provide proper compensation for the victims of crime.  As long as crime continues to pay handsomely, people will take the risk.</P>
    <P>Sentencing has been very much an issue in relation to the Kilkenny incest case.  We all regret the short duration of the sentence imposed, which is not consistent with the gravity of the crime and the damage inflicted on that young woman, her child, her mother and other members of her family.  We must put in place legislation on the lines of the Punishment of Offenders Act in the United Kingdom, under which legislators lay down clear and up-to-date sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary.  We need to do this, in fairness to ourselves and to the Judiciary.  There would then be less need for the kind of appeal mechanism we are discussing.  While I welcome the mechanism, justice ought to be done at the first hearing.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  If a victim has to go to a court of appeal, that inflicts additional pain and suffering on that person.  We must ensure that we get it right in the first instance. That means laying down a more clear and coherent sentencing policy to guide and assist our judges.  Such policy should be regularly reviewed, perhaps annually.</P>
    <P>We must make better provision for in-service courses for the Judiciary.  In common with parents and teachers, judges are being called on to confront situations which were not prevalent when they were growing up.  All of us must update our skills.  We must put in place a mechanism that would enable judges to confer one with the other and to have occasional conferences.  There must be ongoing monitoring of sentences.  The ultimate aim must be to make the punishment fit the crime, to cite <i>The Mikado.</i></P>
    <P>Judges have their difficulties.  They hand down sentences which they believe to be just, but those sentences are seldom fully served.  There is need for a proper penal code and penal system.  The focus on the courts is correct but it must be followed through into the prison system. Any upgrading of sentencing policy and procedure must be accompanied by a <Col N="1545" /> parallel upgrading of our penal policy. There must be an adequate number of prison places, as well as a range of alternatives to custody at the disposal of every judge.  As soon as one prisoner is sentenced, another prisoner is released <i>ipso facto</i> to make way.  Down the years the Department of Justice has carefully concealed the rate of rotation of the revolving door.  The whole process, because it is so secret, has become very suspect.</P>
    <P>To rectify this, I recommend that the Minister for Justice be required to publish annually in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the number of sentences commuted or remitted under the 1951 Act.  If that were done, those in public life would be in a position to ask questions and to submit the whole process to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to put in place this year a proper parole system in accordance with the excellent recommendations of the Whitaker report.  We also need an independent parole board so that any reforms and improvements in sentencing or in the way the courts dispense justice will lead to corresponding improvements in the prison system and in the development of alternatives to custody, thereby enabling the judges to dispense justice in the confident knowledge that the rest of the judicial system supports them in their judgments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill which was brought before us so speedily. The fact that the Minister for Justice is a woman might be one of the reasons the Bill was brought forward in such a dramatic and speedy way.  I have no doubt that the junior Minister shares her concerns and I know his commitment in this area.</P>
      <P>This is a comparatively short Bill.  My first thought is that it is unfortunate that the Bill is needed, particularly its first provision.  It is a fire brigade action, but if there is a fire we must put it out.  In this case we have had a number of fires &mdash; nearly a conflagration.  I do not like this piecemeal approach but at least something is being done.  In that context we must welcome the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a sentence is inadequate and unduly <Col N="1546" /> lenient there should be a mechanism by which it can be appealed and a more appropriate sentence substituted.  It is unthinkable that such a circumstance should arise.  There should be clearcut guidelines on sentencing, ensuring the consistency that we require so that justice is not only done but is seen to be done. That is very important for the victims of crime.  Often people do not report the awful crimes of rape and child abuse because in many cases justice is not seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments about the training of judges and the drawing up of consistent guidelines on sentencing policy.  This has been completely neglected. There is no use in appealing against unduly lenient sentences unless the judges have guidelines on which to operate.  I am not in favour of mandatory sentencing.  Calls for it are born out of a general sense of frustration, mainly by women's groups, because of the unsatisfactory nature of many of the sentences, especially in rape cases.  It is understandable that those calls be made, but the logic behind them is flawed.  We must examine each case on its merits.  What we need are guidelines, not mandatory sentencing.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that it takes so-called hard cases to mobilise action in the whole area of sexual abuse and violence, towards women and girls in particular. However, we should not forget that it is young people in general that we should be concerned about, both boys and girls, who are the victims of sexual abuse &mdash; unfortunately, primarily within the home.  This legislation only tinkers with that broader problem.  It is really closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. That is unfortunate, but at least something is being done.  It is not nearly enough and much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Although I welcome the remedial action provided for in the Bill, I could not allow the opportunity to pass without speaking on the whole context in which we have to make these laws.  This morning Minister Joan Burton mentioned the Safety of Women Conference which she attended in Dublin last October.  I too <Col N="1547" /> attended that conference.  It was a facinating opportunity for any legislator to be present at such a conference because it provided a forum for women to be very open about the many aspects of concern, from child abuse to violence against women, and it challenged all of us to reflect on the type of society which allows abuses such as incest to fester within it.  On this we are all blameworthy; we cannot pass the buck on this one.  We all must examine our own motivation and realise that these things are problematic and difficult to deal with.  However, we have to take on board what is the reality of our society and deal with it effectively.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting contributions in that seminar came from the chief probation officer for Hertfordshire in England, and she is one person who really should know about this.  She said that there is a continuum, from discrimination against women to sexual harassment in the work place to violence against women, and that what connects them is that women are insufficiently valued for their contribution, the way they work and the qualities in which they specialise. That underpins the whole attitude in society towards women, towards sexual abuse and the other areas of incest and rape.  If society is to be a safer place for women, who are in the main the victims of whom we speak, women must be seen as people to be valued and appreciated for the contribution they make to society as a whole.  That is cradle to grave stuff. It reflects in our laws; it reflects in our education.</P>
    <P>My colleague referred to the work done by the INTO.  I served on the Women's Rights Committee during the terms of the last Dáil and Seanad and it was amazing to see how little is being done in the whole area of sexism, leading to attitudinal values and the whole area of abuse, towards children in particular. The only work being done is being spearheaded by the INTO.  It is tremendous to see them taking on that responsibility, but they should not have to do that; that is our responsibility as legislators.  It is the responsibility of the Department of <Col N="1548" /> Education.  At least somebody is doing it, but why is the lead not coming from where it should come?</P>
    <P>All of this begs the question about representation of women at all levels of public and political life.  It makes one realise that our society is worse off for the non-representation of women at all levels.  That is a very important point. I heard the reference this morning to Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club.  I was very disappointed at the reaction of a colleague on this side of the House because there was a lack of understanding of what the reluctance of a social club to have women as full members really means.  It indicates an attitude toward women and it is something that one does not understand fully unless one is a woman.  I thought it was very interesting to hear a man get extremely defensive about that. I was very disappointed.  It is something I would like to have the opportunity to discuss further at a different forum.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Quill, stole my line when she quoted Gilbert and Sullivan. That phrase &ldquo;to make the punishment fit the crime&rdquo; is very apt.  It comes from a 19th century musical with 19th century sentiments.  We are in the latter part of the 20th century and we should focus on the type of society we have, where women in particular can deal with the trauma of violence.  It is very apt that the punishment should fit the crime, but we should not get too focused on punishment.  We need to talk about things like the empowerment of women so that they are not victims in society but full members and not &ldquo;lady associate members&rdquo; of this society of ours.</P>
    <P>It is incredible, in this day and age, that we have to warn women and children that women are most likely to be threatened, battered and sometimes killed within their own homes by husbands, boyfriends, casual acquaintances or friends, and that children are more at risk of abuse at the hands of their father or close family members, trusted adults or those in authority, and that even women's leisure is curtailed by concern for their personal safety.  We live in a society where, despite the extra few bob <Col N="1549" /> thrown to them, the women's aid and rape crisis centres are poorly funded. They are operated on a shoestring.  In the past the women who operated those essential services were regarded as well meaning amateurs who did not know what they were about.  Happily that view has changed.  However, the lack of sufficient funding still remains a scandal.</P>
    <P>We should ask why women should take on the responsibility of avoiding crime. Why should the solution for battered women be to go to refuges which are full and underfunded?  We should confront the type of society that allows this to happen.</P>
    <P>This can be addressed by legislation and that is why I welcome this type of legislation.  Even if it is tinkering, at least it is dealing with the subject.  The subject must also be addressed on a different level.  Of course, we have to assure those who are the victims that they will be helped and treated in a caring fashion when they have to go through the trauma of going to court.</P>
    <P>The type of society that we require has to operate on two levels in regard to this type of problem.  On the one hand it has to deal with the problem in a fair and equitable fashion and justice should be seen to be done, sentences seen to be fair and the procedures put into operation that will make that happen.  On the other hand we should have the alleviating circumstances within society which tries to avoid these things happening in the first place.  That is very simple to say but very difficult to put into action.  If we have the type of approach from our legislators &mdash; and to be fair we are seeing it from the Minister and the Minister of State &mdash; that will allow attitudes in society to change, then we are on the right road.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see that we may very well have a Women's Rights Committee set up again.  Much of the work that was done in relation to changing attitudes and helping our legislators was done by that committee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other two elements of the Bill, I recognise the validity of placing an obligation on sentencing courts to take into account the effect sexual or violent <Col N="1550" /> crime has on the victim, but I am one of those to whom the Minister refers who asks how the effect on the victim is to be brought to the attention of the courts. From that point of view I applaud the work being done by the Irish Society for Victim Support who championed the rights of the victim all this time while maintaining a balanced view on dealing with and rehabilitating offenders.  It is very difficult when one is the victim of a crime.  I have been mugged twice.  Fortunately, I was not hurt much, maybe my pride&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and my purse, most certainly.  I remember the immediate feelings of anger and the urge to run after them and hit them with something. Unfortunately, I had no handbag to hit them with so there was no point in running after them.  I remember that feeling of anger and frustration and thinking what I would do with them if I got them. Of course, that subsides after five minutes and one starts thinking again about the circumstances that lead people into that kind of crime.  In the realm of more serious crime, it is good that those who wish to support victims take a balanced view in relation to offenders as well.</P>
      <P>One aspect that I do not think is good enough &mdash; the Minister referred to this &mdash; is that in each case it will be a matter for the court to decide how to discharge the obligation of informing itself as to the effect of the crime on the victim.  That aspect should be teased out a little more and I hope it will be possible to do so on Committee Stage.  This takes us back to the issue of consistency; who is to make a decision and whether judges will have different attitudes.  The training of the Judiciary is a matter for consideration. There will be difficulties if the decisions are to be left to individual discretion.  This legislation is before the House because of difficulties resulting from the exercise of individual discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that there be an onus on offenders to pay to their victims compensation <Col N="1551" /> for the injury or loss.  The quarrel of the Irish Association for Victim Support with that provision is that we should learn from the experience in the United Kingdom, where problems arise when offenders do not have the means to pay compensation.  That should be teased out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has been brought before the House in a speedy manner.  I regret that it is necessary. I make the appeal that on occasions such as this we examine our consciences and ask ourselves what kind of a society we want.  Are we to continue to pretend that cases of child abuse, incest and rape do not happen to the extent that they obviously do?  Several speakers today quoted a very disturbing statistic from the ICA &mdash; an association not known for exaggeration &mdash; that up to one-third of Irish women have been sexually abused at some stage.  That frightening statistic should be examined.  It means that in many ways our society is sick and we have to do what is necessary to make it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment both the Minister and the Minister of State for the speedy way in which the legislation has been brought forward.  To say that the Bill will be widely welcomed would be to understate the position.  As a person involved in the legal profession I can say that the degree of public concern about the non-availability of a mechanism to review what are perceived to be lenient sentences has given rise to what could be described best as a highly charged atmosphere, especially in the past 12 to 18 months.</P>
      <P>Of course, even though the general public may not be aware of this, under Article 34 of the Constitution the DPP has the power to appeal certain sentences to the Supreme Court.  He can appeal any sentence imposed by the Central Criminal Court and the division of the High Court exercising criminal jurisdiction. To my knowledge, that power has been rarely, if ever, used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives statutory recognition to the right of the DPP to appeal.  I suggest <Col N="1552" /> to the Minister of State that he examine Article 34 of the Constitution in Relation to section 2 of the Bill.  Under Article 34 everybody has a right to appeal a decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court except where it is prescribed by law. Section 2 of the Bill gives that right.  In order to streamline the position, it might be worth using section 2 as the method by which the DPP can appeal decisions to the Court of Criminal Appeal and not using the right under Article 34.  The Minister should consider that issue before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Several factors should be taken into account in relation to sentencing policy. The Minister correctly represented the position when she said that sentencing policy is not an exact science.</P>
    <P>An important advance is the provision in the Bill enabling courts to inquire into the effects of the crime on the victim and to give an explanation of the circumstances that gave rise to the imposition of sentence.  For the most part the sentences imposed do not attract attention or reflect society's abhorrence of the crime committed.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of the appeals mechanism is welcome.  The Bill gives power to review unduly lenient sentences, an eminently sensible move and one I welcome.  The sentence imposed must be substantially out of line with what a judge could reasonably have imposed.  It is vital to reach the correct balance between the rights of the victim and the rights of the perpetrator.  It is clear that the public perception is that of late the pendulum has swung too much in favour of the perpetrator.  Section 2 gives the DPP 28 days in which to ask the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence imposed.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) states:</P>
    <P>An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or the Director of Public Prosecutions from the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal of an application under section 2 if that Court, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions certifies that the <Col N="1553" /> determination involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>That provision appears to give the DPP a second opportunity.  The DPP would have already appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In the interests of fairness, it might be best to confine the certification process to the court itself and/or the Attorney General in this instance.</P>
    <P>The process of an appeal against an unduly lenient sentence imposed by the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court has to be initiated by the DPP.  The issue would go to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is my understanding that the DPP would be one of those empowered to give certification for a further appeal to the Supreme Court. Consideration should be given to confining the certification process to the Attorney General or the court.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which is very important, gives a clear direction that the court in imposing sentences must take into account the effects, including the long term effects, on the victim of the offence. This includes offences involving violence or the threat of violence.  It is high time that the rights of the unfortunate victims are recognised and that the serious impact of horrendous crimes perpetrated on the victim are also fully recognised.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the thrust and spirit of section 6 of the Bill which extends significantly the powers of the criminal courts to award compensation in all cases where the victim has been caused personal injury or loss.  This measure, combined with the power to review unduly lenient sentences, will ensure that the deterrent effect of punishment will be conveyed unambiguously to would-be criminals.  This section will now enable the court to award compensation to the victim.  It is no harm to hit the criminal where it hurts &mdash; in his pocket.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7 which states that all payments of compensation are to be made through the local District Court <Col N="1554" /> clerk.  This is a very important advance because the District court clerk will, on request, take proceedings to enforce payment under an order in his or her own name.  This will ensure that awards which may not have been pursued &mdash; where the victim had to personally pursue them &mdash; will not be dealt with by the mechanism to which I referred.  The local District Court clerk will now be charged with the responsibility, on request, of enforcing the payment order.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill makes an important amendment to the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which was itself an important advance in relation to facilitating the victims of physical or sexual abuse when giving evidence.  There was a lacuna in the law in that regard, particularly in regard to written depositions but the Minister &mdash; or Minister of State &mdash; also perceived that there was a lacuna and has rectified it, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>A video recording of the evidence taken at a preliminary examination is now admissible at a trial.  The amendment was necessitated by the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and makes it quite clear that it is unnecessary to have a written deposition when a video record is available.  It is now quite simple to have a transcript made of such a recording.  It is an important step forward to facilitate the unfortunate victim and to give statutory force to the admissibility of such evidence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, I should like the Minister of State to examine the points I made in relation to sections 2 and 3 on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank all the Deputies who contributed to this wide-ranging debate.  Their contributions have been most useful and I assure Deputy Penrose that I will consider his valid points in relation to sections 2 and 3.  Deputy Harney mentioned that there is a problem in the way we are putting through this legislation in that Committee and Report Stages will be taken tomorrow, immediately after Second Stage.  Her point is valid but the reason <Col N="1555" /> is that we are most anxious to put this legislation on the Statute Book as quickly as possible because it has been brought to our attention that a number of cases will shortly be coming before the courts in which this Bill, when enacted, will be of great significance.</P>
      <P>Another point which Deputy Harney did not mention &mdash; but which is causing problems for me &mdash; is that Report Stage follows so quickly on Committee Stage. I think there is only about an hour and a half between Committee and Report Stages.  A number of technical issues may be raised on Committee Stage which we must consider.  I anticipate, from the debate on Second Stage today, that matters will be raised regarding which we will need the advice of the Attorney General's office.  We will not be able to do that in an hour and a half and, therefore, when I undertake to consider points raised by Deputies I will consider them tomorrow evening and perhaps make amendments in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a number of technical problems in regard to this legislation &mdash; parliamentary draftsmen are not perfect &mdash; and no doubt there may be some things which they have missed.  There may also be ambiguities in the legislation, I see one or two provisions about which I wish to speak to them later tonight.  However, my attitude to this legislation will not be dogmatic or partisan.  We can fight our political battles as much as we like elsewhere but, in a matter like this, it is the duty of all Members to get the best legislation possible.  That is what people sent us here to do and it will be my approach to it.  I have never taken the view that because an amendment comes from the Opposition it must necessarily be rejected.  Neither do I take the view that the Government and the parliamentary draftsman are omnipotent.  In saying that I am not casting aspersions on the excellence of our parliamentary draftsman.  I think it was the 19th century poet and politician, Tom Kettle, who said that Irish parliamentary draftsmen tended to be of such quality that he would consider entrusting to them the drafting <Col N="1556" /> of the Ten Commandments.  That situation has not changed.</P>
    <P>While I welcome all contributions to the debate, the tone and content of some of Deputy Shatter's remarks were regrettable. In using that neutral terminology I am, to some extent, restraining myself. My approach to this legislation is that we are enacting new criminal law, that we must get the best possible result and the interaction of all sides is very important, particularly in relation to criminal law.  I could say the same in regard to Deputy Flanagan's contributions.  However, this is not a party political matter and I wish the Opposition would not make it one, it is a question of parties on all sides of the House getting the best possible result.</P>
    <P>As I said, the contributions were thoughtful and constructive &mdash; most of them anyway.  Deputy Shatter said that Fine Gael had made a constructive contribution to the Criminal Damage Act to provide compensation for all victims of crime but that the Government had turned it down.  That is not so.  Such a provision would obviously have been out of order in a Bill dealing only with criminal damage to property.  Anybody who has practised in the area of criminal law will be aware of the fact that one of the difficulties in looking up criminal law is that it is so scattered.  Sections of the criminal law are in places in which you would not expect them to be.  Like should be with like, particularly in relation to legislation.  That was the reason the Criminal Damage Act was not extended to personal injuries.  We committed ourselves at the time to extending it and we are doing that today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and other speakers referred to the fear felt by the victim in the recent Kilkenny case as to what might happen when the father is released after serving his sentence.  He suggested that the sentencing court should be given the power of injuncting convicted persons from approaching their victims on release.  In fairness, there will be a great degree of sympathy with that suggestion and I undertake to have its implications considered.  I hope that something can be done about it within the four corners of <Col N="1557" /> the Constitution.  The tradition in our society has always been that once a convicted person has purged his offence by serving a sentence of imprisonment he is as free from restraint as if he or she had never been convicted in the first place. If any molestation or intimidation took place the victim would have the remedies provided by the criminal or civil law.  I take Deputy Shatter's point that civil law remedies injunctions and so on, are not appropriate for the vast majority of victims we are talking about.  Without prejudicing the outcome of the examination which I may have to conduct into this area, it occurs to me that it might be feasible to make it a specific offence for a person who has been convicted of an offence to annoy or intimidate the victim, and this would be a separate offence, so that the Garda could act straightaway if any conduct of that kind took place.  In saying that, I am conscious of the fact that considerable injury could have been done to the victim by the time the Garda could move in to apprehend the perpetrator. The Deputy's point is reasonable and I will consider it.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Shatter and Deputy Harney, asked that our criminal justice system should be more victim orientated so that victims are spared as much stress as possible when attending court.  In recent legislation we have provided for that situation by allowing evidence to be given by TV link to spare the victim the trauma of having to go into open court and face the person he-she is accusing.  Deputy Shatter and other Deputies referred to the treatments available for sex offenders in prison.  At present these offenders, in common with other prisoners, have access to a range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services in the prison and I am satisfied that much good work is being done in this way for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>Up to two years ago a pilot project was in operation in Arbour Hill which involved the probation and welfare services working with a number of prisoners on a group therapy programme on an experimental basis.  This pilot project ceased when all of the prisoners concerned <Col N="1558" /> had completed the programme. Last year a group comprising of senior officials in the Department of Justice, together with members of the psychiatric, psychological and probation and welfare services, was established to examine various treatment options which might appropriately be introduced.  The Minister is conscious of the urgency with which the issue must be addressed and has asked that the report of the group be available to her within weeks so that a decision on providing services can be taken by her as a matter or urgency. However, it should be noted that international experience has shown that there are no readymade, easily applied solutions which guarantee results in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore said the Bill did not send any signal to the Judiciary as to how crimes such as incest rated as compared with others, such as assaults etc.  That is, of course, true; but to do so would be outside the scope of this particular Bill. I think the Deputy is right, however, in suggesting that it might be brought up before the Committee on Crime as it would mean a wider examination than we can give to it here in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon urged that the operation of the compensation provision should be closely monitored.  I fully agree.  Arrangements will be made in particular to have the enforcement provisions watched to see that the District Court office follow up any defaulters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore and other Deputies mentioned the reluctance to report sex abuse cases.  Of course, there is a reluctance, especially among young victims &mdash; and the younger the victim the more reluctant he is &mdash; but the increased public discussion of child abuse is helping and so is the INTO initiative in primary schools which has already been referred to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney suggested that it might be years before the Director of Public Prosecutions could exercise the right of appeal being given to him by the Bill, because he has not appealed any sentence imposed to date by the Central Criminal Court, despite the fact that he has jurisdiction to do so.  I think I can put her <Col N="1559" /> fears to rest in that regard.  From what I know of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he can be trusted to carry out his statutory responsibilities to the full.  I believe there may have been some element of doubt about his existing right to appeal but, whatever the reason, it can be taken that he will not now be slow to act in a proper case.  Deputy Harney asked also if the transcript of the proceedings will be available to the Director of Public Prosecution in the 28 day limit? I very much doubt if it could.  I assume that what the Director of Public Prosecutions will have available to him will be a report from prosecuting counsel, a note of what the sentencing judge said and any documents submitted to the judge on the basis of which he made his decision on the sentence to be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked for clarification of what is meant by communications to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to influencing his decision.  I assume it would have its ordinary meaning of a communication specifically addressed to him or to one of his officers, either written or oral.  That would not include speeches in this House or editorials or other public comments.  May I point out that the provision we are introducing to prevent communication with a Director of Public Prosecutions is to apply the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, which prohibits communications to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the decision to prosecute in the first place.  Discussion in this House on particular cases and newspaper or editorial comment on it have not attracted any sanctions.  A recent Dublin case attracted much editorial comment before the Director of Public Prosecutions took his decision to prosecute and there will be sanction on newspapers as a result of that.  I think her fears in this regard are groundless.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of funding for the rape crisis centres. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, referred to the Minister for Health's statement on this afternoon and <Col N="1560" /> I understand this announcement was very positive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney advocated that the prosecution should be able to appeal where an acquittal was obtained on a technicality. The Committee on Court Practice and Procedures has completed a study of all aspects of the question of giving the prosecution rights of appeal and I understand that its report will be available very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory raised the issue of the Tina Caffrey murder case.  I was not present when he was speaking but from the report I understand he said the family want to pursue a civil action and want financial help with their legal costs as well as having the case reopened.  He said also that they want to meet the Minister for Justice in this regard.  May I assure the Deputy that I will pass on his request to the Minister and I will ask her to deal sympathetically with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald raised a number of recommendations in relation to rape that have been made by the Commission for the Status of Women in their second report.  The Deputy can rest assured that all the recommendations of the commission are being looked at, several of them have already been implemented, others are in the process of being implemented and the remainder are under active consideration.  Deputy Gregory raised the question of sentences for drug offences and asked that the attention of the Judiciary be drawn to the need for heavier sentences in drug cases. The Law Reform Commission were asked to look at the whole area of sentencing policy and the commission plan to publish a consultation paper on this topic in the next few weeks and I will give urgent consideration to any proposals they may put forward in this regard.  We all agree there is some room for improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne was concerned that compensation orders might not be made in some cases, even if it would be appropriate to do so.  The courts have the discretion to decide when compensation orders should be made.  They will be familiar with the facts of each individual <Col N="1561" /> case and be in the best position to decide what order should be made.  Deputy Durkan was concerned that legislation which is rushed through can turn out to be bad legislation.  I have explained already the reason for the urgency of this legislation.  Deputy Quill suggested that an advisory body be established that could be consulted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Let me point out that the Director of Public Prosecutions is completely independent in the exercise of his functions.  However, there is nothing to prevent him from consulting with any person or body if he so wishes. If the Director of Public Prosecutions so wishes and if he feels it useful, he could establish an advisory body of the type envisaged and I will certainly offer any assistance I can in that regard.  The Deputy also wanted a provision whereby the prosecuting team would make submissions to the trial judge suggesting what might be an appropriate sentence. It is my understanding that counsel for the prosecution does that already.  She also wanted the Stay Safe programme to be extended, as at present it applies only in the Eastern Health Board area.  Let me assure Deputy Quill that the programme is being extended to the rest of the country during the current school year.</P>
    <P>I will consider the points raised by Deputy Penrose before we take Committee Stage tomorrow.  I will also consider many of the other points which are more appropriate to Committee Stage. In relation to legislation such as this, my function is not to make party political broadcasts or to refer to what people did or did not do in the past.  My concern is to introduce the best possible legislation and I invite contributions from all sides of the House tomorrow on Committee Stage so that, we can enact legislation that will stand the test of time and prove useful in the years ahead.  I hope the necessity for this legislation will not arise frequently, but I hope we can introduce the best possible legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the approval for 3,500 local authority house starts because there is a significant increase in demand for housing, created mainly by the recession in Britain and the United States.  Three or four years ago our housing facilities were adequate and young couples in my area could obtain a local authority house within three to four months of getting married.  However, that is not the case at present.  The waiting lists are increasing steadily because of the numbers of emigrants returning home. I welcome the employment these new house starts will create as the construction industry, in particular housing, has a spin-off effect in regard to job creation right down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the £25 million provided for the establishment of county enterprise boards and the £130 million which has been promised by the banks and financial institutions.  The State agencies and local authorities should play their part with the various nominees from <Col N="1563" /> the private sector.  I welcome the involvement of the private sector and the fact that a chairman will be appointed with experience in this field.  Much work could be done and many jobs created in this area.  Our approach to the environment has been reasonably satisfactory over the past number of years but the private sector has not responded to any great extent.  I hope the local authorities, Government agencies and the private sector will co-operate in this regard and that jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>Deputies from the Border regions have heaved a sigh of relief because it was expected that there would be a substantial increase in excise duties in the budget.  Border areas have suffered a great deal because of Britain's withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and devaluation, which created an upsurge in cross-Border trade.  Thankfully, the effects of this have been eased considerably by the Government providing £50 million by way of the development fund.  I would like to reply to speakers from the Opposition benches who were critical of the budget and stated that it was an anti-Border region budget.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Leonard, for being generous enough to share his time with me. Against an international background of recession, very high interest rates and a number of pressures on the budgetary position, both at national level and arising from the EC Single Market, the Government has done well to present a budget which gives some tax relief and increase capital spending substantially while maintaining Exchequer borrowing at a low level.  The Government has done this against a background of low single figure inflation, averaging around 3 per cent.  This has been the longest sustained period of low inflation for more than 40 <Col N="1564" /> years.  Low inflation has a positive effect on all sectors of society, business, farming, those on pensions, PAYE earners and social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>In forming the budget the Government was mindful of keeping down inflation, particularly following the recent devaluation. As a result of this determination there have been no excise duties on petrol which would have had a negative knock-on effect on the whole economy.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland will be particularly pleased that there was no increase on beer and spirits as any such rise would have resulted in job losses, particularly in the small licensed premises in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Reduction of VAT on service industries to garages, mechanical repairs and hairdressing from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent was very welcome as was the reduction from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent on flour confectionery and bakery products.  Such measures result in immediate maintenance of jobs in those sectors with the possibility of growth which, in turn, could translate into future job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourist industry will welcome the measures to improve availability of car hire.  The Fianna Fáil strategy for dealing with unemployment is to give a big boost to public capital investment to sustain economic activity and this has been honoured in the budget.  The public capital programme of £2.4 billion is the largest ever.  The Minister for the Environment estimates that up to 9,000 jobs could be created directly or indirectly in the construction industry. The capital programme will mean investing in ports, roads, railways and adequate water and sanitary facilities.  The stamp duty charge and the increase in the first time grant for new houses to £3,000 and increased mortgage interest relief will help the housing construction industry as will the proposed increase in local housing. I understand the construction industry has been in contact with the Minister for Finance in the hope that the house improvement grants will be re-introduced as this would have a positive effect <Col N="1565" /> on the construction industry and would translate into further jobs.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent special investment accounts and the renewal of the business expansion scheme should encourage business and set the right climate for future job creation in this sector.  The Taoiseach stated that there would be further measures in the Finance Bill which will examine, among other things, the tax treatment of owners' capital for business start-ups and incentives for employee investment.  It is encouraging that the Government is proceeding with the establishment of the enterprise boards.  As a member of the committee on job creation which was in existence until the general election, I know that this was appreciated and agreed by most, if not all, members of that committee.  I note that the Minister for Finance has allocated £25 million in the budget to this area and this will be coupled with the £130 million which will be made available from financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £20 million provided to deal with hospital waiting lists in the health area and the additional £8 million for services mainly for people with a mental handicap.  This, I understand, will provide additional residential and day care places and emergency and respite care support for up to 1,000 extra people caring at home for sons and daughters with mental handicap, as well as developing education and training facilities.  I am assured this will also enable residential facilities to be provided so that more people with mental handicap will be housed in local communities.  The provision of an extra £2 million has also been made in the Estimate for the development of the public dental service.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the carers allowance since its inception. Therefore, I welcome the 12 per cent increase in this allowance from £53 to £59.  This recognises in a small way the unselfish work carried out by the carers in our society, the majority of whom are women.</P>
    <P>The increases in this budget for social welfare beneficiaries have been protected. The special increase in short time <Col N="1566" /> rates of 5 per cent moves closer to the implementation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  However, I am sure the Minister will appreciate it is a long way off the complete implementation of this report.  The major improvement on child benefit from £15.80 to £20 per month and the future improvement in the family income supplement are necessary and, therefore, welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the resource centres for the unemployed.  It is vital that these centres receive core funding for a percentage of staff.  When the scheme runs after 52 weeks the burden on the supervisor is horrendous.  The preoccupation with fund raising and worrying about how to pay the employers' PRSI or rent &mdash; not covered by FÁS &mdash; draws from the purpose of these centres.  With proper funding more time and energy could be directed to the appropriate areas of education, enterprise and job creation, as well as social welfare advice.</P>
    <P>Those in the farming sector will be pleased to note that the Minister is providing an additional £1 million in 1993 for Teagasc, towards an advisory service in connection with the small farm development programme.  The principal demand from farm organisations during the last election was for something to be done to substantially raise the tax thresholds for lifetime farm transfers between generations, complimenting the EC retirement scheme.  This has been dealt with in this budget.  The raising of thresholds and the probate tax provide a general incentive to lifetime transfers.</P>
    <P>This budget is financially responsible, reasonable, pro-jobs, supportive of invesment, gives incentive to businesses to create jobs and is socially caring.  It is a budget which I am happy to support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the trouble to look at the last page of the Minister's Financial Statement which sets out the five principal objectives claimed for this budget.  I find no evidence to suggest that it lives up to any one of those objectives. The first is to claim that the budget gives effective priority to the creation and preservation of jobs.  In fact, the budget does <Col N="1567" /> quite the opposite.  It increases taxes on employment by raising the PRSI contribution ceilings, thereby increasing the cost of taking on new workers or maintaining existing workers in employment. In an economy with over 300,000 people unemployed, raising taxes on employment is economic and social lunacy.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about striking an appropriate balance between fiscal prudence and maintaining investment and growth in the economy.  This is not a fiscally prudent budget by any means. Both the current deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement are projected to exceed the out-turn figures for 1992.  The out-turn figures for 1992 substantially exceeded the budget targets that we set in that year.  Therefore, effective economic management in this country is, regretfully, a thing of the past. Indeed, the general view in the financial sector is that the targets set in this budget for the deficit and the borrowing requirement will also be exceeded.  Some believe this may represent an over-shoot in the order of £100 million to £200 million as a result of slippages in current expenditure, a lower growth rate than that assumed by the Government and probably injections of capital into the semi-State sector, a not unlikely scenario if we are to believe what we read these days.  I very much fear that what we are seeing now is the beginning of the new economics so beloved of Minister Michael Higgins which, in fact, amounts to nothing less than the abandonment of even the most rudimentary economic commonsense.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any evidence that this budget will maintain investment and growth.  It contains nothing, for example, that will help to reduce interest rates which are now, in spite of recent reductions, still the key obstacle to investment and growth.  If anything, what this budget does by increasing the deficit and the borrowing requirement is maintain upward pressure on interest rates and delay or prevent us from benefiting from reductions that are triggered elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> As far as I can see the Government in this budget is relying on the construction sector for most of its claimed job creation for 1993.  For example, we have just heard Deputy de Valera claim that some 9,000 jobs will be created in the construction industry in 1993.  It is worthwhile examining what is happening to the construction sector.  The public capital programme, as it stood on budget day, will simply reduce the expected reduction in the volume of construction activity in 1993 from a range of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent pre-budget to a range of between 2 per cent and 4 per cent post-budget. Therefore, contrary to the idea that it will increase the volume of activity in the construction sector this budget will only reduce the drop in the volume of activity in the construction sector.  Even if we add to this the effects of the injection of the first phase of the Cohesion Funds announced this week the volume of construction activity in 1993 compared to 1992 is likely to be static or, at best, will show a marginal increase of not more than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>We should not be fooled by any of these projections.  There will not be 9,000 new jobs coming on stream in the construction sector in 1993.  For the Minister or the Government to make such a claim is simply hot air.  In fact, we will see a reduction in employment in the construction sector during 1993.</P>
    <P>A huge mythology has been built up concerning the local authority housing programme.  For example, we have been promised 3,500 new local authority housing starts this year which, if it were to happen, would be a substantial improvement on recent years but a far cry from the situation that existed in the eighties.  I would ask how many houses will actually be completed this year?  It is always useful to examine what the Government will spend.  The published Estimates indicate that the provision for local authority and social housing programmes in 1992 was £46 million and the provision for this year is just under £68 million, an increase of £22 million.  One might say that looks like a substantial amount of extra money but even if we <Col N="1569" /> make the generous assumption that the average unit cost in these programmes is £35,000 &mdash; that is actually a very low figure because the actual average cost works out at almost £40,000 &mdash; in each of those two years we find that the 1992 allocation would have built 1,314 houses and the 1993 allocation would build 1,943 houses, an increase of 629 over last year. I can assure the Minister that I could find people to fill 629 new houses any day of the week without ever going outside the confines of my constituency or, indeed, the confines of only two local authority electoral areas in my constituency.  We are not going to see 3,500 new local authority houses built this year.  It is a sham to say that will happen.  If 3,500 local authority houses are indeed started this year they will not be finished this year or next year; only one-sixth of the work will be done.  Therefore we will not see a gross addition of that number of houses to the local authority housing stock.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what is claimed, this budget does not give business a stable economic environment.  It contains an unconnected and incoherent jumble of measures designed to create the illusion of purposeful action but which will only create new problems.  There is no indication that the Government's approach to public sector investment is in any way strategically directed towards the long term needs of the economy.  Only this week, for example, the Tánaiste tried to dress up the first tranche of the Cohesion Fund as an initiative.  However when you look at what has been announced by the Government you will find that it is nothing more than a continuation of last year's unfulfilled public capital programme. There is no imagination in this and I see no reason to expect any constructive new thinking on the next tranche of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government pretends this budget is fair and equitable and that it places the burden of necessary adjustments on those who can bear it best while protecting the less well off.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  On the income tax front the changes in personal allowances and the basic rate band are not <Col N="1570" /> enough even to keep up with inflation. The income tax bite will increase this year for everybody, including the low paid, and everybody will pay more VAT and excise duty this year.  If we combine the effects of tax changes, child benefit, social welfare changes and other changes that affect people in their daily lives we find that the budget actually takes away from people £50 million more than it gives back.  By any definition that is not equitable burden sharing.  This budget shows the lethal result of combining the Labour Party's chronic tendency to avoid expenditure problems by increasing taxation with Fianna Fáil's infamous pragmatism which always leads it to prefer taking small, cosmetic steps in a wide range of areas to doing something worthwhile in a small number of priority areas.</P>
    <P>The budget has of course been rumbled.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors, a body which the former leader of Fianna Fáil did not like because it called itself major and superior, has developed a very acute skill in the analysis of budgetary problems in recent years.  It finds that the budget has failed to tackle poverty and the unemployment problem, failed to remove the barriers which block unemployed people from working when there are jobs to be done and failed to give priority to tackling the enormous problem of rural decline. That is a fairly damning, comprehensive and accurate indictment of this budget.</P>
    <P>The budget seems to set a course for further rural decline.  There is a vague reference to stock relief which is causing considerable worry.  We know that the Labour Party usually, and wrongly, looks at changes in stock relief provisions as a means of extracting more money from farmers.  That would be folly.  A great number of farmers face the prospect, as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy changes that our genial and incompetent Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has recklessly abandoned us to, of having to reduce stock levels.  Unless the Government understands that necessity it is going to make a mess of changing the stock relief provisions in relation to agriculture in a way that would make it <Col N="1571" /> more difficult to maintain the productive base of our agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to hear Deputy de Valera say that the 2 per cent probate tax is an advance.  It is an imposition.  It is not a part of any discernible policy on the part of the Government to give encouragement. Even the words used in this regard in the Budget Statement make it plain that it is just another means of increasing tax revenue, and it is a further imposition on farm transfers on death.  It will mean that even at a time of quota restrictions, set-asides and difficult market conditions there will be further pressure to have capital realisations to pay the tax, thus further weakening the productive capacity of the individual enterprise.  Nothing could be more stupid or more effectively designed to accelerate rural decline.</P>
    <P>This is the budget of a Government that has no sense of direction and is incapable of making coherent decisions. That indeed has been admitted by the Government.  We have been treated to the spectacle by the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste whining their excuses in the face of the concerted barrage of justified criticism that has been directed at the budget.  They say it is a holding operation and that there was neither the time nor the opportunity to make it otherwise.  They have damned themselves and their colleagues by their cringing and whinging.</P>
    <P>It took longer to put this Government together than any other Government I can remember, and we are told it took that long because the two parties wanted to be sure they would come to a proper understanding of what they are about.  I have to ask the question; what in God's name were they at for all those weeks since they have no understanding of what they are doing?  That has been amply demonstrated in the last few weeks and again this morning by a succession of petty squabbles between the two Government parties about budgetary and non-budgetary issues.  Looking at the budget and the limp defence of it by the Government, I can only conclude that we have <Col N="1572" /> a Government of political and economic wimps.</P>
    <P>Classic diversionary tactics are now being used.  It seems that the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, has been promoted to a position that was occupied in a previous Dáil by the current Minister, Deputy Brian Cowen &mdash; that is the position of gurrier-in-chief to the Government.</P>

      <P>Listening to the outburst from the Minister of State at the weekend I was reminded of a remark made to me some years ago by a frank colleague who, when presented with a problem about which he knew nothing, said that the depths of his ignorance on the issue had yet remained unplumbed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Bruton, has shown that she has considerable unplumbed depths. A few simple facts might help to lighten her darkness and relieve her &mdash; I hesitate to say ignorance because that might be unparliamentary &mdash; misinformation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Press Officer, for example, is paid by Fine Gael, not by the <Col N="1573" /> taxpayer.  A retired civil servant employed in Deputy John Bruton's office is employed by Fine Gael, not by the taxpayer.  The staffing of Deputy Bruton's office otherwise is perfectly within the framework of the scheme for secretarial assistants that applies to all parties in this House, including the Labour Party.  I speak as the only person in this House who went to the trouble of concluding a formal agreement with the staff who work for my party.  The Labour Party did not do so, in spite of all Deputy Burton's protestations about concern for the workforce, nor did the Fianna Fáil Party, so far as I know.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nora Owen has never been employed in a remunerated capacity by her sister, Mary Banotti, MEP, as claimed by Deputy Bruton.  Mary Banotti, MEP, is by far the most accomplished Dublin representative in the European Parliament.  She is much more effective than Deputy Burton's colleague who represents Dublin in the European Parliament and who is chronically addicted to the gossip that gives rise to the kind of outburst we heard from the Minister of State at the weekend.  The Minister of State was right to point out that both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats received funds from the Exchequer, although the amounts, in all conscience, are small enough.  We might be charitable and wonder why the Minister of State omitted to tell the rest of the story, and give her a fool's pardon on the basis of ignorance, but she should know that the Labour Party also gets money from the Exchequer as does Fianna Fáil. Has the Minister of State anything to say about the use that the Labour Party makes of the money it gets?  Did it perhaps use some of that money to pay for the minibus that brought all the delegates to the Labour Party's Youth Conference in Cork last weekend or was that paid for out of the swollen budget of the office of the Tánaiste to make sure that in addition to his few dutiful parliamentary party members he had at least some kind of audience?</P>

The Minister of State's intemperate and deliberately misleading outburst was an attempt to deflect away from curiously sensitive Labour Party hides the flood of criticism that has burst on them in recent weeks.  The Minister of State would do better if she would try to understand the cause of the criticism, because it is to be found in real palpable public outrage at the immence gap between Labour's rhetoric in Opposition and its pitiful whining in Government, in its vertiginous fall from the high moral ground that it held in opposition to the absolute pit of mire in which it has immersed itself since it came into Government.

      <P>Only God knows what else they have in store for us.

This budget is a failure.  It is a gross injustice to the unemployed, the poor, the marginalised, to the young and to all the people who in spite of adversity still work for their country.  The Government should be ashamed.  It has betrayed those people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoghis-Offaly)</i>): As a new Deputy who has listened to debates in order to inform himself of the procedures in the House, I was most disappointed at the personal nature of many of the remarks of the previous speaker who is a person of ability with Government experience.  Deputy Dukes belittled the reputation of ability he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes addressed some of the points which I want to address.  This budget marks a turning point in a strategy which was initiated in 1987 when Deputy Dukes supported the Fianna Fáil minority Government in what was a financial and budgetary U-turn.  This policy was continued under the influence of the Progressive Democrats in the last Government so that we were aping the Thatcherite and Reaganite economics being applied in Britain and the US. Those of us who have had the opportunity to visit Britain to keep ourselves informed of what is happening there will know of the destruction to the social and economic fabric of that country which has followed from those policies.  Such destruction was being visited on us as a result of similar policies being followed by the Government from 1987 until now. This budget has started to address the <Col N="1578" /> wider area of social need and responsibility which must be addressed by the Government. The writings of the late John Healy were writings that I always enjoyed although I did not always agree with him. One of his criticisms of the last Labour &mdash; Fine Gael Government was that it was trying to govern an economy whereas the job of Government was to govern a country populated by people.  This budget has started to address the needs of the people who live here.  Ireland is not simply an economy.  If we left ourselves at the mercy of economists, God knows where we would be.  Those who recall the lead up to the currency devaluation will remember that economists wrote in the newpapers telling us that devaluation was a bad thing.  Yet, When devaluation had taken place there was a barrage of comment from the same people saying how it should have been done months ago.</P>
    <P>As a result of policy followed here since 1987 under the Tallaght strategy and under the influence of the Progressive Democrats in Government we saw a massive cutback in investment in public capital programmes, and we saw privatisation of companies such as Greencore.  Given that that was a matter for discussion here last week I would remind the House that Greencore was privatised by a vote of 119 to 23 in the last Dáil.  In relation to Aer Lingus, every obstacle that could be put in the way of Aer Lingus growth and development was put there, to facilitate the haphazard introduction of air services for short term gain, without any air transport policy. We saw the changes in welfare and it was put to people that it was their responsibility to find a job or a house.  The budgetary allocations in those areas were cut back as a result of a change in policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned last evening I was saying that we had received assurances from the Minister, and various speakers on the Government benches, that many of the concerns which this Bill was drafted and framed to address would, in turn, be addressed by some unspecified Government measure which does not appear to be promised as part of the Programme for Government.  I reiterate that the real problem with promises of that kind is that they are unfailingly forgotten about when the pressure of Private Members' Business, and the focus which this kind of debate puts on the issue, is no longer felt by Government.  I have little confidence that the particular concerns of ordinary people in relation to the breakdown of public order in public places, the growth of racketeering, the absence of proper provisions in our criminal law to deal with matters such as people being found in possession of incriminating documents and disguises which are preparatory for crime, and the absence of a proper loitering law to prevent criminal trespass on private property will be addressed in a comprehensive way by the Government in the forthcoming session or in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play was made by the Minister in the course of the debate of the achievements by this Government, and previous Governments, in relation to improving our criminal law.  When one examines the record one finds that these achievements are negligible, are inadequate and above all they are always, without exception, extremely late.  One of the measures to which the Minister had drawn the attention of the House as an achievement was in relation to certain procedural rules in criminal evidence.  The Minister said that the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, closed a loophole which first became apparent in 1965 or 1966 in an English case.  Although the British Legislature had the good <Col N="1580" /> sense to act quickly, it took many years for the Irish Legislature to address the same problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was her intention to bring forward a Bill which would abolish the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and between imprisonment and penal servitude which would affect a comprehensive reform of very outdated provisions of our criminal law. That is all very well but, as I pointed out, all of this was contained in separate chapters of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1966, and nothing has been heard of it since.  When we hear in this House that these measures are at an advanced stage of drafting that is eyewash because the simple fact is that they were drafted and presented to this House almost 30 years ago.  The sad fact is that in relation to this, and the law relating to criminal insanity and diminished responsibility in crimes such as murder, where when Mr. Justice Henchy was asked by the State to prepare a report for the reform of the criminal law, he had the good sense &mdash; knowing how slowly the wheels of the Department of Justice turn &mdash; to supply the Department of Justice with a complete draft Bill to reform the law.  That report is about 15 years lying gathering dust in the Department of Justice.  I could go on with a litany of examples of how the Irish Legislature fails to address issues which are addressed in other countries, with similar legal systems to ours much earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney's Bill is designed to modernise the law in relation to public order offences such as violent disorder, riot and affray.  Her Bill is meant to address the problem of racketeering which genuinely exists.  I was shocked to hear the Minister say she had not been told by the gardaí that the law in relation to racketeering is inadeqate.  If she has any experience of real life in this city &mdash; I excuse her to some extent because she is newly appointed and may not be conversant with real circumstances in this city - she will know that there are areas, as Deputy Barrett mentioned where insurance for business cannot be obtained because of the threat of racketeering. <Col N="1581" /> People running small corner stores cannot get insurance to save them from depredations by local thugs and hoodlums who threaten them.  People are driven out of business in this city for want of proper laws to protect them.</P>
    <P>There can be no excuse for delay. People without influence need protection. People who live in the front line where violence and disorder causes pain, suffering and misery are entitled to look at this House for protection.  The Bill presented by Deputy Harney represents the first comprehensive legislative bid to put in place laws which were intended to protect those people.  I am sorry to say that the attitude of the Government, as betoken by the Minister's response last week, seems to be that there will be no progress in the near future, there will be no protection, there will be a vague promise but coming from that quarter I can say from past experience, it will be a promise that will not be honoured for a long time.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a number of points made by Deputy McDowell.  The upgrading of our criminal law is a matter of concern in this jurisdiction.  We are relying too much on outdated legislation to deal with modern crimes.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to update the legislation in this area.  There are specific references to the Whitaker committee and many of its recommendations. There is specific reference to a juvenile justice Bill.  We had a very thorough debate last week on the all-party report on juvenile crime.  Deputy Quill of the Progressive Democrats played a major role in the preparation of that very fine report which dealt with legislation and the social aspects which impinge upon anti-social behaviour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a commitment to expand the Garda juvenile liaison scheme and to put more gardaí on the beat.  Those specific commitments are in the programme for Government and I will insist they be adhered to.</P>
      <P>This legislation is well intentioned but it is a poor attempt to reform the law to deal with public disorder.</P>
      <P>Many of the proposals in the Bill are draconian.  For example, it proposes to confer powers on the Garda which are blatantly unconstitutional.  Even from the point of view of drafting, it is flawed and displays an inadequate understanding of current law.</P>
      <P>My most serious objection to the Bill is the complete lack of balance in its approach towards criminal justice.  While the primary objective of the State's penal policy must be to defeat the criminal, this is not its only objective.  In particular, the powers given to the Garda must be balanced by safeguards to protect the innocent.  I am afraid this Bill portrays an ignorance of this elementary principle of our legal system.  The legislation openly ignores the constitutional requirements that criminal statutes be clear and certain and that the burden of proof must rest with the prosecution.  The vagueness of the Bill reaches its climax in section 5, which states:</P>
      <P>A person who without lawful authority loiters in a public place in circumstances (which may include the company of other persons) which give rise to reasonable apprehension for the personal safety of persons or for the safety of property or for the maintenance of the public peace shall be guilty of unlawful loitering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It proposes also that the Garda should be empowered to arrest such a person without a warrant, to direct the person to leave the vicinity or to direct the person to desist from any behaviour which is, in the opinion of the member of the Garda Síochána, likely to give rise to a breach of the peace.  I am sure the <Col N="1583" /> House is aware of the seriousness of such a provision.  In 1981 the Supreme Court declared that the old &ldquo;sus laws&rdquo; under the Vagrancy Act were unconstitutional because of their extreme vagueness and the unfettered discretion which they gave to the Garda.  This Bill proposes to upturn that 1981 constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court.  The Progressive Democrats' Party seems to have learned nothing from that case.  In fact, it is now seeking to reintroduce the elements which were overturned by the Supreme Court in 1981.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the Progressive Democrats package are completely undefined. Section 5 refers to &ldquo;reasonable apprehension&rdquo; and I should like to know &ldquo;reasonable apprehension&rdquo; by whom. The section seems to put the burden of proof on the person who is arrested to show that he or she had lawful authority to loiter in a public place.  This again is in contravention of a basic principle of our criminal justice system.  The section which empowers the Garda to direct an individual to desist from behaviour which may give rise to a breach of the peace seems to interfere with the principle that persons can only be punished for offences they have actually committed.  It is the old conspiracy theory which we criticised so severely in the British system of justice &mdash; one can be arrested for what is in one's mind rather for something which had happened, and it is left entirely to the discretion of those who exercise the powers of arrest to decide when an offence has been committed.  This is a very dangerous area and the provisions in this respect are contrary to our constitutional imperatives.  There are many other sections to which I could refer. If the Bill was given a Second Reading obviously I would put down many amendments to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The offences listed in the various sections are somewhat bizarre.  Section 2 defines a riot as a group of 12 or more people and proposes a sentence of ten years.  Section 3 proposes that a group of three or more people can constitute violent disorder and proposes a sentence <Col N="1584" /> of five years.  Section 4 defines an affray or threat of unlawful violence as a group of two or more people and proposes a penalty of two years' imprisonment.  It seems that the number of people involved will determine the sanction imposed. There is a huge difference between a prison sentence of ten years and a prison sentence of two years.  This reminds me of what Christ said: &ldquo;When two or more are gathered in my name, I am amongst them&rdquo;.  The presumption in this Bill is that where two or more people are gathered together something bad will happen. No recognition is given to the fact that people can gather together for positive reasons.  I have many reservations about the way the numbers are put together in terms of the offences and the length of the sentences proposed.  Section 6, which deals with criminal trespass, is an all-embracing section and covers just about everything.  It is dangerous to include such a blanket provision in legislation; it is very heavy handed.</P>
    <P>The most pertinent section of the Bill is section 9, which deals with special local provisions in respect of order in public places and the making of prohibition orders by local authorities.  This is the best way of dealing with this matter.  It should be possible for local authorities to make by-laws, erect signs and ban certain activities in their areas.  As I said, this is the way to deal with the issue of order in public places.</P>
    <P>The legislation has not been put in a proper social context.  This is why I compare it with the excellent report on juvenile crime which we discussed last week.  The issue of juvenile crime was put in its proper context and dealt with in its proper context and as a result, the report put the onus on parents and the juvenile liaison system to deal with this problem.  The report proposes that juvenile crime committees should be established which would have a citizen input and which would search for solutions rather than impose sanctions.  This Bill seems to follow the old traditional tried, tested and found wanting methods rather than putting forward any new solutions. For that reason I am very critical of the <Col N="1585" /> Bill; it deals with the symptoms without looking at the causes.  No attempt whatsoever has been made to deal with the variety and complexity of issues which give rise to urban crime in particular and no solutions to the drugs epidemic have been offered.  Even though we have much legislation dealing with drug abuse we do not seem to be able to deal with this problem.  Legislation which proposes the imposition of sanctions will not deal with the problem if it does not also look at the causes.  Consideration also needs to be given to the education of people in disadvantaged areas, the low level of educational attainment by people in prison and those who have missed out on the educational system entirely.  We need to ensure that a greater remedial element is built into our educational system.  Our educational system needs to be made more relevant so that we can deal with problems of this nature.</P>
    <P>Many ghettos have been created in our cities without accompanying amenities or employment.  As local authority members, councillors and Deputies, we are giving rise to problems which cannot be addressed merely by passing legislation which imposes sanctions and criminalises certain activities.  It is natural for youngsters to congregate together.  If they do not have a proper place in which to congregate they will congregate in some of the areas referred to in the Bill &mdash; colleges, school premises, yards, building sites, gardens, parks, sports grounds, community centres, museums, galleries, theatres, cinemas, car parks and shopping centres &mdash; in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that they are there for an unlawful purpose.  Such groups may end up engaging in anti-social behaviour, but by and large they congregate because they have nowhere else to go.  We need to ensure that youngsters can engage in useful activities when they congregate together rather than trying to prevent them assembling.  There is a constitutional imperative in this respect and we cannot fly in the face of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should prefer a much broader approach than the one adopted in this <Col N="1586" /> measure.  The emphasis should be placed, not on the Garda or the prisons, but on the local authorities.  We should ensure that planning changes are made to bring about a mix of public and private housing in the urban environment and that relevant amenities are provided, including the sporting facilities which are so badly needed.  Our concern should be that all these things are put in place rather than bringing in an all-embracing, heavy handed, penalising type of legislation which would be more likely to aggravate than resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1993.  There is no doubt that the current level of crime in our society is a matter of serious concern. Many of us as public representatives have had difficult experiences with regard to crime and law and order within our respective constituencies. One has to accept the fact that a major increase in the rate of crime, often of an extremely appalling nature, is a feature of modern life in all developed and developing societies.</P>
      <P>One has to try to assess the reasons for this situation.  It is due to the massive unemployment level, or the exposure to violence on various media such as television, videos, films and books?  One thing is certain, people throughout this country are crying out for a solution and it behoves us as politicians to establish a framework even if it means more effective legislation in dealing with serious crime and law and order.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who is involved in ongoing discussions with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and his senior personnel.  I have no doubt that these discussions will play a major part in tackling the very serious problems facing us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we continue to work on improving our legal framework to make it more effective in dealing with crime, the most acute problems arising from current legislation must be identified.  I congratulate <Col N="1587" /> Deputy Harney on giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue.</P>
    <P>Once a crime has been committed it is vital that both the overall thrust of the law, and the details within the legislation, help as much as is reasonably possible to ensure a conviction when the defendant is guilty, while, at the same time, ensuring as far as is possible there is not a miscarriage of justice.  We have had too many examples in the recent past of miscarriages of justice, even in cases which have undergone one or more stages of appeal.</P>
    <P>We can never forget that the law is an extremely complex matter.  The hasty introduction of legislation is likely to diminish, rather than enhance, the effectiveness of the various layers of our justice system.  It is an extremely difficult task to provide fairness to everyone &mdash; victims and defendants.  It is extremely annoying when one sees cases being dismissed simply on the basis of small technical points.  If we are not careful when supplementing our laws we run the risk of providing a guilty party even greater potential for avoiding justice by simply playing with the technical details of legislation.</P>
    <P>A main objective of any change in the legal system must be to provide a meaningful deterrent to crime.  While this often means that the punishment must fit the crime, that consideration alone is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>One has only to examine our crime statistics to realise that many offenders repeat their crime.  We must address this situation as a matter of urgency.  Social conditions play a major role in the continual involvement of certain people in crime.  Very often individuals from deprived backgrounds see little hope of any improvement in their lives and thus have not much interest in or, indeed, respect for the rule of law and order.  I doubt that we can change these people from their repeated involvement in crime by simply adding more severe laws to the Statute Book.  The necessary impact on crime levels will only be achieved when <Col N="1588" /> such people see a bright future in our society.</P>
    <P>Despite my reservations regarding the proposed Bill in terms of the amount of preparation and consultation which has gone into its production there are a number of elements in the proposals which deserve serious consideration. There can be no doubt that, at the very least, all of our citizens should feel totally safe when walking along the streets.  A number of serious incidents recently in Dublin are, of course, to be regretted and we must take all necessary steps to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.  These were highlighted in the media in this country and throughout the world and have done untold damage to our tourism prospects.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of these matters and she has already taken a number of steps to deal with them.  These steps, include increasing the number of gardaí in relevant areas, and also increasing the number of clerical support staff in a number of stations.</P>
    <P>Just as the Minister has been prompt in her reaction to recent events, I am equally confident that she will address each and every issue proposed in the Bill before us when she is drafting her own proposals regarding changes in criminal law and that matters dealing with security on our streets will be dealt with in a full and effective manner.</P>
    <P>While we have been given very little time to consider the details of the proposed changes, from a preliminary examination I do not think they offer major improvements on existing legislation in terms of preventing crime.  Some aspects of the proposed changes do seem to offer improvements, especially in relation to the definition and prosecution of criminal behaviour in regard to such matters as riots, criminal trespass and violent disorder. I am sure the Minister is fully receptive to such positive aspects of the proposed changes.  I feel that it would be extremely wise to wait for the comprehensive proposals of the Minister in order to ensure that amendments to our criminal law are thoroughly researched, with direct and extensive consultations <Col N="1589" /> with all parties who are in a position to make a positive contribution.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by expressing my strong support for any developments in our criminal law which provide maximum protection for our citizens at all times. While it will be difficult to significantly reduce the level of crime in our society in a short time, nevertheless we must take every possible step to prevent crime to the greatest possible degree and to ensure that the criminal pays fully for his or her misdeeds.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House supports the objective of removing criminal activity from our society.  While we must do everything to maximise crime prevention, we must be equally determined to ensure that crime does not pay under any circumstance.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill which my party introduced at the first opportunity. We are painfully aware of the current crisis in law and order.  It is a phenomenon not peculiar to Ireland but rampant throughout the civilised world. It is difficult to decide on the appropriate legislative approach to deal with the problems we are facing.  There are underlying problems such as social deprivation and unemployment which are causing difficulties in countries throughout the civilised world.  It is large communities finding themselves totally disenfranchised in society that is leading to much of the crime.  Until such time as we begin to grapple with the underlying problem we are only tinkering at the edges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a Bill as important as this we tend to speak in the context of the Department of Justice being primarily responsible. However, it is the responsibility of Government as a whole when the various Departments are dealing with issues that have a direct impact on the type of society <Col N="1590" /> we live in.  The lack of effort on the part of some Ministers and some Departments leads to further deprivation, a rise in crime and lawlessness and an increase in the difficulties that people face.  The type of crime we are talking about is most evident and showing its greatest growth among young people.  This is because some of them have been raised in an environment of continual unemployment with a continuing sense of worthlessness, a lack of involvement in society and no opportunity to contribute positively towards the society they live in.  This leads in the first instance to petty crime, such as stealing small items from shops, as an outlet or as a way of getting some excitement.  This inevitably leads on to far more serious levels of crime.  The perception of some people who have gone down that road is that they have to steal because there is no other way they can survive in society.  Obviously, this is something I would not agree with, but that is the perception of many of those people who get involved in crime at an early stage.  They feel that the State has failed them, that the politicians have failed them, that there are no systems to make them feel that they are a whole and equal part of the society they live in.  They feel they are outside society and are, therefore, unable to contribute to society.  That is a failure on the part of society that runs right across the board.</P>
    <P>Another side to the question is the very serious drug problem that exists here and in other countries today.  People who feel they have no stake in society are looking for kicks, for ways of whiling away their time, for ways of removing themselves from the reality of life as it exists around them, because the reality is that they are not involved in society as many of us see ourselves involved in society today.  They take drugs as an escape from the terrible and awful world they have been born into, a world that has failed them.  The drug problem has grown into enormous proportions worldwide.  Every now and again we doff our caps to the drug problem in this country and recognise its existence and that there are things we must do.  The State is failing to put the necessary <Col N="1591" /> resources into dealing with this problem that is ravaging society here today, a problem that has grown from very small proportions and is increasing annually. The number of people abusing drugs in this country is growing at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>How then do we deal with this issue? I mean no criticism of the Garda Síochána but I do not believe there are enough gardaí on the ground.  We know that the numbers of gardaí in uniform has dropped substantially over the last number of years and that is a major reason for the difficulties we face in society today, particularly in the context of teenage crime and the drug problem.  When we look at old black and white films we see the image of the friendly bobby, the man who went around on his bicycle, had a kind word for everybody and knew everybody who lived in his local area.  Most important, the children of the area related to him.  They knew him on a first name basis, so there was not this barrier between themselves and the law that has grown up in recent times, largely because of the lack of a relationship on a personal level with the Garda.  That has disappeared from society within the last few years to a great degree.</P>
    <P>In the last 20 years we created these massive housing estates, which, I am glad to say, local authorities are no longer building.  These estates consisted of 1,000 or 1,500 houses in one area with very few green areas, few amenities and few opportunities for children to play and burn off that excess energy.  We created concrete jungles and that was a failure of society, a failure of planning, a failure of the people who made the decisions. However, we must recognise that these areas exist and we must recognise the difficulties that exist in them.  It is because of the way they were built that the difficulties are more obvious in those areas than they are in some others.  We must look at the possibility of again creating a Garda presence in those areas.  One way to do it would be to create small, active, friendly substations in these areas where there would be a constant Garda presence. <Col N="1592" /> It should not be the &ldquo;eye-in-the-sky&rdquo;, with somebody watching all the time, but somebody who is an active participant at realistic levels, who would be seen on the streets and would get to know the people who live in those areas and who make an incredibly valuable contribution to the wellbeing of people by the work they do in residents' associations and the work they do for their own communities, areas of involvement that are so valuable and so underresourced in society today.  We need the presence of the Garda in those areas and that would make a very substantial contribution to solving the problems.  I accept that high-tech equipment is valuable and important, but one has to balance the resources that are available and not get carried away by massive machinery to deal with the problems only on a statistical basis. Valuable as that is, we must balance that against our need for the continued presence of gardaí in the community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of the Garda in the new European liaison group.  This is particularly important at present because of the disappearance of the customs posts throughout the EC. One of the big questions being asked <i>vis-à-vis</i> this change is about movement of drugs within the EC.  That is a very serious issue that will have to be faced. It is right that the various police forces should become more closely associated with each other in order to deal with problems resulting from drug trafficking. Those who are making money out of drugs, the faceless barons, are faceless murderers in my view.  Anybody who provides drugs to young people is nothing more than a murderer living off inhumanity dished out to fellow men and women.  Those involved must be tackled. We must have legislation that deals with the assets of those who are charged and convicted of serious drug offences.  The assets that those people possess, ill-gotten gains, have largely been generated and made available through the traffic of drugs and should be taken from them, as a matter of course and not as a matter of some debate.  It is not a portion of the assets of those people that should be <Col N="1593" /> taken in an attempt to match the magnitude of their crime.  Everything should be taken from those convicted of direct involvement in procuring and selling drugs.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows of the serious problem in relation to demands for protection money.  It was the case for some time that big businesses and large stores were the victims of such racketeering but that has changed.  I know of people living in housing estates in my constituency who now have to pay protection money to people who live in other houses on the same estates so that they can live in peace and quiet, so that they will not be hassled on their way home and so that their children will be left alone.  People are paying protection money to avoid having their children beaten up on the way home from school or from being prevented from playing sport for the local team.  That is reality in Ireland today.  We will have to legislate to deal with this problem. Racketeering will not go away until the Garda are given power to deal satisfactorily with it.  A contributing factor to the problem is the lack of gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals also with the serious matter of loitering.  I fully recognise that someone's right to meet friends at the local corner and to go out for an evening or whatever one might do is something that we should be very careful not to try to prevent, it is normal activity in Irish society.  Sadly, however, there is clear evidence that groups of people are gathering for no reason other than to commit crime or to be obstructive and create difficulties for others.  We have failed to deal with that issue.  The measure brought before the House this evening by my colleague, Deputy Harney, is a reasonable approach to the problem of loitering.  We have to at least give that measure a chance, try it out and then determine what impact it will have on daily life.  It is preferable to judge the success of that measure in practice than knock it on the basis of theory.  I respect the concerns of other Deputies in this regard.  I have concerns myself, but crime and vandalism have become so prevalent <Col N="1594" /> the measures such as those before the House this evening must be considered.</P>
    <P>It will be a shame on this House and on those who oppose the Bill if the legislation does not pass this evening.  It is clear that the Bill represents the kind of lawmaking that is essential to the development of our society.</P>
    <P>I wish to allow the remainder of my time to be used by my colleague.  Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cullen for agreeing to share his time with me and for giving me the opportunity to say a few inexpert words about the Bill.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the criminal law in the area concerned is badly in need of reform.  I have not had the opportunity of following the debate as closely as I would have wished but I hope that if the Government does not permit the Bill to proceed to the next Stage the Minister will at least give a commitment to bring forward the Government's own measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney has done us a service in focusing on a fact of modern life &mdash; that there are several offences to which law-abiding citizens are regularly subjected in relation to which the law as it stands is ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should say that I take a somewhat schizophrenic approach in the sense that whereas I represent a constituency that very much demonstrates the necessity for the enactment of legislation such as this I recognise that the Bill does not &mdash; and, I suppose, by its very nature cannot &mdash; have any regard to the conditions that help to explain this phenomenon in modern society.  I do not offer those conditions as an excuse but as an explanation.  As Deputy Cullen said, very many young people feel completely alienated from society today.  They do not believe they have a stake in society, they do not participate in its economic activity and, as a result, the phenomenon that has been discussed in the House for four evenings now is worsened.  That is very cold comfort, however, to the law-abiding citizens who are suffering almost on a daily basis and who will suffer more <Col N="1595" /> severely during the summer months from many of the social phenomena that the Bill is envisaged to combat.</P>
    <P>I am especially interested in section 5 which is concerned with unlawful loitering in public places, and in section 9 which gives local authorities the power to make prohibition orders that would provide for the upholding of the law in certain public places.  Those two measures would go a long way towards dealing with many of the problems that besiege my constituents, especially during the summer.  We simply cannot countenance a continuation of some of the things that are happening at present. For example, almost every week my telephone rarely stops ringing after closing time on a Saturday night and sometimes on Sunday night because people want advice in trying to deal with the problem of certain houses being selected, for no apparent reason, for harassment, abuse and threatened violence by young people in the constituency.</P>
    <P>I am aware of situations where on the way home from the pub at night certain law abiding citizens in my constitutency have been subjected to violence to the extent of having concrete blocks hurled through the windows of their living rooms.  The Garda in Crumlin will testify to such a recent incident in Greenpark, Walkinstown in which a person in the living room of their home narrowly avoided being killed.  The fact that there are examples of families literally besieged by gangs of thugs, and that the law is apparently ineffective to cope with it, is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people.  We have to admit that the Garda in many cases are virtually powerless to deal with the problem.  For example, in a different part of my constituency, in Tallaght, I am aware that a family has been broken up for no other reason than the fact that their house juts out on an open space, an undeveloped area, which has become the haunt of young vandals, not just every weekend but throughout the week.  The man of the house has had a nervous breakdown and is now living apart from the rest of his <Col N="1596" /> family in a day care centre in a different part of the city.  He is afraid to visit his family except under cover of darkness. That situation is intolerable.</P>
    <P>The climate for this kind of activity has been created by the layout of many of the new, sprawling estates which have been a feature of planning in this city in particular over the last 20 years.  Many of the estates in my constituency are new. They were apparently in some cases an architect's dream, for reasons which escape me in most cases, and have as a feature laneways and connecting pathways which are the focus for anti-social activity.</P>
    <P>Section 3, and perhaps more appropriately section 5, would do a great deal to give the Garda effective powers to deal with the situation where laneways have become a source of constant nuisance &mdash; to put it at its mildest &mdash; for people who are trying to live a normal live.  Of course I am concerned about the relevance of any reform or updating of the criminal law where, apparently, the Garda are not equipped to implement some of the measures which Deputy Harney envisages in this Bill.  For example, in my constituency I have long argued for the efficacy of the community policing system.  I was alarmed when the powers that be in the Garda at the time continued to argue that this was a rural phenomenon which could not be imported to the city.  I do not see why it cannot.  Deputy Harney is aware, since we represent the same constituency, that a particularly gruesome murder some years ago in that constituency caused such panic throughout the hierarchy of the Garda that a very effective pilot scheme of community policing was introduced.  It was an unequivocal success and it is disquieting that it has now been abandoned because, I presume, of contraints on resources, although its abandonment coincided with a change in control of the Garda at Tallaght station.  I do not know whether that explains it, but certainly the previous man, Superintendent Bill McMullen, earned his place in the affections of my constituents by the efficiency, patience, understanding and tolerance with which <Col N="1597" /> he conducted the community policing experiment.  However, that has now fallen apart and you can see the effects.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have dealt with a number of matters in more detail but, in summary, there are many factors which breed the conditions which we are now experiencing in modern housing estates in Dublin and, I am sure, in other parts of the country.  Young children in many of these areas do not have any prospects in life; that is the main reason for crime. It is a pity it is left to the Garda to try to combat that phenomenon because it is a failure of the education and economic systems inasmuch as those young people have little hope.  I have had the experience &mdash; I am sure the same applies to the proposer of this Bill &mdash; of making representations to FÁS on a regular basis to have young people who have dropped out of education at a very early age accommodated on fundamental skills courses, very elementary courses on living skills.  FÁS responded by saying that they hope the young people concerned will stay longer than the previous people about whom I made representations. In other words, they drop out almost immediately.  Acknowledging that that is a fact of modern society we simply must update the law to give protection to people, especially to women in my constituency who cannot cross pathways for fear of gangs of young thugs attacking, assaulting and harassing them. If this Bill does nothing else apart from focussing attention on this problem and obliges the Government to introduce its own legislation, it will have been well worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lawlor for giving me five minutes of his time.  I congratulate Deputy Harney on introducing this Bill to the House.  However, I wish to express my sorrow and disappointment that the Minister for Justice is not present.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice has been here all day to listen to the debate on another Bill and now has to listen to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept of what Deputy Harney is trying to do in this very important legislation.  The old days are gone. Those who grew up in Dublin in the sixties remember with affection the enormous influence which &ldquo;Lugs&rdquo; Brannigan had in deterring petty crime and general nuisances thoughout the city.  However, the methods of detection and the serious crimes now being committed mean that this is a timely Bill.  When one speaks to Garda superintendents and sergeants, and members of the Garda in general, it is obvious that juvenile crime is very serious.  It is mostly concerned with larceny, burglary, assault and in some cases sexual assault.  The problem is caused by lack of parental control.  Those who bring children into the world do not live up to their responsibilities for one reason or another.  The breakdown of society is one <Col N="1599" /> of the symptoms of crime and the Bill goes some way towards addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>Instead of the sound of a football at night being a comfort and consolation to elderly people in remote parts of the country it is now a source of personal terror and individual nightmare which drives people to the absolute limit of insecurity and depression.  My county has the second lowest crime rate in the country, but I know many people who live in personal terror day and night and to them the sound of a dog barking, a car engine cutting out or a football is not what it used to be; in the nineties this could mean the wielding of a pick axe handle, a shovel or a lump hammer and this drives people in their later years into a world of personal terror.  In that context I support the measures recommended by Deputy Harney.</P>
    <P>During my short period in the Department of Education we set up a scheme, with the grandiose title of a high level liaison committee, that operated between the Departments of Labour and Education.  The idea was that the Department of Education would be able to inform the other Departments at a very early stage of young people who dropped out or had a truancy record so that arrangements could be made to cater for them where they do drop out of education on a full-time basis in order that they would not become involved in crime and making a general nuisance of themselves.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I had occasion to pass a public house where they were celebrating some occasion.  A young girl of no more than 14 or 15 years of age lay vomiting on the street.  It was beyond me how she was able to acquire the alcohol or alcoholic mixture that made her so sick, but this happens on a nightly basis and leads to all sorts of difficulties.  There is a clear need to codify and update the liquor licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I support the measures recommended by Deputy Harney in her Bill.  I trust that the Minister of State, who is here on <Col N="1600" /> behalf of the Government, will be able to accept it.  Finally, may I thank Deputy Lawlor for giving me these five minutes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides of the House appreciate fully the intent of Deputy Harney's Bill.  As the Minister for Justice has committed herself to the introduction of a Bill from the Government side, I hope both Bills will be seen as complementary, that decisive action will be taken and that legislation will be on the Statute Book shortly.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency adjoining that of Deputies Rabbitte and Harney and can elaborate in great detail on the complex difficulties that have arisen and continue to be of great concern to public representatives, community leaders, the Garda Síochána and others.  The large urban sprawls on the outskirts of the city were provided to meet a major housing crisis.  Housing had to be provided for large numbers of people.  Good quality new homes were provided for families in need of such accommodation.  However, because of recent demographic trends and the falling birth rate, we may not have to address that problem again.  The response to the crisis of large numbers needing housing was to provide houses on green field sites but we managed to create further crises by not providing the facilities and back-up services and supports. The root cause of the problems in the large urban estates is due to the breakdown of responsibility on the part of the bureaucracy of local authorities and Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of an incident where a fire tender was stoned by large numbers of youths with nothing to do congregating in the community a task force was charged with looking at the situation in the north Clondalkin area.  I wonder if the provisions in this Bill on loitering will make one whit of difference to the community I represent?  I wonder what will now happen to this very thorough report by the task force?  The statistics in the report are frightening; yet six to eight months afterwards it is still being sent from one Government Department to the next, up and down to the local authorities and <Col N="1601" /> over and back to FÁS and to the Garda Síochána.  The report is being sent round in an never ending circle.</P>
    <P>We are a small country of some 3.5 million people, we undertake to study the problems in our society, but the lack of action on the recommendations contained in these task force reports is unbelievable. I suppose the buck stops at the politicians.  I cannot understand why we cannot get the system to respond.</P>
    <P>The report states we are spending £446 million per year on the courts, the prison service and the Garda Síochána, not to mention all the other costs.  I cannot understand why somebody in the Department of Justice did not consider it worth while to calculate what is spent on these services over the past ten years and to build in some preventive measures which could be implemented in conjunction with the other arms of Government and local authorities.  In a three year period 1,946 crimes were committed in a community of approximately 6,000 homes in north Clondalkin.  Of this number 759 crimes have been detected, leaving a balance of 1,187 crimes that remain undetected in this small community. This is absolutely ridiculous. Something needs to be done immediately. This is the first area to be tackled by a task force and I believe the results can be applied in Dublin south-west, in the Minister's constituency in Limerick or in the large urban areas of north Cork. We need to implement the recommendations in this report.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be long on criticism and short on recommendation.  Surely there is a relationship between recruitment to the State services of young people who want to make a contribution to society but cannot because there is no avenue open to them.</P>
    <P>Another fact that will emerge from the statistics in this report is the lack of third level opportunities in my constituency. More young people now have good third level education qualifications, yet they do not secure employment.  Is there any hope for the young teenagers growing up in large urban areas who do not get that opportunity?  I believe that decisive <Col N="1602" /> action should be taken on the recommendations of the task force.  A combination of local authority and private sector interests are prepared and willing to provide a range of services, both commercial and leisure, in these communities. Something dynamic needs to be done.</P>
    <P>We are now establishing another layer of bureaucracy with the county development boards, who will relate to the IDA, FÁS and other State bodies.  We appear to be creating more pigeon holes for paper work, for more committee meetings, yet very little decisive action is happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>I understand there is in excess of 10,000 members in the Garda force.  I do not know if the deployment of manpower in the Garda is efficient, but since it appears that most crime is committed between 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. one must question whether the maximum number of gardaí possible is directed towards policing our streets during that time.  A primary school teacher has informed me that out of a total 34 or 35 of his pupils, 22 have reported that their homes have been broken into.  These are small three and four bedroomed detached and semidetached houses in built-up areas.  That is a frightening statistic.  Might it not indicate that there is something remiss with the deployment of gardaí?  It is not unusual to see three gardaí in a squad car.  I do not know what method is used to deploy Garda manpower, but there are not enough gardaí patrolling our streets.  A few ghastly crimes have been committed in O'Connell Street and they got a great deal of attention, leading to greater numbers of gardaí patrolling that street &mdash; probably to the detriment of some of the large housing estates which I represent.  As a result of the high presence of gardaí in O'Connell Street, house break-ins will increase.</P>
    <P>Our courts system needs to be addressed. The time of gardaí should not be taken up sitting around the courts waiting for offenders' cases to be heard.  This is an incompetent and inefficient procedure. There are many other slow and cumbersome procedures taking up the time <Col N="1603" /> of gardaí which prevents them from doing what we want them to do, to patrol large housing estates.  There should be many more gardaí on foot patrol, especially after dark, with, perhaps, the assistance of alsatian dogs and a link with their base. The Garda force could be deployed much more efficiently.</P>
    <P>Studies carried out in Denmark and the United Kingdom drew attention to the many social problems caused by the latch key children phenomenon.  As a member of a board of a community college I attended a meeting called with a view to expelling some pupils who had been causing problems.  When the parents were brought in we discovered that we would compound those families problems by taking the action proposed.  At the heart of this whole issue is the need for some preferential action in the large, unfinished urban areas.  They should not be decried and referred to as unsatisfactory because of bad planning and so on, although this is probably true. Nevertheless, we must rescue them and this will involve a great deal of concentrated effort.</P>
    <P>This Bill will improve the workings of the Garda force and our courts' system and I welcome that.  The Minister's Bill will probably take on board many of the recommendations in this Bill and, for that reason, it is timely that it should come before the House.  However, the spending by Government Departments of millions of pounds on various aspects of their work does not lead to an inter-relation. We could do a great deal with the promised £446 million in many of the areas about which we are concerned.  Surely we should examine the reasons for spending £446 million in this area?  Another ridiculous statistic which is causing concern in the housing sector is the fact that some £20 million will be spent on subsidised private housing.  Many young people living in seriously over-crowded conditions in large urban areas will be denied housing, yet private landlords will benefit to the extent of £20 million in this financial year.  Instead, we should construct and develop houses to accommodate <Col N="1604" /> over-crowded families in large urban areas.</P>

      <P>First, I thank the Minister of State for sitting through all this debate both last week and this evening.

      <P>I apologise for my failure to be here last Wednesday.  Unfortunately I had the 'flu and I was not being discourteous to the Minister by not being here for her speech on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for supporting the Bill and the Democratic Left Party for their commitment to support it. I understand some other members of the Technical Group will support it, but as I am not certain who they are let me, in advance of their doing so, thank them.  I also want to thank the large number of Deputies who contributed to the debate. It confirms &mdash; if I need such confirmation &mdash; that the incidence of crime and the dramatic increase in the seriousness of crime in recent years is of concern to the public and the politicians who represent them.  In my view this problem is as serious as the unemployment problem in that it causes destruction, hardship and a feeling of isolation in many people.  Very few people have not at some stage in the past few years been affected by the rising level of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the view that much of that crime, particularly the type we discussed in this debate, stems from the socio-economic problems confronting this country and I, more than anybody, know that to be the case.  Certain types of criminal behaviour are almost always committed by the unemployed or by people from the poorer sections of our society and they are brought before the courts, convicted and are serving sentences in our many detention centres around the country. However, a large number of people who <Col N="1605" /> do not come from deprived backgrounds are also involved in serious crime and I look forward to the day when many of them will serve their rightful place in some of our detention centres.  I refer, of course, to what is commonly known as the &ldquo;white collar criminal&rdquo;.  We seem reluctant to take prosecutions against many of those criminals.  I regret that, but it is part of the double-think in our society.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the Bill is very strange.  The Labour Party stated, with the exception of Deputy Costello, who does not support the measures, that the reason they would not support it is that the Minister is introducing her own Bill, but the Minister told us last week that there should not be a Bill because she did not see the need for most of the changes recommended in this Bill. Therefore, it is strange that so many Government Deputies &mdash; not just Labour Deputies but Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies &mdash; supported the principle of what was involved, saw the need for changes along these lines and told us the Minister was preparing her own Bill and that it would be introduced shortly.  I have studied the Minister's speech in great detail and that is not the case.</P>
    <P>This is not a perfect Bill and I never said it was but it is important to note, particularly in the context of the large Government majority, that when political parties and Deputies introduce legislation, imperfect and all as it may be, there is an opportunity at the next Stage to amend and improve it.  Because of the way the parliamentary draftman's office works, the whole procedure of drafting law is extremely slow, tedious and cumbersome.  In my view there will be no other major criminal law reform Bill before this House for the remainder of 1993.  If there is an emergency, for example, in regard to the Office of Public Works, we will certainly have emergency legislation introduced overnight, but other than what a Government might regard as emergency legislation we can forget about making any serious effort to reform our laws.  I stated earlier, in the context of the other Criminal Justice Bill, <Col N="1606" /> that the Government should produce their proposals in what I would regard as framework form; I accept that the broad framework of the legislation needs Government approval.  It should then go to the new committee that will be set up to deal with legislative and security matters and that committee should be given the resources to improve the framework and enact the legislation.  That would give us all a role as legislators which is, and should be, our first responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am tired of hearing Ministers for Justice tell us, every time there is a question or a debate about crime in this House, that crime is on the decrease.  I do not mind what the statistics convey.  I, and most reasonable people, know that crime is not on the decrease.  What has happened is that many people have given up reporting crime.  Most people take the view if their house is burgled or their handbag stolen that there is no point reporting it to the Garda Síochána because they will not be able to do anything about it.  That has been my experience also.  I do not criticise the Garda because it has not got the resources, the personnel and the laws to equip it to deal effectively with crime.  The editorial of the current edition of <i>Garda Review</i> states:</P>
    <P>Let's face it, things have never been so bad.  Crimes of violence are more prevalent than ever before, our citizens are frightened of walking on the main thoroughfares of our cities and in suburban estates like Ronanstown, really ugly scenes are repeated night after night.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take that on board and the departmental officials should stop writing into the Minister's script that crime is on the decrease because that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Minister's response to the provisions of the Bill I want to take issue with a statistic the Department of Justice is very good at including in ministerial scripts of late, that is the number of gardaí in the force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> They selectively give the Garda figure for January 1990 which they say is 10,472 and for January 1993, 10,984.  The Minister then tells us there has been an increase in the number of gardaí in the force.  However, the figure for mid-1985 was 11,400.  Therefore there are now 500 fewer members in the Garda Síochána than was the case in mid-1985.  I wish the Department of Justice, and the Minister, would be honest enough to admit that this is the case and stop using the January statistics.  Contrary to views constantly expressed by the Minister about new recruits, this year there will be 270 new recruits, but 420 gardaí will leave the force.  Therefore, at the end of this year the position will be even worse.  There is a certain dishonesty in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister questioned why we brought in the Bill and began her speech by telling us she was going to bring in a similar Bill.  She proceeded to go through the Bill section by section and told us there was no need for the provisions.  In the few moments available to me I will deal with some of the matters to which she referred.  The Minister said there is no need to change the law in relation to criminal trespass, that the changes made to the Larceny Act, 1990, are sufficient and, even if they are not, the Vagrancy Act, 1824, is more than adequate to deal with the problem.  The Minister quoted from that Act which refers to every person being found in or upon any dwellinghouse, warehouse, coach house, stable or outhouse.  To quote that kind of archaic language in 1993 is absolutely ridiculous.  If a person is found in a factory, an apartment or some of the more modern buildings or if a person is found in the DPP's office reading the file of his pending case is he liable to be prosecuted for criminal trespass?  A few years ago 141 files were taken from the DPP's office by what the Garda believes is a well organised Dublin gang, thereby preventing many prosecutions being taken.</P>
    <P>In relation to the racketeering the Minister said that the Garda has not told her there is a need to change the law.  I cannot tell the Minister how many gardaí <Col N="1608" /> have told me about the need to change that law.  At present an offence related to rape or incest gets a great deal of media attention and rightly makes ordinary decent people feel sickened by what they hear, but there is another serious crime that does not receive the same kind of media attention and the effect of that crime on families is of an equally sickening nature.  I know of a young Dublin businessman who six or eight weeks ago was shot by a well-known Dublin criminal gang for what the Garda firmly believes was his refusal to pay protection money. He was held at gunpoint for one hour in the company of a foreign visitor to Ireland &mdash; one can imagine the impression that left on that visitor.  The effect on that person and his family is as devastating as the effect of some of the cases we have heard about recently.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not tell me that the law on racketeering and protection money is adequate.  It is not even an offence to pay protection money, a practice that is rampant here.  In many parts of the city business people cannot get insurance because their premises are burned down so often, broken into and stones thrown through the windows. There is much talk about an enterprise culture and yet crime is driving many people away from enterprise.  Decent people who are trying to make a living, to be honest and to ensure that money does not get into the hands of criminals are penalised and the law is inadequate to protect them.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt about the extent of racketeering I will quote from <i>Garda News</i>.  The Minister is no doubt aware of the unit established in the Garda Síochána in 1991 to deal with racketeering. The Garda set up an operation called &ldquo;Operation Jolly Roger&rdquo; and procured warrants to raid video premises to stop the widespread use of pirate videos to fund IRA and other such activities. In Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Louth and Monaghan the Garda raided 30 premises and took videos worth £400,000.  They took items valued at £3 million to the legitimate video trade, including a converter for adapting American videos for <Col N="1609" /> European use and six photocopying machines used for video sleeves.</P>
    <P>Racketeering is rampant &mdash; the Garda know that is so &mdash; and is funding the provisional IRA as their other sources of finance such as Lybia have fortunately dried up.  This problem needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency but the law is not adequate in this area.  If this practice continues more people will be driven out of business, customers will pay more for their products, in certain parts of the country people will not be able to get insurance cover and those who are insured will pay higher premiums.  I do not want to hear the Minister say that the Garda has not told her there is need to change the law.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to the possession of material for what might be regarded as unlawful purposes.  The Minister wondered why the existing common law offence of conspiracy could not be used.  The reason is that, first, there has be more than one person involved and, second, conspiracy to commit a particular crime has to be proved.  As the Garda has found recently, it is not sufficient to find a man with wigs, moustaches and so on as well as details of a bank he intends to rob.  The Garda has to be able to prove that the person is going to commit a particular indictable offence, but that is impossible at present. Therefore, the existing law in relation to the possession of materials for the purpose of carrying out a crime is insufficient and again I do not want to hear the Minister tell us it is adequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comments on loitering were disappointing.  She sees no reason to create a new offence of loitering.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Rabbitte's comments in this regard.  Many people living in suburban Dublin are terrified to get public transport home in the evening because of gangs hanging around laneways and so on.  Many people travel by taxi rather than take public transport. Great play was made about the need for a footbridge over a motorway in Deputy Lawlor's constituency and millions of pounds were spent on its construction. However, people are now afraid to use <Col N="1610" /> this footbridge.  Occasionally young thugs use it to throw stones and damage cars.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision on riots, the Minister was correct in saying that we took this provision from the English legislation &mdash; I said that last week &mdash; but she said that there is no need for it here.  She said it was introduced in Britain to deal with dreadful riots, anti-Vietnam and fascist groups and so on and that nothing like that happens in Ireland.  What is the Minister's attitude?  We will wait until we have a massive riot and then the following week in the Dáil everyone will come in screaming for new legislation and the Government will rush in a Bill?  But the Bill will not deal with the riot last week but with the next riot, when perhaps some more people will have been badly injured or killed.  This legislation is necessary. If the Dáil is to be serious we must have the legislation in advance.  It will only be used when people commit crimes. It will not be used on innocent people. For Deputy Ferris's benefit, it will not affect those on picket lines.  The Industrial Relations Act provides adequately for people to picket.  Nobody with any serious intend would deny anybody the right to picket.  I wish the Deputy had come up with a better reason than that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that we should put more resources into crime prevention.  It takes £65,000 a year to keep a young person in detention in Trinity House.  That would probably give six young people some worthwhile activity to do for a year if it was spent on that. We have to have the law and the fire brigade approach because our legislation is so bad and we have to have the educational approach, which sometimes takes a generation to bear fruit because it is slow and painful, but I know it is very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the House I would ask the Government not to oppose it.  We have heard a lot about change, broadening democracy and Dáil reform.  If that means anything this Bill will not be opposed here this evening, because every reasonable person and the vast majority of the members of the Garda Síochána know that this kind of <Col N="1611" /> legislation is badly needed.  If it does not come now, I can guarantee that when we have serious crime and serious riots there <Col N="1612" /> will be a Government of some ilk bringing it forward here.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise the plight facing the self-employed workers in Coillte forestries who are being refused C2 certificates by tax districts in my region and to inquire whether there is a national policy by the Revenue authorities to refuse applications.  Many of these workers have put in a considerable amount of their own finances into equipping themselves for this hard work.  They have purchased chainsaws, protective gear and tools at their own expense.  They are also required to purchase the fuel to run the chainsaws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>These workers also have to pay their own travel expenses to and from the forests; some of the journeys could be 40 to 60 miles from their own homes.  Most of them have had to take part in FÁS courses in order to qualify for the work they are doing. When they received their first payment most of them received the total amount due, less 35 per cent tax.  This meant that effectively they had worked at a loss.  I accept that they can reclaim the extra tax which has been deducted, but the time lapse between the reduction, the repayment claim and the refund is unacceptably long for most of these workers. The amount they receive is not over generous and the deduction of 35 per cent tax means that they are effectively working at a loss.  This reduced payment causes extreme hardship for these families.</P>
      <P>The operators who approached me regarding the refusal to issue C2 certificates meet the necessary requirements normally requested by the Revenue Commissioners to qualify for these certificates &mdash; for example, tax paid up to date, a permanent place of business, etc. However, they have been inexplicably refused these certificates.  I have been given to understand that a direction from head office has been issued to the local tax districts &mdash; Cork and Waterford are the ones about which I am concerned &mdash; that no C2 certificates are to be granted to forestery tree fellers.  I ask the Minister to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.  The refusal to issue C2 certificates in this instance has already driven many of these people, who are anxious to work, on to the live register.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me.  The problem raised by Deputy Ahern has also been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents.  I suppose there is more than a strong possibility that some of the people who have spoken to Deputy Ahern have also been in contact with my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this problem has been caused by bureaucracy and red tape.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1615" /> it is another example of the measures which can prevent employment creation.  Many of the people working in the forestry area want to get on with their jobs and in the process hopefully create one or two other jobs.  It is most disappointing that the red tape and bureaucracy put in their way are diminishing their desire to work and to create jobs.  People at local level who show enterprise and initiative should be given every assistance possible.  They should not be hindered in any way, as the regulations governing the issue of C2 certificates seem to do.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to remove this further layer of red tape so that these people can get on with their work.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern and Deputy Bradford for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, provides that contractors in certain industries are required to deduct tax from payments to subcontractors unless the subcontractor has a certificate of authorisation, a C2 certificate, from the Revenue Commissioners.  These provisions were extended to the forestry industry by the Finance Act, 1992, to counter widespread abuse of the tax system within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements for the issue of certificates of authorisation are set out in the law and are designed to ensure that only genuine subcontractors who are likely to comply with their tax obligations qualify. Before issuing a certificate of authorisation, section 17 requires the Revenue Commissioners to be satisfied that (i) the person is, or is about to become, a subcontractor engaged in the business of carrying out relevant contracts including contracts in respect of forestry operations; (ii) the business is or will be carried on from a fixed place of business and that the subcontractor has all the stock, equipment and other facilities <Col N="1616" /> that in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are necessary; (iii) proper records are kept; (iv) the person and his partners etc., have a record of tax compliance over the previous three years; and (v) there is reason to believe that the person will comply with his tax obligations.  The law also allows the Revenue Commissioners discretion to issue a C2 certificate even though the full requirements are not met.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are obliged to deal with applications for certificates of authorisation in accordance with the law.  They are satisfied that the law is being applied to applications from subcontractors in the forestry industry in an even handed fashion throughout the country.  In cases where an application is refused the applicant may appeal to the Appeals Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, during Adjournment debates many points have to be made before one comes to the specific point of interest to the Deputies.  I am very aware of this.  However, some of the points I have made will obviously be of general interest.  Some 70 applications have been received from persons engaged in the forestry industry in the Cork area.  The following is the up-to-date position in regard to those applications: applications under consideration, 12; certificates of authorisation issued, 23 and certificates refused because the statutory conditions were not satisfied, 35.  Obviously, the latter certificates are those in which Deputies Ahern and Bradford and the other Deputies from the constituency are interested.  Appeals have been lodged in 15 out of the 35 cases where a certificate has been refused, and ten of those appeals have been heard to date.  It is an indication of the reasonable approach taken by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to these applications that the refusal of the certificate of authorisation has been upheld by the Appeals Commissioners in all ten cases.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the absence of a certificate <Col N="1617" /> does not preclude a person from carrying out their business, but tax is deducted at 35 per cent.  I wish to point out to the two Deputies concerned and other Deputies who may have received representations in regard to this matter that if they wish to submit further information in regard to individual cases I will be glad to bring the details to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  I am aware that many people in relevent industries or subsections of industries await the issue of C2 certificates from time to time.  I have had experience of this with people in the subcontracting area.  These people can quite rightly be very irked at times at the delays in the processing of appeals.  The Deputies should submit any further information available to me so that I can bring it to the attention of the Minister for Finance in an effort to ensure that the applications are more speedily processed.</P>

      <P>That is why both of us are here.  The loss of 184 jobs at the Molnlycke Factory is a disaster for the town of Dunmanway, County Cork, of the same proportions as the Digital disaster for Galway.  Following the layoff of 60 temporary workers approximately six months ago and a further 98 employees in November, it is intended to make an additional 28 people redundant next Friday.  This means that out of a total workforce of approximately 300, including <Col N="1618" /> temporary staff, nearly two-thirds will have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, the Molnlycke Factory has been the main employer in the Dunmanway area and the loss of approximately 200 jobs will be a savage blow to the town and its surrounding areas.  To compound the problem, approximately 30 jobs were lost with the closure of the Interhat Factory in the town last August and a further 25 employees were let go from a nearby timber company.  There was much publicity and expression of concern from the Government following the Digital disaster, and rightly so.  Understandably, too, the people of Dunmanway feel that they also deserve some attention from the Government for the blight that has been cast over their town.  There has been no significant response from the Government to the huge problems that confront almost 200 additional people who are now unemployed in the Dunmanway district. Townspeople have also suffered a mortal blow as a consequence.  Many additional service jobs have already also been lost in the shops and businesses of the town because the wage packets are no longer there and turnover has dropped drastically in most premises.</P>
      <P>The Government must respond to this cry for help.  Specifically, I want special priority to be given to the town by all Government agencies and every effort made to provide replacement industrial jobs.</P>
      <P>One heartening response to the crisis is that the local community leaders have banded together with ex-employees in a voluntary committee to investigate job possibilities themselves.  A huge amount of work has been done by this committee to date and indeed any prospective industrial employer has a readymade local organisation ready and more than willing to help in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also accept that local officers of the IDA have responded to requests for information and have been sympathetic to the cares and concerns expressed by the committee.  This is not enough.  I want action from the Government.  I want <Col N="1619" /> special priority given to the town of Dunmanway which has suffered such great job losses.  Unless I have assurances from the Minister in response to this request, followed by immediate action, the people of Dunmanway will very rightly feel that theirs is a neglected town and one that has been written off by this Government. The time for action is now and on behalf of the people of Dunmanway I demand that action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for allowing me an opportunity to speak on this important matter.  The final stage in the reduction of the workforce in Molnlycke has taken place.  A clear SOS is going out from Deputy O'Keeffe and myself to the Minister urging immediate action to alleviate this drastic problem in Dunmanway. These people have been laid off by Molnlycke because they brought in people from the Far East and trained them in Dunmanway.  The company can employ labour more cheaply in the Far East than here.  It is not good enough for an international company to take advantage of people here and then pull out.</P>
      <P>The lay-off of Digital workers in Galway received very wide media coverage but the problem in Dunmanway is of equal importance to the people in that town and throughout the constituency. Almost two-thirds of the workforce is to be made redundant.  The majority of these people have to meet hefty loan repayments.  Pious platitudes from the Minister are not enough.  We need action and a replacement industry for Dunmanway to fill the vacuum which has been created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Keeffe and Sheehan for bringing this matter to the attention of the Dáil.  They have put forward their point of view with undoubted sincerity and vehemence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> There is no doubt that representing one's town and constituency give words great potency on such occasions.  Adjournment debates are the true expression of constituency concerns on the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of the Deputies about the difficulties being experienced by Molnlycke.  The company set up as Steritex Limited in 1974, producing plastic medical disposable surgical gowns, caps and drapes.  It was part of a Swedish enterprise.  The Deputies have this information.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, competition from Far Eastern products has greatly affected the company in its European markets and Molnlycke no longer produces surgical gowns.  The Dunmanway factory today produces an extensive range of disposable surgical drapes.  These products are unique to Dunmanway and were introduced in 1990.  They were part of positive research and development, which the firm undertook, to get into an area where there was the prospect of a growing market.  It was hoped that a smooth slow-down in the production of gowns would occur at Dunmanway and that this reduction would be compensated for by an increase in the production of drapes.  It did not work out that way.</P>
    <P>The company has consistently met and, indeed, exceeded its employment target of 245 jobs, reaching peak employment of 261 in the Cork operation in 1991. However, in September 1992 the company indicated that they intended seeking redundancies at the Dunmanway plant. On 23 October 1992 the company announced that they would be seeking 126 redundancies from the period December 1992 to March 1993, thus leaving a permanent workforce of 120 people in Dunmanway.</P>
    <P>The company is optimistic.  I appreciate the strength of the concerns expressed by the Deputies.  It is too early to say when the growth of the drapes business might mean an increase in <Col N="1621" /> employment.  Output growth is dependent on the acceptance by the European market of the concept of disposable drapes.  In the US at present 90 per cent of the market is supplied by disposable drapes, while in the European market only 30 per cent is so suppied.  The company hope to close that gap and it is expected that the European market will grow towards US levels.  I hope that a growth in the disposable drapes market will justify the foresight of the Dunmanway firm in looking to this area and that it will be fruitful for them.  Very often firms have not looked to the future and have not seen the areas into which they could grow and diversify.  This firm has done so and it is now a matter of marketing to see that the European market makes up the leeway.</P>
    <P>The Department is conscious of the employment situation in the south-west Cork area and of the impact of job losses. Deputies are quite right in claiming that proportionately the impact of these job losses in Dunmanway and the surrounding area is just as great as the impact of the Digital job losses in Galway.  We share the huge sense of loss at Digital but it must be remembered that other areas in the country are experiencing poignant examples of job losses.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the IDA will continue strenuous efforts to locate new industries in the area, which is being marketed as an entity.  While support agencies play an important part in assisting industrial development, much depends on the external trading environment. I hope that the objects for this firm will in time lead to a growth in its market share.  I am interested in the company and in the way it has set about its business.  I genuinely feel there is hope and cause for optimism in Dunmanway in the future growth of the firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate <Col N="1622" /> the opportunity the Chair has given me to raise this matter.  I have raised the issue on two previous occasions.  As a native of Foynes, and a former pupil of the local secondary school, I am most disappointed that the Department of Education has not clarified what will happen to second level education there beyond 1995.</P>
      <P>In January 1991, the Sisters of Mercy wrote to the parents of the students stating that they would not be continuing with the provision of education beyond 1995.  This caused immediate concern in the area.  In February 1991 a public meeting was held in Foynes and all politicians pledged their support for the continuation of education at this location. An action committee was formed at local level and since then they have been in contact with three different Ministers for Education, Deputies Davern, O'Rourke and Brennan.  Now they have been in contact with the present Minister.</P>
      <P>The convent has 230 pupils.  The parents have proposed the amalgamation of the Shanagolden Vocational School and the convent thus creating a community college in the area.  This would be welcomed by the local vocational education committee.  The Sisters were prepared to sell this fine educational establishment for £500,000.  The action committee hired an architect who also does work for the Department of Education.  He recommended that it was good value for money and in sound structural condition.  The convent are now refusing to accept first year pupils.  This is understandable as they cannot guarantee that they can complete their education cycle at this location.  At the Shanagolden, Kilcolman, Ballyhahill, Loughill and Foynes schools there are about 86 pupils completing their primary education this year. Where will these pupils go to complete their education?  Parents, pupils and teachers have been left under a cloud of uncertainty regarding the future role of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 March, when I last raised this <Col N="1623" /> matter, I was told that the officials of the Department would be submitting their report to the Minister that week and that the Minister would not be able to assess the proposals until the report had been studied.</P>
    <P>The previous and the present Governments have delayed too long on this issue and the parents, pupils and teachers have been shabbily treated because of Ministers' indecision.  The enthusiasm and commitment of the committee is to be admired.  They recognised that there might be budgetary constraints but were prepared to appoint trustees and purchase the school with the possibility of the Department of Education leasing it back over a ten year period.  I call on the Minister, as the fourth Minister to deal with this matter, to face up to the issue and allow the community college go ahead.  I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Deputy will be aware that the Mercy Order in the Diocese of Limerick announced, in 1991, its intention of withdrawing from the management of its post-primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, in 1995.  As the Stella Maris School is a voluntary secondary school, this decision was a matter solely for the Mercy Order.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the great work which the Mercy Order has carried out for many years at their school in Foynes catering for both day and boarder pupils.</P>
      <P>The Stella Maris School is located in the West Limerick catchment area which is unique in that it has four post-primary schools located in four different locations.  The three other schools are Scoil Mhuire Secondary School, Askeaton, Salesian College, Pallaskenry and the Vocational School, Shanagolden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the Department has considered that some measure for rationalisation <Col N="1624" /> at post-primary level should be implemented in this catchment area and since the late sixties the matter has been discussed periodically with the four managements involved in post-primary education in the catchment area.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the Mercy Order announcing its intention to withdraw from management, the Deputy will be aware that a school action committee was formed in Foynes with the intention of keeping the Stella Maris School in operation after 1995, under a new management, County Limerick Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>The Department carefully considered a submission made by the Action Committee and the question of whether the school could be continued in operation beyond 1995 has been under consideration. One option, that of leasing the school property from the Mercy Order, has been explored but found to be unacceptable to the Sisters.</P>
    <P>The point has now been reached where the school management has decided not to take in new pupils into first year of the junior cycle next September.  The question of how best to facilitate those pupils who would formerly have enrolled in the Stella Maris School is under examination in the Department at present and, in view of the urgency of the case, it is hoped to complete the examination as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that there will continue to be a sufficient number of pupil places available to cater for all those seeking a post-primary education in the catchment area.  Every effort will be made to meet this responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I thank the Minister of State for attending. There is widespread concern and anxiety <Col N="1625" /> throughout the parish of Gweedore as to the future of the turf generating station. This station has been operational since 1958 and during that time has provided a livelihood and an income for 200 to 300 families in this impoverished Gaeltacht region.</P>
      <P>At present there are 30 employees in the station and almost 200 families provide the turf that is harvested locally, generating an income of almost £1 million annually in an area with the highest unemployment figures in the country.</P>
      <P>Last year, the board of the ESB recommended the closure of the station.  Emergency meetings of workers and suppliers were arranged which resulted in a five to seven year development plan being submitted to the then Minister, Deputy Molloy, and at the end of that time the future and viability of the station could again be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Since then the only response to the development plan has been a brief press release stating that the station may be given another year or two.  The Minister should clarify the following points tonight: what are the exact plans for the future of the station; is the development plan and its timescale being accepted by the Government and the ESB and is the station being wound down at present and closing completely at the end of 1994? Immediate clarification is urgently needed tonight to restore the confidence of both the employees and turf suppliers.</P>
      <P>The closure of that facility in Gweedore would be a devastating blow to the economic fabric of west Donegal, a region already hard hit by unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>The Minister should guarantee undertakings already given by his predecessors that the station will be left open so long as the people of west Donegal continue to produce the necessary quota of turf towards its efficient operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation <Col N="1626" /> to the Gweedore power station is that the ESB has been requested to continue to operate the station until the situation is finally reviewed in 1995.  The age of the station and the costs associated with generating electricity at Gweedore mean, however, that in the light of energy efficiency no guarantees on the future of the station can be given beyond 1995.</P>
      <P>A key consideration for the future of the station is the quality of turf available. Supplies have declined in recent years and while there are indications that some additional supplies may be available within the existing supply area, the scope for increasing supplies without further investment in bog development and machinery is very limited.  As the plant is 35 years old its continued operation has to be conditional on the technical condition of the plant.  That creates considerable uncertainty about the future.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair and uneconomic to require the ESB to invest in maintaining the station if turf supplies could not be increased and relied upon and it would be equally wrong to encourage investment in turf cutting if the operation of the station could not be guaranteed for a reasonable length of time so that the turf supplies could be consumed for generation. As of now it is difficult to recognise a workable basis for the continued operation of the station past 1995, but the position will be kept under constant review both in the Department and by the ESB.  I am assured by the ESB that any decision made in the future by the board in relation to the Gweedore power station will not result in any compulsory redundancies among its staff.</P>
      <P>I refer the House to the statement issued by my Government colleague, Minister Gallagher, on 9 December last when, after consultation with the Taoiseach, who was then Acting Minister for Energy, the Minister of State confirmed that the Gweedore station would continue to operate until 1995, when the position would be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment I have had representations <Col N="1627" /> and consultations with Minister Gallagher and Deputy Mary Coughlan regarding the position at the Gweedore power station.  I can again confirm to the House that the position prevailing at the time of the Government <Col N="1628" /> announcement in December last still obtains.  I trust that this confirmation is to the satisfaction of the representatives of the people of sweet Donegal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the provision and organisation of services at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranabraher is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that a working group representative of the Southern Health Board, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary/ Victoria Hospital, Cork and the Department of Health was established in 1990, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Kenny, to draw up a plan for the development of hospital services in Cork city and county for the next decade.  The Cork Hospitals Review Group's report was received in my Department in January of this year.  The report contains a recommendation <Col N="1435" /> that, in the long term, consideration be given to the centralisation of orthopaedic services in the Cork Regional Hospital campus and that St. Mary's be closed as an orthopaedic hospital.  The report has been circulated to the Southern Health Board and the two voluntary hospitals in Cork for their views on its contents.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also wish to know that approval was given to the Southern Health Board by my Department last year to provide new clean air facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranabraher. A project team has been established and the planning process is underway.  It is anticipated that work on the project will start later this year.</P>

      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board have informed me that they have not experienced any problems in meeting the demand for respite care for the elderly in South Tipperary.  Such care is provided at St. Patrick's Geriatric Hospital, Cashel, usually during the summer months when carers wish to take holidays.</P>
      <P>Respite care for people with mental handicap is provided by a number of service providers within the region.</P>
      <P>Additional respite care facilities for people with mental handicap were provided in the South-Eastern Health Board area, and in particular in South Tipperary, as part of the developments in services for people with mental handicap which were put in place in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the additional funding which has been provided in 1993, services for people with mental handicap, including respite care, will continue to be developed in line with the priority needs <Col N="1436" /> of the region as identified by the South-Eastern Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the provision of ambulance services in the Eastern Health Board area are a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that, prior to 1988, it operated two ambulance control centres in the greater Dublin area, one based at Loughlinstown Hospital and one based at St. James's Hospital.  In order to avail of improved technology and to utilise its resources more effectively, the board decided to develop a centralised ambulance control centre for the greater Dublin area.  The board is confident that this has resulted in improved planning and scheduling of the ambulance workload and the provision of a more effective service to the public. The board's development of a single centralised control centre for an operational area conforms with both national and international developments in the provision of emergency services.</P>
      <P>In regard to training of ambulance personnel, I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that it conforms fully to the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work regulations.  In addition, all ambulance personnel are required to undergo the national basic training course in ambulance aid which includes instruction in specific areas of health and safety e.g. lifting techniques and personal hygiene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the board that equipment is issued to ambulance personnel <Col N="1437" /> in accordance with the recommendations of the National Ambulance Council.  However, there is an ongoing monitoring of the risk factor involved in the work of ambulance personnel and, where a degree of risk is identified as requiring additional safety equipment, this will be supplied by the board</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major review of ambulance services nationally is currently being completed by my Department, together with the health boards.  It is the intention that the forthcoming recommendations of the Ambulance Review Body in relation to the provision of these services will be taken into account by the health boards when considering any future developments.</P>

      <P>The decision by Government to increase public in-patient and out-patient hospital charges was taken in the context of restructuring the cost sharing arrangements which operate in the public hospital sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding upon the level of increase the Government was mindful that payment <Col N="1438" /> of the charges should not lead to undue hardship for an individual or family.  In this regard I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards in exercising their discretionary powers on grounds of hardship to be particularly conscious of patients' circumstances. I have suggested, as a general guideline, that the total out-patient charges for any one family should not exceed £60 in a twelve month period.  In relation to the public hospital in-patient charge I have instructed my Department to carry out a review of the current regulations to ensure that the charge does not have a disproportionate impact on persons admitted to hospitals for very short stays.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board offers a low cost healthcare insurance plan (Plan P) against the cost of public hospital in-patient and out-patient charges.  The current annual group scheme subscription rate for cover under this plan is £10.50 for an adult and £4.55 for a child.</P>

      <P>Under new arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone regardless of income is entitled to public consultant services free of charge.  Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of being private patients of the consultant.  The <Col N="1439" /> implementation of this recommendation was sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and agreed by the Government and the other social partners in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>No speciality was excluded from either the commission's recommendation or the new legislation.  I have reviewed the issues involved and I am satisfied that preferential treatment can arise for private patients in any speciality, including obstetrics, and consequently I do not propose to introduce separate arrangements for obstetrics.  With regard to the operation of the new system, my Department monitors this to ensure that the objective of improving equity of access is achieved.</P>

      <P>The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  I would point out that it is very difficult to arrive at an average waiting time as the waiting period for each patient will differ according to his or her medical requirements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the filling of the second cardiac surgeon post at Cork Regional Hospital, I understand that the Local Appointments Commissioners held interviews for the post on Friday last.</P>

I will consider the recommendations contained in that report before deciding on any particular course of action.</P>
      <P>However, my primary concern is the cost of providing indemnity cover for consultants employed in the public health service.  The provision of indemnity for self-employed consultants or consultants engaged solely in private practice is a matter between those consultants and their medical defence organisations.</P>

When the order is approved the health board submits copies 1 and 2 to the named pharmacy.  As the stock received by the doctor is dispensed he completes a record form for each dispensing.

      <P>When comparison is made on the basis of expenditure <i>per capita</i> on health services, the North Eastern Health Board is the lowest.  I would point out, however, that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average and fails to take account of a number of important demographic and geographic factors.  The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialties, density of population and, particularly, the present stage of development of the services.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board is currently reviewing its services with a view to identifying the specific service areas in need of attention.  Following this review, my Department will be entering into discussion with the board regarding its future needs.  While the pace of advancing priority developments within the health services must have regard to the overall level of funding allocated by Government, every effort will be made to fund the agreed development needs of the Board on a phased basis.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce hospital in-patient waiting lists.  The overall objective is to eliminate excessive waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting E.N.T. or eye treatment.</P>
    <P>I will announce my decision in regard to the allocation of the £20 million in the coming weeks.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the level of funding he intends to direct towards education and publicity on the dangers of alcohol abuse in 1993; and if, in view of the clear evidence of high levels of alcohol abuse in this country, particularly among young people and teenagers' he agrees to the need for greater funding for this area of health education.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Alcohol abuse is, in many cases, dealt with in the context of more comprehensive substance abuse programmes and, accordingly, it would be very difficult to specify the level of funding directed at tackling the problem.  However, the various programmes which are being funded by my Department's Health Promotion Unit and which I detail hereunder will cost more than £200,000 in 1993.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that a concerted effort by all of those involved in alcohol abuse prevention is needed in order to tackle the present problems caused by the abuse of the legal drug alcohol in our society.</P>
      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit is actively involved in a multifaceted strategy but measures necessary to address the complexity of the problem fall within the remit of a number of Government Departments, statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Alcohol Policy</i>
      </P>
      <P>In pursuance of a broadly based policy on alcohol, its use and abuse, we are in the process of developing a policy which will address the various economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors which impinge on alcohol use, with a particular emphasis on under-age drinking.  The Advisory Council on Health Promotion has completed a major consultative exercise involving national and regional organisations, including youth organisations, and it also considered submissions from the general public on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendations from the Advisory <Col N="1451" /> Council will dictate the focus of preventive and educational strategies in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Health Promotion Unit is engaged in a number of alcohol education initiatives in schools, the non formal education sector and in the community. I believe that if we can foster the development of social and decision making skills, backed with sound information on the topic of alcohol young people will be helped to make healthy lifestyle choices regarding the use of alcohol.</P>
    <P>
      <i>School Based Programmes</i>
    </P>
    <P>At primary level alcohol education is incorporated into the various health education programmes which have been developed by health boards.  At second level a Substance Abuse Prevention Programme including materials on alcohol, jointly developed by the Departments of Health and Education, with the assistance of Mater Dei Counselling Centre, will conclude its pilot phase this year. Following evaluation it will become widely available to schools in the next academic school year 1993-1994.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit's Health is Lookin' Good, a competition running in all primary and second level schools has substance abuse, including alcohol, as one of its themes.  Young people, through this competition, will have a say in the development of a message to their peers on alcohol and other drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Drink Awareness for Youth</i>
    </P>
    <P>Drink Awareness for Youth developed in 1990 and jointly funded by my Department and the Youth Affairs Section of the Department of Education in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland continues to be a successful programme in alerting young people to the dangers of alcohol abuse and in training them to make responsible decisions regarding its use.  The programme is being used by youth leaders, teachers, gardaí and others who work with young people as a way of exploring attitudes to <Col N="1452" /> and awareness of problems relating to alcohol and its abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Parent Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>A Parent Education Programme is being developed by my Department's Health Promotion Unit with the Cork Social and Health Education Project in the Southern Health Board.  This programme helps parents cope with the problems of communication and conflict which emerge in dealing with the abuse of alcohol and other drugs by young people.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Drugs Questions &mdash; Local Answers (DQLA)</i>
    </P>
    <P>This broadly based community programme uses an inter-disciplinary approach in developing a community response to local alcohol and drug problems. It brings together health and education professionals, social workers, gardaí, civic representatives, youth workers and voluntary groups who under the guidance of expert facilitators examine what steps can be taken to tackle local problems.  This course continues to be a successful step towards addressing alcohol related problems at local level.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the Health Promotion Unit to launch a specific alcohol education media campaign during 1993. This will be complemented by the activities of a number of other statutory and voluntary agencies who are all concerned with the high level of alcohol abuse among the community and among young people in particular.</P>

      <P>I have checked with the Western Health Board which has confirmed that the person in question was recently put on the out-patient waiting list but the board <Col N="1454" /> is not in a position to give an appointment date at this stage.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the clinician concerned.  Should the person feel that their condition has deteriorated, they should return to their general practitioner who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of their case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to discuss the current situation regarding orthopaedic waiting lists with the Western Health Board in the context of its 1993 revenue allocation which issued recently.  A sum of £20 million has been provided this year in the Health Estimates to reduce waiting lists for certain specialities where there are long waiting times for admission to hospital.  These specialities include orthopaedic surgery, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.  The aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties for which there are unduly long waiting times. Decisions in relation to disbursements of waiting list funds will be taken in the coming weeks following detailed discussions with the agencies concerned.</P>

    <P>It is proposed that new mental health legislation would provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for a review of every decision to detain a mentally ill person for treatment and for a review of long term detentions; set down the criteria and procedures to be followed in detaining a mentally ill person, and specify the length of such detention and the safeguards to protect the right of mentally ill patients to give informed consent to treatment.  It is my intention to bring forward proposals to Government for new mental health legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The costs associated with the introduction of new mental health legislation will not become apparent until new legislative provisions have been drafted following consideration of the proposals by Government.</P>
    <P>I am committed to bringing forward a Charter of Rights for the mentally ill as promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This charter will safeguard the rights of patients in mental hospitals and ensure that high standards of care are maintained.  The charter will also safeguard the rights of discharged hospital patients who remain in the care of community based psychatric services.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Charity/Mercy Healthcare <Col N="1456" /> Company Limited was established by the Charity and Mercy Congregations in 1991 to determine, manage, and control overall policies and to act as an administrative, co-ordinating and supervisory body for the following six hospitals which the Orders own in the Dublin area: St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh; The National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire; St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire; The Children's Hospital, Temple Street; Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Eccles Street and St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park.  As Minister for Health, my principal objective is to ensure that any mechanism for improving co-operation between these institutions would enable them to deliver patient care in an effective and efficient a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I feel that any savings which might accrue from a more co-ordinated management structure should be used for the provision of better patient care.  Similarly, I would consider that the elimination of any unnecessary duplication of resources identified by the co-ordinating body for the six hospitals will help to ensure that the financial allocations which my Department makes for the provision of health care by those hospitals are used in the most beneficial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with all independent voluntary hospitals in the Dublin area and elsewhere which rely on public funding, the Charity/Mercy Healthcare Company have confirmed to my Department that it is their intention to continue to deliver and organise the services provided in the six hospitals within the parameters of public policy on hospital services as set down by my Department.  My responsibility as Minister for Health is to ensure, given the substantial public funding provided to the six hospitals, that the existing conditions of employment of all staff employed by the hospital will be fully protected and that the policies of Comhairle na nOspidéal and other relevant statutory agencies will be adhered to.  My Department has held discussions with the Company on its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association and I <Col N="1457" /> have been assured that, in exercising any powers relating to the organisation of services in Dublin, Government policy will prevail.  Furthermore, I have been assured by the Charity/Mercy Healthcare Company that there is absolutely no question of the closure of any of the six hospitals or part of the hospitals involved.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the Government is determined to develop and expand the services for people with mental handicap.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to enable the recommendations of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;<i>Needs and Abilities</i>&mdash; to be accelerated.  This report, which was published in 1990, provides the guiding principle for the future direction of the mental handicap services which is, the development of each person's potential to live as full and independent a life as possible.  I will be working closely with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to ensure that this principle is put into practice throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The 1993 Estimates of my Department include provision to maintain, in real terms, the 1992 level of services this year. In respect of the mental handicap agencies directly funded by my Department, an allocation of £104.7 million has been made available, which represents an increase of £7.3 million or 7.5 per cent on the final 1992 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the special additional funding announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, it will be possible to put in place this year significant <Col N="1458" /> improvements in services in addition to strengthening existing services for people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to implement a package of measures which will address the most acute needs for service developments. Additional funds will be made available throughout the country, with particular attention to the health boards with the greatest number of clients without services. This funding will be on top of the additional funding of £6 million made available in 1992, which is being repeated this year.</P>
    <P>Consequently the following additional services will be put in place for people with a mental handicap and their families this year: an additional 70 residential places, an additional 200 day places, an extension of respite services to support families, this extension will make progress towards the point where planned respite breaks will be available, on a regular basis, to all families and carers, additional home support services for 800-900 families, improved services for those who are behaviourally disturbed, further transfers of people with mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements within the mental handicap services and an extension of early intervention and child development services.</P>
    <P>The actual services to be provided will be agreed in each health board area by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, which are representative of the health boards, voluntary agencies and parents, and approved by my Department.  The boards will shortly be given details of the allocation of this additional funding.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioners services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. At present almost 36 per cent of the population hold medical cards.</P>
      <P>I have given the issue raised by the Deputy very careful consideration and I would of course be anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  However I do not think that it is justifiable to grant an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    <P>The new HIB vaccine was introduced in October 1992.  I am satisfied with the resources being provided for this programme which is delivered through public health doctors and general practitioners. The programme is being promoted by the Department and the health boards and towards this end, the Health Promotion Unit of the Department circulated promotional leaflets aimed at parents and health professionals.  A total of 200,000 copies of the leaflet for parents and 5,000 copies of the leaflet for health professionals were circulated through maternity hospitals, health centres, general <Col N="1461" /> practitioners, pharmacies and the Health Promotion Unit itself.</P>
    <P>The vaccine manufacturers have also prepared comprehensive information for health professionals and leaflets for parents. A vaccine information pack has been offered to all health care professionals including general practitioners, public health doctors, public health nurses, paediatricians, microbiologists, maternity hospital etc.  A media seminar on HIB which was addressed by professionals from our health services was held recently.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Study Group on the Development of the Psychiatric Services, Planning for the Future published in 1984 recommended that alcohol related problems should be dealt with at a community level by the primary health care and social services.</P>
      <P>Current policy relating to treatment of alcoholism is in line with the recommendations of Planning for the Future. A comprehensive range of services in the community for people with alcohol related problems is being developed throughout the country.  There is no evidence to suggest that intensive, high cost in-patient treatment is more effective than community based intervention in assisting people with alcohol addiction.</P>
      <P>The question of involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals, including those persons who suffer from alcoholism, is currently being reviewed by my Department in the context of the Green Paper on Mental Health which was published in June, 1992.  The Green Paper draws attention to the exclusion, under the European Convention on Human Rights, of social nonconformity, including addiction to alcohol, as grounds for involuntary detention of a person in a psychiatric hospital.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring forward to Government proposals for new mental health legislation this year which will deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with the grounds for involuntary commital to psychiatric hospitals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 131, 141, 145 and 146 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are wide variations in the availability of speech therapy services in different parts of the country.  However, it is not possible to specify an average waiting time for each health board as waiting times vary <Col N="1464" /> depending on the priority afforded to different categories of clients e.g. young children, stroke victims, motor neurone and multiple sclerosis sufferers) and on the staffing levels in particular Community Care Areas.</P>
    <P>I will be making available additional funding this year for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and it is my intention that a proportion of this will be devoted to improving and expanding community based therapy services, including speech therapy.</P>
    <P>With regard to speech therapy services in the Eastern Health Board area, the Board recruited nine additional speech therapists in 1992 and an additional two speech therapists have been recruited so far this year.  Arrangements are also being made to hold interviews to recruit additional staff which should considerably reduce the waiting period for speech therapy services.</P>
    <P>As far as the Southern Health Board is concerned, my Department has recently received an application from the Board for the appointment of six additional speech therapists and this is being examined in the context of other applications for staff improvements submitted by the Board.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the delays in the provision of speech therapy services is the inadequate numbers of trained speech therapists.  My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, at Trinity College Dublin, commencing in the current academic year.  The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students this year to 104 students in 1995/96.  I am confident that the increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development will considerably ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have had discussions with the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists and have provided assistance towards the preparation by the Association of a <Col N="1465" /> Review Document on speech and language services throughout the country. This document is currently being finalised by the Association and I hope that it will be of assistance to me in bringing about further improvements in the service.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, is aware of public concern regarding the possible adverse health effects of electro-magnetic radiation emanating from overhead power lines.  The Swedish study referred to has been noted.  However, research in this area is on-going internationally and the general body of evidence to date has not established a casual relationship between this form of radiation and cancer.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, has also pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power lines in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1992 concerns were expressed by some residents in the Santry, Ballymun area of County Dublin regarding a possible association between electro-magnetic radiation levels from overhead power lines and cancer mortality in the area.  A study was carried out in the area by the Eastern Health Board. The findings of the study indicated that the levels of electro-magnetic radiation were not a factor in the cancer mortality rate for the area and that the residents <Col N="1466" /> could be completely re-assured about their impact on health.</P>

      <P>I wish to confirm that the construction of the Tallaght Hospital is the Government's top priority in this year's Health Capital Programme and building will commence as soon as possible this year. The contract documentation provides for a construction period of 42 months from start-up date, following which there will be an equipping and commissioning period of 6 to 9 months.  Before building work can commence, there are a number of phases which must be completed, and I am pleased to say that speedy progress is being made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently met with the Boards of the three participating hospitals &mdash; the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital &mdash; and the Tallaght Hospital Board to ensure that all necessary planning and tender documentation changes are finalised as quickly as possible. I am glad to inform the House that, despite a very tight deadline of two weeks <Col N="1467" /> which I set for the Tallaght Hospital Board, I received on Thursday last the agreed revised functional content from the Board.  I have accepted the revised functional content and I have now instructed that the necessary planning adjustments be made immediately so that the tender documentation can be finalised. In the light of this progress, I am confident that my target of a 1993 building start will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bed figures, the new hospital will have a total of 467 beds, 22 Accident and Emergency beds and 14 dialysis places.  These figures include a provision for 40 paediatric in-patient beds, together with 23 paediatric day beds and 4 paediatric high dependency beds within a purpose-built unit designed for children's needs and separate to the standard ward accommodation of the hospital.  In addition, 6 accident and emergency observation beds will be provided for children in the dedicated Paediatric Accident and Emergency Department.  This level of paediatric bed provision has been agreed with the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the three participating hospitals that I am anxious to have discussions with regard to the Board structure and management for the new hospital recommenced at the earliest possible date.  To this end, I have secured the agreement of Professor David Kennedy and Mr. David Kingston to act as facilitators for this process and I have asked that these discussions be completed by June of this year.</P>
    <P>The rapid progress which has been made in recent weeks in relation to the Tallaght Hospital is in no small measure due to the goodwill and commitment of the Tallaght Hospital Board and the three participating hospitals involved in the move to Tallaght and I am confident that there will be a continuation of this spirit of goodwill and co-operation.</P>

      <P>My Department is examining in detail the options for effecting the decentralisation of the General Register Office to Roscommon Town.  This examination takes account of the needs of all users of the Office, including statutory agencies, the general public and those undertaking genealogical research.  The timescale will depend on the particular option chosen.</P>
      <P>Almost all the staff will have to be replaced by staff who wish to work in Roscommon.  If sufficient staff to fill the complement of the Office cannot be found from within the Civil Service, there will be recruitment of staff locally.  The number of staff required in Roscommon will depend on the option chosen for effecting the re-location of the Office with particular reference to the degree of computerisation undertaken.</P>

    <P>At an equivalent annual cost of £4.50, I feel the fee for a standard 10-year passport is not unreasonable.  However, as I indicated to the House in response to a previous question on 10 February 1993, I appreciate that the fee of £45 may cause hardship for certain categories of applicants and special provisions are already in place to help reduce this hardship.  I do not feel, however, that it would be feasible to extend those special provisions to cover situations of the type described by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Kilfenora Display centre managed by Comhar Conradh na Boirne has been in existence for over 20 years and has provided some interpretation of the Burren throughout that period.  Visitor numbers in recent years have been in the region of 40,000. The centre is now in need of substantial investment if it is to provide the quality of product needed to retain visitor numbers and the management sought a grant in 1989 from Shannon Development to upgrade the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Development made a grant available but the KDC were unable to provide matching funds and that grant was withdrawn in 1992.  I understand Shannon Development have indicated a much larger grant will be made available in the next Structural Funds programme and that the Comhar are hoping to receive much of the matching funds from the National Heritage Council.  When the Visitor Centre near Mullaghmore was first proposed, the Office of Public Works and Shannon Development and the Comhar were concerned at the possible effects of the new centre on the viability of the Kilfenora Centre.  Shannon Development urged the Comhar to bring forward and upgrade their development proposals so that Kilfenora could take advantage of the increased number of visitors to the area.  The Office of Public Works have co-operated with this and <Col N="1472" /> have had a number of meetings with the Comhar and Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>As a result of this co-operation, it has been proposed that the centre at Mullaghmore and Kilfenora should operate in a complementary fashion.  The Office of Public Works centre at Mullaghmore at the edge of the natural area will concentrate on the natural story of the Burren and the Kilfenora Centre, in a built up area close to the outstanding Kilfenora Cathedral, will concentrate on the cultural story of man in the landscape.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have agreed to give the concession to operate the tea-rooms at the Mullaghmore Centre to the Comhar.  This will give up to 15 seasonal jobs.  It has also been agreed that all school-tour business, which is a significant part of the Office of Public Works target market &mdash; particularly in the shoulder season &mdash; would be booked and routed through Kilfenora. The Office of Public Works and the Comhar have also agreed that there should be joint marketing and sign-posting to both centres.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have agreed to assist the Comhar in developing audio visual displays and in preparing their plans for development.</P>
    <P>Talks are continuing on the question of joint ticketing.</P>
    <P>I believe the arrangement proposed will ensure the continuation and development of the Kilfenora Centre and that these arrangements represent a good example of the State co-operating with local initiatives to maintain existing jobs an to create new ones.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an Old Age Contributory Pension a person must have entered insurance at least 10 years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>Contributions paid prior to 1953 count for the purposes of the first two conditions but not the third.  Because the contributions average is calculated by reference to post-1953 contributions only, a person could have a substantial record of pre-1953 contributions and still not qualify for pension.  Payment of contributions prior to 1953 could not in itself, however, result in a person not qualifying for contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that the Old Age Contributory Pension scheme was introduced only in 1961 and contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  Contributions paid prior to 1953 gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of contribution conditions for social insurance pensions is among the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board in its final report on a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the Board's report later this year and the matter will be considered further in that context.</P>

      <P>Since it's introduction, the Carer's Allowance has been increased and improved each year.  With effect from July next, the rate is being increased by £6.50 to £59.20 a week.

      <P>State cars are provided to each member of the Government, the President, the Attorney General, the Ceann Comhairle, the Chief Whip and former Taoisigh.  It would be contrary to established practice to give details of cars allocated to the individuals concerned on the grounds of security.

    </Speaker>
    <P>These cars were purchased at various <Col N="1475" /> stages in 1990, 1991 and 1992.  The cars in the State fleet are not purchased at the list price.  Individual prices are negotiated and are confidential as between the supplier and the State.  This enables us to achieve the best possible value for money for the State.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the cars purchased in 1992 less the amount accruing from the sale of old State cars in the same year was £374,000.  The annual cost of providing drivers, who are members of the Garda Síochána, including overtime and allowances is estimated at £1.8 million.

      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): The Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations, 1992 prohibit the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal within the restricted area of Dublin and require that solid fuels in that area are sold or distributed only in sealed and labelled bags.

    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government makes it clear that there will be no Eastern Bypass, but also commits the Government to provide an efficient access route to Dublin Port.  With that in mind, the Dublin Transportation Initiative has been asked to urgently complete <Col N="1479" /> its evaluation of the three remaining post access options:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Port Access Route (Northern Section) &mdash; from N1 (Belfast Road) at Whitehall to the North Port;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an east/west tunnel from Island-bridge to Dublin Port;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a dedicated truckway along the Royal Canal railway line;</P>
    <P>and to report on its findings and recommendations before the end of April 1993. Questions such as traffic volumes and local road connections fall to be addressed in the DTI report which will be published.</P>
    <P>The technical appendices to Dublin Corporation's &ldquo;Dublin Port Access and Eastern Relief Route&rdquo; study, which underpin the cost estimates referred to, have been received in my Department and are available for inspection in the Corporation's offices.  It is a matter for the Corporation to decide if these appendices should be published.  I am, however, arranging to have a copy placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine provides grant-aid towards the cost of certain harbour development works at local authority owned harbours and towards certain coast protection schemes.  The level of grant-aid, in accordance with long established practice, depends on geographic location.  A 50 per cent grant-aid level is available in respect of projects on the East and South East coasts and a 75 per cent level is available in respect of the South West and West coasts.</P>
      <P>I believe that the local authorities should continue to make a significant local contribution to the cost of such works.  However, I do appreciate that in the present financial circumstances many local authorities have difficulties funding such works at the present contribution rate.  This is especially so in the areas where the lower level of grant-aid is available. I am therefore reviewing the situation in consultation with the various maritime local authorities and the Ministers for the Environment and Finance. This review will include the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1991 special beef premium on 18 animals.  When he presented the cattle identity cards for these animals at the local livestock office on 17 September 1991 one was found to be already punched and one was in respect of a female animal.  This constitutes a false declaration in the context of the EC Regulations governing the scheme and the applicant has to be debarred from the scheme for 12 months from 17 September 1991.</P>

      <P>The EC, with the support of member states including Ireland, favours the concept of a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) as currently proposed in the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations.</P>
      <P>The main reason for this is that a permanent institution of this kind is seen to be needed to ensure the satisfactory integration of the present multilateral trading system with the many new provisions which form part of the Uruguay Round negotiations, such as agreements to deal with trade in international services and trade involving intellectual property rights.  Currently, under the umbrella of the GATT, there are numerous arrangements, decisions, understandings and agreements relating to international trade which operate unsatisfactorily without the benefit of a common institutional basis and direction.</P>
      <P>As discussions on the proposed MTO are ongoing and form part of the overall Uruguay Round negotiations, the final shape which the proposed organisation will take is far from clear at this juncture. It is anticipated however that Third World concerns will be adequately taken into account in any final structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A job-sharing scheme was introduced in the health services in 1985.  The scheme provides that all categories of staff serving in a full-time permanent capacity who have satisfactorily completed their probation are eligible to apply for job sharing. The granting of job sharing arrangements in respect of a particular post or category of post is however a matter for the individual employing authority and subject to the exigencies of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> It should also be noted that the scheme allows for the employing authority, where there is no partner available within a health agency to complement a person who wishes to job share, to recruit a person to fill the other half of the job. In certain circumstances, full-time posts may be filled by the recruitment of two job shares.</P>
    <P>A measure of the increasing success of the scheme is shown by the fact that there were 3,248 persons employed in a job sharing capacity in the health services at the end of 1991.  This represents an increase of more than a 1,000 over the comparable figure for the end of 1989.</P>
    <P>I am committed to encouraging health agencies to allow the scheme to be used to the fullest possible extent.  In this regard my Department is undertaking a review of the scheme with a view to seeing what further steps can be taken to expand it.  The question of job sharing being made available to staff employed in a training capacity who are not covered by the scheme will be considered in this context.</P>

    <P>Legislative provision concerning computerised records is covered by the Data <Col N="1494" /> Protection Act, 1988.  Regulations under this Act governing access to medical records stored on computer were made in 1989 by the Minister for Justice after consultation with my Department.  The question of extension of legislative provision to cover manual medical records is under consideration in the context of the EC Draft Directive on Data Protection. The Department of Justice is taking the lead role in relation to this Draft Directive. My Department is monitoring the proposals in so far as they relate to medical records.</P>

      <P>Bone marrow transplant operations are provided for adults at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and for children at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>In relation to St. James's Hospital, the number of bone marrow transplants to be performed each year is determined by the hospital at the beginning of the year. The patient is notified of his or her appointment at that stage.  The hospital has scheduled a total of 26-28 bone marrow transplant operations for 1993. The position at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin is that three children have to date received bone marrow transplants this year, and there are currently four children waiting for bone marrow transplant operations at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I would point out that patients who cannot be facilitated at St. James's Hospital or Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin and who require urgent treatment are referred abroad under EC arrangements. There are, therefore, no waiting lists as such for bone marrow transplants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Programme</i> contained a commitment to implement the Child Care Act on a phased basis over a seven year period.  This commitment has been fully endorsed in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Seventeen sections of the Act have been brought into operation to date, including most of the service &mdash; delivery and preventative provisions contained in parts I and II of the Act.  Among the important sections involved are:</P>
      <P>Section 3 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and empowers them to provide a comprehensive range of child care and family support services;</P>
      <P>Section 5 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children;</P>
      <P>Section 6 which requires health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in their area;</P>
      <P>Section 7 which requires each health board to establish a Child Care Advisory committee to advise and assist it in the performance of its functions under the new legislation, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> Sections 9 and 10 which enable health boards to make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide services on their behalf and to grant aid them for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I intend to circulate a table setting out details of all 17 sections in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The next phase of implementation will involve the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These are the most complex provisions of the Act and also the most significant in terms of their resource implications.  It is my intention that they will be brought into operation as soon as the necessary staff, services and facilities that are required to underpin them have been put in place.</P>
    <P>When these provisions have been successfully implemented, I will proceed with the commencement of Parts VII and VIII of the Act which deal respectively with the supervision of pre-school services and the regulation of children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>With regard to resources, the House will be aware that a sum of £2 million was set aside for child care in the budget of 1992.  This was used to fund a number of new developments in the child care services including:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of additional hostel and other residential places for homeless children</P>
    <P>&mdash;the creation of 50 new social worker, child care worker, psychologist and other community-based posts in the child care services</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of family placement services and improved supports for foster parents</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of a regional child care advisory committee in each health board area</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; child abuse prevention programme to primary schools around the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> I will circulate in the Official Report details of the full year cost of the various child care developments approved in 1992.  Full provision for this expenditure is included in the 1993 allocations to the health boards.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the full implementation of the Act will require the provision of a significant level of additional resources.  This is something that I intend to discuss with the Government when I receive the report of the investigation into the role of the health services in the horrific incest case in County Kilkenny. With regard to the industrial action by IMPACT members in the Eastern Health Board area, I understand that discussions are taking place between the officials of the board and representatives of the trade union and I hope that this will lead to an early resumption of normal working arrangements.</P>

      <P>The position is that St. James's Hospital, being the national referral centre for plastic surgery, receives emergency cases from hospitals throughout the country. The Deputy will appreciate that emergency and urgent cases must receive priority over elective or more routine cases.  However, waiting list figures are constantly monitored by the hospital, and each case is assessed to determine its medical priority.  Should a patient feel that their condition has deteriorated, they should return to their family doctor who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of their case to the consultant directly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that St. James's Hospital is currently in the process of recruiting an additional Consultant Plastic Surgeon, the interviews for which will be held towards the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty million pounds has been provided this year in the Health Estimates to reduce waiting lists for certain specialities <Col N="1504" /> where there are long waiting times for admission to hospital.  Plastic surgery is one such speciality and my Department will, in the course of the next few weeks, be discussing with St. James's Hospital its plans in relation to the elimination of waiting lists in excess of 12 months in plastic surgery and other specialities for which there are unduly long waiting times.</P>

      <P>Alcohol related problems make a heavy demand on our psychiatric services.  Traditionally those suffering from alcohol related problems have been treated in our psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the report of a Study Group on the Development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future</i> published in 1984 referred to the trend in Ireland towards greater specialisation in <Col N="1506" /> the management of alcohol related problems. This approach often involves costly in-patient care which tends to separate the treatment and management of alcohol related problems from community and social services.  The report recommended that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report have been adopted by successive Governments and in line with this policy comprehensive community based alcohol treatment programmes are being developed by all health boards.  There will, however, continue to be a need for detoxification facilities in hospitals and a small number of residential places for people who for social reasons, cannot benefit from day programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government is particularly concerned about the problem of alcohol use and abuse generally and by young people in particular.  As part of a strategy to implement a comprehensive national alcohol policy, the Government requested the Advisory Council on Health Promotion to develop such a comprehensive policy.  The council is well advanced with its task and has prepared a number of research papers on the economic, cultural and social issues associated with alcohol abuse.  It has also completed intensive consultations with relevant groups, including youth organisations.</P>

      <P>The maximum facility that can be allowed to pupils whose parents have opted to send them to Arklow Post-primary Centre, is concessionary transport from the Rathdrum catchment boundary. This concession applies only to pupils who are basically eligible for transport, and is subject to spare seats being available on existing services and at no extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>From its commencement, the purpose of the post-primary school transport scheme has been to allow access to a basic general education for pupils who would otherwise have difficulty in getting a post-primary education.  While parents have the right to send their children to the school of their choice, a cost effective scheme could not facilitate unrestricted choice of school or subjects.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the applications in hand at any particular time vary from major projects including very significant capital outlays to projects for relatively small sums, a good proportion of which for one reason or another will never proceed to fruition.

      <P>The capital allocation for primary and post-primary schools covers equipment and resource grants, emergency and minor capital works, the provision of temporary accommodation to meet increased enrolments, site/property acquisitions and major building projects. A very substantial number of schools benefit each year from the capital allocation to one degree or another.  The time-lapse between application for a capital grant and commencement of building work depends on many factors, many of which are outside of my Department's control.  These factors include the <Col N="1510" /> size of the project proposed, the extent of investigation and examination required both from the technical and from the educational planning points of view, the extent of the design work required, the time needed to acquire sites or other properties and to satisfy planning and fire safety regulations, and the many demands with different priorities being made on the capital allocation available in any one year.</P>
      <P>Over the entire range of grant applications, the time-lapse would range from an immediate response in emergency cases to many years in the case of some major projects.  It would not be feasible, in the circumstances, to indicate a typical time-frame for all grant applications.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of grants for emergencies and minor works, the time lapse between application and completion would be less than one year in the great majority of cases.  The majority of major projects under the primary school capital programme would be completed within four to five years.  The time would tend to be longer in the case of major post-primary projects in view of the greater complexity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision for primary and second-level capital in 1993 is 18 per cent greater than for 1992, thus permitting a large number of major projects to proceed to contract, and that the Programme for Government provides for &ldquo;an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing and refurbishing sub-standard school buildings&rdquo;.</P>
