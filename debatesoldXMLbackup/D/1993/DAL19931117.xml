      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 (Section 5) Order, 1993,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 27 October, 1993.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the draft order before the House today is to change the composition of the committee which selects candidates for the chairmanship of An Bord Pleanála.  The draft order proposes that the Secretary of the Department of the Environment will take the place of the chief engineering adviser of that Department and that the membership of the committee will be expanded to include the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The seven year term of office of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála will expire on 1 March 1994 and a new appointment falls to be made in accordance with procedures laid down by section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983.  Under that section, a chairman is appointed by the Government, from among not more than three candidates chosen by a committee of selection following public advertisement of the position.  This committee consists of the President of the High Court, the chairman of the County Councils General Council, the chairperson of the Council of An Taisce, the President of the Construction Industry Federation, the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the chief engineering adviser of the Department of the Environment. However, subsection (6) of section 5 allows the membership to be altered by order of the Minister for the Environment which order has to be approved in draft by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The need to alter the membership of the committee of selection arises from a reorganisation of the professional staff structure in my Department.  The post of chief engineering adviser, which became vacant in September, has been discontinued and it is necessary, therefore, to make other arrangements to fill one <Col N="1758" /> place on the committee.  I consider that the appropriate course of action is to provide that the Secretary of the Department of the Environment should be a member of the committee and the draft order makes provision for this.</P>
    <P>The Secretary is already, under section 21 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, a member of the committee which selects candidates for the offices of Director-General and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The need to change the membership of the committee of selection in the manner I have outlined presents an opportunity to add to the committee the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this is an appropriate addition in the interests of gender balance and helping to ensure that the needs of women are taken into account in planning issues.  I would point out also that the council is represented on the Environmental Protection Agency committee of selection. The proposed changes to the membership of the committee have already been approved by the Seanad and, if they are approved in this House today, I will be making the order without delay and making a formal request to the committee to start the process of selecting candidates for consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>The draft order we are discussing today relates only to the procedure for filling the office of chairman of An Bord Pleanála. The ordinary members of the board are appointed under separate statutory procedures established by section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983. Under that section, the Minister for the Environment appoints the five ordinary members of the board, one of whom is drawn from among officers of my Department, while the four remaining positions are filled from among persons selected by four panels of nominating organisations. As the terms of office of a number of the board's ordinary members are due to expire early in 1994, I will be activating the appropriate statutory procedures in <Col N="1759" /> the near future so that appointments can be made in good time.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief mention of An Bord Pleanála's recent performance.  Deputies will appreciate that one of the key objectives laid down for the board is to ensure that there are no avoidable delays in deciding on development proposals.  I am pleased that the board's annual report for 1992, which was laid before this House recently, shows a generally satisfactory picture from this point of view.  At the end of 1992, there were 719 planning appeals on hands, only 15 of which were with the board for more than six months. This compares very favourably with the position at the end of 1990, when there were 1,454 appeals on hands, of which 11 per cent were more than six months old.  The position has improved further since the end of last year.  By the end of last September, the number of appeals on hands in the board was down to 470, with only three on hands longer than four months.  Four months is now, under the 1992 Planning Act, the statutory target period for the determination of appeals and I am sure that Deputies will welcome the fact that the board is fulfilling this important new objective for virtually all appeals.  The extent of the turn-around can be summed up by noting that the average time to determine appeals has been reduced from 18 weeks in 1992 to only 12 weeks in September of this year.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Act, which streamlined planning appeals procedures, has undoubtedly made a considerable contribution to the improvement in the board's performance. The Act made important changes to the appeals process, aimed at speeding it up but without taking away from its thoroughness or fairness.  The efficiency with which these major changes have been introduced reflects well on the chairman, members and staff of the board, and I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of their dedication to this task.  The new streamlined procedures should enable the board to maintain, and even improve, current performance levels.  In a situation in which <Col N="1760" /> many of the appeals before the board relate to employment creation projects, it is vital that appeals are dealt with in a way which avoids any undue delay in getting new projects off the ground.</P>
    <P>I emphasise, finally, that the purpose of the draft order before the House today is merely to make necessary and appropriate adjustments to the membership of the committee of selection.  It does not involve any fundamental change in the overall process for selecting the chairman of An Bord Pleanála, which has worked well since 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I greet with approval the Minister's announcement that the vast majority of appeals are dealt with in the four month period mandated by recent changes in the 1992 legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular difficulties with the order before us but I note with interest some of the changes the Minister made. However, it is in his interest to listen to the serious concern expressed about certain aspects of the operation of An Bord Pleanála.  I ask him to give us another opportunity to discuss constructively and in greater depth the extension of the brief of An Bord Pleanála, given the new regulations that now impinge on its brief.  Many practitioners in planning feel that the practice of preparing the full and final grounds of the appeal application within 28 days makes for greater efficiency, even if they are put to the pin of their collars to meet this new deadline &mdash; a deadline which has helped speed up appeals but which, nonetheless, is causing problems in many areas.  We must remember that the planning authority and the developer will be very familiar with all the documentation and the issues by the time the application gets to the appeal stage as they have been through the initial planning application. We must, however, think for a moment about community groups, residents' associations and even neighbouring landowners who will be affected by the proposal for even a medium or large project on their doorsteps.  If these groups, for whatever reason, assume that planning permission will be refused and then find <Col N="1761" /> they have to lodge an appeal they have only four weeks in which they must secure the services of a relevant consultant &mdash; we are assuming a fairly large project.  They must also obtain, analyse and assess the application itself and indeed any environmental impact statement that may have accompanied it, that can be a highly technical document as most environmental impact statements range from 500 to 1,000 pages.  Finally the appellant groups must formulate, present and deliver the full and final grounds of appeal within the four week period.</P>
    <P>My concern is that the balance of advantage now lies with the developer and the planning authority.  Even though the four weeks was introduced to bring efficiency to the process, we have erred in that we have titled the balance so that the third party appellant often becomes familiar with the entire project only on the day planning permission is granted. Will the Minister reconsider that aspect of the legislation in order to ensure equity?  We need development, but we need balance between development and environmental impact.  Legislation should not tilt the balance against the genuine third party objector who is hard pressed to document his concerns within four weeks.  If the professionals in local authorities are hard pressed to meet deadlines, what hope has a community group or an individual?  Procedures for lodging appeals against large projects must include the flexibility of an extension to the time premitted for lodging the appeal.  This would ensure the more equitable operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The freedom of access to environmental information regulation which many of us called for, and welcomed when it came, was a major disappointment when we discovered that An Bord Pleanála had been excluded by the Minister when introducing the directive into Irish law.  This is an absurd decision and I urge the Minister carefully to review it.  If planning affairs are to become transparent with access by individuals to environmental information, individuals and groups must be entitled <Col N="1762" /> to have access at least to the inspector's reports.  We need only recall the Tara mast saga where it became apparent in the process of the judicial review that the inspector had recommended against planning permission but, in a one line minute, the board granted planning permission. The appellants called for a judicial review and the High Court sided with the appellants, whereas the Supreme Court subsequently decided with An Bord Pleanála.  Now we have this judgment blocking many community groups and non-governmental organisations of one kind or another in terms of their approach to An Bord Pleanála. These groups are not sufficiently financed to take the risk of having the Supreme Court decision used as a precedent against them.  I would urge the Minister to allow transparency, to allow the directive on freedom of access to environmental information to apply to all appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister would be on safe ground in that we would not need to go back to Europe on this issue. The European regulation does not preclude An Bord Pleanála from making some amendment which is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>We must address the issue of the extended scope of the brief of An Bord Pleanála, with the European regulation and our legislation now encompassing environmental impact statements.  Originally the board in determining an appeal only had to consider it in terms of the &ldquo;proper planning and development of the area&rdquo;.  With the expansion of the scope of issues to be considered since the introduction of the EC regulation on environmental impact statements, the board is now required to have regard to the EIS and to any supplementary information relating to the EIS and any other submission or observation concerning the effects on the environment of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>The problem lies in the fact that there is no evidence the board has changed its approach to determining appeals so as to encompass the broader issues to which it is required to have regard.  The major <Col N="1763" /> environmental issues raised by appellants in the appeal against the planned new power station at Poolbeg were not reflected in the planning conditions imposed by the board.  Similarly, the appeal against the Westport irradiation plant which cited among other things the fact that it would help to support the Canadian nuclear industry, with obvious international environmental implications, was rejected by the board.  In this instance the inspector at the oral hearing attempted to rule out all issues which did not relate to the proper planning and development of the area.  The planning conditions subsequently imposed only related to matters concerning the &ldquo;proper planning and development of the area&rdquo; and not the environmental impact on the area.  The board has yet to take up the scope granted by the recent legislative changes. I would like another opportunity to debate that issue in depth.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties relating to proof of appeal but the time constraint will not allow me to go into them this morning.  We should look again at appeal fees.  We want to be reasonable and we do not want vexatious objections and cranks blocking the serious good work of An Bord Pleanála.  At the moment the fees deter many local groups and individuals who have serious concerns of a personal or an environmental nature in relation to planning permissions granted by their local authorities.  There is a £100 fee for a domestic appeal, a £200 fee for a commercial development appeal plus a £50 fee if either of those appeals requires an oral hearing.  The payment of £30 for observation needs clarification.  One can become an observer to an appeal without being a full appellant but one is not involved subsequently within the full communication process.</P>
    <P>We welcome the improvements and the tightening of the timeframe in terms of the four month deadline for most appeals but the Minister should look again at the four weeks allowed to the genuine third party objector, who will not be able to get the consultant's report <Col N="1764" /> and the necessary technical documentation together in that time.  The Minister should reconsider the fees and look at broadening the scope of the remit of an Bord Pleanála to ensure that it takes into account matters such as environmental impact statements.  Please allow transparency in the operation of An Bord Pleanála for its sake.  It is suspect as long as people feel it is not transparent.  It has nothing to fear by being transparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>While the proposition before us is very simple, it gives rise to some complex questions.  In this short debate we will not have the time to deal in depth with the various issues.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty in changing the membership to include the Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  I welcome the decision to include the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women because it acknowledges the valuable work done by the council and it recognises the representative nature of that body which represents over 90 women's organisations, many of which are involved on a day to day basis with environmental matters.  The first acknowledgement of the Council for the Status of Women came in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill initiated by Deputy Harney as Minister.  In a debate in the Seanad I welcomed that initiative.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution read out a list of the people who are members of this committee.  He referred to the President of the High Court, the chairman of the County Councils' General Council, the chairman of the council of An Taisce, the president of the Construction Industry Federation and the president of the executive council of ICTU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when there is so much talk about equality we are still using the archaic term of &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. I accept the argument that there are constraints in respect of wording, but at a time when the Government has given a commitment to take affirmative action in respect of <Col N="1765" /> gender proofing all legislation, it is ironic that we are still using such archaic language. There is a wider point involved in this matter which may not be appropriate to the Minister's brief, but at the basic level of communication we should use the mode of expression that best describes the type of society in which we live.  The position of women should be acknowledged.  I have great difficulty with being referred to as chairman and my two daughters, who are seeking role models in society, find it difficult to accept the use of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; because of the automatic assumption behind the use of that word.  This may seem a trivial matter but the use of language is fundamental and for that reason there should be a quicker resolve in respect of this matter.  Perhaps the Minister might examine the issue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the work of An Bord Pleanála, I welcome the fact that the 1992 Act streamlined the planning appeals procedure and assisted in speeding up the board's procedure.  The Minister stated that that legislation contributed greatly to the improvement of the board's performance, but unfortunately we do not know if that is the case because we have not the transparency we were promised, despite regulations on freedom of access to information and the powers vested in the Minister.  I made that point in the debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1993 last June when the Government was forced, because of the Supreme Court decision on the interpretative centres, to provide that planning legislation applies to the Office of Public Works and other State agencies.  I have made a consistent plea since then about the importance of openness and transparency as promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government. That is an example of the Government sitting on its hands until forced into action.  The Minister should show greater openness in the use of his powers.  The response, particularly regarding freedom of access to information, has been minimalist. The Minister has power in this area but has failed to use it.</P>
    <P>At that time other Deputies and I <Col N="1766" /> called for greater openness so that people could be reassured about the planning process and the decisions reached by An Bord Pleanála, the final arbiter, could be seen to be fair and unbiased.  I have no doubt that is true in most cases, but people are generally cynical unless something is seen to be done.  They are cynical in particular about the political process and matters on which they do not have sufficient information.  That is the crux of the matter.  If people are given information they can make a judgment based on accuracy, not on speculation.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the Minister's continued reluctance to accept that, for example, the inspector's report should be published or at least made available to the public and interested parties.  Some decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála are unclear and access to information would help iron out difficulties and clear up speculation.  The Minister appears to have a certain reluctance in regard to freedom of access to information; he frequently talks about what he cannot do rather than what he can do in that regard. Will he reassess his attitude?</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the question of charges for making representations in respect of decisions.  Public representatives are frequently asked to make observations or representations, the minimum charge for which is £30.  It is ironic that a public representative should be asked to pay a charge for pursuing his or her job.  We want to ensure that vexatious claims are not made or that representations are not spurious and, therefore, a certain sum of money should be required to be lodged, but I would ask the Minister to re-examine the charges and allow a waiver in instances where a good case is made on behalf of local organisations.  That should not present an enormous difficulty.  We do not want to clog up the system.  We want to ensure that cases put forward are valid but, at the same time, we do not want to disenfranchise people or price them out of the business, as it were.</P>
    <P>In general there has been an improvement in the work of An Bord Pleanála, but there is a long way to go yet.  I welcome <Col N="1767" /> the Minister's decision in regard to the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women and I look forward to greater openness from Government in respect of gender awareness and gender proofing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us involves a relatively minor change in the manner in which the committee of selection for the chairman of An Bord Pleanála is appointed.  I welcome that and recognise the necessity for it.  This debate gives us an opportunity to take an overview of the operations of An Bord Pleanála and how it operates within the planning system generally.  It is fair to say that there is a worrying decline in public confidence in the planning system.  It is regrettable that the legislation in relation to An Bord Pleanála which we passed some time ago contributed to that.  While it is true that the appeals procedure has speeded up, the sense of isolation felt by many people in regard to An Bord Pleanála has increased.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the charges imposed on members of residents' associations, but I would not make an exception for a public representative.  What cuts for a public representative should cut for members of the public also.  Many individual citizens might wish to express an opinion on planning applications in their area and they should not be prevented from doing so because they do not have the money.  The sum of £30 is a fairly substantial charge and it costs £100 to make an appeal.  That may well be &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; for a developer lodging an appeal but it is a substantial charge for a member of the public.  Those charges should be reduced to make the planning system more accessible for the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála should provide clear-cut reasons for taking a decision. It frequently makes decisions that are difficult to understand and explain, but there may be a valid reason.  The point has been made that in some cases the decision eventually made by the board varies from the recommendation made <Col N="1768" /> by the inspector.  There is a necessity for An Bord Pleanála to be much more open in providing information, to make available the inspector's report to the public and to explain more fully the basis on which decisions are made.  This would be of help in restoring public confidence in the planning system.</P>
    <P>As I said, public confidence in the planning system is low.  To some extent this is due to the deficiencies in the legislation relating to An Bord Pleanála and other factors.  For example, during the past four years there have been two Garda inquiries into allegations of malpractice and corruption in the planning system.  The inquiry carried out in 1989 resulted in the then chief planner of An Bord Pleanála being charged.  These charges were subsequently dismissed by the court.  This was a very disturbing episode in the history of the planning system in that senior officials were brought before the court and a Garda inquiry was conducted into the way in which the system operated.</P>
    <P>A second Garda investigation is now underway arising from articles which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> last July and on the review of the development plan for County Dublin.  I understand that that Garda inquiry is continuing.  This has led to public confidence in the planning system being undermined.</P>
    <P>There is a belief among the public that to a large extent the planning system operates in favour of the developer. What we have seen during the past few months in relation to the review of the development plan for County Dublin, for example, would lend strong support to that opinion.  During the past 25 years or so the greater Dublin area has grown and developed; and it appears that this was not based on good planning principles but more at the behest of individual developers who proceeded on the basis of what was good for them.  We have sprawling suburbs which very often were developed without appropriate infrastructure or community facilities.  Costs for the taxpayer have increased in terms of servicing the land, while the quality of the environment has declined in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> As a result of many of these decisions the cost of houses has increased which, in turn, has led to higher mortgages and so on for the home owner and purchaser. This has been to the benefit of the developers. During the past 25 years, for example, large tracts of land in County Dublin have been rezoned.  I very much regret that this process has been continued in the review of the development plan for County Dublin which is now nearing completion.  An additional 2,500 acres has been rezoned for development, particularly in parts of the country where there was already sufficient land zoned for development.  Last Saturday the <i>Irish Independent</i> estimated that the value of the land in question would increase to £110 million, which in anybody's language is a substantial increase in profit.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government, which is considering the budget that it will introduce in the new year, to introduce a tax on windfall profits made from land rezoning.  Given that we live in a State where the pensions of elderly people are taxed and where a 1 per cent income levy was introduced last year &mdash; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wants to have this removed &mdash; it is not unreasonable to ask the Government to introduce a tax on the windfall profits made from land speculation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not; I am dealing with the question of public confidence in An Bord Pleanála.  Apart from the revenue that would be raised for the State, it would have the effect of reducing the pressure from developers and landowners to have land rezoned.  If they realised that the windfall profits made might be lower, they might be less inclined to push to have land rezoned in the first place.  This, in turn, would have the effect of restoring a degree of confidence in the planning system.  This is not a new proposal.  Twenty years ago the Kenny report was presented, but no Government has done anything about it. <Col N="1770" /> It recommended measures which go much further than what I have now suggested.</P>
      <P>In summary, while I am aware that this motion deals specifically with An Bord Pleanála, it raises questions about confidence in the planning system.  Specifically, I am asking the Government, which is now considering its budget for the new year, to consider the possibility of introducing a special tax on the profits made from land rezoning because planning decisions, regardless of whether they are made by the elected members of a local authority during a review of the developing plan, by a county manager in reaching a decision on an individual planning application or by An Bord Pleanála in respect of an appeal, can result in substantial gains.  There is probably no other area of public activity where a decision made by a public authority can result in the same windfall gain for small numbers of people.  In the case to which I have referred in Dublin County Council approximately 30 land owners stand to gain substantially from decisions made during the past two and a half months.  It is time that the Government, which would normally accuse the Opposition of being opposed to the introduction of taxes, took the suggestion on board that a tax be introduced to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Labour Party, I welcome the Minister's proposal, because this change is necessary.  In particular, I welcome the involvement for the first time of a representative of a women's group.  This is essential.  As those of us who are members of local authorities are aware, few women are involved at any level of the planning process and in many respects they have more to contribute than many of their male colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the point made by Deputy Gilmore that a tax should be introduced on the profits made from land rezoning, I should point out that in 99 per cent of cases the bad publicity centres on planning decisions taken in County Dublin.  I want to assure the Deputy that <Col N="1771" /> this is not the position in County Louth. Ninety-eight per cent of all planning applications in County Louth relate to the construction of dwelling houses. Indeed, only a small percentage ever reach An Bord Pleanála.  Strange as it may seem, if one were to look at the appeals one would find that they contain the same signatures.  There are small groups of &ldquo;appeal crazy&rdquo; people who tend to take satisfaction in appealing against everything.</P>
    <P>My party campaigned and sought a reduction in the length of time it took An Bord Pleanála to process appeals.  I welcomed that decision because it was a good one.  The time specified in the legislation is more than adequate.  In talking about the planning system we seem to concentrate on the objector and never seem to think about the unfortunate person who has to go to great expense in submitting a planning application to a local authority.</P>

      <P>A very large percentage of planning applications are submitted by ordinary, working class people and they relate to the construction of a house for their family.  We get carried away by the mass media coverage of County Dublin. I wish County Dublin would keep its planning problems to itself and leave the unfortunate people on rural county councils and corporations to deal with their own affairs.</P>

      <P>We do not have those problems, and they do not have them in Wexford, so far as I know.  Dublin should look after its own affairs for a change, we are sick of reading about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant must also be taken care of.  Many of the appeals to An Bord Pleanála could be avoided if certain changes were made to the planning procedure. Generally speaking, the <Col N="1772" /> notification for the planning permission is given in, say, the seventh week of the statutory eight.  Alternatively, if the local authority is under pressure, it will ask for further information thereby gaining a further eight weeks.  There would be much saving of time and effort at local level if that were to change.  A four week period would be more than adequate to deal with an application for a dwelling house at local level.  We must take into account the fact that applicants have to pay very substantially and can lose very substantially in the event of failure to get planning permission.  We must not alone strike a gender balance but a planning balance to give a fair crack of the whip to the applicant as well as to the objector. It should not be necessary to have an elaborate system of appeals where we are only talking about an application for a dwelling house in a rural area, because the county development plan sets the criteria for dealing with planning applications. Everything it is necessary to know about the planning application is contained therein and much of the fault lies with auctioneers and solicitors who do not advise the applicant to find out before purchasing a site if there is planning permission, and its conditions, to ensure the contract is signed subject to planning permission being granted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal and I hope further improvements will be made to allow for the quick processing of important planning applications.</P>

      <P>We do not have the same problems as county councillors, neither do we have the problems they face in regard to population shifts, for example. On radio this morning Deputy Rabbitte said there were only about six bad rezoning decisions, but that the media give the impression it is all about rezoning land and that every single thing the councillors <Col N="1773" /> did was bad.  As a city councillor, I am delighted we have not had the same problems and that we did not get all the media attention the county council got.  I do not know enough about them to say whether they are right but there is certainly a huge problem because people want to live in a certain area and we must recognise that things are not as simple as they look.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the appointment of a member of the Council on the Status of Women to this group because women have been ignored in the planning process. As chairman of the planning committee on Dublin City Council, which drew up its own development plan, we received a very good submission from a group called, I think, Women in Planning, which opened councillors' eyes on how planning affects women.  They probably spend far more time in housing estates than men, but they rarely have an opportunity to design housing estates. This submission highlighted a number of areas, including shopping centres.  It was taken on board and one of the biggest and most prestigious housing estates in Dublin, St. Helen's in Booterstown, recruited housewives to help in the design of the houses, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the lay-out of kitchens, living rooms, etc.  This was done over a considerable period of time to ensure that the housing estate and the houses were designed in such a way that people would feel comfortable there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning changes have been very good.  Prior to the changes an enormous amount of time was wasted by people objecting to any development.  In many of these developments people who wanted to set up factories and create jobs were never told when they would get planning permission.  The matter could go on for years and it was extremely difficult for the IDA to deal with.  The Bill will be advantageous in the long term to developers and residents' associations. Many people would like to believe that developers are dreadful people but they create jobs.  Residents' associations will also benefit, particularly in cases where somebody builds without planning permission, the residents' association objects and the person applies for retention <Col N="1774" /> of use.  This can go on and on, the case goes to An Bord Pleanála and there is another time lag.  Residents' associations wonder how this kind of thing can go on for years when people are breaking the planning laws.  Therefore, these changes are not all bad.</P>
    <P>Residents' associations in urban areas face huge expenditure in objecting to small extensions and small developments, and perhaps the Minister could look at the question of reducing the charges in the case of small developments because some residents' associations would have to deal with many in a one or two year period.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies that there should be no change in relation to charges for public representatives.  If they did not have to pay, they would be asked to object to every single development for which there was a proposal.  After a while our objections would not be worth the paper they were written on.  If other people have to pay, the same should apply to public representatives.  When residents' associations ask me to object to a proposed development, I will do so, if I feel strongly about it, but sometimes I do not.  However, it would be foolish to allow public representatives to make objections free of charge because, after a while, their objections would not be taken seriously but would be seen merely as another routine letter from a public representative.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues who contributed to the debate.  I am not surprised we have moved from the main issue before the House.  Planning and development is a central question here and opportunities are all too infrequent to deal with that matter in a comprehensive way.  I hope in future to debate in greater detail some of the matters raised.  Nonetheless, I will try to deal with Deputies' questions in the time limit available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keogh raised the point regarding the &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. It is impossible to win on this issue. As a democrat I contacted all the organisations to inquire what term was <Col N="1775" /> used in their constitutions and applied those terms.  It has been said on many occasions that this matter should be decided locally rather than centrally.  As Deputy Doyle and other Members will know, Deirdre Bolger is Chairman of the General Council of County Councils and has no objection to being addressed by that title.  This matter may not be best adressed locally and I accept we should decide an appropriate title.  However, the title I am adopting is that contained in the constitutions of the various organisations. That position may change following contact with those organisations in the future.</P>

      <P>I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's statement that there has been a decline in public confidence in the planning process.  I am sure he will appreciate &mdash; and Deputy Bell made the point in a different way &mdash; there have been very few problems with the planning process and that, where they emerged, we tried to deal with them.  In the past the appeals process was dealt with by the Minister. A planning appeal board was established and it worked quite well.  When the appeals process became sluggish due to long delays associated with processing appeals we tried to minimise delays and the appeals process has improved.  We are still endeavouring to make the planning process more efficient and modern and ensure there is greater public consensus and participation.  I am reviewing the regulations in the planning process in respect of public notices.  The public will be aware of what is happening.  They will have the benefit of knowledge from the beginning.  They will have the benefit of knowledge from the beginning of an appeal as distinct from receiving information accidentally.  The planning process is not in decline.  In 93 per cent of cases planning permission is either granted or refused at local authority level without reference to the planning appeals <Col N="1776" /> process.  There should be recognition of the work at local authority level.</P>
      <P>There is need for further work in respect of the pre-planning applications process.  Some applications that end up in appeals process or in dispute with local authorities might have been managed better if there had been greater emphasis on the pre-planning application process by the local authority to investigate and resolve the problems.  This would also apply in circumstances where a planning application is refused because it is very important for applicants to know how to proceed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle expressed concern about the operation of the recent planning Act.  It was introduced a year ago and has worked quite well.  Very few representations have been made to my Department in respect of difficulties arising from the provisions of that Act.  Nonetheless, it must be kept under review and, if changes are necessary, they will be addressed in future.  I am anxious to ensure that not only is the planning system efficient and modern but that it is one in which the public have confidence.  If any aspects of the Act create disadvantage for individual groups they will be addressed in the future.  At this stage it is too early to make amendments to the Act.  We went through that process a year ago and tried to find the right balance to ensure the system was fair and streamlined.  There were not only vexatious appeals but an almost deliberate attempt to lengthen and frustrate the process, but that practice has been eliminated now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of fees.  It is important to remember <Col N="1777" /> that the taxpayer who is not involved in the appeals process contributes 85 per cent of the cost of the appeals system. We are asking for a contribution towards that cost from those directly involved which would be approximately 15 per cent of the cost of an appeal.  I have no intention of transferring any more of the burden to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Gilmore and Ryan that if public representatives had free access to the substantive area of the appeals process they would be used as a lever on a regular basis and that would not be acceptable.  Such a role for public representatives in the appeals process acting for appellants would not be appropriate. Public representatives are in favour of developments and employment and they must make a balanced judgment as to what they would support under the appeals system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the question of the environmental impact statement. Under law An Bord Pleanála is required to give due consideration to all environmental aspects when considering new projects.  If there is evidence to suggest otherwise I would welcome details of any complaints.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to engage in arguments with colleagues in relation to access to information.  We have a new instrument at an embryonic stage.  The present system is a change for many local authorities. We are anxious to accommodate such change which not only builds confidence in the system but also in the public who have access to it.  We will continue to improve the system.  I appear to stand accused of not being anxious to make inspectors' reports available to the public but that is not the position.  Deputy Doyle indicated her thinking on this matter when she outlined the case, where the board made a different decision from that recommended in the inspector's report. It would be wrong if an inspector's report is required only for such cases.  The board must decide all the issues and that is why it was established.  People are selected through an independent process, they have a broad experience which brings a blend of opinions and a wider perspective <Col N="1778" /> to the planning appeal process and they will consider all areas before making a final decision.  The inspector's report is a technical one and is upheld in more than 90 per cent of cases.  Deputies appear to be suggesting that the public consider the technical report to be the be-all and end-all in regard to planning matters.  If that is the position I must accept every technical and administrative report I receive in my Department, but I do not because I have to take into account wider issues.  This House must decide whether to abandon the present Bill and get rid of the board system so that the inspector's report will become the major element in planning appeals.  That system is applied in the United Kingdom but it has not been adopted here.  I am prepared to listen to any arguments advanced but I am not prepared to allow Deputies accuse me of considering only one element.</P>

      <P>I have tried since the Committee Stage debate to take on board some of the suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1, a consequential <Col N="1779" /> amendment, provides for the repeal of section 101A of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which currently provides for ramps and bollards.  That section is to be repealed and replaced by a new general provision governing traffic calming.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 39 proposes a new section to give local authorities flexible new powers to carry out traffic calming works.  One of the main advantages of these measures is that they encourage drivers to make their speeds appropriate to local conditions through measures which are self-enforcing.  The only specific statutory powers currently available to local authorities for such measures is the power to provide ramps or bollards. These latter powers have been in operation for about five years.  While they have been useful, the powers are limited and quite restrictive.</P>
    <P>A wide range of new traffic calming techniques have been developed in other countries in recent years.  The new power will give local authorities the maximum flexibility to decide on the measures best suited to individual streets or areas.  The intention is to allow local authorities as much design flexibility as possible. However, many local authorities will, at least in the early stages, have no significant expertise in this area and provision is included to provide for the issue of general guidelines to assist them in selecting the most appropriate measures. This amendment proposes to extend power and flexibility to local authorities to determine the measures they should take in tandem with experiences we gain from systems in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I made the argument on Second Stage, and on Committee Stage, that local authorities should be given the power to adopt a flexible approach in relation to traffic control measures.  One difficulty with the traffic problem, particularly in urban areas, is that there has been a phenomenal increase in the volume of traffic.  For example, in the past 20 years the number of cars on the road has doubled, resulting in an <Col N="1780" /> increased traffic problem, and there are difficulties in dealing with it.  I attended a local authority meeting yesterday at which the question of the introduction of a traffic management system was considered.</P>
      <P>The proposal to give the local authority power and discretion as to what to do in certain circumstances is to be welcomed. I am a little concerned about the Minister issuing general guidelines to the roads authority, as set out in subsection (6).  I hope it is not intended that local authorities should not take whatever steps are necessary in advance of any such regulations or that the regulations will have the effect of restricting or diminishing the discretion granted to local authorities in the operation of this section.</P>

During the lengthy and useful Committee Stage debate I commented particularly on traffic calming and other measures that might be taken by the roads authority or local authorities.  Those involved in local government are aware of the difficulties in relation to traffic, and any powers vested in local and roads authorities are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) provides that the Minister may issue general guidelines to local authorities and may amend or cancel any such guidelines.  I hope the guidelines issued will be minimal.  The Minister has shown by tabling the amendments that he is open to suggestions.</P>

It is a helpful provision as distinct from a provision that seeks to return control to my Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 9, after &ldquo;drive&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or at the time of the sample being taken, in any case where the driver has been involved in an accident and leaves the scene of the accident before the gardaí have had an opportunity of taking a sample&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Doyle said because I am at somewhat of a disadvantage in that my amendments are grouped with other amendments.  My amendments deal with the problem of hit-and-run accidents, about which we had a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage.  The Bill proposes that a person may be breathalysed or have a urine or blood sample taken up to three hours after an accident occurs.  The difficulty is that in the case of a hit-and-run accident the chances are that the person involved may not be caught within three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law as it stands there is a strong incentive for people involved in accidents to leave the scene of the crime. There is also a strong possibility of a lighter sentence being imposed on them if they do that than if they stay at the scene and are breathalysed.  If a person who has been drinking and who may be over the limit stays at the scene of an accident he will be breathalysed by the Garda, who presumably will arrive shortly after the accident.  In addition <Col N="1782" /> to the charges brought against him for dangerous driving and causing injury or, worse, death, he will also be charged with drunken driving and will have to face the severe penalties proposed in this legislation. If the person leaves the scene of the accident he will have three hours within which the Garda will have to catch up with him.  It will be very difficulty for the Garda to catch up with somebody involved in a hit and run accident within three hours.  In all probability it will take the Garda longer than three hours to arrive at the scene of an accident, establish what happened, find out whether somebody has seen the registration number of the car which caused the accident, establish the owner of the car, establish who was driving it and locate the driver.  If it takes them three hours and ten minutes to do all this, then the person involved in the hit and run accident cannot be breathalysed, cannot have a sample taken and, therefore, cannot be charged with drunken driving.</P>
    <P>With regard to the penalties provided for in the legislation, unless a death is involved, the penalties for dangerous driving are still very low &mdash; a maximum fine of £1,000 or a maximum period of six months in prison.  The penalties for drunken driving are much more severe &mdash; for example, a driver may lose his driving licence, etc.  Therefore, there is an incentive for somebody involved in an accident to leave the scene of the crime because he will have three hours within which he cannot be breathalysed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  This is a very serious anomaly.  On Committee Stage the Minister referred to the practical difficulties involved in changing the provisions.  For example, at what stage could a person be breathalysed, would it be within three and a half hours or six hours or even the next morning?  There is also the problem that the level of alcohol in the blood will have decreased after a certain time.  I appreciate that those practical difficulties exist, but nevertheless <Col N="1783" /> we have to address the situation which has arisen.  For example, in one of the more celebrated cases brought to public attention in recent times, involving the death of a young woman, it was alleged by the parents of the young woman that the driver, who received a very light sentence and who was subsequently released very early, had been drinking.  There is no way of establishing whether this was true.  There is also the problem that a person involved in a hit and run accident will claim that he drank the proverbial bottle of vodka to steady his nerves after he got home.  This issue needs to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Even if we run the danger of the level of alcohol in the blood being lower after three hours, the Garda should still have the discretion to breathalyse a driver, take a sample from him and produce it as evidence in court.  Of course, it will ultimately be a matter for the court to decide to what extent it takes account of the evidence.  It makes a nonsense of the law if a person can be breathalysed after two hours and 55 minutes but may not be breathalysed after three hours and five minutes.  The culprits I am most anxious to get at in this amendment are those cowardly people who, having caused injury or death, leave the scene of an accident.  We have to deal very forcibly with those people and ensure there are no loopholes in the law which they can exploit.  Unfortunately, there is a loophole in the law as it stands &mdash; a drunken driver who leaves the scene of an accident can get off more lightly than if he stays at the scene of the accident.  This loophole should be covered.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's explanation for his amendments and I will respond to it when I conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>Deputy Gilmore is seeking to remove the three hour period within which a blood or urine specimen must be taken in certain circumstances so as to facilitate drink-driving prosecutions against persons who leave the scene of the accident.  This issue arose on Committee Stage and many Deputies emphasised <Col N="1784" /> their great distaste for hit and run drivers.  I want to further emphasise my distaste for them.  I am determined to ensure that no provisions in this Bill will provide a safe refuge or haven for anybody involved in this type of accident.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to a number of the practical difficulties involved in implementing the proposed changes in the law, including the proposal in his amendment.  On Committee Stage I said that I would consider the matter further before Report Stage.  There are major practical difficulties involved in removing the three hour period within which a blood or urine specimen can be taken. The removal of the three hour period, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore, would require the redefinition of the offence of drink-driving to confine it to an offence committed only by driving when the alcohol level is over the specified level. Such a change would place an onus on the prosecution to prove the actual alcohol concentration at the time of driving.  As specimens must for practical reasons be taken sometime after the event, it would therefore become necessary to introduce one or both of the following: (i) a presumption in legislation that the alcohol concentration at the time of driving was not less than the concentration determined by the later analysis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and (ii) a system of back calculation of the alcohol level to the time of driving, based on standard alcohol elimination rates.  This would constitute a significant change to existing legislation and would without doubt give rise to new legal challenges which could be successful.  I am not prepared to take that risk.  Extraordinary efforts have been made over the past number of years to try to find loopholes in the law governing drink driving.  I have read many of these cases, some of which were quite embarrassing. I have no intention of opening up the possibility of further loopholes which could be used as a rescue package by individuals involved in this kind of criminal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> I accept the point behind Deputy Gilmore's amendments and I am in full agreement with what he is trying to achieve.  I stated on Committee Stage that a person who leaves the scene of an accident is liable to be prosecuted under section 106 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 in addition to any other offence committed such as drink driving or dangerous driving.  The maximum fine and term of imprisonment for drink driving offences and for leaving the scene of an accident where injury to a person is caused are identical, namely, £1,000 fine and six months imprisonment, but there is no mandatory disqualification for the offence of leaving the scene of an accident. Thus, as Deputy Gilmore has already said, a person who stays at the scene of an accident and who is subsequently convicted of drink driving faces a greater penalty, namely, a mandatory disqualification and a requirement to pass a driving test, than the hit and run driver who subsequently is convicted only of leaving the scene.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is an anomaly and, accordingly, the amendments which I am proposing provide that a person convicted of leaving the scene of an accident where death or injury to a person is caused will be automatically disqualified for two years for the first offence and four years for the second offence.  In addition, they will be subject to a requirement to pass a driving test before their licence is returned.  This brings the penalty into line with penalties for drink driving.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies can accept that there are very real difficulties in relation to any change in the practice of taking blood and urine specimens within a three hour time frame.  My amendments are an alternative method of dealing with hit and run offenders and will eliminate any incentive to leave the scene of an accident.  I have given considerable thought as to whether there is any other way to deal with this problem.  I agree with the points made on Committee Stage and again today and I believe I have found a way to deal with them which is more safe from the point of view of a successful prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the general tone of what the Minister is saying and I accept that what Deputy Gilmore is proposing may generate a whole series of legal arguments. However, it is fair to say that a reasonable estimate can be made of the levels of blood alcohol at a given time when a sample is taken somewhat later. One of the characteristics of the metabolism of alcohol is the fact that it is metabolised at a given rate.  I realise there will be variations for body size, experience of drinking, etc. but it is possible to make an estimate within a certain margin of error and it is unfortunate that more consideration was not given to this aspect.  I accept that there are grounds for legal argument in this regard but there is a margin of error in every estimate.  The level of 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood is open to variation; it may be estimated at 81, 82 or 85 milligrammes. One cannot be absolutely certain that the level is 82 milligrammes. That figure is accepted within a certain framework of probabilities.</P>
      <P>The same idea holds true for blood alcohol levels which are estimated on a retrospective basis arising from a sample taken.  A fair estimate can be made of what the blood alcohol levels were two, three or four hours previously.  I accept the general tone of what the Minister is saying and I accept also that while this may be true on a scientific or physiological level, lawyers and various other scientists will have a field day with these cases when they reach the courts.  It probably would not get us any further in what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely important part of the Bill and these amendments are very important because of omissions in the original Bill.  I would like the Minister to put on the record the definition of drink driving in this Bill as distinct from the changes that would be needed if, for example, Deputy Gilmore's amendment was taken on board. We need to understand clearly the changes that this would introduce and why his proposal would not, in fact, achieve the effect that he has stated.  In other words, <Col N="1787" /> how would his proposal affect the present legal definition of drink driving?</P>
      <P>The anomaly whereby leaving the scene of an accident was more leniently treated in our courts than drink driving needs to be rectified.  The Minister is now proposing two years imprisonment for a first offence and four years for a second offence, with a mandatory disqualification for anyone who leaves the scene of an accident, in other words, a hit and run driver.  We will not quibble with the Minister in this regard because leaving the scene of an accident is probably one of the most heinous crimes in this context.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify whether these penalties apply only in the case of injury or death to a person in such an accident.  Very serious motor accidents can occur involving severe damage to property but by some miracle, the person receives no injury.  A driver involved might leave the scene of the accident before the Garda arrive.  Are any penalties envisaged in that kind of situation?  We need clarification as to the scope of mandatory disqualification in hit and run cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three hour limit is a vexed issue. The Minister gave sound reasons for concern about extending the scope of this Bill beyond three hours and the legal problems that might cause.  There is no reason blood and urine testing should not be carried out beyond three hours but that would be treated differently in the courts when those results were produced. Most people involved in serious hit and run accidents, where there is a fatality or serious injury, will have far more than the legal level of 80 milligrammes of blood alcohol.  Consider a person who drinks seven or eight pints or the person who drinks five, six or ten glasses of spirits, the chronic drinker.  We are talking about the person who severely abuses the legal levels of blood alcohol and drives at the same time.  It is possible that long after the three hours those people will be above the 80 milligrammes permitted blood alcohol level.  Therefore, there is sufficient reason to breathalyse those <Col N="1788" /> people and follow that up with a urine or a blood sample.  If they are still over the limit five hours later, there is no reason those results cannot be produced as evidence in court.  If they are below the limit after the three hour period one cannot then prove that they were over the limit at the time of the accident, but the chances are they will still be over the limit if they leave the scene where there has been a serious injury fatality.  That type of person would probably be over the limit for more than three hours and there should be some system whereby they could still be tested.  A judge can then decide whether to accept that evidence when it is produced before him.</P>
    <P>In another section of the Bill, we deal with the problem of those who deliberately try to frustrate prosecution by going home and drinking a bottle of vodka so that when they are questioned more than three hours later they can say that they were sitting in front of the television drinking at home, but that they were not drunk at the time of the accident. That section should apply also in a case where someone deliberately tries to frustrate prosecution.  A judge should have the liberty of taking into account that a person may have taken some drink at the time of the accident.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we get this right.  Without any notice having been given, eight amendments were grouped together.  We are frustrated in our ability to respond to eight different amendments, because we thought we would have been taking most of them sequentially. I had expected Deputy Gilmore's amendments to be taken together, but I have to admit that I did not expect the Minister's amendments and the section all to be taken together.  I would hope we would be afforded an opportunity of some further discussion, although I recognise that this is Report Stage.  I still await circulation of the list of grouping of amendments.</P>

      <P>Without meaning any disrespect to those involved, perhaps we should not have agreed that all of these amendments be taken together, because as it transpires Deputy Gilmore's amenment goes considerably further than the Minister's.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has endeavoured to address the hit-and-run aspect described.  There was considerable discussion of this aspect on Committee Stage.  I said already that it was ironic that somebody who actually stood their ground, even though they might have been over the legal alcohol limit, and endeavoured to help at the scene of an accident, would find themselves in greater trouble than somebody who had left the scene and escaped, as it were.  Therefore I welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled amendments to cater for these type of circumstances. My reading of the amendments tabled is that they would apply in circumstances in which injury only had occurred.  I would like the Minister to throw more light on that aspect.</P>
      <P>I might revert to the case of a driver who has left the scene of an accident, returned home, perhaps realising he or she was over the limit, and then consumes an additional amount of alcohol, in the knowledge that they will be apprehended and that, if they are breathalised or tested in any way, they will be found to be above the limit.  This is a very difficult question. I think Deputy Upton is correct in saying that scientifically there should be a way of getting around this problem.  I believe there is a way of getting around it. However, I accept what the Minister says, that unfortunately the spirit &mdash; if the House will forgive the pun &mdash; of the law is ignored in this case by the legal profession.  We witness countless such cases.  The Minister rightly says it is embarrassing to read of so many; it must be embarrasing for him and equally for the Minister for Justice to read of these cases.  We all abhor the fact that technical details are combed over so that people get off scot-free or with much lighter sentences than should be meted out to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas I understand the Minister's <Col N="1790" /> difficulties, perhaps there should have been greater indepth investigation in the interval between Committee and Report Stages to ascertain whether there is not a way in which the spirit of Deputy Gilmore's amendment could be incorporated here.  I support what the Minister is endeavouring to do, but I do not think that in this case he has gone far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Minister's set of amendments deal with the anomaly to which I referred, whereby somebody involved in a hit and run accident could actually get off with a lighter sentence or penalty than somebody who had remained and faced the music.  I acknowledge that that does cover the loophole that had obtained.  However, I am disappointed that he has not addressed the three-hour problem, for this reason.  He has taken the amendment to task largely on technical grounds, largely on grounds of the redefinition of the drink driving offence.  Indeed, he may well be right in that.  The difficulty we have on this side of the House is that we labour without the kind of Civil Service professional advice and the hired advice now available to Ministers and Ministers of State in addressing such matters.  We have to endeavour to do this ourselves.  Inevitably, particularly whenever we are dealing with matters of great technicality, technically we can be slightly off the mark.  But I do not think that in any way absolves the Minister from his responsibility of addressing what is at issue here.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether three hours is appropriate.  My understanding is that up to 90 minutes after consumption the blood alcohol in the body maximises and thereafter begins to tail off.  Therefore, I do not know what is the basis of this three-hour cut off point.  But probably there is an argument for saying that at a certain point, because of the variations in individual size, one's capacity and all the rest of it, it may not be possible to trace back and say that one must have had a certain level of alcohol in the blood at the precise time the accident occurred. There may well be some grounds for that kind of logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> But I would have thought whenever an accident occurred it would be of interest to the court to know whether the person who had caused the accident had consumed drink.  It is not just a matter of simply establishing whether there was a neat offence committed under the drink driving legislation.  Surely it would be a matter of interest to the judge hearing the case to know whether or not this person had consumed drink.</P>
    <P>If a hit and run accident occurs and everybody ends up in court at some time subsequently, there are a number of matters the judge will have to decide. First, he will have to decide whether offences were actually committed.  If he satisfies himself that offences were committed, he will then have to decide what is the appropriate accompanying sentence. I would have thought that it would have been of interest to and important for the court to know whether the person had consumed drink, because somebody who leaves the scene of an accident will subsequently go into court and state that they had a fit of nerves and had to rush home.  For example, somebody may go into court and say they had gone out to do a bit of shopping, that they had left very young children alone at home and had to rush home to them. People will come up with all kinds of excuses why they had to leave the scene of an accident.  The court will then be left to assess how valid were those reasons advanced, particularly in relation to the sentence to be imposed.  But many people will wonder whether the driver of the vehicle had consumed drink.  This has arisen already in one recent case when there was a very strong allegation made by the relatives of the young woman killed in the accident that the person who was driving the car had consumed drink. It may not be possible to establish the precise level of alcohol the person had in their body at the precise time the accident occurred, but if this three hour limit were extended at the very least it would be possible to establish whether drink had been consumed.  One would then be able to bring in one's expert witness who <Col N="1792" /> would be able to say: &ldquo;Well, if at four hours after the accident occurred there was that level of alcohol in the body, in all probability the person was quite drunk at the time the accident occurred&rdquo;.  It is important for a court to know that, when dealing with a charge of drink driving, dangerous driving, a hit and run accident or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not found some way to deal with this, even if only to permit the Garda to take samples and bring those samples into court; even if it were only a provision in the Bill stating that a court, in deciding on a sentence under the provisions of this Bill, would take into account the evidence assembled resulting from breath tests, or blood and urine tests, albeit after the three-hour limit had expired.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not found some way of doing that.  While the issue is important, I will not press this to a division but I want the Chair to put it formally to the House.  It is certainly not something I will withdraw as it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the issue is disposed of here and before the Bill goes to the Seanad that the Minister will find some way &mdash; if what he says is true, that without a time limit we would have to redefine the drink-driving offence &mdash; of enabling the Garda to take the samples.  He should find some way of requiring the court to take account of evidence produced as a result of those samples when assessing charges under this legislation, particularly when the court is about to hand down a sentence.</P>

      <P>The real problem with Deputy Gilmore's amendment is the risk involved.  I am not prepared to risk well established and accepted practice which could end up invalidating what we are setting out to do.  Deputy Gilmore will accept that evidence taken a considerable time after the accident would be questioned. If the Garda authorities fail to breathalyse a suspect within four hours it may be decided that he was being held in unlawful custody.  Failure to get a conviction <Col N="1793" /> because the breathalyser equipment could not be brought to a scene within that time is an indication of what we have to cope with.  I want to ensure certainty of prosecution is maintained.</P>

      <P>It is a long established practice.  Deputy Doyle also asked a question about the definition of drink-driving. A drink-driving offence is committed not only by driving when the alcohol level is over the specified limit but by driving when the amount of alcohol in the body is so great that it will cause the concentration of alcohol to exceed the specified level at any time within three hours after the person has been driving. Thus, it is not necessary to prove the actual alcohol level at the time of driving. That is where the real problem arises.  I am prepared to examine this again between now and the debate in the Seanad.  I have to be honest and say that we have looked very searchingly at this whole matter.  We have produced a definite proposal which ensures a prosecution and levels the playing field, as it were.  I am reluctant to give an indication that I may be able to respond in a more concrete way than I have done today because of the risks involved.</P>

The Minister said that throughout the debate and I agree with him and all Deputies should. The reason I seek to delete &ldquo;80 milligrammes&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;50 milligrammes&rdquo; is because of the general acceptance that we could not have a nil blood alcohol level defined and that we had to have some room for discretion.  If we are to come into line with our partners in the European Union &mdash; as it is now &mdash; we should accept the 50 milligrammes limit which, in general, is accepted throughout Europe.  The whole issue of the correct blood alcohol level is not an exact science and even within the limits the Minister is setting down of 80 milligrammes there is room for error.  It is a little like the opinion polls where there is a margin for error of 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>To a member of a smaller <Col N="1795" /> party it is of particular importance, but we err on the generous side.  This is a very serious issue.  It is not acceptable to drink and drive.  All the signals we send during the course of this debate should be to the effect that a person who drinks should not drive.  We heard in the debate of how difficult it would be for Irish society, particularly in rural areas, to operate if we were to insist on this.  The farmer would have to be allowed to have his pint after his long day's work in the hot sun.  That does not apply in the winter.  Certainly, coming up to Christmas we should be particularly vigilant.  On Committee Stage I said it was very important that this provision be implemented and that the Garda be given adequate resources.</P>
      <P>We are very familiar with the Garda scaring us at Christmas into submission, making us realise we should take our responsibilities seriously.  We are told often that the Garda have the necessary resources.  That is not enough.  It is important that the whole issue of drink-driving be addressed throughout the year.  We dwelt at length on the very sad statistics of the deaths, injuries and so on that occur as a result of drink-driving. The Minister is sincere in his efforts in this regard but it would give a much stronger signal if we were to reduce the blood alcohol levels.</P>

      <P>My party will not be supporting this amendment.  Even though I have a great deal of sympathy for the case put by Deputy Keogh, I believe that even by lowering the blood alcohol level to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood one cannot drink and drive.  It is academic.  If one is going out for a few drinks or a meal, or even visiting a friend's house with a view to having a drink, one will have to make other arrangements to get home.  It is as simple as that.  Only this morning I received a letter from a lady which expresses the views of many ordinary Irish people who are alarmed at the moves in this Bill to reduce the limit of blood alcohol levels to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of <Col N="1796" /> blood.  I think it deserves to be read into the record:</P>
      <P>Dear Ms. Doyle,</P>
      <P>I wish to protest vehemently at the proposed changes in the law on drinking and driving.</P>
      <P>While I empathise fully with those who have suffered as a result of drunk drivers and I have, in fact, been a victim of one myself, I do not think that reducing the limit to 80 millilitres from 100 is the answer to the problem. I have no difficulty accepting that alcohol may be a contributory factor in many road accidents.  However, I would contend that drunk drivers would have consumed much more than the current legal limit for driving.</P>
      <P>What the proposed legislation will do is cause problems for those, like myself, who try to keep within the current levels but I do not think it will change the behaviour of those who drink 7 or 8 pints and then drive home.</P>
      <P>When I am out at night, either in the pub, having a meal out or visiting a friend, I would generally have around two glasses of wine if I am driving home.  To go out and have one glass of wine, particularly if one is eating, just isn't worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Getting someone else to drive you home or taking taxis is not the answer either for most people as the former is simply not practicable and the latter too expensive.</P>
      <P>Once again, I should state that I have no sympathy for drunk drivers. While I appreciate fully the sentiments of people who have lost loved ones because of over-indulgence in alcohol, I do not think this is the solution to the problem and is simply pandering to those who will not be satisfied until the limit is nil.  This proposed measure will simply penalise those who are careful. Do you really believe that this problem is created by those who drive with a blood alcohol level of between 80 and 100 millilitres?  I certainly do not.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>That letter expresses the views that have reached other Deputies as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> Generally, the correspondence to <i>The Irish Times</i> refers to the high moral ground that the Minister has taken in relation to this issue.  In replying to these amendments it would be worthwhile if the Minister were to explain very clearly how he arrived at the opinion that the blood alcohol level needed to be reduced from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood. There is a great deal of confusion as to why the Minister is reducing the blood alcohol level.  This is not being done simply because the rest of Europe has done so and most states have done so, but for sound scientific reasons.  For the record will the Minister explain his reasons to those who point the finger accusingly at those of us who support this Bill?  It is important to get wide acceptance for a principle that I believe in.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the resources that will be provided by his Department and by the Department of Justice to the Garda to implement the Bill.  We will have wasted our time if the legislation is enacted and not enforced.  I believe that if the Garda had sufficient resources to implement the existing law in relation to blood alcohol limits at the rate of enforcement we can expect between now and Christmas, there may have been no need for change at all.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is responding to these amendments, perhaps he might explain what is meant by section (5) (a):</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations made by him, vary the concentration of alcohol for the time being standing specified in subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, whether generally or in respect of a particular class of person,...</P>
    <P>This has begged a great many quips and cartoons.  One of the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues ventured to suggest on Committee Stage that we could have a two-tier system, a blood alcohol level for the country people and a different one for the townspeople.  I am not sure if that is what the Minister has in mind, but that could be interpreted from the subsection <Col N="1798" /> I have just read into the record.  Will the Minister clarify the matter for the record?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Members have drawn attention at various Stages to the fact that what is proposed is a very major change in the relationship between drinking and driving.  When introducing the Bill the Minister's grandiose intention was &ldquo;to take drink out of driving&rdquo;.  That is what it comes down to.  At present most people try to translate the permitted limit of 100 milligrmmes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood into measures of alcohol, pints if they are drinking beer and glasses if they are drinking wine.  People try to figure out how much they can drink. Under the existing limits I understand that one can drink about two pints of beer, depending on capacity, so that two friends going to the pub could buy a round each and in all probability remain within the limit.  A couple going out for a meal could share a bottle of wine and still be within the limit when driving home.  In reducing the blood alcohol limit to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, this will change.  One cannot share equally a bottle of wine, as the person driving will have to consume much less than the passenger or leave the remainder.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle that the Minister needs to clarify why he proposes to reduce the blood alcohol level and to state the evidence that supports this reduction.  I have not had a satisfactory response to this to date.  I think I know what the Minister is trying to achieve.  He is right in wanting to take the drink out of driving, but if that is his intention he should accept Depuy Keogh's amendment, so that there is no ambiguity that it is still OK to drink a little if driving. We need to be clear on the message we send out.  Either it is you do not drink and drive, or it is left near enough to where it is at present.  We are presented with that choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is carnage on our roads &mdash; over 400 deaths and 10,000 people injured per year, which is worse than the carnage in Northern Ireland.  Even if one accepts that a quarter of the accidents are <Col N="1799" /> attributable to drink driving and that the real offenders are those who drive having consumed seven or eight pints &mdash; not the farmer who goes out and drinks two or three pints, as he has been doing for years, and drives home at 25 or 30 miles per hour, as Deputy Doyle outlined &mdash; even if one accepts all that, it still comes down to the fact that one's senses are very considerably affected by having this level of alcohol in one's system.  If it will minimise the carnage on the road I will support it.  Indeed I support Deputy Keogh's amendment.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was introduced the Minister has peddled the line that it will solve the problem relating to the degree of road accidents, death and injury on our roads.  It is wrong to send out that message because other factors are involved, many for which the Minister has direct responsibility, contributing to the death and carnage on the roads.  The level of alcohol is immaterial if gardaí are not out checking it.  The Garda force is 1,000 fewer than it should be and there are not enough gardaí on the roads.  Unlike other countries we do not have traffic police and we have a problem with enforcement. When the Minister announces his drinking curfew for Christmas the incidence of accidents drops dramatically due to enforcement.</P>
    <P>Other factors, for instance dangerous driving which does not involve drink, which contributes to the death on our roads must be addressed.  The young super stud who wants to show off to his girlfriend may not have taken any drink but is a menace on the road.  The condition of non-national roads, for which the Minister has responsibility, is a disgrace as is the condition of road signs and so on.  The local authorities do not have the money to do anything about this and it is the Minister's responsibility.  That contributes to the carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>We must decide whether we want to ban drinking and driving.  I have come to the conclusion that drinking and driving should not be allowed.  That will cause inconvenience for everyone but it is a decision one must make if one is seriously <Col N="1800" /> trying to reduce the appalling level of death and injury on our roads.  We have to do more than just ban drink.  We must enforce the law and ensure that the roads are capable of being driven on safely. We have to address the other factors contributing to death and injury on the roads.  If the Minister does not address that in a practical way all the grandiose statements about taking drink out of driving and reducing death and injury on our roads are not worth anything.  We need honesty about what is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this at length on Committee Stage.  Because the cities have an efficient taxi service which is not available in rural areas, rural Deputies, including me, were concerned about the reduction in the level of alcohol in the blood from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes for driving purposes.  We tend to see the hundred milligrammes limit as meaning a limit of 2 pints.  I would not consider myself incapable of driving after taking two pints.  I am concerned about the reduction to 80 milligrammes and I oppose the amendment reducing the limits to 50 milligrammes.</P>
      <P>None of us condones drunken driving. Coming up to Christmas a lot of media attention is focused on drunken driving, the Garda are more vigilant and people are conscious of the danger.  It is a pity we cannot be conscious of the danger throughout the year.  I wonder whether the Minister's reduction from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes will have a significant impact on statistics &mdash; I think not.  If one expresses reservations about a reduction like this one is almost considered to be in favour of drunken driving and there is a tendency for people to take the high moral ground and believe that if you do not go along with these proposals you are opposed to moving in the right direction.  I do not support Deputy Keogh's amendment as the limit is low enough at 80 milligrammes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we market Ireland abroad we talk about the marvellous social life of people who live here, our pub culture and pubs being a focal point.  In rural areas the pub is the main focal point for <Col N="1801" /> socialising and meeting people.  The cities give a wider choice of entertainment in that they have cinemas, theatres, restaurants and so on.  In many country towns the ordinary farmer comes in and drinks two or three pints and then drives home, he has done that religiously for years.  Such people will be extremely concerned about the reduction to 80 milligrammes and it will impact on business. Another consideration to be taken into account is the revenue which drink provides for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support the amendment. The reduction to 80 milligrammes is adequate.  I agree with the point made by a number of Deputies when they spoke in terms of the basis for the reduction of blood alcohol levels in the Bill to 80 milligrammes.  That is the essence of this Bill if one leaves aside the legal technicalities.  The Minister has not clearly outlined the improvement that change is likely to bring.  There has been much talk about the effects of drunken driving and there is no doubt it is a major problem.  People who drive a car with in excess of 100 milligrammes of alcohol in their blood are breaking the law.  There is ample evidence in the data available from court cases and from simply observing the way people behave in public houses that a large proportion of our population consume above that level.  If those people drive cars they are breaking the law.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore said, it is wrong to suggest that this change alone will bring about a major improvement.  It will not, unless it is enforced and we address other factors which contribute to road accidents. We are making the mistake of lumping all those factors together and assuming that this change will make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the effects of alcohol on a person's capacity, we must recognise that one's capacity changes in accordance with the level of alcohol in the blood. The effects of 50 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood is relatively small, but the effects increase with 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, and a <Col N="1802" /> person would be practically incoherent with a level of 300 or 400 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  If a person's level of alcohol exceeds 500 milligrammes it is almost the equivalent of having an anaesthetic.  It is possible for a person to die from excessive consumption of alcohol.  That is the reality, but in this legislation we are dealing with levels of alcohol of between 80 milligrammes and 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood.  That is what the Minister should be addressing.  He should supply us with the data which indicates that there will be a significant change because of this incremental reduction.  I have not seen that data.  Are we not simply following the European line?</P>
    <P>It is important that the public know the amount of alcohol they can consume before exceeding blood alcohol levels of 80 milligrammes.  I agree with what has been said in relation to the consumption of two pints.  At present a person could probably get away with consuming two pints before exceeding the limit, but under the law limit a person will have exceeded the acceptable drink driving level following the consumption of two pints.  That will undoubtedly have adverse effects for life in rural Ireland, although I do not wish to defend drunk driving.  We should consider the full consequence of the enforcement of this legislation. It is unacceptable that a set of laws should be placed on our Statutue Book and that, in effect, the position remains unchanged.  That is part of the difficulty at present.  In general, people do not observe drink driving limits and in most cases get away with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh's amendment appears to have run into difficult water in terms of the contributions so far.  From what has been stated I would want to be Solomon to decide the correct level of alcohol consumption for drink driving.  On the one hand, Deputy Keogh requested that I reduce the level from 80 milligrammes to 50 milligrammes and, on the other, it has been suggested that the level should remain at 100 milligrammes. although some Deputies supported this <Col N="1803" /> reduction to 80 milligrammes.  It has been suggested that I should do nothing to interfere with tradition in rural Ireland. It is abundantly clear that there is no consensus in this House in regard to the appropriate action which should be taken at present.  There is no safe level of alcohol consumption when mixed with driving and the fact that an upper limit is set does not encourage or condone driving with alcohol levels below that limit.</P>
      <P>The thrust of our education and publicity programmes in this area has been to promote the message that drinking and driving should not be mixed.  Nevertheless, soft arguments do not hide hard truths about drink driving.  I do not wish to have a long debate on Report Stage about the effects of alcohol on a person's ability to drive.  Suffice it to say that small quantities of alcohol can impair a driver's concentration.  Factors such as fatigue, illness, stress and drugs can exacerbate the effects and cause severe concentration loss even when a small quantity of alcohol is consumed.  When a person's blood alcohol level exceeds 80 milligrammes the normal reaction is overestimation of ability, impairment of peripheral vision and of one's eyes reaction to light and dark.  Impaired judgment of distance and speed of oncoming vehicles, impairment of ability to react and a tendency to take risks can result at lower levels.  Research carried out in America estimated that drivers with blood alcohol levels of approximately 80 milligrammes had twice the risk of being involved in accidents as those who had not taken a drink.  Research in France and in other parts of Europe shows the graph in respect of accidents rising dramatically at alcohol levels about 80 milligrammes.  We are a very sparsely populated country, but we have the third highest level of car accidents in the Community and statistics show the number of those associated with drink driving.  Such accidents take place not alone in cities but in every parish and town in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should distinguish between drinking and driving.  I have stated on numerous occasions that I do not wish to <Col N="1804" /> interfere with people's right to have a drink.  Statistics show that on average every man, woman and child in this country consumes one and a half pints of alcohol per day at a cost of £5 million.  On previous road traffic legislation Deputies stated that reducing the alcohol levels would ruin life in rural Ireland.  This legislation does not hinder people from having a drink and enjoying themselves. I am delighted at the reaction in many parts of the country and the fact that people are arranging that one person in a crowd does not drink while the others enjoy themselves.  People can make such arrangements.  It is ridiculous to try to argue about an absolute point at which the legislation should be enforced because we are talking about a cultural change, the right to enjoy a drink but not cause a threat on our roads. We should distinguish between those two matters; otherwise people will misread the provisions of the legislation.  As Minister for the Environment, I cannot stand up here and say what the absolute level of alcohol should be for drink driving.  I do not know the answer to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No other Deputy could categorically state what the level should be, but we all know that we need to change the attitudes of a hard core of people who will not face reality and as a result of whose actions many people continue to suffer.  There is no hiding from that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to suggest that the only effort made by the Garda authorities takes place at Christmas time.  A total of 8,000 prosecutions have taken place throughout the year as a whole.  I accept that enforcement of the law generally could be stepped up and I have made proposals to the Department of Justice in that regard.  The question of manpower and more sophisticated equipment is essential, because legislation is only one element of the matter.  There will be publicity campaigns, educational programmes, <Col N="1805" /> law enforcement, research and proposals for a cultural change which this legislation promotes.  It is not a question of high moral ground.  Such a suggestion totally misrepresents what is involved. The stark statistics of the fatalities and horrific injuries which place us third in the Community in respect of traffic accidents, despite our low population, shows the necessity to step up our performance in terms of law enforcement and road improvements.  In this regard additional resources are being made available to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>So far as the amendment is concerned, I have outlined clearly the reasons I am taking these steps.  As I said earlier, I am not in a position to indicate to the House the precise figure, but I do not want people to drink and drive.  However, we have to set limits which are enforceable. We also need to receive a reasonable degree of democratic support.  In this regard there is no consensus in this House.  I have been asked to introduce a lower or a higher figure or to do nothing. Having listened to all of the contributions, I am making my best judgment in this matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of different classes of driver, I should say in response to Deputy Doyle that there are people who drive buses and trucks carrying chemicals and other dangerous substances.  The question of whether these should be treated in a different way because of the responsibilities on them can be considered.  This is the position in other countries and I would like an opportunity to consider this option.  It should not be laughed at.</P>

I do not accept that because this is an inexact science we should not agree to a figure of 50 milligrammes. The principle should be &ldquo;If you drink, do not drive&rdquo; and I make no apology for saying that.  We should not <Col N="1806" /> ignore the law as it stands.  This applies equally to those in rural Ireland about whom we have heard who are ignoring the law.  That ought to be the position regardless of whether a person lives in Dublin or Limerick.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have met the families of people killed or injured in road accidents feel very strongly that people should not drink and drive.  I am no kill-joy; I will have a drink with anybody. But we should avail of the opportunity in this debate to make the point that if one wants to have a drink, they should not drive, but that they should make other arrangements.  As I said, it is appropriate to make this point in the runup to Christmas.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says there is no consensus.  I think there is consensus when we come to the question of enforcement.  In this regard the Minister said that he has made proposals to the Minister for Justice.  This is the crux of the matter.  If resources were made available to implement the legislation as it stands, we would find ourselves in a far better position.  It makes no sense to introduce legislation if we know in our heart and soul that it will not be implemented.  It appears that we have developed a culture whereby laws are meant to be broken or ignored.  It is critical therefore that resources be made available to implement the legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who say that the dangers associated with driving are not confined to those who drink and drive; other issues have to be examined.  In this regard the Minister has a responsibility to ensure that our roads are safe and that cars are roadworthy.</P>

Neither do I doubt the sincerity of those who are fearful that a particular culture will disintegrate, but the truth of the matter is that we will have to say to those who drink seven or eight pints and drive that they cannot legally drink and drive.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 48 to 51, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 48, down to and including &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 51.</P>
      <P>There are a number of amendments to be discussed together.  All are related to the question of powers of entry.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 40 proposes to insert a new section in the Bill to clarify the specific powers of members of the Garda Síochána to enter private property and the circumstances and conditions under which the power of entry may be exercised. The new section is intended to replace the provisions which are currently contained in sections 10, 11 and 15 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in sections 10 and 11 to allow members of the Garda Síochána to enter private property to effect an arrest were included in the Bill to overcome a difficulty highlighted by the Supreme Court.  In March 1991 the Supreme Court determined that a garda who entered a person's driveway to arrest a person for a drink driving offence was a trespasser <Col N="1808" /> and that the arrest was unlawful.  In giving its decision, one of the Justices of the Supreme Court expressed the view that &ldquo;although any change in the existing law is a matter exclusively for the Oireachtas, instances such as in the present case would appear clearly to warrant legislative intervention to prevent repetition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposed powers of entry in the Bill were developed in the light of that judgment and on the basis of legal advice. Arising from that legal advice, the proposed powers were confined to effect an arrest &mdash; the powers were restricted to circumstances where the garda has, prior to entry, sufficient evidence to form an opinion that an offence had been committed which would be essential to justify an arrest.  The powers do not extend to allow a garda to enter a dwelling to take a preliminary breath specimen in cases where the garda may only have suspicions that the person had been drinking.</P>
    <P>These provisions were debated at length on Committee Stage.  Significant reservations were expressed at that time by the Select Committee; and, while I indicated that I could not agree to withdraw the measure, I did undertake to reexamine the provisions to see how the concerns raised might be addressed.  This amendment gives effect to that commitment.</P>
    <P>The main objections raised on Committee Stage to these new powers were that the power would infringe constitutional rights, that the use of force could be excessive, that it would be open to abuse, and that there could be a danger of errors being made with the wrong person being arrested.</P>
    <P>In debating this issue on Committee Stage, Deputies on all sides expressed contempt for hit-and-run drivers and indicated that they would support additional measures in dealing with people who run away leaving dead or injured people on the road.  Several Deputies expressed the view that a power to enter a dwelling could be justified to arrest a person who had left the scene of an accident where death or injury to a person occurred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> I have now reconsidered the proposed powers in the light of all the comments aired on Committee Stage and I have sought ways to alleviate the fears expressed by many Deputies.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental and significant issue is the question of the constitutionality of the provision.  I had previously taken legal advice on this aspect but I arranged to have the matter reviewed again in the light of views expressed in committee.</P>
    <P>Article 40.5 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law&rdquo;. The Constitution clearly envisages that the Oireachtas may, in legislation, limit that constitutional protection in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>While a final determination of the constitutionality of a statutory provision can only be made by the Supreme Court, I am advised that it should be possible to successfully defend the provision I am proposing.</P>
    <P>The other issues raised in committee are not of the same fundamental importance but they do require the same serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have queried whether the commission of a drink driving offence on its own is sufficient justification to permit a person's home to be entered.  I personally believe this to be a serious offence.  I have previously said I was anxious to ensure that there would be no safe havens for people who commit criminal offences and that I was satisfied the provision can be successfully defended in any constitutional challenges.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have listened carefully to the views of my colleagues and, to meet what I perceive to be genuinely held concerns, I am proposing in this amendment to allow entry to the curtilage of a dwelling but to exclude entry to the actual dwelling of a person for the purpose of drink driving arrests.  I am, however, proposing that entry to a dwelling be permitted to apprehend and arrest any person who runs away from the scene <Col N="1810" /> of an accident having caused death or injury.</P>
    <P>To meet the concerns of Deputies about possible cases of mistaken identity, I am proposing that entry to the dwelling in a hit-and-run case will be permissible only in cases of hot pursuit where a garda has actually seen the person enter.</P>
    <P>As regards use of force, it is implicit that any such power given to the Garda may only be exercised in a reasonable manner but to put the matter beyond doubt this is being explicitly stated.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amendments I have just outlined meet the main concerns of Deputies and I am seeking the support of the House for the new proposals.  The bottom line is that some power is needed, both to tackle the hit-and-run offender and the drink driving offender who, as of now, can evade justice simply because he has reached the sanctuary of his own property.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section also contains the powers regarding entry to hospitals.  These are included to incorporate all powers of entry in one section.</P>
    <P>The other amendments which are consequential upon, and grouped with, this amendment are as follows:</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 14 and 23 delete the existing powers of entry which are to be replaced by the new section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 47 provides for a new power of arrest in section 106 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  The purpose is to allow a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest, without warrant, a hit-and-run offender who has caused death or injury.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 is a consequential amendment to provide that a breath, blood or urine specimen may be taken for analysis following such an arrest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle has related amendments, Nos. 10 and 15.  I believe that the thrust of what Deputy Doyle is proposing is catered for in my own amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for reconsidering his original proposals.  As one who raised this matter on Second Stage, and again on Committee Stage, I felt strongly that the bald provision in the Bill as initially circulated would be wide <Col N="1811" /> open to abuse and proved unconstitutional when challenged.</P>
      <P>The Minister caters for the sentiments in my amendments which are less technically drafted because of the lack of resources available to the Opposition relative to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>There is one area on which I still need clarification.  I have no difficulty with the Minister's proposal to give the Garda powers to enter a dwelling in cases of hot pursuit.  The section of the Bill was too broadly drafted and this proposal makes it specific.  The Minister has made it quite tight in that a member of the Garda must actually have seen somebody leave the scene of the crime and pursued them to their house.  That is a very reasonable power, given the safeguards.  However, I wonder if there is a case for extending the time within which the garda has power to enter a private dwelling to three hours in the case of a hit-and-run.  I specify three hours because there is a presumption that alcohol levels can rise in the blood for up to three hours after consuming the last drink, and after three hours, if no more alcohol has been consumed, the blood alcohol level reduces in normal metabolic circumstances.  I am attempting to make specific this extension of the power of the Garda to enter private dwellings, with force if necessary, and arrest without warrant, if necessary.  The Minister's proposal is to do that in cases of hot pursuit. However, in hit-and-run cases where the garda may not have actually seen the person leave the scene of a crime but can reasonably be of the opinion that that person was involved in the accident, is there a case for giving the garda the power to enter that person's home for up to three hours after the accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a Supreme Court judgment adds to our case in regard to drunk driving and being drunk in charge of a vehicle, dealt with in sections 10 and 11 of the Bill.  I refer to the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>.  William Forbes with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  Apparently the court decided that, this Bill apart, under present law a garda is entitled to enter <Col N="1812" /> private property to effect an arrest for drunken driving and, furthermore, a householder gives &ldquo;an implied authority&rdquo; to a member of the garda to come on the forecourt of his premises.  I would like to know the Minister's thinking on how that extends our ability to deal with the type of cases we are discussing here.  In proposing his amendments the Minister made the power to enter a dwelling and arrest without warrant specific to cases of hot pursuit, but in ordinary drunk driving cases he is extending the power to the Garda to come on to the curtilage or forecourt of a private dwelling or private premises generally.  Although it is probably neater to have this nailed down in the Bill, is it necessary, as apparently the Supreme Court has already decided that that power exists?  I was not aware of that when we discussed this Bill on Committee Stage; perhaps the judgment had not then been handed down.  However it brings a step further the case law used in deciding these issues.</P>
    <P>I will put on the record the views of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in respect of the original subsections 10 (8) and 11 (10) which gave rise to extreme concerns.  I was very unhappy with the original wording of those two sections which have been amended subsequently. I received a letter from the Law Society which states:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>The Society's Parliamentary Committee has considered subsections 10 (8) and 11 (10) of the above Bill [namely, the Road Traffic Bill, 1993 before us today].  The Committee's view is that the provisions amount to an abuse of power; [that is strong language from the law society] that the powers of arrest contained in these subsections are excessive in relation to the offences and the frequency with which they are likely to occur.</P>
    <P>It was felt that if such powers are not necessary in other legislation dealing with greater offences, they are not necessary in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have accepted the spirit of the views of The Incorporated <Col N="1813" /> Law Society of Ireland and may have communicated with it.  Its view is that the extention of such power to the gardaí was excessive given that other legislation dealing with more serious matters did not extend such powers to them. We are all aware that powers which are a cause of concern to many are extended to gardaí in areas covered by other legislation. I am pleased the Minister made crime specific.  Having regard to what the Minister said when proposing his amendments I have no reason to believe that the extension of his power to the gardaí has been restricted to make it crime specific. I would welcome his views on where the line should be drawn in a case of hot pursuit and extending the time limit for alcohol content by up to three hours following a hit and run accident.  I will not press my amendments given that their spirit has been fully incorporated in what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>When replying I ask the Minister to consider an amendment which has been ruled out of order because it would be a potential charge on the Revenue.  When the powers that be are at a loss to know the basis on which to rule an amendment out of order it is ruled out on the basis that it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I asked the Minister to consider the spirit of that amendment because it relates to the amendment he proposed.  If powers are extended to gardaí to enter private property, with reasonable force if necessary, and to make an arrest without a warrant in any circumstances &mdash; they have been clearly defined today &mdash; the gardaí must be protected against claims for damage to property or subsequent injury to the person. Powers have been extended to the gardaí to enter private property with reasonable force and make an arrest without a warrant under other legislation, for example, legislation covering the case of a victim in peril or where an attempt is made to dispose of evidence.  That provision is included in the protection of the Constabulary Act of approximately 1800.  I <Col N="1814" /> am not sure of the year but it is an old Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like that. Serious consideration must be given to protecting the gardaí in their role of protecting citizens.  If powers &mdash; even crime specific ones &mdash; are extended to gardaí to enable them to enter private property and make an arrest without a warrant, damage will probably be caused to the property and injury may be caused inadvertently to a person who may object to an arrest without a warrant.  In such cases are the gardaí protected by the protection of the Constabulary Act or other legislation? I do not believe they are.  In other legislation involving the extension of such powers to the gardaí, they are specifically protected by the Constabularly Act against subsequent claims in respect of injury to the property or the person.  I give the Bill a guarded welcome.  The area is a legal and constitutional mine-field. Even though the Minister proposes to make the extension of powers to the gardaí under this Bill crime specific &mdash; in cases of hot pursuit, curtilage and drunken driving, although the Supreme Court would hold that those powers exist in certain circumstances &mdash; the risk of a constitutional challenge is strong because we are stepping into the area of the private home and protection within it, covered by Article 45 of the Constitution, which people guard jealously.  I ask the Minister to cover those points when replying.  I will withdraw my amendments and support those of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that this area provoked heated discussion <Col N="1815" /> on Committee Stage.  Many Members expressed reservations about the openness of the powers given to the gardaí, especially in relation to the privacy of the home.  I recall Deputy Doyle saying to the Minister that nobody condones a hit-and-run accident and she favoured granting the Minister powers in such cases.  I compliment the Minister for taking on board the sentiments expressed on Committee Stage.  I am sure most Deputies will support the Ministers amendment. The Minister referred to the curtilage of the House and the Supreme Court judgment and I am sure Deputies will not object to that provision.  Many of the concerns expressed by Members on Committee Stage have been allayed by the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by other Deputies.  Obviously, the Minister listened to the heated debate on Committee Stage.  The view of the Law Society in respect of the powers being excessive was expressed by Deputies on all sides, but at that time the Minister was concerned to give the gardaí what he considered to be appropriate powers. Deputy Doyle referred to a case of hot pursuit referred to on Committee Stage. The person involved in that case pulled into the driveway of another person's home and that might have influenced the decision in that case.  That case was an example of where the violation of the privacy of the home might be open to challenge through the Supreme Court and that was an area about which all Members were concerned.  Regarding cases of drunken driving, the challenges in court are numerous, every device is used to challenge prosecutions and cases may be appealed to the Supreme Court. The Minister's amendments address the various reservations by Members.</P>

      <P>The compilation and publication of statistics on tourism and travel is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

      <P>The study in question was carried out by consultants from the Department of Economics in UCD and is based on expenditures in the 1988-89 school year. I do not propose to comment on the figures contained in the newspaper report as they are not set in the context of the total study.</P>
      <P>Any conclusions drawn from the study must taken into account that: (i) it deals with expenditure for one year only; (ii) there are differences in the scope of activities provided i.e. in the ranges and types of subjects offered in the different sectors &mdash; voluntary secondary schools concentrate traditionally on the provision of academic subjects while the vocational schools and community and comprehensive schools provide a higher proportion of technical-vocational subjects which are more expensive to teach; (iii) in the vocational schools it was not possible to allocate costs precisely between general second level programmes and other courses-activities such as adult literacy and community education and vocational preparation and training programmes &mdash; as a result of the data on unit costs per whole time general post-primary pupil for vocational schools may overestimate some expenditures; and (iv) some cost items are not reported consistently because they are directly incurred by schools in some sectors and not in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these reservations, I accept that the study indicates some disparity of funding as between the voluntary secondary schools and the other school types.  The main element in the disparity is the pay costs which were being met at school level. In that regard, I would remind the House that since this data was gathered progress has been made in implementing the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to expand the caretaking and clerical services available to <Col N="1822" /> second-level schools.  An additional sum of £2.36 million per annum is being provided for this purpose and the scheme will be extended as resources permit.  In this way the imbalance of funding is being redressed.</P>
    <P>Since the survey was conducted, there have been improvements in the funding for the running costs of national schools also.  These improvements have been by way of increased ordinary capitation grants and required local contribution, additional grants for clerical and caretaking assistance and additional grants for schools in disadvantaged areas, totalling in all £7.75 million annually.</P>
    <P>The State does not meet all the costs of national schools and voluntary secondary schools.  In regard to parents' contributions, the funding regulations for the operating expenses of national schools require that a local contribution equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the State grant &ldquo;shall be provided by the local parish community or other appropriate analogous community or body from the general funds at the disposal of such community and that there shall be no levy on parents of children attending the school&rdquo; Contributions made by parents to voluntary secondary schools are not compulsory but such contributions where they are made are valuable and are appreciated.</P>
    <P>Based on the figures indicated in the unit cost study and taking account of inflation in the intervening years it is estimated that the cost of meeting the shortfalls in funding for national schools and voluntary secondary schools are in the region of £4 million and £5.5 million, respectively.  The case for meeting this shortfall has to be set in the context of other demands for educational funding and taxation levels.  The report of the unit costs studies will be published when summaries and my comments on them have been prepared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the report has been with her Department since 1988, will the Minister say why it has not been published before now? After all, this is supposed to be the era <Col N="1823" /> of open Government, accountability and transparency.  Is the general public not to be trusted with the information contained in the report?  Article 42.4 of the Constitution states that the State shall provide for free primary education.  What is the Minister's understanding of &ldquo;free primary education&rdquo; as enshrined in the Constitution?  This report shows a yawning gap between what parents have to pay and what is provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>The report was not received by my Department until February 1992.  I intend to publish the report, which has been the subject of some examination. Having regard to the need for fairness and transparency, it is only right that the report should distinguish between the funding given to various schools, the reasons this funding is provided and the headings under which it is provided.  I am happy to make the report available.  With regard to costs, the newspaper report referred to a difference of £32 between the capitation grant of £150 and the average cost per pupil in voluntary secondary schools of £182.  The average cost of maintaining a pupil at secondary school included a sum of £11.44 for substitute teachers.  This is not a cost as it can be recouped by the Department of Education.  I am not saying there was not a shortfall in regard to voluntary schools, but we have to look at the different payments and the headings under which they are made.  It is not correct to say that there is a difference of £32 when a sum of £11.44 can be recouped by the Department.  After the report is published I will comment on it, and I will welcome the comments of the Deputy and other interested parties on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to primary schools, a local contribution equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the State grant is provided by the local parish community or other appropriate body.  In the case of multi-denominational schools this funding is provided in a different way.  It became apparent during the recent national debate on education that we have very few, if any, free <Col N="1824" /> primary schools; rather we have a series of schools which are in receipt of State funding.</P>
    <P>I wish to tell the Deputy, and those who have made representations to me for more funding in certain areas, that the question of choice in terms of the money available is a particularly difficult one at present.  We have to decide how best to use the contributions by the State.  All voluntary contributions are welcome but contributions are not compulsory although I have had cases brought to my attention about the apparent compulsory nature of some contributions.  Parents who are worried about costs should bear in mind these are voluntary contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the amount of funding a local community must raise for the upkeep of its school is now far in excess of the 25 per cent capitation grant made available by the State and that the study to which we are referring confirms that by highlighting a shortfall of approximately £16 million?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that while the contributions in schools may be termed voluntary, when a child comes home with a note from the school requesting money, it would be a very hard-necked parent indeed who would not send the child back to school with the contribution?  Will she also accept that while in theory these contributions are voluntary, in practice they are compulsory?  Has the Minister plans to increase the capitation grant in the coming year, acknowledging that there was a modest increase in the grant last year?  Has she any further plans in the lifetime of this Government to increase the capitation grant to shorten the gap and deal with the problem that parents and local communities have in raising money on a daily basis to keep their schools operating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a remarkable increase in funding to primary schools.  The local contribution increased from £26.50 to £33 per pupil.  There was an advance in the funding of clerical and <Col N="1825" /> caretaking assistance in primary schools which was an acknowledged drain on the resources of the schools.  The cost to the taxpayer is £2.2 million annually.  Since 1988-89 the Department of Education has designated schools as disadvantaged. The number of those schools has increased and those are the schools for which the Deputy and I have a common concern with regard to the burden placed on parents in the funding of their children's education.</P>
      <P>The total additional grants paid to those schools increased from £316,000 in 1988 to £1,267 million in 1993.  That is an extraordinary increase towards the operation and upkeeping costs of the school. The combined improvements in funding for the operation costs of primary schools is by way of the increase in the ordinary capitation grant, the required local contribution, the additional grants for caretaking and clerical assistance and the grants for disadvantaged schools.  The Deputy must acknowledge that £7.75 million annually has been put into a system that urgently required it.</P>
      <P>Referring to the second part of the Deputy's question in regard to the voluntary nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the first part yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the first part.  He stated that matters had disimproved but I am telling him they have not.  In fact, schools finding it difficult to maintain standards of accommodation and conditions have been assisted dramatically in the last year compared to 1988-1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy wants me to answer the second part of his question, I refer him to a reply I gave to Deputy Higgins. Voluntary contributions are obviously not compulsory.  However, I take the Deputy's point and that is why I repeated twice what I said in my initial reply.  We need to be able to give advice to parents who feel they are under pressure and that advice I have given on a constituency level &mdash; perhaps the Deputy and I share the same constituents &mdash; is that instead <Col N="1826" /> of embarrassing the child, the parents should write a note to the school explaining their position.  I have asked people to get back to me if they have not had a satisfactory response to that sort of communication, which can be done privately between the school and management, not between the child and management.  To date, nobody has come back to me in regard to this matter.  Some parents feel they should contribute even though it is voluntary, and it is up to us to advise them.</P>
    <P>The funding of schools through a capitation mechanism is one I particularly favour.  With the increase in the grant to primary schools last year, we were able to target further the disadvantaged schools so that rather than giving a grant across the board we were able to top up the grant for disadvantaged schools which cannot provide the facilities available in other schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Priority Question No. 4 and Questions Nos. 46, 53, and 68 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need for the development of foreign languages in schools, particularly at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>Regarding primary level, the Deputy may be aware that the Primary Curriculum Review Body Report considered the question of the introduction of modern continental languages in the senior classes of primary school but recommended against it because of the demands it would put on the curriculum.</P>
      <P>The Green paper proposed the introduction of an awareness programme of foreign languages in senior classes at primary level and, on examination of the views received in this regard, I am having the matter further explored in the context of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>There is provision for the teaching of French in virtually all second-level schools and there has been a significant increase in the number of pupils taking German.  The numbers taking Spanish and Italian are, however, quite small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, in excess of 80 per cent of post-primary students take at least one foreign language.  Our efforts at present are directed at increasing the participation of students in learning German, Spanish <Col N="1828" /> and Italian, rather than in extending the range of languages.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that teaching and learning methods are improving. There is increased emphasis in developing oral-aural competencies.  A survey by the inspectorate on the teaching of French indicated many positive features. A similar survey on the teaching of German is about to commence.  The situation is kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that Ireland is at the bottom of the Community foreign language league, that our students, in terms of usable language skills and an ability to speak the language, have a lower level than even the notoriously monolinguistic United Kingdom? Will she agree that in terms of the ability to speak a language, it is quite obvious there is something fundamentally wrong with our approach to language teaching and that the performance of students in the leaving certificate is embarrassing by comparison with other countries?  If we are to compete with other economies within the EC, and it has been proven that of the smaller successful economies such as Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland, those prolific in terms of language ability succeed, will the Minister <Col N="1829" /> agree that this problem must be addressed?</P>

I can give the House the numbers of students who are proficient in languages on leaving school but that might lead to further delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Information is not available on the number of schools damaged by vandalism or the cost of repairing such damage.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary, secondary and vocational schools the cost of repairing damage from vandalism is borne by the schools' insurance.  My Department is usually not provided with details.  Community and comprehensive schools do not have commercial insurance and the repairs are funded by the Department. However, there are no specific figures available in respect of those schools for the costs arising directly from vandalism.</P>
      <P>Security of school buildings is a matter for the school authorities in the first instance.  As far as the Department is concerned, steps taken to combat vandalism include the installation of intruder alarms, provision of security lighting and perimeter fencing where the particular circumstances warrant such measures.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level all new schools and major extensions are designed with provision for intruder alarm systems. Alarm systems may also be provided, as resources permit, in existing second-level schools.  Grants are also provided for such systems in national schools in high-risk urban areas.  In addition, security lighting and perimeter fencing is provided where the particular circumstances of the school warrant it.</P>
      <P>In the case of nine schools in the Finglas area, which have been heavily vandalised, it is proposed to operate a pilot scheme on school security out of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> caretakers provision.  A sum of £45,000 will be allocated between the schools in question to provide night security involving a guard and guard dogs.  The position will be reviewed after a year and an assessment made of how effective was the scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is something fundamentally wrong if her Department has not got the relevant figures?  She has a report in process; there are school principals, to whom she can refer, there is obvious disruption of the day-to-day running of the school and surely, as a matter of routine, these figures and statistics should be made available to her Department?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last year &mdash; this is a conservative estimate &mdash; approximately £5 million worth of damage was done to school property through arson, vandalism and so on?  Is the Minister aware for example, that the Oblate primary school in Inchicore was vandalised to the tune of £200,000, that St. Agnes's school in Crumlin was vandalised to the tune of £400,000, that St. Mary's multi-denominational school nearby was vandalised to the tune of £200,000 and that many of these arson attacks and vandalising of schools are caused by children who are drunk on the school premises or in the school grounds?  Instead of keeping school facilities locked up we should be making them available to enable these children have some social enjoyment or interaction rather than leaving them easy prey to such people when they have drink consumed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of vandalism, whenever trouble occurs it is a matter generally between the schools and their insurance companies.  I might add that it is cases that cannot be dealt with in that manner that are brought to the attention of my Department.  I share the Deputy's concern that, in some cases, children are involved.  Indeed this year we have gone some way to responding to communities who have requested that extra facilities be made available to them. It is children who cannot benefit from the schools system who comprise the group to whom we need to turn considerable attention and devote resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is need for an expert objective analysis of the pattern of vandalism? <Col N="1834" /> Would she agree &mdash; a survey has been undertaken of this &mdash; that running throughout every case are common threads. Obviously there is lack of parental control evident in those areas; there is a very high incidence of unemployment and there is a marked lack of appreciation by the children in question of the value of education when it comes to seeking jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy seriously wants me to initiate another study.  This matter might best be dealt with through the existing departmental inspectorate network. Certainly I would welcome a copy of the findings of any survey that may come to the Deputy's attention.  Whenever and wherever law and order problems extend to children within a community I hope that the extension of the schools' liaison service and intervention in precise areas will achieve some long term results.  But, while overnight solutions may be attractive subjects to report they hardly constitute the appropriate way to deal with this problem.  I will take on board the Deputy's concern and ask the inspectorate in my Department to use their network to build up a picture of problems in certain communities.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that remedial teachers living or working outside a radius of 30 miles from Dublin city cannot avail of in-service training available in St. Patrick's Teacher Training College Drumcondra, Dublin 9; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides grant aid towards the provision of <Col N="1835" /> in-service courses for remedial teachers at six different locations throughout the country.  Three of these courses are held in Dublin and one each in Sligo, Cork and Limerick.  In all, 172 teacher places are available.</P>
      <P>The in-service remedial course in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, is one of those grant-aided by my Department. Organisation of the course and selection of participants is arranged by the college authorities.</P>
      <P>The college has indicated to my Department that one of the criteria used by them in the selection of applicants for the course is that the applicant's school should be within a 30 mile radius of the college.  They have explained that this course involves supervision and continuous assessment of both course work and teaching.  With this approach, which includes on-the-job evaluation of each participant in his/her school, regrettably it is not possible to facilitate teachers from outside the 30 mile radius.</P>
      <P>Two other remedial courses are organised in Dublin and are specifically designed for, and give preference to, candidates from outside the greater Dublin area.  One of these, at the Marino Institute of Education, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, is an intensive course conducted during the summer over a two-year period, for two weeks in each year. The second course, at the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines, Dublin 6, is held on Saturday mornings from October to May.</P>
      <P>Remedial teachers who cannot be accommodated on the course at St. Patrick's College get favourable consideration for inclusion in the other courses mentioned above on application.</P>
      <P>The Department's inspectorate are being asked to review in-service remedial courses in general with a view to streamlining the structure of the courses being provided at the various centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her detailed reply regarding the content of the course.  The course in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, is not available to <Col N="1836" /> teachers seeking training outside a radius of 30 miles of Dublin.  This is grossly unfair.  This is a course for which one particular teacher &mdash; I am now informed that another teacher made a similar request &mdash; applied and was refused.  Is this fair to the teacher, and the children whom this teacher is looking after, who saw fit to apply for the course in order to improve his own ability to help these children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, there is a choice in the matter. St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, is geared for inservice and on the job monitoring by the Department.  There would be enormous resource implications if we were to extend this course outside the 30 mile radius.  There are two other options, one of which is the Saturday morning course in which I participated.  I said at the end of my reply that the inspectors would look at the workings of it and take on board the demands of teachers who indicate their willingness to seek extra training so that they will be a specific resource in their schools.  Far be it from me to come between somebody's inclination to become a remedial teacher.  I have replied in some detail outlining the present position.  We are looking at the issue.  The administration involved in extending that service to teachers outside the 30 mile radius is quite different.  Perhaps this is a matter we could look at when the local education authorities are in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the service operates at present there is a bias in favour of Dublin remedial teachers and the children who can avail of this service in the greater Dublin area.  The children in rural areas, and certainly those in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, have to put up with a second class standard which is not acceptable to me or to the teacher in question. Far be it from me to question the suitability or otherwise of the other courses mentioned by the Minister.  It is on record that the INTO say they are not of the same calibre as the training available in <Col N="1837" /> St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  Does the Minister accept that?</P>

      <P>We are in the process of examining the delivery of services and the whole area of inservice training for teachers who have to come to Dublin. Changes in the delivery of services in the Department of Education are afoot.  I will certainly take on board the remarks made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this course be moved to, say, Cavan as a region for teachers in that general area.  Is the Minister aware that the teacher who brought this matter to light offered to pay for any extra expenses that would be incurred outside college training?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not only one teacher who brought this matter to my attention.  In responding I have to recognise there are problems even outside Cavan-Monaghan in the delivery of remedial teacher training.  The time is right to examine the matter in the light of the impending local education authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask two brief questions to give some focus to the review which the Minister mentioned?  Would the Minister agree that there is an equal need for remedial education throughout the country and that those needs are not concentrated in Dublin, as the courses tend to suggest?  Would she also agree that employment possibilities for teachers living outside the 30 mile radius are diminished because of the lack of opportunity to add to their qualifications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that whether a child lives in <Col N="1838" /> an urban or a rural area they will have reading problems.  I would remind the Deputy that in the past year we have been able to extend the remedial teaching service to rural areas.  In the past year 80 teachers were put into the service on a shared basis.  In some remote rural schools they now have a visiting teacher one day per week.  The fact that more teachers are seeking the remedial qualification is welcome.  While I was glad to introduce 80 teachers into the service this year, I continue to meet deputations who want the service extended to their schools.  There is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government for the provision of more remedial teachers which I hope to honour.  We need to encourage remedial teachers. Regarding the delivery of that inservice training, perhaps it is time a Dublin Minister would recognise that everything does not have to happen in Dublin and that that training can be delivered on a much better and probably financially sounder basis at a regional level.  That issue is under active consideration by me at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that £15 per teacher is paltry in terms of inservice training and that £50 per secondary teacher, of whom there are 20,000, is again paltry?  Can the Minister confirm whether the much heralded £39 million for inservice training promised in the National Development Plan will be delivered on once and for all to put in place a proper regional scheme for easy access for all teachers from the regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general acceptance throughout the teacher unions, the managerial bodies and parents that the funding of inservice training has not been adequate.  It certainly features in the application for Structural Funds.  I will be able to spell out in greater <Col N="1839" /> detail the spending of that money when the full extent of those programmes can be revealed.  In regard to a regional delivery of training, I have already said I agree with it.  A network of teacher centres is available throughout the country.  I have spoken at some length with second level teachers on this matter.  I was in Bantry with the chief executive officer and vocational education committee principals last weekend spelling out the money available.  If that money is to be well spent it should not be spent on travelling to the course but rather to increase the quality of the course.  I am committed to that course.  I am satisfied that funding is available and that it will be spent wisely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any restructuring of the remedial services available I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the vast imbalances in the regions.  For instance, I understand that the national average for those who have recourse to remedial education is 75 per cent to 76 per cent whereas in Donegal the figure is as low as 61 per cent or 62 per cent.  Will she bear that in mind when restructuring remedial education services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will, and that is why I referred earlier to the ability to provide a teacher one day a week.  The statistics show that 78 per cent of all pupils have access to remedial education but when the figures are broken down &mdash; usually by Deputy Higgins when the matter is raised &mdash; the number of schools where remedial services are provided is nothing like 78 per cent of the total as very small and isolated schools are also included.  It is a challenge to me to ensure that the remedial service is extended to all children who need it rather than to specific areas.  I am sure there is no difference in the level of need throughout the country and that the same number require remedial help in the Deputy's country as in any other county.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In an effort to ensure that rural schools are <Col N="1840" /> provided with remedial teachers will the Minister ensure that she does not stretch it so far that a great many schools end up having the services of a remedial teacher for one day?  While I accept it is better than none, rural schools deserve a fair crack of the whip and a token service is not enough.</P>

      <P>In schools where no remedial service has been provided, the provision of remedial teachers for one day is a welcome change.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  It is the quality of the teaching time for individual pupils that should be measured rather than the hours and the dots or the map in the Minister's office.</P>

      <P>A review of special education needs has just come to my attention.  That report will be discussed on 6 December next by all those who made submissions.  That report contains suggestions on the delivery of the remedial service.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the report as I want to have dialogue with those who made submissions and those involved in the delivery of services on the ground &mdash; and the report refers to the large number of children in need of special education.</P>
      <P>Rather than establishing any norms and committing myself to something that may not be the answer to dealing with the problem, I will wait until I have dialogue with those who provide the service on the ground.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to leave of absence for primary school teachers.  The position is that paid leave of absence is sanctioned by my Department for primary teachers, subject to board of management approval, for a number of specific purposes.  These purposes do not at present include paid leave to attend their child's Confirmation.</P>
      <P>National teachers may qualify for extra personal vacation (EPV), by attending approved in-service training courses, which usually take place during the summer vacation.  Teachers may qualify for up to a maximum of five EPV days in any one year, the number of days being determined by the number of days' attendance at a course.  EPV earned by teachers must be taken during the school year following the course, otherwise it is forfeit.  The permission of the board of management is required before a teacher can take any of the EPV days earned. The EVP days may be taken as single days, or in any group of days subject to the maximum five days referred to previousyly.</P>
      <P>Secondary and Community and Comprehensive teachers are allowed up to five days' paid leave for personal reasons subject to the approval of the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers employed by vocational education committees may, in exceptional circumstances, be paid salary in respect of occasional brief absences owing to <Col N="1843" /> reasonable causes and subject to the approval of the committee and the sanction of the Minister.  Special leave of absence with pay is also allowed on marriage or on the death of a near relative or through illness.</P>

Does the Minister realise that a teacher who is a parent may attend the wedding of a near relative, the ordination of a relative, the funeral of another teacher, whom he or she may not know, attend the funeral of a member of the clergy, a person whom he or she may not know and a university conferring ceremony but not the Confirmation of his or her own child?  It is as good as a kick in the teeth when a parent is told he or she can take a day's holiday leave to attend the child's Confirmation and is not entitled to paid leave as in the other cases to which I referred.  This reflects very badly on how we value the occasion of a young person's Confirmation, as to the child this is the biggest occasion of his or her life.  Is the Minister prepared, as she indicated in response to previous questions, to initiate a review bearing in mind the continuous difficulties it causes?</P>

Generally the Minister is under pressure on the length of the school year.  It would cause more problems in the classroom to allow a teacher to attend a Confirmation in addition to the other leave that can be taken.  Parents might wish to attend on the occasion of Holy Communion as well as Confirmation but parents have at least two or three years' notice of such occasions, and depending on where your child goes to school you know exactly when the child will be confirmed.  There is anything up to two or three years' notice for both those occasions.  Parents know exactly when their children will be confirmed, having regard to what class <Col N="1844" /> they are in at school.  Given the fact that teachers have managed their leave through the courses done in the summer, I think it would be acceptable.  That is how teachers have attended religious ceremonies for children.  They plan in advance, notify the board of management and get the day off.  I would prefer not to shorten the school year. Indeed, the pressure at the next question Time may be from the other side of the House to lengthen the school year &mdash; although probably not from teachers.</P>

      <P>I was not suggesting a shortening of the school year and I am aware of the controversy surrounding it. I was asking for a review.  I take on board what Deputy Shatter says because I too am a representative from a minority religion.  I see the need for a certain amount of pluralism, but that is a bigger debate.  I was asking for this to be reviewed along with the other peripheral issues, particularly attendance at functions that do not bear any relation to the teacher who may be taking leave of absence.  As it seems timely, could these issues be considered in the light of the review to which the Minister has agreed for other issues?</P>

      <P>I am unsympathetic to the Deputy.  A variety of reasons for primary school teachers leave of absence is listed, but all that leave is subject to the approval of the board of management. Religious ceremonies of one kind or another do not come as a surprise to the family so I do not see the need to review this.  The leave days and summer courses available to teachers have served them well and I would like teachers to continue taking up summer courses because they have been a source of wonderful in-service training for teachers.</P>

      <P>All school furniture for national schools grant aided by my Department is designed and manufactured in Ireland in accordance with the relevant official British and Irish Standards.  These standards are determined by reference to extensive research and development on school furniture.  My Department is constantly monitoring these standards and will constantly update its specifications for school furniture in accordance with any new standards, including standards that might be set at European level.  My Department will be in consultation in the near future with the INTO to brief them on the latest position regarding the design and specification of school furniture.

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It has nothing to do with the problem I have raised.  The Minister's scriptwriter in the Department should be fired as this is the fifth effort to come out.  I am talking about the difficulty for children who have to lean over flat topped desks for 14 years as against the old style desk which had a slope of 23 degrees where the person could sit in beside it, sit up straight and <Col N="1846" /> write properly, so that lordosis would not occur and the spinal curve would be kept in the proper shape.  Will the Minister give a private reply to this question and tell whoever gave her that stupid answer for the fifth time to jump into the river? The matter is far too serious.  If this matter is taken seriously by the Department we would be effecting preventative medicine.  It has nothing to do with the standard of furniture.  It does not matter whether the legs on the desk are square, round or anything else, or whether it is good timber or bad timber.  I am talking about the top of the desk.  I am referring to a curve into which people can sit, as do architects.</P>

      <P>I apologise if the Deputy is hearing this answer for the fifth time, but it is the first time I have come to the House to give the answer.  The Department is not aware of research that shows that children are suffering because of the use of flat topped desks.  I am much more aware of the concern of parents at the weight of school bags which the children carry to school every day and how it affects their backs.  I am open to discussion on it.  With regard to the old style desks, the children sat before them for hours and were not allowed to move. There is much more movement in classrooms now.  I have not a closed mind on this; and if the Deputy, the teaching unions, parents or managements concerned would like to bring up the matter, the Department will review the furniture it recommends.  I have lists of technical requirements from which I will spare the Deputy, but if he feels that we could add something to the list I will be more than open to considering it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I asked the Minister's predecessor to get medical advice on this, because I have raised it on medical advice which I received when getting treatment for my back.  Two experts, one as late as a month ago, said that the fact that children are <Col N="1847" /> sitting wrongly in the early part of their lives will affect their backs later on.  I have already asked for a medical review by the Department, but I get the same answer about the standard of furniture, which has nothing to do with the issue. The furniture can be as light as the furniture I have used for 20 years, but the question is whether a desk is flat or curved.  This is a major problem for the welfare of our children.</P>

      <P>My Department is grant-aiding the refurbishment of a portion of the former Loreto school at Nutgrove Avenue to provide permanent accommodation for a south city school project. The need to resume usage of these premises for primary education arises because the previous buildings occupied by the south city project which is a fully recognised multi-denominatinal national school were burned down earlier this year.  Obviously this requirement was not anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that some <Col N="1848" /> local community groups are using part of the school premises with the permission of Dublin County Council.

Is she aware that undertakings were given to the boards of management and the teachers of the two amalgamated schools that the Loreto school premises would no longer be used as a school premises, that the Good Shepherd national school would cater for the catchment area and that the Loreto nuns were given undertakings by her Department that the premises would be used solely for community purposes?</P>

As I stated in answer to an earlier question we had a private school premises which was offered to a multi-denominational group whose school premises in Crumlin was burned out earlier in the year.  That group will not require the use of the entire building and the building has been the subject of much debate in the community. When the premises became available I was interested in housing a school group which required a school premises.  Many local groups are also using the premises and some refurbishment of the building is taking place. Officials in my office were in touch with members of Dublin County Council as late as this morning to ensure that use of the building will be available to the community involved.  A section of the premises will be used as a school during school hours and other sections of it will be open in the evenings and during weekends for use by the local community.</P>

Will she agree that there has been a serious breach of trust and faith with the boards of management and teachers of the Good Shepherd national school who agreed to an amalgamation?  Will she agree also that all the children currently attending the multi-denominational school come from the Crumlin and Drimnagh areas? They travel by bus to Churchtown and they all live outside the catchment area of the building in question.

The needs of the community are being met satisfactorily by Dublin County Council and I intend to ensure that community use of the building continues by allowing Dublin County Council use the premises.  In regard to the needs of the school, a protracted and heated discussion took place at a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs about the dire needs of the multi-denominational school because their premises was burned out.  At that time the pupils had to travel by bus a much greater distance from their community.  It was mutually agreed between the boards of management and the various parents' groups involved that the site in Nutgrove would be suitable for their needs and they are being facilitated.</P>

If the Minister believes that this proposal meets the needs of the people in Crumlin and Drimnagh, why has a new Crumlin multi-denominational group been established and published a statement in the newspapers stating that a multi-denominational school will be opened in Crumlin in September 1994 and that there is a waiting list of 66 children?</P>

      <P>To recap I complimented the Minister for listening to what we had to say and trying to meet the reservations expressed in regard to this provision under which a garda may enter a person's house, by force, if necessary, in order to apprehend him.  The Minister has altered the section considerably.  I am still concerned that this provision may be challenged in the Supreme Court but because of the way the Minister has framed the <Col N="1966" /> amendment this is unlikely.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their support for my new package of proposals dealing with the power of entry.  Deputy Doyle suggested that the proposals to limit the power of entry to make an arrest in a case of hot pursuit following a hit-and-run accident might be too restrictive. The Deputy mentioned that we should consider the possibility of allowing a garda to enter a person's home up to three hours after the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>The reason I decided to restrict the power was that I wanted to meet the concerns expressed on Committee Stage. This power is only operable and effective when a garda is in hot pursuit.  If a garda was to arrive at a suspect's home one hour after the incident occurred there would be grave doubts about the admissibility or value of a specimen taken subsequently. Perhaps my proposals are restrictive but, apart from those expressed by Deputy Doyle, no other concerns were expressed.  I have tried to meet the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify the position in regard to the judgment handed down recently by the Supreme Court.  Deputy Keogh was correct when she pointed out that this was related to the property of a third party.  In so far as the section authorises entry to property not owned or occupied by the person to be arrested the section merely sets out in statute law what has already been determined by the Supreme Court.  Arising from a case stated to the Supreme Court, the DPP <i>v.</i> Forbes involving an arrest for drink driving, the court decided in May 1993 that while the offence must be committed in a public place and provided a garda does not breach any constitutional or any other legal right of another the garda is entitled to go on to other property to effect an arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also raised the question of Garda liability.  Even though her amendment had been ruled out of order she very skilfully managed to raise this <Col N="1967" /> issue in the debate.  Members on all sides are used to exploiting these skills from time to time.  I therefore do not intend to be critical as I am sure, if one looks at the record, I could be accused of having done likewise at some stage.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Constabulary Act, 1802 is concerned with the execution of warrants.  That Act indemnifies or protects gardaí in circumstances where a garda makes an arrest on foot of a warrant, acting lawfully and in good faith, and where the warrant is subsequently found to be defective through no fault of the garda.  As regards the principle, I foresee serious difficulties. Every garda in discharging his or her duties must act in a reasonable manner and in accordance with the law.  If a civil action is taken against the garda the matter will be determined by the courts. When such cases arise I understand that it is common practice to join the State in the action.  It is a matter for determination in individual cases as to whether the State would meet the cost of an award made against an individual garda.  The Garda have nothing to fear provided they act in accordance with the law and act reasonably.  I would have serious concerns about a blanket indemnity.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Doyle spoke about gardaí who might be over zealous or have their minds set on a particular individual.  I am afraid that instead of helping the Garda on this occasion with her amendment she might exacerbate the problem.  One of the best checks on Garda abuses is that they must be accountable and responsible for their actions.  More gardaí might be over zealous if they knew there was automatic indemnity.</P>
    <P>From my point of view this debate has been satisfactory.  I have tabled an amendment which not only meets the concerns expressed on Committee Stage but which will ensure that there will be no sanctuary of a person involved in a hit-and-run accident.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 18, after &ldquo;relates&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the doctor is unwilling, on medical grounds, to take from the person or be provided by him with the specimen to which the requirement related&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the drink driving laws have for many years been the subject of legal challenges. Many of those challenges have been on procedural grounds.  A number of these challenges were related to the procedures governing the taking of blood or urine and the manner in which the requirement was <Col N="1969" /> made by the Garda.  The existing text of the Bill has dealt with most of the situations which can be exploited. However, on Committee Stage I pointed out that a further anomaly may still exist. Under the Bill as drafted where a person is asked to allow a designated doctor to take a specimen of blood and refuses permission, the Garda can then seek a specimen of urine.  However, where a person gives permission for blood to be taken and the doctor is subsequently unwilling on medical grounds to take the specimen of blood, the Garda cannot make an alternative request for a specimen of urine.  These amendments will deal with that specific situation and remove the potential for a successful legal challenge.</P>
    <P>The issue that gives rise to the need for this amendment has arisen in practice.  In that case the person opted for and agreed to provide blood, but then told the designated doctor that he was a haemophiliac. The doctor was unwilling to proceed to taking the blood sample. Although the circumstances of that case are most unusual, there could be other circumstances or medical conditions where the same difficulty would arise. There are safeguards in the Bill to protect people who genuinely cannot provide specimens and these are set out in section 23 of the Bill and are based on existing law as set out in the Road Traffic Act, 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We probably could have discussed my series of three amendments with these.  I see why the Minister feels it necessary to amend the Bill on Report Stage to ensure that a garda's attempt to pursue a prosecution is not frustrated on medical grounds.  I support these three amendments and do not think there is any need to waste any more time on them.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 18 in the name of Deputy Avril Doyle.  Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 are cognate.  It is suggested that we take amendments Nos. 18, 20 and 22 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall affect the right of any person to decide to give either a specimen of his blood or his urine.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation an individual who has been arrested on suspicion of breaching the drink driving laws has discretion to give either a blood or a urine sample while at the Garda station.  I ask the Minister to leave that discretion with the individual.  In the vast majority of cases this would present no difficulty at all.  Having considered the Minister's previous amendments, the case of a haemophiliac seems to be the only area of doubt.  However, as long as people co-operate by providing a sample of either blood or urine, that discretion should be left with the individual and I urge the Minister to incorporate that provision which is in the present law into this updating of the road traffic law and drink driving regulations generally.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Doyle.  I see the Minister's point that people will seek loopholes in the law and possibly abuse the facility, but I think it desirable that the person being accused should have the choice of whether to provide a blood or urine specimen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not want to be unreasonable and I would like to accommodate Deputy Doyle's view if I can.  The effect of her amendment is to <Col N="1971" /> transfer back to the arrested person the choice in regard to the taking of a specimen. Bearing in mind the previous amendment, I will look at this again to see if I can achieve a result whereby a prosecution could be effected and would not be frustrated in the way that has been experienced up to now.  I will do that between now and the debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his sympathetic response.  I trust that between himself and his advisers he will find the right formula of words before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I think it is important that in the case of the average person who is prepared to co-operate no additional dissension is created by insistence on taking a blood specimen, for example, when the person will freely provide a urine specimen.  Notwithstanding the possible complications the Minister points out and in regard to which his previous amendments were introduced, the average compliant citizen should be looked after in this regard.  I have a feeling that an accommodation of words between the Minister's last set of amendments and my set of amendments could be reached whereby if there was any question of a blood test being ruled out for medical reasons, no choice should exist and a urine specimen could be demanded.  Where there is no medical problem in relation to a blood test, the choice could be left to the individual.  I trust the Minister will be able to find the right formula of words.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Keogh raised a valid point in regard to detention of a person under 18 years of age and expressed reservations that such a person could be held in custody without a relative or other responsible person being made aware of the detention.  The section as drafted contains a provision to protect the rights of an arrested person, including the right to privacy.  A person arrested for a drink driving offence may not wish any person to be told of their arrest and the section, as drafted, safeguards that right.  However, I agree that in the unfortunate circumstances where a person under 18 years is arrested for a drink driving offence and is so intoxicated as to constitute a threat to himself or others, a parent or other relative should be told automatically and the young person should be automatically released into the custody of the parent or other responsible person.  These amendments introduce a modifying procedure on those lines and have the same effect as Deputy Keogh's amendment No. 25.</P>

      <P>When a person complies with a Garda request to produce a driving licence at a specified Garda station within ten days a certificate stating the request has been complied with should be given to the person concerned.  That point has been brought to my attention by members of the legal profession who highlighted many cases that ended in court because of a misunderstanding in that regard. There is a provision in the Bill that certification should be provided by a member in charge in cases where the licence is not produced within the required time limit but the converse position is not provided for.  Those who comply with the law should be given a certificate verifying that fact to avoid unwarranted court proceedings or a court case.  Common sense should prevail to ensure that a person who has not committed an offence is not subsequently accused in the wrong.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the provisions of the amendment.  It proposes a phasing of penalties in respect of drink driving offences depending on the extent of the breach of the law.  It proposes that those caught driving with a blood alcohol level of 400 to 500 milligrammes per millilitre &mdash; those whom Deputy Upton described earlier as being at the anaesthetic stage &mdash; would not have the same penalty imposed on them as someone who may have a blood level of 85 milligrammes per millilitre and be in breach of the law following the enactment of this Bill.  Today a blood alcohol level of 85 to 90 milligrammes per millilitre is legal, but when this legislation is passed it will be illegal. The full force of the law will be applied, namely mandatory disqualification from driving and sentencing.  Discretion has been removed from the Judiciary in this <Col N="1978" /> area.  If the Minister cannot be persuaded to accept changes in respect of the principle of removing discretion from the Judiciary, those with a blood alcohol level of 85 milligrammes per millilitre should be distinguished from the person who has consumed eight to ten pints or those who have a blood alcohol level of 400 to 500 milligrammes per millilitre of alcohol and who are so intoxicated as to be lethal behind the wheel of a car.  When this Bill is enacted if I consume two glasses of wine, technically I could be over the limit, although no one suggests I would be a serious danger to myself or any road user.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes penalties in respect of first and subsequent offences. There is a major difference between the person whose blood alcohol level exceeds 85 milligrammes per millilitre and who at present is legally under the limit and the person whose blood alochol level exceeds 200 to 400 milligrammes per millilitre. The introduction of mandatory penalties and the lack of discretion by the Judiciary has given rise to much disquiet.  A person whose blood alcohol level exceeds 85 milligrammes per millilitre cannot be treated as a criminal or in the same way as the person who widely exceeds the legal permitted level.  I would be uncomfortable if the mandatory penalties were being introduced leaving no discretion to the Judiciary.  However, if there is mandatory sentencing and penalties, the wide variation in breaches of the law, when this Bill is enacted, must be recognised. The legal blood alcohol level today could disqualify a person from driving for two years when this Bill is enacted.  The Bill proposes a major change but it does not provide for reality.  I support unequivocally the reduction of the blood alcohol level from 100 to 80 milligrammes per millilitre.  However, I am concerned about the person whose blood alcohol level may be 80 to 100 miligrammes per millilitre who could be pulled in for drink driving and technically in breach of the law but whom a layperson would regard as being stone cold sober having consumed less than two pints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí will be less likely to rigorously <Col N="1979" /> implement the law if people are only marginally over the limit, if their blood alcohol level is within the 80 to 100 milligrammes per millilitre threshold. They will recognise that, in layperson's terms, the person is sober and totally in control and in such circumstances they are unlikely to enforce the law even if the person is technically in breach of the regulation because of the extent of the mandatory penalty that will be imposed when this Bill is enacted.  There might be a greater emphasis placed on cleaning up the act in terms of drink driving if minor breaches of the law in respect of the present permitted blood alcohol limit were treated differently from excessive breaches.</P>
    <P>I am making the case for a sliding scale of mandatory penalties and mandatory disqualifications on the assumption that the Minister is not prepared to change his mind in relation to removing all discretion from the Judiciary.  That is a matter for a later debate but it is one about which I am very uncomfortable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in the principle behind this amendment.  It goes back to the old saying: the punishment should fit the crime.  There is no question but that blood alcohol levels of 80 milligrammes create a much different effect from blood alcohol levels in excess of 400 milligrammes.  At such a high level one would be almost comatose, whereas at a level of 80 milligrammes the person may simply suffer from a mild degree of incoordination. It is very unfair that a person with a blood alcohol level of 80 milligrammes should receive the same punishment as a person with an extremely high blood alcohol level and the Minister should consider this matter.  There is no doubt that there is a much lesser risk to the public from a person driving a car with a low blood alcohol level than from a driver who is out of his mind with drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle behind this amendment should be considered with a view to accommodating the general point made, particularly in the context of mandatory sentencing.  If one were to be perverse <Col N="1980" /> one could make the point that if a person is going to drive his car when drunk he might as well indulge himself.  I am not suggesting that people would do that, but that perverse logic could be applied to the present legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms. Keogh Ms. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much sympathy for this amendment.  I agree with the previous speakers that a sliding scale should be considered in terms of the punishment appropriate to the crime committed.  For example, if a person is just over the required limit they should not have to endure the same punishment as a person who is considerably over the limit and is obviously a danger to themselves and everybody else.  If a person drives a car having consumed seven or eight pints he should be severely punished whereas, notwithstanding the fact that one should no drink and drive, in the case of a person who is slightly over the limit there should be a lesser penalty.  Some discretion should be allowed to the Judiciary in that respect.</P>

      <P>From listening to the Minister on Committee Stage it is quite obvious that he will insist on mandatory sentencing and will not allow discretion. I accept that the Minister has reasons for this and I understand some of them.  This amendment should be seriously considered by the Minister.  Nobody in this House tolerates drink driving, but a distinction should be made between the driver who has consumed between 80 and 100 milligrammes of alcohol and the driver who has consumed 400 milligrammes. Under the existing law a person who has consumed between 80 and 100 milligrammes is legitimately entitled to drive and everybody assumes that person is capable of driving. However, that position is being changed under this Bill.  As Deputies Doyle and Keogh have said, a person may drive, not realising he or she has consumed in excess of the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider this amendment.  In the heel of the hunt it is enforcement of the existing law that is important.  It would be more acceptable <Col N="1981" /> to ensure that the present law is strictly enforced than to implement a new Bill, with all its excellent measures, without giving the Garda the necessary resources to enforce it.  The Minister should ensure that the legislation is enforced.  If this amendment is accepted it would ensure equity and people would respond better to the law.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this matter.  I suspect he will not change the position in regard to mandatory sentencing and I accept he has reasons for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate on this amendment many references have been made to the fact that I am not going to change my view on mandatory sentencing.  From that one might form the view that I am introducing mandatory sentencing, but of course it has been part and parcel of our laws for 30 years and I am not introducing a new concept.  However, I understand the thrust of Deputy Doyle's amendment and the supporting contributions made by Deputies Nealon, Keogh and Upton. When preparing the Bill I carefully considered the introduction of a graduated penalty system, which no doubt would ensure greater equity.  However, bearing in mind that the risk of accident occurring in the case of consumption of 150 to 200 milligrammes of alcohol is 25 times that in the case of zero level of alcohol, I do not favour such a system.  The risk of accident is phenomenal at much lower levels than those prescribed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I reject the concept proposed in the amendment, because graduated penalties would inevitably result in legal challenges to the precision of the analysis of specimens.  For instance, if a driver with an alcohol level of 101 milligrammes faced a greater penalty than a driver with a reading of 100 milligrammes that would invite legal challenges to the accuracy of the results in terms of the effect of the difference, which in this case would be minuscule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the mandatory disqualification element, the courts have full discretion to decide appropriate penalties. <Col N="1982" /> They decide the level of fines to be imposed, whether a term of imprisonment is appropriate and they can impose a longer disqualification where circumstances warrant a more severe penalty.  Notwithstanding careful examination of what is involved here, the real risk of a successful legal challenge on the basis of the precision of the results of analysis requires me to oppose setting different automatic penalties for different alcohol levels.  In the final analysis I had to be realistic, in closing loopholes, I did not want to invite legal challenge.</P>
    <P>It is with some regret that I have not found it possible to accept the thrust of the Deputy's amendment.  If we were to go down the road proposed by the Deputy we would give rise to the possibility of legal challenge and open up many of the loopholes we have sought to close.  In view of the number of amendments accepted up to now, Deputy Doyle must have thought she was on roller skates, so to speak, in regard to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment; it deals with the areas of greatest concern in the legislation.  The graduated level of penalties proposed by me would be open to change; the cut-off point between one level and another will not be sacrosanct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue about which I am most concerned is the mandatory disqualification of people with 80-100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, a level which has been accepted as perfectly safe for driving purposes for many years.  The Minister said that after serious consideration he came down against introducing a graduated level of penalties on the basis of the risk of legal challenges as to the accuracy of the testing system.  I put it to the Minister that the same risk of legal challenge will still exist from people who have 81, 82 or 83 milligrammes of <Col N="1983" /> alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  If the Minister provided for a shorter period of mandatory disqualification for such people all he would be doing is removing the risk of legal challenge from them. Even under the Minister's proposals there will still be a risk of legal challenge.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was prepared to adopt a two-tier approach to mandatory disqualification, I think many legal people would be much happier with what he is trying to achieve and there would be a greater incentive to enforce the law.  In general the Garda adopt a more sympathetic approach to people who commit minor breaches of the law; human nature being what it is, they do not pursue them as vigorously a they pursue people who commit more serious breaches of the law. If the Minister really wants to deal with this problem he should ensure that the penalty fits the crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that he did not introduce mandatory disqualification. I accept that point; but the nearer we get to a zero level of alcohol for motorists, the greater the need for equity in terms of the way in which the penalty fits the crime.  Motorists who have 150, 200 or 300 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood are committing serious breaches of the law and should be put off the road for a number of years.  Under the Bill it will be illegal for a person with 81 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood to drive.  If the Minister will not accept the graduated level of penalties and mandatory <Col N="1984" /> disqualification periods proposed in my amendment, I urge him to at least provide for a two-tier system of mandatory disqualification.  There should be a shorter period of mandatory disqualification for people with 80-100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood and a longer period of mandatory disqualification for people with more than 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to meet the Minister half way on this issue.  My amendment contains other proposals.  By accepting that part of my amendment all the Minister will be doing is moving the greater risk of legal challenge from people with 80 milligrammes of alcohol to those with 100 milligrammes of alcohol.  As I said, the risk of legal challenge still exists under the legislation as it stands.  Even though there is widespread support for what the Minister is seeking to do, some people are seriously concerned about having the same mandatory disqualification periods for people who commit major and minor breaches of the law.  We should seek to ensure that the law is enforced, even at the lower limits, by endeavouring to make the punishment fit the crime, which it does not at present. The mandatory disqualification periods proposed in the Bill for minor breaches of the law are draconian.  I ask the Minister to at least consider providing for a two-tier system of disqualification, if he will not accept the four-tier system proposed in my amendment.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 30 in the name of Deputy Avril Doyle.  I observe that amendment No. 33 is related.  Therefore, I suggest that, if acceptable, we discuss amendments Nos. 30 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The period of disqualification specified in a consequential disqualification order may, where the person to whom the order relates is convicted of an offence under&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that amendment No. 30 could have been coupled with <Col N="1987" /> amendment No. 29, that it would have been consequential on the change there. However, it does not make any difference.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I can speak on amendment No. 33 first, because it contains a principle which permeates all of this section on mandatory disqualification periods, and say that my concern is about the total removal of any discretion from the Judiciary in these cases.  We have for some time accepted mandatory penalties for drunk driving offences.  Even occasionally the Judiciary, if you like, has expressed its concern at the lack of any discretion left to it when it considered there were extenuating circumstances, hard as that may be to believe when one is talking about drink driving.  But I think we all accept that a drunk person behind the wheel of a car is a lethal person to be driving on the road.  After all, the greatest civil liberty is that to life.  Therefore, if you like, one must sacrifice any indulgence towards civil liberties when one must protect life. Basically it was on that concept that mandatory sentences and penalties were originally introduced for drunk driving.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to re-examine the extension of mandatory penalties and mandatory disqualification contained in the Bill before us today.  I would contend that the extension of those proposals means, effectively, we are stating that everyone is a joyrider.  I know the whole area of joyriding and the lethal consequences of a lot of joyriding need to be attended to.  The provision that one must have a licence in a car at all times and/or produce it within ten days was inserted to give the Garda some powers to stop a suspected joyrider, ask them to identify themselves, and, if they do not have a licence, the Garda can then apprehend and the rigours of the law will follow suit.  I am making no case to protect the joyrider at all.  In fact, any powers the Minister may need in order to protect the public from that heinous type of activity will be given him as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>But I do not support the concept that everyone involved in a traffic accident, <Col N="1988" /> or who technically contravenes the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, is necessarily the joyrider type.  Through an aberration &mdash; perhaps through being slightly tired, distracted by a child in the back of a car, hearing some bad news on the radio or whatever &mdash; a normal, compliant citizen can, once off, breach the law and be involved in an accident. Technically, it could be a dangerous driving offence for which they would be booked as well and not just careless driving. They could have driven dangerously in that one off incident.  The Minister must allow the Judiciary discretion in this area.  That is why my amendment suggests changing the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Interestingly, in the case of most Bills we amend we ask the Minister to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because our difficulty is to get a Minister to be absolute and precise in many cases. Yet in this case, when he is being absolute in his requirement, making his requirement mandatory, I am asking him to insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in relation to convictions under the provisions of section 20 (5).</P>
    <P>The determination as to what constitutes dangerous driving tends to be arbitrary, notwithstanding statutory prescription as to what constitutes dangerous driving.  Unfortunately, certain cases which would be classed as the more minor elements of dangerous driving rather than, say, malicious dangerous driving, can result in death or serious bodily harm to other persons as well.  Therefore, there is a difference between malicious dangerous driving and just a once-off aberration, or a minor element of dangerous driving, even though the effect of both can be the same.  In any case, those who have been involved in a minor element, or who have had an aberration that caused dangerous driving, will have the matter on their conscience for the remainder of their lives.  Therefore, in one sense they will have a mandatory penalty in that they will have to live with the consequences of their aberration or action.  They will have that sentence hanging over them and no court of law is needed to impose that on them.  The <Col N="1989" /> imposition of such mandatory disqualification on top of their already difficult position all too often can have the effect of seriously disrupting and, in certain instances, destroying the lives of the second family and not merely the family of those who have been seriously injured or killed.</P>
    <P>Such mitigating factors, no matter how eloquently presented to a court, finds the trial judge with his or her hands tied by legislation, even though he or she may well have been favourably disposed to deal with the case by way of an alternative penalty.</P>
    <P>It is a well recongised maxim that the punishment must fit the crime.  Malicious dangerous driving deserves the type of penalties the Minister is suggesting here. No one would question that.  But a once-off aberration or more minor elements of dangerous driving, which tragically can result in the same consequences, deserve some discretion in the way they are handled when they reach the court.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to leave with our Judiciary the discretion necessary in these cases.  If we appoint judges, if we consider them to be the proper people to determine penalties to be imposed, dependent on the facts of each individual case before them, we must trust them and allow them to have that discretion.  I urge the Minister to concede the point I make.</P>

      <P>The effect of Deputy Doyle's amendments would be to make consequential disqualifications permissive rather than mandatory.  We discussed this at length on Committee Stage when I outlined the reasons I could not agree with a change in that area.  There are two specific aspects of this which need to be addressed.  The first is the principle of mandatory disqualification.  The second main point is the offence to which it should relate.  I want to reiterate that I am not introducing a new concept into Irish law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the principle of consequential disqualification, that a court must on conviction of specified offences impose a minimum period of disqualification from holding a driving licence, has applied since 1933.  That principle rests on two bases.  Disqualification is an extremely effective deterrent, is feared more than a fine and the serious nature of certain offences makes it necessary to provide for mandatory sanctions. The bottom line is that a procedure on these lines is necessary.  The knowledge that certain offences will result in an automatic loss of a driving licence is the most effective deterrent.  In an attitudinal survey carried out in 1991 on behalf of my Department 39 per cent of those surveyed indicated that mandatory disqualification is the most significant deterrent which influences their driving behaviour.  The specific offences are set out in section 26 and in the Second Schedule. A mandatory disqualification has applied to most of these since 1961.  The new offences that attract mandatory disqualification are first convictions for dangerous driving and uninsured driving. I take it there is no argument about the second.  The addition of these two offences to the list was recommended by the inter-ministerial group.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the main objection was the application of mandatory disqualification to dangerous driving. Deputy Doyle referred them to technical transgressions and spoke of cases where there might only be a minor element of dangerous driving.  The Deputy made the same type of argument today.  My view on this is clear.  I consider dangerous driving to be a serious offence and one which warrants severe penalties upon conviction. If there is a doubt about the gravity of the offence in individual cases, the courts will decide if a conviction is warranted or if the individual should be found guilty of a lesser offence of careless driving.  As Deputy Doyle is aware that happens in numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore in a separate amendment proposed to increase the maximum penalty for dangerous driving.  Unfortunately, I have no scope to increase the <Col N="1991" /> maximum fine or term of imprisonment. To do so could take the offence out of the remit of the District Court.  The only scope I have is in the area of disqualification and I have acted accordingly. The administration of justice is a matter for the courts and, accordingly, the Oireachtas hesitates to prescribe penalties such as fines and imprisonment. Disqualification is, however, a separate category.  Disqualification is not regarded by the courts as a penalty but as a regulation of the exercise of its statutory right in the interests of public order and safety. The concept has been challenged in the Supreme Court and was upheld in practice.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, and again this afternoon, many references were made to enforcement.  While the main discussion is about drink driving most of us realise that more accidents are caused by dangerous driving than those which are drink related.  Every day we hear of court decisions relating to traffic and driving offences arising out of dangerous driving, some of which I outlined to the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the case of a minor transgression Deputy Doyle is trying to ensure that we do not have an automatic mandatory disqualification.  In the case of dangerous driving the mandatory disqualification is the best type of deterrent and it has been in place for a long time.  Two new offences are being added on the recommendation of an inter-ministerial group which was chaired by the former Leader of the Progressive Democrats Party. There was very wide agreement in that committee of the need to strengthen the law in this area.  I have heard no argument which would encourage me to deviate from what we want to achieve in this area.  Deputy Doyle knows as well as I that we are entering a really dangerous area &mdash; I am not saying she has done this deliberately &mdash; if we play down dangerous driving bearing in mind the speed at which some road users drive today and the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it <Col N="1992" /> clear, lest the Minister's remarks suggest otherwise, that in no way am I playing down the seriousness of dangerous driving. Changing the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves discretion to the Judiciary to treat in the harshest way a person who is charged with dangerous driving.  In fact all the penalties suggested in this legislation could be applied rigorously by the judge concerned.  I am talking about malicious dangerous driving.  I made some effort to distinguish between the different categories of dangerous driving. I am not a legal person but I know that the Judiciary feel there are circumstances sometimes which should be treated differently, depending on the evidence, and that some discretion should be left to it as to how these cases are treated. That does not mean that maximum penalties would not apply in the cases to which the Minister alluded, certainly to all cases of malicious dangerous driving.</P>
      <P>Drunk driving is only a part of the problem in relation to accidents and the carnage on our roads.  It has been suggested that about one-third of road fatalities involve drink driving and it has also been suggested that we do not have statistics. I offered the Minister the opportunity earlier to put on record the reasons for the reduction in blood alcohol levels. The Minister did not give those reasons at any length.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, some time ago the Dublin city coroner carried out a survey fo fatalities on our roads.  According to the survey more than one-third of those killed on our roads had drink taken. The other two-thirds of fatalities must be as a result of dangerous or careless driving and also some genuine accidents; human error always plays its part.  I would not play down the seriousness of malicious, deliberate dangerous driving, people who drive at excessively high speeds through urban areas and, indeed, on the open road if as a result of driving at that speed they cause serious injury to a person or a fatality.  Any judge would know how to handle such a case and would not need to be mandated on what to do.  Once we set maximum limits the judge knows he can apply them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> I am concerned not about the joyrider, the malicious dangerous driver, the excessive speeder or, as Deputy Gilmore said, the super stud trying to impress his girlfriend by driving at 80, 90 and 100 miles per hour on our national primary roads and causing carnage.  They can be dealt with by the full rigours of the law and I make no pretence to defend them. However, occasionally, through an aberration or a once-off distraction a normally compliant person who always observes the law can be involved in an accident that results in serious injury or a fatality. Technically that person could have breached the law by crossing a continuous white line due to being momentarily distracted. The Judiciary has no discretion in such cases.  The person is already sentenced by the tragic loss of life or serious injury caused.  That person would have that accident on their conscience for the rest of their lives.  Now it is intended to put him or her off the road with the possible loss of a job and a family suffering as a result.  We should leave the discretion to the Judiciary in these cases and, at the same time provide severe penalties which can be applied to the malicous dangerous driver who cause serious injury or a fatality.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention specifically the application of this section to a person driving without insurance.  Unfortunately, such cases are not always clear cut.  The person who has time and again been caught driving without insurance cover and who blatantly disregards the law should be put off the road and disqualified. I have my doubts as to whether the punishment should be mandatory in the area of no insurance.  Insurance cover may genuinely be missed for one month and technically, the person would be in breach of the law but people always backdate their car insurance.</P>
    <P>If you drive without insurance in the second month is it mandatory for the Judiciary to put you off the road for the year?  Will you be treated in the same way as the chronic offender who blatantly abuses the law and has no intention of insuring his car?  We need to be very sure of what we are doing.  There are <Col N="1994" /> circumstances where genuine mistakes can occur, for example, a spouse may genuinely believe that the insurance is in order when it is not.  Is it reasonable to impose mandatory disqualification in that case?  I am not sure because the spouse could have believed that the insurance was in place or an insurance broker may have been at fault in having given false information.  The imposition of disqualification in such circumstances may result in the loss of a job where driving is paramount causing severe hardship for the individual's family.  These factors have always been taken into consideration by a court when imposing a penalty and such discretion should not be removed.</P>
    <P>I support the thrust of the Bill and I will support the Minister when we deal with the impounding of uninsured vehicles provided he can give an adequate explanation on how we decide the car is uninsured.  Will the driver have to prove that he or she is covered to drive a particular car?  However, we will come to that later.  I support the Minister's moves in relation to uninsured vehicles but we need discretion in the application of section 56 which deals with uninsured cars.  While having maximum penalties for the chronic offender who abuses the law and intends to continue to abuse it, I ask the Minister to leave discretion with the judge where, in genuine circumstances, a mistake has been made concerning another wise compliant individual.</P>

      <P>In page 22, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.  &mdash; Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act and the Principal Act, the Minister shall by regulation introduce a system whereby persons who commit minor offences shall have certain points recorded against them and where such points exceeds a specified number such person shall have their driving licence endorsed accordingly and where such number of endorsements exceeds a specified number, a court may make an order declaring such person to be disqualified from holding a driving licence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I moved a similar amendment on Committee Stage but made little progress in convincing the Minister to support the case.  Will the Minister accept this amendment notwithstanding the logistical difficulties according to the Minister's response on Committee Stage in terms of having a data bank of information on this entire area?  Will he make provision to introduce a points system, for noting transgression on the licence for minor transgressions of the law, leading to disqualification when one reaches a points threshold to be determined by the Minister? If this could be included in the Bill, the Minister would be in a position to decide the commencement date when we have the appropriate computed software and a national electronic communications system in place and I would be <Col N="1996" /> satisfied.  There are many minor transgressions of the law that could be adequately be dealt with by a points system, it would save a great deal of time and energy and stop minor offences cluttering up our courts.  This would be a very effective way of penalising people. We are not removing the final penalties in the case of serious ongoing transgressions as when the points threshold, as determined by the Minister, is reached the person could face mandatory disqualification. This system has worked very effectively in other jurisdictions and I ask the Minister to use this legislation to introduce such a system.  The commencement date could be determined some time in the future.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I understood that the Minister was not opposed in principle to this amendment but had difficulty with its practical elements.  I support Deputy Doyle's amendment.  On Committee Stage I tried to get leeway in regard to the type of punishment people would have to undergo and indeed I supported Deputy Doyle's amendment.  Even if the Minister has reservations about the practicalities of this measure will he indicate how such a system may be introduced in the future? Does he see this being introduced in the short term?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the system that applies in the UK whereby penalty points are applied on conviction for certain road traffic offences leading to endorsement of disqualification when a certain number of points has been accumulated.  On Committee Stage I said I appreciated the merits of that type of system and indeed the reasons for proposing the amendment but that I was not in a position to agree to it.  The operation of a penalty points system is simply not possible under our existing driver licensing arrangements.  Such a system could only operate with a centralised computerised driving licensing record and we do not have such a system in place.  The Finance Act, 1993 provided a statutory basis for such a system and work has <Col N="1997" /> commenced on developing it.  The project will be implemented over a five-year period.  We will not have a central record for approximately another four or five years and, therefore, the introduction of a penalty points systems, which of itself is very complex, needs to be examined in greater detail.  To do so knowing it will take a number of years to implement is putting the horse before the cart because it requires to be teased out.  I do not think this could be operated on the basis of regulations.  Deputy Doyle accused me on many occasions of trying to use regulations but they would not be appropriate in this case, as I would like the House to have the opportunity in primary legislation to tease out the best way to approach the detailed provisions required in legislation of this kind.  I intend to monitor the systems operating in other places and at the appropriate time, bearing in mind the introduction of the system to put this in place, to come back to the House with the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of a difference of principle but the necessity to let the House know that I do not have the instruments to put in place what is being recommended here.</P>

I take the Minister's point and if there is an opportunity to discuss the introduction of a penalty points system by way of primary legislation, I think we would all avail of it and if we need a centralised computerised driving licence recording system, we cannot proceed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35.</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 44, to delete &ldquo;70&rdquo; and substitute &rdquo;60&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I moved this amendment without success on Committee Stage.  I am moving it now because I firmly believe that the slogan &ldquo;speed kills&rdquo; is true and it seems something of a contradiction to put up that slogan encouraging people to drive slowly and then to extend permission on motorways to drive at 70 miles per hour. Perhaps if the Minister combined this amendment with amendment No. 36 he could substitute &ldquo;70 kilometres per hour&rdquo; and that would get around both mine and Deputy Doyle's amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly said that 80 per cent of accidents are caused by a combination of speed and drink.  In the US it has been proved that traffic accidents are reduced proportionately as speed limits are reduced.  On Committee Stage the Minister said that our motorways are dedicated routes and so on and that in terms of our experience and international experience we could allow such a speed limit.  I have some knowledge of driving in the US and the speed limit on the vast majority of interstate routes is 55 miles per hour.  That is because they accept that a lower speed contributes to reduced danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motorway on which I travel most is the Bray-Shankill bypass.  There is an enormous volume of traffic on that road throughout the day and not only at rush hours.  People travel at speeds of well over 70 miles per hour, up to 80 miles per hour or 90 miles per hour.  Apart from the speed there is grave danger in travelling from a dual carriageway to a motorway where there are differences in the speed limits.  A pet hate of mine is where one travels from motorway to dual carriageway and then coming towards a town one suddenly comes upon a 30 mph sign when one is cruising at a steady 50 or 60 miles per hour.  One speed limit on motorways and dual carriageways would be far safer.  I do not accept that because <Col N="1999" /> motorways are of a better standard it necessitates allowing a higher speed limit.  Will the Minister reconsider this amendment now, having regard to the fact that he has been reasonably open in relation to some of the amendments tabled today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with this amendment.  A speed of 70 mph on a motorway is safe in certain circumstances. In addition to the speed limit there is the broad obligation on people driving motor cars to drive them safely at a speed at which they can control them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh knows that I am all heart and am trying to help in any way I can and that I give in perhaps in circumstances where I should not.  I am sure the Deputy is not implying that the speeds on American highways are being adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The speed limits are not adhered to, from what I know.  Our 70 mile limit applies to motorways, which are designed to cater for speeds of that kind.  Any of these upper limits is the maximum speed taking into account the prevailing conditions on motorways.  The motorways are different from other roads in that there is limited access and there are no crossings.  It is perfectly safe in circumstances like that to drive at 70 miles per hour and it is infinitely safer than to drive at half that speed on another road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not change existing speed limits.  The provisions relating to speed limits deal with the structure and procedures for applying speed limits.  While section 31 introduces the concept of a separate statutory speed limit for motorways, the limit of 70 miles per hour set out in the section is the existing speed limit which applies to sections of the motorway already constructed and in use.  I made a number of changes in 1992 and am satisfied <Col N="2000" /> that on balance, on the information available, there is no reason for making any purposeful change at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the Minister's answer because it is much the same as the answer given the last time. We do not have a motorway stretching from Cork to Belfast or from Dublin to Galway with various towns being bypassed. We have a number of sections of motorway which in most cases lead onto a dual carriageway or onto a minor road. It is all very well to say that 70 mph is acceptable on a motorway which runs for 100 miles or more, but our stretches of motorway are criss-crossed and divided up.  The longest stretch of motorway we have is about 20 miles, so people zoom up to the 70 mph speed limit or more and then have to break at the end of it. Drivers are stopping and starting and it is not safe.  There should be some sort of a happy medium in this.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to have one speed limit on dual carriageways and motorways. I do not know if that would meet the bill.  Our motorways in the main are bypasses.  They are not long motorways on which people can travel at a steady speed for many miles.  I realise the Minister is not going to accept my argument and, even though he says he is all heart, he has hardened his heart to me in regard to this amendment.</P>

    <P>That is a genuine unsolicited letter I received from a person in County Limerick. If the Minister wishes I will show it to him later.  It explains my sentiments in this regard.  Can we not get our act together on this matter?  At present our distance signs are in one denomination and our speed signs in another.  As natives we have got used to the confusion between some signs displaying kilometres and others displaying miles, but a simple effort would quickly put us in line with other countries.  The Minister should <Col N="2002" /> change all road signs to kilometres.  That would make far more sense and I urge him to do so as soon as possible.

I accept that there will <Col N="2004" /> have to be a reasonable phasing-in period, but it would be appreciated if the Minister indicated his willingness to make the change over, say, a three year period.  Our young people do not understand the confusion because they were educated in the metric system and visitors, particularly those from the Continent, do not understand our system.

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;36. &mdash; It shall be compulsory for all persons to wear helmets when cycling or horseriding.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment which has been altered slightly since Committee Stage.  I strongly believe that young people in particular should wear protective head gear when cycling on public roads.  What they choose to do in their own back garden or <Col N="2005" /> in a field is their own business and it is up to their parents to ensure they are safe if they are minors.  The days of the High Nellie are almost gone.  We now have modern, high-tech bicycles which have many gears and all sorts of gadgets. Youngsters on bicycles today travel at higher speeds than cars travelled 30 years ago and on national primary routes.  They put themselves in serious danger if they make an error of judgment or if there is an accident.</P>
    <P>The case has been well documented to the Minister by many organisations, including professional groups and youth clubs.  When I raised the matter on Committee Stage some of my colleagues felt that it should be compulsory for all citizens, not just young people, to wear a helmet when cycling.  I have no difficulty with that concept.  However I initially baulked at the idea of dictating to adults what they should do as they should be able to make up their own minds.  It was a fair point and I took their views into account before retabling the amendment for Report Stage.  I, therefore, specifically ask the Minister to make it compulsory for all persons to wear a helmet when cycling or horseriding.</P>
    <P>At present there is a Bill on the Order Paper in the House of Commons &mdash; I am not sure whether it is at First or Second Stage &mdash; which would make it compulsory to wear a helmet when horseriding on a public road.  In all modern developed countries it is now compulsory to wear protective head gear on public roads in respect of transport of all kinds. Insurance companies, doctors and other medical people who have to sort out the mess after accidents &mdash; and most parents whose children use bicycles to get to school or for enjoyment &mdash; would support this concept.</P>
    <P>Parents need to be able to invoke the law to ensure that their children comply because for many groups of young people it is not fashionable or the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to wear a helmet.  Unless parents can invoke the law or threaten that they will incur the wrath of the local gardaí &mdash; this was the position when I was young &mdash; many young people will not wear a helmet.  I, <Col N="2006" /> therefore, ask the Minister to accept the amendment to protect those who use our public roads on horseback and bicyles.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well ask what penalty should be imposed, particularly on young people, for transgressions if this is made law.  I leave that matter to him and the Minister for Justice but I suggest we could introduce a system of on-the-spot fines whereby parents would have to cough up within ten days at the local Garda station if a minor transgresses the law.  This might prove effective and the fine could be as low as £20 &mdash; the price of a helmet.  The Minister could also specify a commencement date six months from now to allow young people earn sufficient pocket money to buy a helmet. Indeed, they could insist that they be given a bicycle helmet as a Christmas present.  As more lives will be lost if we are tardy people should not be given too much time to acquire helmets.</P>
    <P>Those who ride horses are already obliged by law to wear helmets in certain circumstances.  However they do not always do so.  It would be a very small step to bring them all into line.  Again, what they do on private property or in their own fields is their own business; it is not our intention to interfere with them.  As I said, we now have high-tech bicyles which allow young people to travel at high speeds.  Combined with the increase in traffic our roads are now more perilous for the cyclist in the absence of bicyle lanes.  This applies equally to the horserider.  There has been a huge increase in the number of people who ride horses both professionally and for recreational purposes, in the number of people who own horses and in the number of people who attend riding schools and clubs which use the public roads.  In this regard anyone who rides out with a riding club should be made wear a hard that.  We also need to ensure that clubs can invoke the law.</P>
    <P>It should also be specified that the helmet should not just be placed on the head but attached with a strap running underneath the chin.  The law relating to riding helmets is specific in terms of the insurance requirements laid down for <Col N="2007" /> riding schools, clubs and shows affiliated to the showjumping associations and the other equestrian parent bodies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accede to this request.  I am not concerned about the penalty that should be imposed, particularly on minors.  This should not deter us from doing what we know is right in this area.  As I suggested we could introduce a system of on-the-spot fine for transgressions.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. Indeed, I am glad that Deputy Doyle altered the wording slightly since Committee Stage, when I also supported the amendment, to make it compulsory for all persons to wear a helmet when cycling or horseriding.  I do not know a lot about horseriding but when it comes to cycling a campaign will not succeed if it is aspirational. Even though many children wear helmets when cycling and do what they are told many others do not.</P>

      <P>There is no appropriate punishment I could impose.  I used to ride a bicycle to school each day but I did not go very fast.  However, I did not have a high-tech bicycle.  As we are aware, in many instances children on bicycles travel much faster than cars and weave in and out of city traffic, putting themselves at risk.  We need to legislate for this.  I would prefer, however, if we could find some other way of ensuring that children do as they are told.  In this regard this amendment, which would make it compulsory for everybody to wear a helmet, would help in ensuring that children <Col N="2008" /> obey the law.  If it was mandatory for everyone to wear a helmet then children would not be singled out.  As I said on Committee Stage, many children do not regard it as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; to wear a helmet no matter how attractive or how high-tech it may be.  They object if they are asked to wear one because they think they look stupid in them.  While sensible, mature children will respond the majority do not. The reason I make this plea is that I want to safeguard our children.  I do not like the idea of imposing some sort of draconian punishment on children in this regard.  There must be quite simple solutions. It was suggested that the bicycle be impounded at the local Garda station for, say, a week, or that the child could be required to present himself at the local Garda station three times a week for the following three weeks wearing the helmet.  Human ingenuity is infinite.  I am sure there is a way around the difficulty. I know the Minister agrees that to save lives and reduce injuries children in particular should have to wear helmets.</P>

      <P>Nobody could disagree with the objective of this amendment. It is highly desirable that people riding bicycles should wear helmets.  The accident statistics for cyclists emphasises this point.  I am driven to despair at how cyclists behave in this city.  I agree with the sentiments expressed at Dublin City Council last night by one of my Labour colleagues, Paddy Bourke, when he denounced in the strongest language people who pedal bicycles around this city with no lights.  It is kamikaze stuff.  It would be highly desirable to get going an advertising campaign which would highlight the risks cyclists are exposed to, even despite their best efforts using helmets and shiny reflector belts and so on. However, one finds people cycling around the city of Dublin on dark nights with no lights, no reflector belts and, sometimes, no reflectors on the bicycles. They really are taking their lives into their hands.  I hope something can be done to get some sense into them.</P>

      <P>I will be asking the <Col N="2009" /> National Safety Council to feature the advisability of wearing helmets as prominently as possible in the 1994 Road Safety Campaign.  If we can incorporate other things in that programme, we certainly will.  I accept the protective benefits to both cyclists and horse riders of wearing appropriate headgear.  I have considered this matter since the Committee Stage.  There are a number of reasons why I am somewhat reluctant to compel people to do what is right, but I might be persuaded.</P>

      <P>I have an odd feeling about saying &ldquo;you must&rdquo; to a ten year old. Then there is the question of appropriate sanctions against young vulnerable cyclists who have no other way of travelling and who are, perhaps, not in very good financial circumstances.  I would be reluctant to require families with two or three children to have £100 available to meet this requirement to wear a helmet while cycling.</P>
      <P>I am sure everybody would agree that, in the main, the best way of promoting a development like this is on a voluntary basis.  I will try to approach it in two ways.  I will consider between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad what other additional powers I could put in the Bill which would give me the leeway at some time to decide on the question of compulsion.  First and foremost, people would have to be alerted to the fact that this was going to arise so they could at least make some effort to prepare even for the financial investment that would be necessary, particularly for families not in the best of financial circumstances.  I will have discussions with the Road Safety Council on the promotional effort. I will have that underpinned with some further developments on the legal side between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad to allow for a phased introduction, if that is the decision that is ultimately taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the points being made here and am anxious to facilitate <Col N="2010" /> the House in the best way that I can.  I have also expressed my fear about adopting such a philosophy for every problem we have.  Nevertheless, the evidence on accidents is such that young people must be prepared to make changes.  If it is not done on a voluntary basis it will certainly have to be done compulsorily, but not as a direct result of the debate here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has come a little bit of the road with me on this.  However, I am afraid it is not sufficient.  I feel very strongly about this. I am reflecting the views of large sections of the community, who know far more about the dangers of cycling on the roads than I do, when I say that we need the Minister to give statutory effect to the requirement to wear helmets while cycling on our roads or horseriding on our roads.  I urge the Minister to take this amendment on board.  Even if the Minister could assure me that he will bring in such a requirement in the Seanad, introducing the necessary penalties.  I would be satisfied.  However, all the Minister appears to be saying is that he may, between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad, bring in some enabling clause that would allow him sometime down the road to make the requirement compulsory, if in the meantime some efforts to persuade by way of advertising or public relations campaigns have failed to encourage the wearing of helmets.</P>
      <P>The Minister must believe me when I say that the best possible persuasive powers have been used by most parents in Ireland to get their children to wear helmets.  It is an never ending battle. They wear them if one is standing over them when they go out the door.  If the parent is not there they go out on their bicycles and the helmet is the last thing they think of; even if they think of it, they do not want to wear it unless they are being forced to do so.  Parents need the backup of legislation in this area and we are being remiss in our duty as legislators if we do not take this opportunity to bring in this legislation today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that about 400 <Col N="2011" /> cyclists are killed or injured on our roads every year?  We changed the drink driving laws on the basis that 400 are killed driving cars for one reason or another.  I will give the Minister the source of the figures, which are from a professional organisation.  I said that 400 people were killed or seriously injured on our roads, that is nearly one cyclist every day who is involved in either a serious injury or a fatality.  Cyclists under the age of 20 are the most vulnerable age group.  Boys are more likely to be injured than girls, especially when they reach secondary school age when the casualty rate increases dramatically &mdash; I suppose the macho bit comes into play at that stage. Research also shows that the actual number of cyclists injured might be as much as nine times the reported number. Head injuries are the main cause of death and amount to 70 per cent of cyclist fatalities, and over a half of all cyclist casualties receive head injuries.  The figures are horrific.  We really do not need to sit about and wait for advertising campaigns to persuade the public, particularly the young people of the error of their ways. The risk of fatal or even serious head injuries for those who do not wear helmets in traffic are on average four times as high as for those who do.</P>
    <P>We cannot argue with those figures. Helmets must be carefully marked as having been manufactured to a recognised national standard.  They are an essential part of cycling gear and we must persuade, with the backup of statutory support, all cyclists, particularly the young, that it is fashionable and smart to wear a helmet.  I am deeply unhappy about the short distance the Minister travelled with me in respect of this issue. Like him I balk at any compulsion directed towards adults in this regard.  I do not mind compelling children to do what is in their best interests.  All young people are very enthusiastic, exuberant and on many occasions have more energy than sense.  We cannot put an old head on young shoulders and preaching responsibility to them goes in one ear and <Col N="2012" /> out the other.  They do not understand mortality or limits to their ability.  I balk when it comes to adults; hence the reason I tabled my original amendment.  I hate being told what to do or that I must do something, it immediately gets my back up and that is my nature.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government cannot regulate for all aspects of people's lives.  That point has been made on many occasions. However, the statistics and facts in relation to this issue must make us take it more seriously than any Government has to date.  The speed at which cyclists travel, the amount of traffic and the high-tech nature of bicycles all point to making the wearing of a helmet compulsory.  Why is it compulsory for a motor cyclist to wear a helmet?  Bicycles are ridden at higher speeds than those who drive low powered motorbikes.  It is compulsory for people driving low powered motorbikes to wear helmets and they are being overtaken on the roads by young people riding high-tech bicycles.  If it was logical to make helmets compulsory for the users of motorbikes of all cubic capacities, and if today cyclists can travel faster than low powered motor bikes, is it not logical to make it compulsory for cyclists to wear helmets?  The same argument applies in respect of horse riding where the rider must take account also of the unpredictable nature of the animal and increased traffic on our roads.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Mayo Triathlon Cycle Club and its cycle helmet awareness campaign.  It is participating in a two week awareness campaign which commenced on 11 November and will continue to 25 November.  It is promoting cycle helmet awareness through 31 post-primary schools with extensive publicity through the press, radio, interviews, posters, adventure cycles, cycle shops, school visits, awareness seminars and a prize fund for promotions.  Its new logo is, &ldquo;get into the helmet habit&rdquo;.  I would like to pay tribute to its development officer, Jarlath Sweeney, and his committee for the tremendous work they are doing in Mayo.  We could learn from them.  Organisations such as that are very <Col N="2013" /> committed and convinced about the validity of the case they make.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the Mayo Triathlon Cycle Club which states:</P>
    <P>Dear Ms Doyle,</P>
    <P>As founder of the Mayo Triathlon Cycle Club, I continue to admire your efforts to make the wearing of cycle helmets compulsory when cycling in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are people concerned about this <Col N="2014" /> issue.  I urge the Minister to accept m amendment.  He may wish to amend the wording and include the imposition of penalties.  I suggest a sufficient on-the spot fine for minors.  That would tidy us this area.  In the absence of an indication that the Minister is prepared to make cycle helmets and helmets for home riding compulsory, between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad, I must press my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage several Deputies expressed the opinion that the power to detain vehicles for the non-payment of road tax would be excessive.  Arising from that debate I undertook to re-examine the position.  The provisions and procedures provided for in this section are almost identical to the provisions of section 97 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which provides for the detention and impounding of vehicles which are either abandoned or unlawfully parked.  For a number of years the Garda Síochána has been impounding vehicles unlawfully parked in clearways, on bus lanes and on double yellow lines.  I am satisfied that a procedure which can apply for parking <Col N="2020" /> infringements is also appropriate for dealing with people who evade paying road tax.  The annual loss in motor tax revenue due to evasion is more than £20 million per year and the reality is that the law abiding motorists are subsidising the evaders.  This should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that it is not the intention to impound a vehicle merely because the tax is a few days or weeks out of date.  The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to that commitment.  The amendment will confine the power to impound to cases where a garda finds that the road tax of a vehicle in use in a public place has expired for at least two months.  Deputy Doyle proposes that the minimum period should be six months.  This would be far too long.  I can understand somebody forgetting to renew his road tax for five or six weeks but six months is excessive.  I do not want signals to go out from this House suggesting it is acceptable not to renew road tax for as long as six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking our concerns partially on board. This issue was raised on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I made it clear on Second Stage that while I supported the power being given to members of the Garda Síochána to impound or detain uninsured vehicles I still had strong reservations about extending that power to untaxed vehicles.  Driving an untaxed car is, rightly, an offence but people driving such cars are not a danger to themselves or any other road user unlike people driving uninsured cars.  Uninsured drivers involved in accidents can cause immense complications in terms of personal injuries claims, etc.  In some cases the State has to take responsibility for the payment of compensation by the uninsured driver in cases involving injury or death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to impound vehicles whose tax is two months out of date is oppressive. That is the view of the Incorporated Law Society, the Automobile Association and many other conservative bodies which have considered this section.  I accept a case can be made for impounding <Col N="2021" /> the car of someone who habitually fails to tax it.  I asked people better qualified in this area than I for a definition of someone who blatantly abuses the law in this area as distinct from someone who forgets to renew his tax or has temporary difficulties in renewing it.  It was suggested that six months should be the minimum exemption period under this section &mdash; indeed some proposed a much longer period.  I agree with the Minister that we cannot afford to give wrong signals to the public.  The driving of untaxed vehicles is illegal and there are penalties to deal with this problem.  It should be underlined that anything we say or do here today will not change the existing penalties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board my amendment.  Unlike many other people, I support the impounding of uninsured vehicles.  However, I should like to hear how a member of the Garda Síochána will form a reasonable opinion as to what is an insured vehicle.  Will a car with a current insurance disc constitute an insured car?  We referred briefly to this issue earlier.  A person driving a car with a current insurance disc may not be insured to drive that car.  What criteria will be used in deciding whether a car is insured?  Will uninsured drivers be able to get away with driving cars which have a current insurance disc?  This point needs to be clarified as it could be wide open to legal challenge otherwise.</P>
    <P>Will a car without a tax disc be automatically deemed untaxed?  As both the Minister and I know, this may not necessarily be the case.  What criteria will be used in deciding whether a car should be impounded?  I urge the Minister not to make the provision too oppressive in regard to untaxed cars.  I accept that a person who blatantly flouts the law, has not taxed his car for years and who has no intention of doing so deserves to be penalised.  However, a person who normally taxes his car but who may be a month or two late in doing so should not have his vehicle impounded.  This provision is excessively oppressive. There is not a whole lot between the Minister and me on this issue.  In view of the fact that the Incorporated Law <Col N="2022" /> Society stated that the provision in the original Bill was oppressive and that the Automobile Association believes six months should be the minimum exemption period, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think allowing motorists two months grace in this case is unduly oppressive.  I would be quite happy if the Minister says in response to Deputy Doyle that he would allow three months' grace in relation to taxing a car, particularly as he has now allowed the reinstatement of the quarterly tax disc.  I did not put down an amendment on this, I was content to see the course that Deputy Doyle followed in regard to this matter as he had mentioned it on Committee Stage.  I was unsure whether the Minister should allow any grace but having had to pay a couple of months' back tax recently.  I have a little more sympathy for those who may forget to pay the tax.  I did not have time to get to the Tax Office although I was carrying my insurance certificate in my car with the intention of doing so.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that two months' grace is oppressive but it might be helpful if the Minister would allow three months grace in view of the fact that he changed his mind in relation to the tax discs earlier this year.</P>

      <P>As I explained earlier, for a number of years the Garda had been impounding vehicles which were unlawfully parked in clearways and bus lanes. I do not want Deputies to suggest we are introducing something new.  I am sure the Automobile Association and the Incorporated Law Society have made the same arguments in regard to this issue.  This provision has worked effectively in traffic management and there is no real public outcry or problem with it.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I was concerned to see to what extent I could tailor the amendment to deal with persistent offenders.</P>

Therefore, I found that it was not a practical proposition.

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 34, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>40.&mdash;A road authority may, with the consent of the Commissioner, provide <Col N="2024" /> and maintain on public roads in their charge any equipment or structure which the authority consider desirable for the detection of offences under section 47 (as amended by this Act) of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The need for more effective action to enforce the law in relation to excessive speed was raised during the Second Reading and indeed on Committee Stage when I pointed out I was anxious to ensure that the Garda would have the necessary statutory powers and the use of modern detection equipment to tackle this problem.  At present, the Garda make extensive use of radar speed meters.  They also have the use of in-car video equipment which is proving very effective.  New enforcement techniques and equipment are being developed on an ongoing basis.  The purpose of these amendments is to cater for the use of the latest technology by providing for modern automated equipment to detect and record speeding offences.</P>
    <P>The specific amendments proposed are as follows: amendment No. 45 will empower road authorities to provide on public roads the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the use of speed cameras; amendment No. 46 amends section 105 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 to put beyond doubt that the apparatus which may be used by the Garda to detect speeding offences includes photographing apparatus; amendment No. 48 amends section 107 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to empower the Garda to require details of who was driving at the time of the alleged offence either in person or by service of a notice by registered post.  The existing provisions do not cover such a requirement and the amendment is designed to put beyond doubt that a requirement can be made by service of a notice by registered post.</P>

      <P>I realise I cannot move the amendment but may I make a brief point?  Will the Minister look at this section, regarding which many professional bodies, including the advice available to the Incorporated Law Society, have major concerns?  With the three year provisions I was attempting to amend to one year, the maxim &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; applies.  I urge the Minister to examine the time it could take for such cases to get to court.  Before the Bill goes to the Seanad, perhaps the Minister could look at this again and try to meet the concerns of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (b) provides, contrary to the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 and indeed contrary to the Courts No. 3 Act, that summary proceedings for an offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1993, may be instituted &ldquo;at any time within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the person by whom the proceedings are instituted, to justify proceedings comes to such person's knowledge&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) goes on to provide that &ldquo;summary proceedings mentioned in subsection (1) of this section shall not be instituted later than three years &mdash; [that is my concern] &mdash; from the date on which the offence was committed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that &ldquo;a certificate signed by the person instituting the proceedings or on his behalf by a person authorised by him to sign such a <Col N="2027" /> certificate...stating the date on which evidence described in subsection (1) (b) of this section came to the knowledge of the first mentioned person shall, until the contrary is shown &mdash; [I presume that is by the defendant] &mdash; be sufficient evidence in any proceedings under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1993, of the facts stated therein, without proof of any signature on it or that the signatory was the proper person to sign it, and shall, until the contrary is shown, be sufficient evidence of compliance by the first mentioned person with the requirements imposed on him by or under this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&lsquo;(7B) Where, in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle, there is a contravention of a bye-law under subsection (7) of this section, each of the following persons shall be guilty of an offence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the registered owner of the vehicle,</P>
      <P>(b)  if the vehicle is the subject of a hire-drive agreement on the occasion in question, the person to whom the vehicle is hired under the agreement, and</P>
      <P>(c)  if the person who parked the vehicle is not its registered owner or the person to whom it is hired under a hire-drive agreement, the first-mentioned person.</P>
      <P>(7C) (a)  Where a person charged with an offence under subsection (7B) (inserted by the <i>Road Traffic Act, 1993)</i> of this section is the registered owner of the vehicle concerned, it shall be a defence for him to show that the vehicle was being used on the occasion in question by another person and that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  such use was unauthorised, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  the vehicle was on that occasion the subject of a hire-drive agreement.</P>

    <P>The amendment provides that, where there is a contravention of a local authority car park by-law, the registered owner of the vehicle will be held to be liable.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding my limited reservations in certain areas, this is a very important Bill now being passed through this House.  When the Minister has had a chance to go through the provisions of the Bill again, as it passes through the Seanad, I would urge him to endeavour to take on board the major areas of concern voiced here.  I do not expect him to accept all of the points we made in a wide variety of areas but the areas of concern to us have been narrowed to a few at this stage.  I would urge him to too look again at the points made by way of amendment today.  I thank him for having accepted an amendment tabled by me and effectively compromising on two other amendments today.</P>
      <P>However, I remain concerned about the provisions in regard to impounding of uninsured and untaxed cars only because the criteria to be deployed are far from clear in deciding what in fact constitutes an uninsured car.  For example, if the car has a valid insurance disc displayed but the driver is not validly insured to drive it, how will that be determined?  I contend there is a major loophole or difficulty remaining to be closed in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would plead with the Minister, when he gets to the Seanad, to table an amendment, or accept one from the floor, in relation to bicycle helmets, helmets for cyclists generally riding on our public roads.  I will not rehearse my case there since I dealt with that area to some extent.  Whereas the Minister, to use my expression, did travel some of the road with us, he did not accept my amendment. Nonetheless, he was reasonably sympathetic to the case made.  With the <Col N="2031" /> statistics staring us in the face I would ask him please, if you like, to complete the circle.  Rather than wait too long, depending on public relations machines to persuade, all, but particularly the young, I would ask him to take the initiative, giving a commencement date, say, of 1 June next, to allow people financially to comply with the requirement of purchasing a helmet when everybody would be reasonably satisfied.</P>
    <P>I will not rehearse many of the other arguments with which we have dealt already.  I must reiterate that this is a most important Bill.  But the removal of total discretion from the Judiciary in certain of its sections is a major cause of concern to me.  I contend the punishment must fit the crime and not all dangerous drivers are joy riders.  I am unhappy about the mandatory disqualifications and mandatory penalties being introduced in this area where no discretion at all is left with the Judiciary, if you like, to deal with the once-off offender as distinct from the malicious dangerous driver who needs no sympathy or support from us here today.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having taken on board, with an amendment of his we all accepted today, the concerns I voiced initially on Second Stage and with which we dealt subsequently at some length on Committee Stage, in relation to the extension of the new power being given the Garda to enter private property, with force if necessary, and to arrest without a warrant in certain cases.  The Minister has made that requirement quite crime specific.  He turned out at the end of the day to be even stricter than we on this side of the House had required of him. We tried to meet him; he came even further along the road in this case to meet us.  He has made the extension of that power to be crime specific just to the pursuit of the hit and run, the pursuit of someone who leaves the scene of an accident, in other words, the hot pursuit case.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say he would examine the possibility of extending that power up to three hours after the occurrence of <Col N="2032" /> such an accident.  I am happy with what the Minister has done in that regard because I had feared for the constitutionality of his original intent in the Bill, as initiated.  In extending to the Garda the powers they need to ensure that criminals are taken out and face the rigours of the law, hopefully, this amendment will render the extension of this particular power constitutional.  I am afraid that probably that will still be tested in our courts &mdash; in fact I have no doubt that it will &mdash; but in making it crime specific to the hot pursuit case most of the arguments many of us advanced in terms of its contravening Article 45 of the Constitution will have been taken care of.</P>
    <P>There are other new terms &mdash; perhaps not so new &mdash; of road traffic law introduced in relation to the whole body of law generally, for example, powers of detention by the Garda, as distinct from powers of arrest, to give them time to take a blood sample or urine test from a suspect in relation to a breach of drink driving alcohol levels, various other such powers which I contend are needed, such as the power to stop a joy rider and insist on the production of driving licence. Again, some compliant members of the community are somewhat worried that if they did not have their licence with them in their car a garda might insist that they produce it and not give them the option of producing it within ten days at their local garda station.  But I understand the Minister's argument that this is the only way a garda who suspects an under-age driver, or a joy rider of some kind, can prevent a false name and address being given, thus preventing them from getting off scot free.</P>
    <P>We travelled the road with the Minister in some areas, perhaps with some reservations, but understanding fully what he was endeavouring to achieve.  I should like to thank the Minister and his Departmental officials for the tremendous amount of work put into this Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to voice my disappointment at the Minister not having been able to take on board a graduation of the penalties, particularly <Col N="2033" /> the mandatory disqualification from driving. I am deeply unhappy about a person with 85 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood being treated the same way before a court of law as someone with 400 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood, in that the persistent, drunk driver, the blatant abuser of the law is being treated in the same way as someone who inadvertently consumed half a glass too much and to whom the Minister or I might appear perfectly sober although technically or marginally in breach of the law.  The fact that all discretion is removed from judges is a real cause of concern at that end.  At least a phased introduction of mandatory penalties would have been warranted, in order to treat a person with an 85 milligrammes level of alcohol slightly differently in terms of mandatory disqualification from driving from a total abuser, someone with say, 200, 300 or 400 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millitres of blood.</P>
    <P>I hope that what we have done today ultimately will save lives; that has to be the bottom line.  While some civil liberties have been impinged, and life will be a little less comfortable even for the compliant citizen, I hope that the compliant citizen will be paid back in dividends in terms of allowing the Garda to pursue the criminal, those who are criminally negligent, in relation to road traffic offences of one kind or another.  It is not always easy to achieve the correct balance.  Some of us still have concerns but we have acceded to the Minister's requests in many areas given the carnage on our roads today.</P>
    <P>I hope that the provisions of this Bill will pay dividends and that many lives will be saved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the open manner in which he approached this debate.  All of us said &mdash; it seems a long time ago now we were generally supportive of the provisions of this Bill even though we had difficulty in certain specific areas.  I think we have had a good debate overall.</P>

    <P>As somebody who has been critical of the committee system from time to time, <Col N="2034" /> I should say that, having been able to examine the provisions of this Bill in great depth in Committee Stage was of great benefit to me and, I hope, the Minister. I believe that the powers of persuasion of people from all sides of the House meant that the Minister was more open to taking amendments on board or to tabling his own, as he saw fit.</P>
    <P>The success or otherwise, of the provisions of the Bill will become evident when the road accident figures for Ireland for 1994 are published.  It will be easy to assess from the figures whether these measures, some of which we had difficulty with, are effective.  I have reservations about some of them but I appreciate that the Minister has accepted amendments both from me and other Members.  In particular the power to enter a dwelling by gardaí if necessary using reasonable force, was debated long and hard and I thank the Minister for listening.  I wish the Minister well with the Bill in the Seanad where, I have no doubt, a number of amendments will be tabled.  Our debate on the Bill will be scrutinised.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the complimentary remarks of Deputies Doyle and Keogh.  I thank also my officials who burned the midnight oil often to deal with the amendments.  For my part this has been a very good experience. We spent some of the long summer days dealing with Committee Stage of the Bill.  There is no doubt that the combined wisdom of Members from all sides of the House has produced a much improved Bill.  We will have to wait to see what happens in the Seanad.  The current law dates back to 1978 so it was definitely a time for review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proven connection between road accidents and alcohol.  We have to take account of many new systems and advancing technology such as the evidential breath-testing machines.  We have tried to up-grade and make the system more efficient while at the same time ensuring a good balance.  Overall, I think we have achieved that.  There is no doubt that new deterrents are needed.  There is <Col N="2035" /> still a hard core who, for one reason or another, are prepared to drink excessively and drive on our roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the loss of civil liberties of a compliant citizen but I would remind her of the many deaths on our roads.  Where there is a conflict we have tried to ensure in hit-and-run accidents that no mercy is shown and that there is no sanctuary for such offenders.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Members who contributed, particularly the Front Bench spokespersons.  They must undertake a considerable amount of work.  Some of the step dancing can only be done by the Opposition.  A Minister has to make choices and decide issues.  I was amazed at the way some Members were able to dance through the web of difficulties if they perceived an electoral problem. When there was mention of compliant and helpful people I was told the Minister for the Environment was not prepared to listen.  We may have the back-up staff but we carry the responsibility for making decisions.  In political life there will always be opportunities for the Opposition to exploit such problems.  The sensitivities and the vulnerability of this side of the House can be exposed now and then.</P>
    <P>This debate has been a very good experience and I look forward to the debate in the Seanad and, more important, to the successful implementation of this legislative framework.  A cultural change in the country as a whole in the form of the non-acceptance of excessive drinking or drinking and driving will ultimately lead to safer roads for those who use them.</P>

      <P>These four amendments, which were inserted in the Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad, are interlinked.  Essentially they are technical in character.  Their main purpose is to ensure that the courts' jurisdiction under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act and under Part II of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, will not be constrained in any way by the provisions of this Bill.

      <P>Section 5: In page 7, between lines 45 and 36, the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a spouse in whose favour section 4 applies is convicted of the murder of the other spouse, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  immediately before the death of the other spouse, an interest in the matrimonial home was vested by virtue of section 4 in the spouse in whose favour section 4 applies, <Col N="2038" /> then, as on and from such death&mdash;</P>

    <P>I moved this amendment in the Seanad to meet a point raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of whether a spouse who murders his or her spouse, having benefited from the joint ownership conferred by this Bill, should continue to retain that ownership, has already been the subject of extensive debate in the Dáil.  Initially, I took the view that the general law, in connection with the specific provisions of section 6 of this Bill, was sufficient to cater for the rare instance when this particular issue would arise.</P>
    <P>However, I have given further thought to this issue and in particular to the consideration which was not advanced in either the Dáil or Seanad debates, that it could happen that section 6 could not be invoked in circumstances where the couple concerned were childless and the spouse convicted of murder was the deceased spouse's executor.  For this reason it seemed to me, that in the specific instance of murder it would be appropriate to set aside the statutory joint tenancy and that is the effect of the amendment.  I am sure Deputies will be pleased with that.</P>

      <P>I wish, at this stage, to propose that discussion of the remaining Seanad amendments be deferred to another day in order to facilitate consideration being given to the insertion in the Bill of an additional amendment which relates to section 7.  The background to my proposals is as follows. When this Bill was debated in the House at an earlier stage, Deputies were most anxious that the provisions in section 7 should be subject to independent legal advice.  I took on board those concerns in an amendment which I introduced on Report Stage in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the existing draft of the section contains an anomaly which I should like to remove.  In brief, as matters <Col N="2040" /> stand, it will be necessary for a benefiting spouse to get independent advice from a lawyer before he or she opts out, but if the party who would benefit from the joint ownership is comtemplating marriage, he or she would be free to opt out without obtaining any such advice.  It is desirable that spouses and individuals contemplating marriage be on an equal footing. Accordingly, I am now moving the necessary motion in the following terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the need for an equitable and comprehensive world trade agreement but refuses to accept the agricultural provisions of the emerging Uruguay Round agreement on the grounds that they impose excessively onerous and <Col N="2041" /> unbalanced restrictions and obligations on the EC and are inconsistent with the principle of equality of treatment of all partners.</P>

      <P>It appears this Government does not have the commitment I would expect to our largest industry.  I am glad to see that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Foresty, Deputy Hyland is present because it is very important that agriculture is accepted as a most important issue.  The 4½ per cent reduction in the milk quota has meant that thousands of jobs have been lost at farm, factory and export level.  There is a possible further loss of 2 per cent under GATT and this will mean that more people will join the dole queue.  In addition there will be further curtailments of the beef, cereals and other food sectors.  We can expect a great many more to become unemployed unless major efforts are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, said there were positive aspects to GATT and that it was extremely important that the GATT be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  He highlighted the textile industry as a major sector that would benefit from GATT.  What textile industry is left after the activities of this Government?  The length of time it took <Col N="2042" /> the Government to solve the currency crisis, in addition the imposition of VAT at 21 per cent, put many textile factories under such pressure that they have gone out of business.  They now expect GATT to bring that industry back to life.  The Minister said also that the growth of the service industry would be of enormous benefit and continued: &ldquo;For all sorts of reasons, statistical and otherwise, it is extremely difficult to quantify precisely the economic gains that might arise from the establishment of multilateral disciplines in services.&rdquo;  We must remember that agriculture is still our most important industry.  Since our entry to the EC farmers have proved they can produce and have increased productivity, although the numbers on the land have decreased.  We cannot afford to lose any more from the land.  We have failed dismally to market our produce and to develop the processing sector.  We could do a great deal in this area.  If we accept the GATT proposals the processing industry will be destroyed.  I ask the Minister to bring a clear message to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Foresty, Deputy Joe Walsh and the Taoiseach that we must make a last ditch effort to change the GATT, not just for the sake of agriculture but for all our sakes.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Taoiseach and the various Ministers have not had a higher profile in this area.  I conceded last night they made some effort since January when Commissioner MacSharry resigned but in his period of office they allowed so much to happen that they have a great deal of ground to make up. I believe the GATT will have serious consequences for the country.  Some of the points made by Deputy Dukes and the farm organisations last spring on the effects of Common Agricultural Policy reform have been proved wrong but only because of what has happened in Eastern Europe.  The eastern European farmers dumped their cattle in East Germany and now there are fewer calves coming from eastern Europe which gives us the opportunity to market our cattle in Egypt, and Libya.  We have one last chance in the few remaining days and I appeal to the <Col N="2043" /> Minister of State to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Taoiseach to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

      <P>It is unfortunate that the GATT negotiation process has slowed down while the world waits for the US House of Representatives to vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement on November 17.  It can be taken that the United States is dictating the trend of GATT negotiations by talking first to several of its main trading partners, including Japan, in an effort to see how far it will push the GATT talks.  We are facing an economic war when large countries will compete on the same basis of economy of scale to the detriment of small countries such as Ireland.</P>
      <P>The European Community is being placed gradually in a very weak negotiating position, principally by its inaction and failure to be assertive and to take the initiative.  For instance at the last EC meeting, rather than setting out the priorites for GATT much of the time was spent discussing issues such as where to locate the European Monetary Fund, deciding to proceed with economic and monetary union by 1999 and reaffirming that the European Community should abide by the Maastricht Treaty guidelines. Why was the important issue of GATT ignored.  Where was the Irish Minister?  The plain fact is that the trend in these negotiations has been dictated by the United States, the EC, especially Ireland, has been extraordinarily inactive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential for Ireland to get its priorities right, to assess in detail the benefits and the negative aspects of the issue as it now stands.  The experts tell us that these proposals will benefit Ireland because of the boost in world trade. Growth is likely to follow the success and completion of the Uruguay Round. However, how sure we are that our industrial sector will survive and prosper in a free market when barriers to trade are gradually removed?  Is the Government being fooled on the benefits of free trade? Perhaps some of our larger industries <Col N="2044" /> will prosper but what about our smaller indigenous industries?  I feel there will be little chance for them.  Small firms are struggling to survive so how can they hope to compete when competition becomes hotter?  While there may be some benefits in terms of a more competitive environment Ireland's experience of competition has always been job losses with more people out of work. People should ask what effect the GATT will have on their jobs and how many jobs will be lost compared with the number gained.  How can the Government ensure that we as a peripheral nation can compete effectively?  True, prices may drop and competition will become fierce.  The amalgamation of existing large firms will result in job losses, in some cases the loss of a particular industry altogether.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with the agricultural sector and Ireland was wrong to join France on this issue.  It would have been far better to negotiate our own needs. The importance of agriculture to Ireland can be well argued and the case stands on its merits, but my main concern is for the beef industry.  The importance of the beef industry with regard to exports and employment is well known.  Beef is 11 times more important to the Irish economy than to the overall EC.  Only 12 per cent of Irish beef is consumed here which means that nine out of every ten animals are exported.  These net exporting regions are vulnerable to market oversupplies. Ireland has a very high degree of dependency on beef exports to non-EC countries.  This country accounts for 6.6 per cent of the total EC production, yet Ireland accounts for 24 per cent of EC beef exports.  Therefore, Ireland is very vulnerable to the proposed export refund costs.</P>
    <P>There are two main concerns when considering the GATT negotiations &mdash; a cutback in production and a further drop in beef prices beyond the existing CAP measures.  The real cause of the agricultural problem is that factory type farming is practised in the US and in some EC countries.  It is essential that our negotiators get this point across and <Col N="2045" /> place more emphasis on the family farm and on people.</P>
    <P>The principle of GATT should not go beyond CAP reform as already agreed. Limitations or cutbacks in production are difficult, if not impossible, to justify in our case.  Compensation should be paid if production is limited or cut back.  Suckler cow and milk quota cutbacks should not be tolerated and while the GATT agreement emphasises free trade, resulting in lower prices, it will hit some industries very badly.  From our point of view the emphasis must be on the importance of agriculutre to our economy.  The potential for job losses in native firms must be considered and we must strongly resist further cuts.  We must also take into consideration the effects of the present proposals on the rural areas and on unemployment.  The effect will be disastrous if the agricultural industry goes into decay.  I agree with the point by Deputy Dukes that the GATT proposals as they stand are a one way ticket to oblivion and decay for rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment to Deputy Duke's motion proposed last night by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  The Minister clearly outlined the Government's approach to the overall negotiations including the agricultural aspects and this House should endorse that strategy.  It is opportune for the House to address this issue given the proximity of the deadline for concluding the negotiations and the potentially far reaching impact which a success or failure will have for the world economy and the multilateral trading system in the medium term at least.  There have already been a number of discussions in this House on the Uruguay Round in the last few years.  Thus, as Members will be familiar with the background to and the negotiating history of the round, I do not propose to dwell on those aspects tonight.  Nevertheless, it would be useful to briefly recall the key elements of these long running negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations commenced in 1986 <Col N="2046" /> and were scheduled to conclude in 1990. There are 15 subjects in the round including a number of areas such as services and intellectual property rights which are to be brought within the GATT rules and disciplines for the first time.  It is also envisaged that agriculture would be dealt with in a far more comprehensive way than in earlier rounds.  Notwithstanding the media focus, the agriculture aspects have not been the only or the most difficult elements of the negotiations. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, referred to a number of areas where significant difficulties have yet to be resolved.  Thus, it is by no means certain that resolution of the outstanding agriculture problems would automatically result in the completion of a comprehensive and substantive overall GATT deal.  Nevertheless, it is almost certainly the case that without an agreement on agriculture the round will not be completed.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the major contracting parties have undertaken to seek to finalise the negotiations by 15 December next.  There have, of course, been earlier deadlines for concluding the round and the failures to meet these did not lead to any noticeable deterioration in the world trading system.  However, it does not follow that that would be the case if there is a further failure.</P>
    <P>Even though fewer than 30 days remain before the deadline, it is still not possible to predict whether the negotiations will be concluded.  Apart from agriculture, there are continuing and significant obstacles to be overcome in a number of important areas such as market access for industrial goods and services.  Intensive negotiations are scheduled to continue over the next few weeks in a final effort to overcome the remaining difficulties and to conclude what would be the most comprehensive trade package ever.</P>
    <P>In this regard and while it is a separate negotiation, the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representative later today on the NAFTA could have a decisive bearing on whether the US Administration will be able to complete the <Col N="2047" /> Uruguay Round.  A positive vote would probably increase the prospects of there being a GATT deal, while a negative vote would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, to conclude the round.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, possible to predict what would happen if the Uruguay Round cannot be concluded by 15 December.  Notwithstanding the passing of earlier deadlines, there were no immediate adverse consequences for trade; but if the deadline were to be missed again, there is a serious risk that there would be damaging consequences for the world economy and for the multilateral trading system in the longer term. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, outlined why we have a strong interest in the creation and maintenance of a stable, well-regulated liberal world trading environment.  He also addressed what might follow a failure in the negotiations. I agree with the Minister and add that there is also a risk that some contracting parties could refer our support and other arrangements to GATT for arbitration. On the other hand, a successful comprehensive and balanced conclusion could revitalise the world economy and strengthen the multilateral trading system, thereby securing a degree of certainty for our support and protection regimes.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is not to suggest that we should be or are prepared to accept a GATT deal at any price.  We have always emphasised that any GATT outcome must be comprehensive and balanced and not impose a disproportionate burden on any country or sector.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, the current outline agreement is based on proposals made by the then Director-General of the GATT in December 1991 which were subsequently modified by the Blair House Agreement reached by the Commission and US negotiators in November 1992.  The essential elements of the agreement which would cover a six year period beginning in 1995 are: domestic supports other than CAP reform compensatory payments and similar payments would be reduced by 20 per cent; border measures <Col N="2048" /> such as variable levies would be converted to tariff equivalents which would then be reduced by 36 per cent; minimum access commitments of up to 5 per cent of domestic consumption would be provided for and current access would be maintained; average 1986-90 subsidised exports would be reduced by 36 per cent in budgetary terms and by 21 per cent in volume terms with volumes falling to the 1986-90 average less 3.5 per cent in the first year; the Commission has agreed that existing limitations on exports to South East Asia would be continued; and a &ldquo;peace clause&rdquo; which the Commission claim would protect the CAP system from challenge.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement has not yet been put to the Council and as such has not been endorsed by the Community.  It has not been accepted by the US Senate or Congress or by the other contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The House will be well aware that we have major concerns with what has been proposed for agriculture, and that we have outlined these from the outset. Deputy Dukes suggested that these concerns are of recent origin and in particular that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry welcomed the deal on the day it was signed.  That is untrue.  In this regard, I draw Deputy Dukes's attention to the statement which the Minister issued on 20 November last, the day that the Blair House agreement was concluded. That statement included the following:</P>
    <P>He remained very concerned at the outcome in regard to volume limitations on subsidised exports, particularly in so far as they will affect the beef and dairy sectors.  He will need to be clear that these can be accommodated within the CAP reform arrangements before there can be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the Agricultural Council,</P>
    <P>I could point to other statements made, including statements to this House, where the Minister consistently referred to similar concerns.  I hope that Deputy <Col N="2049" /> Dukes will not continue to use selective quotations to misrepresent the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>All Ministers have continued to voice concerns at appropriate opportunities in all the relevant fora.  Our main difficulty with the agreement relates to the proposed commitment to reduce the volume of subsidised exports by 21 per cent, the timescale for applying this, the absence of arrangements to deal with intervention stocks and the continuation of the restriction on subsidised exports to South East Asia.  We also have other difficulties with the draft agreement including aspects such as the scope and duration of the peace clause and the need to ensure that the Community's approach to market access, particularly aggregation, is fully secured in any final agreement. There are, of course, positive elements in the draft, in particular the exemption from GATT disciplines of CAP reform compensation and the safeguarding of Community support arrangements from GATT challenges.  The Commission has also given specific assurances that it has agreed with the US that disadvantaged areas payments would be exempt from the support reduction commitment. We need to ensure that this understanding is legally underpinned in any final agreement.</P>
      <P>It remains our view that the current proposed commitments would create difficulties for Community and Irish agriculture in a number of sectors, particularly in the beef sector, where exports would have to be reduced substantially in the first year of an agreement compared to the average levels for 1991 and 1992, but probably not compared to the likely export figures for 1993.  There could also be difficulties, although on a smaller scale, in the dairy, pigmeat and poultry sectors.  It is not possible to quantify the impact of the commitments for individual sectors or economies at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, the position is that <Col N="2050" /> any commitments would be undertaken at the level of the Community.  It would then be a matter for the Community to consider whether the commitments could be contained within the present CAP regimes or whether adjustments to internal arrangements would be required to fulfil the undertakings.  The latter possibility was foreseen when the Community made its offer on agriculture in November 1990.  At that time, the Council gave an explicit undertaking that in implementing a GATT agreement, any adjustments would be shared out equitably and that account would be taken of the particular difficulties of certain categories of farmers and regions.  We will rely on this undertaking and the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Rome on economic and social cohesion in negotiations on any proposals to the Council on a final GATT deal.</P>
    <P>Thus, until we know the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the GATT, until the Council decides whether further adjustments are required and, if so, how such adjustments would be applied, it is not possible to give a realistic assessment of a GATT deal on sectors or economies.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the House can be assured that the Government has taken every opportunity, bilaterally and multilaterally, to raise our concerns in all the relevant fora.  There was an extensive debate on the agriculture aspects at the Joint General Affairs/Agriculture Council on 20 September 1993 when the Council re-examined the compatibility of the draft agreement with the CAP in the light of the Commission's acceptance that some circumstances had changed. Ireland and France expressed serious reservations on the agreement while various other delegations raised specific points of interest to them.  Issues raised included the peace and safeguard clauses, the timing and phasing of commitments, disposal of intervention stocks, aggregation, growth of world markets and cereal substitutes imports.  In its conclusions, the Council confirmed that the Community will ensure that its international engagements are compatible with the CAP and that the result of the Uruguay Round <Col N="2051" /> for agriculture will not either directly or indirectly jeopardise the durability of the CAP or its basic principles.  The Council also underlined the need to maintain the Community's presence on international markets.  In the light of the discussions, certain general guidelines were defined for the Commission for the conduct of further discussions on a bilateral and multilateral basis in the search for an agreement which is acceptable to all parties. These guidelines, which include our concerns, were confirmed by the Council on 4 October and by the European Council on 29 October.</P>
    <P>The Commission held discussions with the US on 27 September and again on 13 October at which it raised the reinterpretation of the draft agreement as directed by the Council.  The public US response was that it was not prepared to modify or reinterpret the agreement. Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to continuing discussions with the US and to seeking solutions to the problems identified.  The US has been preoccupied with the North American Free Trade agreement and has been unable to discuss any aspects of the round until this issue is out of the way.  We are hopeful that, in the context of the overall negotiations, the US will be willing to agree to some adjustment of the outline agricultural agreement.  It is expected that Sir Leon Brittan will again meet the US Trade Secretary, Mr. Kantor, next week when the situation should become clearer.</P>
    <P>The agricultural aspects of the negotiations were considered at today's meeting of Agriculture Ministers.  I assure the House that Minister Walsh again outlined our concerns and the conditions which he will insist on before he can accept an agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to press the Commission to seek solutions to the problems we have identified.  We are not prepared to accept any agreement unless we are satisfied that the Community will put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that our agriculture sector and farmer incomes are maintained at levels <Col N="2052" /> envisaged when the CAP was reformed. As I mentioned earlier, there are serious difficulties in other areas of the negotiations also and considerable work remains to be done if a comprehensive and balanced agreement is to be reached by 15 December.</P>
    <P>As was indicated by Minister McCreevy, the Government will ultimately take a decision on Ireland's attitude to a final agreement if and when agreement has been reached in all areas and in the light of whether and to what extent our problems have been addressed. In this connection, the Government has made it clear that while it favours a successful, comprehensive and balanced conclusion to the negotiations, it will not be prepared to accept an outcome which would impose a disproportionate burden on any region or sector particularly agriculture.</P>
    <P>I again commend to the House the amendment proposed by Minister McCreevy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  The balance of advantage in successfully concluding the GATT negotiations is in Ireland's favour.</P>
      <P>A successful conclusion would lead to a stabilisation of world trade, international growth and to a strengthening of the multilateral trading system.  As the Minister of State said, one of the main areas of concern to Ireland is agriculture. Negotiations are taking place under 15 headings and I would like to refer to two of these, agriculture and textiles.</P>
      <P>I join with those who have expressed concern at the proposed changes in the agricultural sector.  In some cases these would have a negative effect.  For example, the proposal to reduce Community output of beef would have serious consequences for the beef sector and the knock-on effects on industry and the implications this would have for the labour market should be the source of serious concern for us all.</P>

I am glad the Minister of State repeated the commitment made by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in this regard.  We are being asked to make sacrifices in order to reach a successful conclusion to the GATT negotiations.  I am disappointed that we will have to endure cutbacks and quota restrictions while other countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand will not have to endure the same discipline or reductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community has been asked to implement a cut of 30 per cent in its support regime.  Since various commitments have been made to conclude the Uruguay Round negotiations by 15 December next &mdash; the fifth deadline to be set down &mdash; the Government must focus on agriculture and textiles.  Along with France we have again drawn attention to the potential difficulties which the draft agreement presents for the agricultural sector in the Community but, more importantly, our domestic agricultural economy will suffer if our vital national interest is not protected.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry must insist in the negotiations that the special needs of the agricultural sector are taken into account in drafting in the final agreement. While some commentators and economists have highlighted the fact that farmers' incomes are expected to increase significantly this year, there is evidence that certain sectors, particularly the beef sector, are feeling the effects of the world recession.</P>
      <P>The face of farming has changed during the past 20 years.  In some instances this has proved to be beneficial but there is also a down side in that there is a move towards larger farm units.  This is regrettable. The small family farm as we know it will soon become a thing of the past if we do not act immediately to safeguard its interests.  While I accept there are serious difficulties in other areas, I must impress upon the Minister of State the seriousness with which we view these GATT negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this topic as it is of great interest to me and many of my constituents.  The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is an international treaty establishing the rules for the conduct of world trade.  Its overall objective is the reduction of barriers in trade and, accordingly, an increase in the volume of trade.  Since 1986 efforts have been made <Col N="2055" /> to conclude a global and balanced package and this has taken on a renewed impetus in recent times, as was clearly demonstrated at the G7 Summit in Tokyo in July.</P>
      <P>The MacSharry-Madigan deal &mdash; the agreement made in November 1992 between the negotiators for the EC and the US on agricultural issues in the GATT &mdash; is commonly referred to as the Blair House Agreement.  I appreciate the fact that this is a small open economy and that the successful conclusion of the GATT discussions, which should promote international growth and lead to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system, would be in our long term interests.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there are some significant obstacles to be overcome before a successful conclusion can be reached from our viewpoint.  While I appreciate these obstacles are not confined to the agricultural sector &mdash; we have only to consider the impact the agreement might have in other areas such as textiles &mdash; it is generally accepted that agriculture remains a very important element in the overall negotiations.  Coming as I do from a midland county, it will come as no surprise that I intend to focus upon agriculture in my contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to agricultural support and trade appears to be as follows: First, internal support for agriculture would be cut by 20 per cent over six years, with the exception of certain &ldquo;green box&rdquo; supports which are considered as not being linked to production or prices which are regarded as controlling production.  The average for the period 1986-88 would be used as a base and credit would be given for reductions in support achieved since then.  Second, export subsidies, refunds, would be cut over six years by 36 per cent in financial terms, while the volume of products covered by refunds would be cut by 21 per cent compared to the average for the period 1986-90.  Third, import levies in operation during the 1986-88 period would be converted to tariff equivalents and reduced by 36 per cent over six years. <Col N="2056" /> In addition, there would be a minimum access requirement of 3 per cent of internal consumption in the first year and 5 per cent in the final year relative to the average for the period 1986-88.</P>
    <P>These restrictions and cuts go far beyond anything envisaged under the CAP reform measures.  This is the reason Ireland must continue to highlight the non-acceptability of these measures, both from an EC and Irish point of view, as they involve a greater commitment from EC farmers and go beyond what is required by CAP reform measures.  This would, in effect, lead to an unacceptable and disproportionate burden being carried by Irish farmers and the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly examine the implications of the GATT proposals for the beef industry in Ireland in particular. It is widely accepted that the greatest problem for the EC arising from the GATT proposals would be faced in the beef sector &mdash; beef is approximately 11 times more important to the Irish economy than to the overall EC economy.  It is quite clear that the current position in relation to agriculture is not balanced and imposes a disproportionate burden on the agricultural sector in Ireland in particular, given our peripheral location and small domestic market.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Government in its stance that since the proposed agreement would require the Community to take additional stricter measures over and above the CAP reform decisions of 1992, our special dependence on agriculture should be fully recognised and taken into account in the implementation of any agreed commitments.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the proposed volume restraint on subsidies exports is a serious aspect from Ireland's point of view. Ireland has a high dependence on exports to non-EC markets and, while it accounts for 6.6 per cent of total beef production, it accounts for 24 per cent of EC exports. Thus, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to the export refund cuts.  Ireland and Denmark are the only EC countries with the necessary health status to export to Japan.  This would necessitate a moderate <Col N="2057" /> level of refund as the Japanese market is protected by a tariff of approximately 50 per cent.  Accordingly, I urge the Government to make a case to ensure that Ireland is excluded from such cuts on the grounds of its vital national interests.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other factors which we must bear in mind in this discussion. It is projected that the total intake of beef into EC intervention would be reduced from 750,000 tonnes in 1993 to 350,000 tonnes by 1997 under the CAP reform measures and that the additional oversupply arising from the GATT would be likely to result in EC beef prices falling by considerably more than the 15 per cent envisaged under CAP reform.  This would have serious long term implications for the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Andriessen Agreement &mdash; an EC concession in 1985 under which refunds are not payable on export of beef to Japan and South East Asia &mdash; would appear set for an indefinite extension under the current US-EC draft agreement. As I have already stated, Ireland and Denmark, which have the necessary health status, will be unable to capitalise on this market due to this lack of refunds. This is particularly important point, in view of the fact that this is a rapidly expanding market, and an extension of the Andriessen Agreement would mean that the EC would be effectively handing over this market to the US and Australia.</P>
    <P>Another technical problem is that EC intervention stocks, which now stand at less than 850,000 tonnes, would have to be disposed of before the GATT is put in place.  Under the GATT rules as they stand, if these stocks were disposed of outside the EC, from 1995 onwards they would be treated as subsidised exports.  This would entail an even greater reduction in commercial exports to non-EC countries to allow the EC remain within the GATT limits in relation to these exports.</P>
    <P>Another technical problem, as I see it, is &ldquo;front loading&rdquo; of the cuts.  This means that most of the cuts would be made in the initial year.  Every effort must be made to ensure a more even spread of the obligations to meet the commitments and, <Col N="2058" /> accordingly, the front loading provisions should be renegotiated and an extended period of at least six to eight years sought for the implementation of the obligation.</P>
    <P>Another major issue which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency is the question of aggregation.  All meats would be treated as one for the calculation of import access and export refund reductions.  It should be noted that Dunkel opposes aggregation in so far as his proposal is that cuts should apply to each individual product.  The achievement of aggregation would significantly limit the damage to the total meat market in the EC.</P>
    <P>Our bottom line, therefore, in any negotiations in relation to a GATT deal is that it should be compatible with the CAP reform package agreed in 1992.  We must not pull any punches with the Commission in seeking to persuade it that adjustments must be secured to ensure that the EC is not forced to take additional restrictive measures.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that a successful conclusion of the negotiations would be in our interests, nevertheless it should also be quite clear that for a deal to be concluded, it will have to be balanced to allow the EC to continue to support and protect its agricultural and food sectors at reasonable levels.  The bottom line is that it should not be a deal at any price. I, accordingly, advocate that the Government should continue its policy of ensuring that there are changes in the Blair House Agreement which take cognisance of the importance of the agricultural sector in relation to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In particular I ask that: (a) The export volume limitations should be reduced to be totally compatible with the CAP reform agreed in 1992.  It is quite clear that the European Community has already accepted reductions in support and protection levels and that the GATT which would require the Community, Irish agriculture in particular, to endure further significant cutbacks would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>(b)  We need a period of six to ten years to implement the export and import commitments.  We require this minimum <Col N="2059" /> time span to allow a rational adjustment to the new liberalisation of trade and to avoid serious distortion in world trade.</P>
    <P>(c)  Aggregation of import commitments will have to take place, particularly in relation to the meat sector.  The front loading provisions will have to be scrapped, and a more even spread of the obligations to meet the commitments should be over an extended period of time.  (d) Every effort should be made to ensure that the EC has full access to the beef market in Eastern Asia.  Accordingly, the Andriessen Agreement should not be extended and incorporated in the current GATT and I urge the Minister to make every effort with his EC partners to ensure that this end is achieved.  (e) As I already stated, the main problem is the proposed commitment to limit the volume of subsidised exports which are used mainly by the Community, and as Community products are unlikely to become competitive at world market prices, they would have to be reduced.  This would be particularly acute in the beef sector, where there would have to be a reduction in beef output of up to 500,000 tonnes by the end of the agreement under the current proposals, based on current production this would lead to a 5 per cent reduction to meet this commitment, which, as I stated previously, is well in excess of what will result from CAP reform.</P>
    <P>There are some 850,000 tonnes of beef in intervention stocks at present, and this would have to be disposed of with the permitted ceiling.  Accordingly, it is vital that current stocks should be totally exempted from export commitments, both in volume and budgetary terms.</P>

      <P>In speaking about the GATT, I am conscious of how limited public knowledge is on this subject and, indeed, how limited knowledge of the complexities of the agreement is among Members of this House.  I am also mindful of Mr. Peter Sutherland's dictum on the complexities when he said: &ldquo;if you are not confused, you are not listening&rdquo;. That said, there is no doubt that the implications of the GATT are universal and will impact not just on the agricultural sector but on all of us, although the debate so far has been dominated by agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of the world trade talks is now more than seven years old and two years overdue.  The GATT has seldom been the subject of a proper debate in this House and the Government has shown a remarkable complacency about its implications for the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade recently announced he had commissioned an outside expert group to conduct a consultancy study on the likely impact of a GATT agreement.  There is no sign of this report being published. Indeed, when pressed, officials in his office could not give any indication as to when it might be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> It is extraordinary that as we approach 15 December deadline we do not have available to us an in-depth sectoral analysis of the potential gains and losses that will result from GATT.  At question time, Deputy McCreevy gave a glib reply that, while not all sectors will benefit equally, without a shadow of doubt the successful conclusion of a GATT will be in our overall interest.  Last night's contribution from the same Minister did not enlighten us much further.</P>
    <P>If we take as an example the clothing industry the importance of a full sectoral analysis of the implications of free trade is obvious.  There are 15,600 people employed in this sector, which is the equivalent of one out of every 12 jobs in manufacturing.  Sixty per cent of output is exported and almost 90 per cent of companies are in Irish ownership.  This is a highly exposed sector of the economy and since 1989 2,000 jobs have been lost. The industry believes that unless it can become more competitive further jobs will be destroyed.  The increase on VAT in the last budget has simply put another nail in the coffin of jobs in an industry which is labour intensive.  More important it is an industry in which we have proved our talent and creativity and could have a chance of developing in the right climate.</P>
    <P>The complacency of the Government in the run-up to the GATT deadline is all the more worrying now that there is an increasing possibility that the whole process might break down.  That should give us cause for consideration.  Mr. Peter Sutherland has warned that failure would mean &ldquo;lurking chaos&rdquo; and may herald a return of economic conditions which provoked the depression of the 30s.  Failure in December will not simply result in the <i>status quo</i> being maintained in international trade policies.  He stated that &ldquo;we will be on a very slippery slope ...and that there will be no multilateral system of sufficient weight and credibility to stop the world sliding into a mire of protectionism and lost economic opportunity.&rdquo; Today's US Congress vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement will be critical.  If NAFTA is voted down <Col N="2062" /> it may well derail the Uruguay Round itself.  The unthinkable might happen.  At the very least failure would result in short term damage to business confidence which would trigger a sharp fall in share prices and hesitation by companies in their investment plans.</P>
    <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for having provided us with an opportunity to debate the GATT.  However, my impression is that there is no serious thinking going on within that party on the implications of GATT.  Fine Gael takes its cue from the IFA, the same view that supported the insupportable opposition to the CAP reform.  How any serious party could defend the milking of public money by an agricultural elite is beyond imagination.  In 1987 the total value of grants and subsidies paid to the agricultural sector by the Department of Agricultural in one year was £191 million, excluding market support measures.  By 1992 that figure had risen to £464 million. As a result we have rural unemployment, an underdeveloped food sector, a massive stockpiling into intervention and a constant demand for special treatment from farmers who represent neither the small, struggling farmer nor the rural community as a whole.  There is grave concern for the future of rural communities arising from GATT and there is a need to protect our future chances of developing a flourishing food industry but to pretend that overdependance on the high level of CAP subsidies is not part of the problem is disingenuous.  A recognition on Fine Gael's part and indeed on the part of the previous Labour Party speaker that a failure to reform the CAP long ago is part of the problem now would be refreshing and realistic.  Instead the same old story is trotted out again. However, this time it is a story that could end in tears if we choose to follow its logic.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the failure of GATT are obvious and the consequences of a full-blown GATT may also be very serious.  For most people the merits of an agreement are considered axiomatic.  Free trade has become an article of faith.  Anti-GATT sentiments <Col N="2063" /> come only from the fringes, mostly from the environmental movement and from Third World groups.  Since nobody is opposed to freedom it is hard to find anyone opposed to free trade, but language can distort as often as it reveals. For accuracy's sake it would be more appropriate to use the term &ldquo;deregulated international commerce&rdquo;.  Deregulation does not have the same aura about it. Look at Britain and the US. Look at the world's financial markets where billions of pounds can be shifted at the flick of a switch.  Look at the demise of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS. During the 80s deregulation was the watchword of the idealogues of the New Right.  It is a hooligan approach to policy making that has made life miserable for millions.</P>

They need to set up their operations in any part of the world, to have ready access to cheap labour, the cheaper the better, and raw materials, the cheaper the better, to be free of government regulations on labour, working conditions or environmental controls and to have direct access to markets around the globe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Uruguay Round may be seen as an attempt by the US to regain its preeminence as the world's economic superpower. In the past decade and a half, a significant proportion of worldwide manufacturing capacity has moved to low-wage countries, especially along the Pacific rim.  The US has attempted to protect its pre-eminent economic position through promoting a trading system <Col N="2064" /> which will serve its interests.  This is particularly true in the area of sophisticated computer technology, biotechnology, investment and financial services, telecommunications and the media.</P>
    <P>More than 100 countries are involved in the GATT negotiations, but it is the big players who dominate &mdash; the US, the EC and Japan.  The conflict between the US and Japan centres around the US-Japan trade deficit while agriculture subsidies are the main bone of contention between the US and the EC.</P>
    <P>While the heavyweights slug it out the development needs of the Third World are being squeezed or ignored.  The GATT view is that there is only one road to economic progress and that is through export-oriented growth, low wages and environmental degradation.</P>
    <P>Free trade promotes economic growth and thus raises more resources for environmental policy; trade measures that hinder economic growth are counter-effective. If conflicts arise between free trade and unilateral environmental measures, priority should be given to free trade.</P>
    <P>The lack of environmental awareness in the present provisions can give rise to the exclusion of environmental provisions in legislation in developed countries quite apart from preventing them being introduced in vulnerable underdeveloped ones.  The GATT panel found that the US tuna ban contravened GATT provisions and, therefore, constituted a discriminatory trade measure even though it was an environmental matter. For example, the Dutch proposal to import only sustainably produced timber, will be illegal under GATT by the year 1995.  From a Third World point of view any national policy towards sustainable management of forests will be undermined by the absence of such policies elsewhere.  Deregulated trade stimulates a growth pattern based on the lowest production costs.  So logging companies will relocate their activities at sites with the lowest production costs.  Poor countries heavily dependent on trade will have no choice but to grant concessions to the <Col N="2065" /> logging companies; hence a discouragement for countries to protect their own resources.</P>
    <P>Peter Sutherland, in an interview in <i>Newsweek</i> magazine last July, indicated that he might look at the environmental question once the present Uruguay Round is completed.  That is closing the door after the horse has bolted.  If the negotiations on the next agreement take as long as those on this one the polluting companies will be laughing all the way to the bank, secure in the knowledge that by that time they will have effectively buried any competitors who have any environmental conscience.  There is little thought about policies that reduce poverty, promote equitable distribution of wealth, sustainable development, environmental protection and self-reliance, especially in the area of food production.</P>
    <P>The rich north holds out the carrot of an expansion in world trade in the order of $200 billion a year to persuade the Third World to come aboard.  However, the Secretary General of the OECD who made that estimate pointed out that the figure is highly theoretical.  The putative gains will take place over ten years and some developing countries will be hurt. The estimated effects on some African countries already has shown that they will impoverish them further.  In any case, the approach involves recycling the old, discredited trickle down development theory.  the argument put forward is that the improved performance in northern economies will stimulate demand and open up more markets for products from the south.  The north will benefit from increased demand in the south.  Little thought has been given to the fact that economic growth in a finite world is often achieved only at the expense of the poor and of the environment.</P>
    <P>As it stands, GATT will significantly undermine environmental controls.  On 3 February 1992, just four months before the Earth Summit in Rio, GATT published its <i>Document on Trade and Environment.</i> That paper dissociates itself from the widely accepted sustainable development viewpoint, according to <Col N="2066" /> which economy and ecology should be linked and brings the discussion back several decades.  The document presents two basic options.  Effective measures to internalise environmental costs must be factored into the present round.  Otherwise there is no incentive to invest in conservation programmes or appropriate new technology.  The other key question that has yet to be faced up to is that of social equity.  To avoid the present downward level on wages, any future agreement must enshrine procedures that protect the rights of workers to organise freely, to join unions and to engage in free collective bargaining.  It must protect high safety and health standards and allow for adequate insurance for workers.  Competitiveness must not be achieved at the expense of workers' health and safety.  If trade is to be internationalised then so too must the essential rights that workers in developed countries have won and are now under threat.</P>
    <P>Poor countries need to be able to protect their markets, fledgling industries and agriculture.  Until the rise of the deregulation ideologues this was a central tenet of development economics.  Any multilateral trading agreement must seek also to promote the principles of sustainable development.  If the Rio conference in 1992 is to be anything more than a publicity jamboree for world politicians its principle of sustainable development must be adopted through the guarantee that environmental costs, which are increasing, and social costs are internalised in price structures.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between the traditional form of protectionism, which at this stage nobody is arguing for whereby tariffs and quotas sustained inefficient industries and the use of tariffs to protect countries from having as deplorable social and environmental record.  GATT may offer the only realistic way to foster an effective international environmental policy.  To do so it must specify those principles.  If it does not, the result will be further depression of wages, a reduction in workers' conditions <Col N="2067" /> and a drop in environmental standards worldwide.</P>
    <P>On the question of accountability, we have seen already the democratic deficit in the European Union.  Maastricht failed to meet the criteria of accountability.  On a larger scale still GATT procedures take place behind closed doors.  They are nondemocratic and non-transparent.  There are proposals for a multi-lateral trade organisation as a successor to the GATT secretariat.  As it stands that proposal would create an unaccountable, unelected body with immense powers.</P>
    <P>GATT may be about free trade but also it must be about other things &mdash; the freedom to work without exploitation, to live in a decent environment and to have access to information.  The democratic deficit is a serious matter that should be addressed.  We are debating GATT in a vacuum.  The sectoral analysis on Irish industry should have been published before this eleventh hour.  The fact that it is not is, to me, the most disturbing evidence that the Government is unprepared and unwilling to face up to the reality of a global agreement of this type and that will have major impact on the future for Irish people everywhere.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote the following from a recent article by the authors of a book entitled <i>The New Protectionism:</i></P>
    <P>Further trade liberalisation would take us in the wrong direction.  It encourages the big players to seek cheap labour, undermines public demands for tougher environment and consumer protection standards and widens the gap between rich and poor, while removing hard-won welfare safety nets in the interest of international competitiveness....</P>
    <P>If people want to protect their futures, they must press politicians to argue for more local trade and diversified economies.  Consumers should be encouraged to buy, first, locally produced goods and services, second, regionally produced ones, and globally produced ones only as a last resort.  For <Col N="2068" /> this to happen, the GATT would have to be transformed into a General Agreement on Sustainable Trade.</P>
    <P>That is unlikely to happen between now and 15 December, but it is important to record these fundamental points. However, at the end of the day they will prove prophetic in relation to the viewpoints being expressed at present on GATT.</P>

      <P>The Government's handling of the agricultural component of the current GATT talks has been incompetent and irresponsible.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry tamely acquiesced in the MacSharry agricultural policy reforms and did not understand until very late in the day to what extent these had been shaped to fit into a GATT deal which is totally unbalanced as far as the EC in general, and Ireland in particular, are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade last night, and the Minister of State tonight, virtually ignored the GATT provisions on agriculture and even though they are the basis of our motion.  He proposed an appallingly weak amendment which is as politically inept as the whole Government approach up to now. It is absolutely clear beyond any doubt that the Blair House Agreement does not take account of Ireland's concerns in relation to agriculture.  That is why we have put down this motion and that is why we reject the Government's empty, insane amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the GATT negotiations stand, the European community will be obliged to lower its internal agricultural price to world price levels; to reduce accordingly the level of export refunds and import levies required to sustain the target internal price levels; to substantially dismantle price support arrangements; to guarantee expanded access to Community <Col N="2069" /> markets for meat, diary products and other key products by exporters in other GATT partners while itself suffering a reduction in its ability to export and to accept that its meat exporters will continue to be excluded from the rapidly-growing Japanese market for meat.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost to Europe has been referred to by a number of commentators. It is generally accepted that if the Blair House Agreement is implemented in its present form it will result in the loss of 4.5 to 5 per cent of our net milk quota and a reduction in cattle exports of at least £500 million to £600 million.  This would be devastating for the Irish economy.  The agreement could reduce our GNP by 2.6 per cent, which would be a major blow to any hope of economic recovery.  We must not accept any agreement which constitutes a sell-out of the Irish national interest by the EC.  Let us consider the effect of this agreement on Ireland as opposed to other EC countries.  If Ireland has to bear a production cut of 15 per cent in beef, the relative burden will be almost 38 times as severe on the Irish economy as compared to the EC average.  If the uniform milk quota of 5 per cent is applied right across the Community the Irish economy will suffer 7.6 times more severely than other EC economies.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are fully convinced of the need for further liberalisation of world trade.  We support the general thrust of the GATT talks and indeed we are critical of the fact that some important areas of trade are not adequately covered by it.  We support the belief that trade liberalisation will give a further impetus to world growth and that there are gains to be made for all participants. However, in no other sector is there an imbalance between trading partners approaching that which will be created in agriculture by the Blair House Agreement.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the effects it will have on this country.  Under its provisions the European Community will be a net loser in all the key agricultural product areas. The US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will be substantial net gainers.  It is <Col N="2070" /> utterly irresponsible of the Government to conspire in capitulating to the interests of those of our partners who will not have to undertake any control of production or any limitation of their exports of the kind the EC is being asked to accept, which will heavily impact on Ireland.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion to strengthen the Government's position in the critical final stage of the negotiations.  The Government, however, is so inept and incompetent that it cannot see this.  I appeal to both Ministers here tonight that the sensible course to take is to withdraw the Government amendment, support our motion and get out and do some real negotiating rather than the limp posturing in which they have engaged up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time with me in this very important debate.  It is clearly obvious that the agricultural provisions of the Blair House Agreement are completely unbalanced and to the disadvantage of the European Community, particularly Ireland.  It is evident that the purpose of the proposals in the Blair House Agreement is to dismantle the EC Common Agricultural Policy and replace it with world prices.  Acceptance of the United States proposals will result in an income loss of approximately £900 million per year, or 60 per cent of farm incomes, to Irish farmers, with major losses to the Irish economy.  It is clearly evident that the purpose of the United States-CAIRNS group proposals is to gain free access to Europe's food markets. It is also evident that CAP reform constitutes the most complex and mind-boggling set of rules that would have a disastrous effect on the future of Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a very small nation, accounting for only 1 per cent of the total European population and only 0.1 per cent of the world population.  We are not blessed with a climate that will produce vines and citrus fruits; we are chiefly dependent on our agricultural industry which is our main natural asset.  Almost a quarter of <Col N="2071" /> a million people are employed, directly and indirectly, in this industry which accounts for one-third of total Irish exports.  In relative terms agriculture is more important to Ireland than to most other European countries.  Responsibility for the preservation of the fabric of rural society on this island and the protection of the most vulnerable section of that society, the farming community, particularly small farmers from Cork to Donegal, rests on the shoulders of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if the Blair House agreement is accepted by the Minister and the Taoiseach it will be deathknell of our farming industry.  Does this Government want to turn the entire western seaboard from Mizen Head to Malin Head into a wildlife reserve for wealthy Europeans and international tourists to enjoy safari trips to that region?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot sit idly by and allow this to happen.  Is the Minister aware that United States farmers are highly subsidised to the tune of more than £20 billion per year to boost their agricultural output while they are advocating the total abolition and elimination of protection and support for the Irish and EC farming industry.  It is of paramount importance that any long term world agreement must recognise the fundamental role of the family farm as the basic unit of production and the backbone of rural society.</P>
    <P>The scenario we are now witnessing could be easily avoided were it not for the fact that the EC Commissioner of the day threw in the towel at Dromoland Castle to the United States representatives and the CAIRNS group who were wined and dined while our Commissioner failed to take off the kid gloves in the fight to protect Irish farmers.  I ask the Minister &mdash; I am disappointed that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, is not here tonight to wind up this very important debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask those who are deputising for the Minister to spell out clearly the benefits which will accrue to Irish farmers from the Blair House Agreement.  So far as I can ascertain, any benefits are completely invisible or nonexistent. It appears that the Minister's motto is &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  If the Blair House Agreement is accepted in its present form Irish agriculture will be left in a dormant position.</P>
      <P>I do not have to remind the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry that increasing numbers of farmers are disappearing from rural Ireland every year.  My local co-op in west Cork has witnessed a scaling down of 50 per cent in its milk suppliers during the past five years.  What future is there for agriculture in the west of Ireland?  As an island nation we should be getting preferential treatment under any world trade agreement.  After England is joined to mainland Europe by the channel tunnel Ireland will be the only island nation in the EC.  The Taoiseach should visit as many capital cities as possible in an effort to engender support for Ireland's cause in the world trade agreement negotiations. It is most important that we do not sit back and be good Europeans on this issue.  We have to protect the future of our main industry, agriculture, and the only way to do this is by fighting for a better deal at the next world trade meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say first &mdash; I am sorry she has left the House &mdash; that it was bizarre to listen to Deputy McManus's solemn and gratuitous lecture about development issues and democratic deficits. I am afraid that Democratic Left has not yet woken out of its slumber.  The criticisms it makes of the capitalist system <Col N="2073" /> pale into insignificance when we remember that the COMECOM system not only was the most polluting system the world has ever known but was also the most oppressive system the world has ever known &mdash; it beggared and killed millions of small peasant farmers throughout the world.  Democratic Left has not yet found out that that system no longer exists. Democratic Left is not in any position to lecture anybody.</P>
      <P>It is a joke for a party which has so recently come out of the long sleep of democratic centralism to come in here and talk seriously to us about a democratic deficit.  There is another kind of deficit Democratic Left knows about &mdash; it is a very democratic deficit for it.  That party simply changed its name, walked away from debts and formed a new party. If anybody else in our economy did this, that party would be howling for new laws to enable the Revenue Commissioners to go after them to collect the money.  I am not a bit impressed by the complaints from Democratic Left that there have been few opportunities in this House to discuss the issues of GATT.  That party has much reshaping of its own thinking to do before it has much to tell the rest of the world about a democratic system of organising world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion, which I again invite the Government to support on reflection, deals only with the agricultural aspects of the GATT negotiations.  I was disappointed last night to hear the Minister for Tourism and Trade departing from his script &mdash; it is a dangerous thing to do if one does not know what one is going to say &mdash; and making smart alec remarks about the fact that there is more to the GATT than agriculture.  I know that perfectly well, but the agricultural part of GATT is the one which concerns us; it is the one which puts most pressure on Irish farming; it is the one which puts most pressure on the European Community. The Minister for Tourism and Trade and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are doing very little service to their Government and the people they represent when they come in here and <Col N="2074" /> make smart alec remarks and tell the rest of us that there is more to the GATT than agriculture.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is true that if one goes into any pub, club or other place where people meet in rural Ireland and listens to people talking about the GATT, they will be talking about the effects of the Blair House Agreement, that is the part of the agreement which will hurt them. They will not be talking about intellectual property rights &mdash; they are not very involved in that &mdash; or textiles because, as my colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford, pointed out, there are very few places left in the country where there is an immediate interest in the textile industry.  The Government has done its best to strangle the life out of this industry through the 21 per cent rate of VAT imposed in the last budget.  I am not talking about these issues, but I could talk about them.  We might have a lengthy debate here another night on areas with which the Minister for Tourism and Trade might claim some passing acquaintance.  It shows how little the Government cares about the damage which will be done to our agricultural industry and how little it can do about the issue confronting us when the Minister for Tourism and Trade can come into the House and speak to us for almost half an hour and ignore the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>That is the impression I have had from the very beginning of these discussions. As I said last night, I see very little evidence that the Government has made any real effort to deal with the issues facing us, to anticipate the effects of what it has agreed in a CAP reform was driven by Ray MacSharry's and Jacques Delors' intention to get a trade deal with the United States in the GATT.  That is the main reason the CAP reform took the shape it did.  When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, his lieutenant and the Minister for Tourism and Trade come into the House and say they will be happy if in some way they can make the GATT agreement fit within the framework of the CAP reform, it is an admission that they have been defeated <Col N="2075" /> right from the very beginning.  They were outsmarted by Ray MacSharry, who in turn was outsmarted by Carla Hills for the United States.  Since the beginning of these discussions, particularly since the discussion in Dromoland Castle, the European Community has allowed itself to be out manoeuvred, outboxed and outfoxed by the American negotiators.</P>
    <P>We have seen evidence of this even this week.  For the past forthnight the US negotiator, Mickey Kantor, has refused to talk to anybody else about the agricultural aspects of the GATT deal because, as he says, they are so busy getting agreement in Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement. That is very convenient story, but it is also a very transparent ploy.  He is like the young lady who likes to keep a few suitors dangling &mdash; he tells them he does not have time to talk to them now but if they hang around he might have some time to talk to them next week.  The love sick swains on the opposite side of the House, who only want to cosy up to the United States for a GATT deal fall for that story, hook, line and sinker. However, they will suffer the same fate as some of those smart alecs &mdash; they will be left on the shelf when the lassie has gone off with somebody else.  I am sorry to say that the Government is falling for that story.  It is one of the oldest tricks in the book in negotiations.  The Government has fallen for this story mainly because it was talked into it two years ago by Ray MacSharry.  As my colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford, said, it was not until we changed Commissioners that the Government began to come out of this trance and realise the danger we were in from the US-driven reform of the CAP.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry tried to give us the same ráiméis tonight as the Minister for Tourism and Trade tried to give us last night.  I want to quote comprehensively from his speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was stating the facts, but the Deputy did not want to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2076" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He said, for example, &ldquo;Notwithstanding the media focus, the agriculture aspects have not been either the only or the most difficult elements of the negotiations&rdquo;.  So what?  I am concerned about the agriculture side.  If we wanted to have a debate on the whole GATT we would have put down a motion to that effect.  But that is not what will ruin our farming population and our rural communities, it is the agriculture part of the GATT.  The Minister will not get away with trying to evade his responsibilities in this area.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say &ldquo;Apart from agriculture there are continuing and significant obstacles to be overcome in a number of important areas...&rdquo;.  I want to know why Minister McCreevy last night and Minister of State Hyland this evening raised that here.  Why do they want to discuss everything but what is in the motion?  I suspect the reason is they have not got the slightest clue what they will do to deal with the concerns we have put forward in the motion.  The Minister has shown his inadequacy again tonight; he has revealed just how little they want and how little they feel they can get.</P>
      <P>The Minister said tonight &ldquo;We have always emphasised that any GATT outcome must be comprehensive and balanced and not impose a disproportionate burden on any country or sector&rdquo;.  That is fine, but what will the agreement now before us do?  It will impose a disproportionate burden on one of the partners, the European Community, on all the partners of the European Community and particularly on us, because we are so much more dependent on agriculture than any other member state.  It will impose a disproportionate burden on one sector, agriculture, in the European Community.  As I pointed out last night, no other sector will find itself in a position where all the cards are stacked against it.  In the context of this GATT only in agriculture is there the kind of one way street we see.  There is no other sector where the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Canada gain all the way while the European Community loses all the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> In no other sector in this GATT does the European Community have to accept unilaterally restrictions on its level of production, restrictions on its ability to export and is required to obtain permission to operate any internal compensation for its own producers.  There is not other sector in the whole GATT.  If the Minister for Trade and Tourism, who says he is in charge of these negotiations, can contradict me, I challenge him to indicate any other sector where that is the case.</P>
    <P>What does the Government continue to say?  It wants reinterpretations and clarifications.  The Minister of State here tonight recalled for us again &mdash; as if we needed any reminding &mdash; the principle aspects of what will happen, the horror list.  Domestic supports will be reduced by 20 per cent; border measures such as variable levies will be reduced by 36 per cent; there will be minimal access commitments of up to 5 per cent of the Community market for other countries; average volumes of exports are to be reduced by 21 per cent and so on.  What does the Minister offer us as a consolation for that?  The Government is seeking reinterpretations and clarifications.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who is supposed to be doing everything on our behalf, do for us?  In a statement of 20 November 1992 he stated that he remained very concerned. I quoted from that statement last night and I was not very selective in doing so.  I quoted a whole series of statements from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry throughout the whole month of November last year, the month the Minister threw in the towel.  I even quoted a statement by the Taoiseach from November of last year when he ran up the white flag by saying that he believed Ray McSharry had got the balance right.  If ever a Taoiseach undermined his Ministers, that was the occasion when it was done.  If ever a Taoiseach cut the ground from under the man who was supposed to be negotiating on our behalf, that was the time it was done.  He said that Ray McSharry had got the balance right and thereby sold <Col N="2078" /> out the interests of Irish agriculture in this context.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister say in November of last year?  He said that he will need to be clear that these volume limitations can be accommodated within the CAP reform arrangements before there can be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the Agriculture Council. That was the surrender clearly signalled again.  That was an admission &mdash; and the more often it is stated the more tragic the admission becomes &mdash; that the pass was already sold before anybody ever sat down to discuss reinterpretations and clarifications of the Blair House Agreement. This Government praises the CAP reform, although its supporters do not. The members of Fianna Fáil Cumainn around the country would not give you a thank you for that CAP reform because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one can still find sensible people there.  They will not thank Minister of State Hyland for coming down to them and telling them that as a result of this CAP reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the accommodation of the GATT within the CAP reform, they are facing a 20 per cent reduction in milk prices over the next five years.  They are facing a 21 per cent reduction in the volume of beef production over the next five years and they will be wondering where they will go when they have to cope with another 2 per cent cut in their milk quota and when the intervention weight limit for beef is reduced to 340 kilos and they find that they cannot export live cattle any more because some of the markets to which they go will not qualify for export refunds.  They have no market to which they can sell their cattle.  They will not thank Minister Hyland for that and they <Col N="2079" /> will not thank him for telling them that this was all Ray MacSharry's idea and that this is the great CAP reform that the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, accepted last November.</P>
      <P>When we examine a little more closely what the Minister said tonight we see the real weakness in the Government's position.  What is the Government doing? Its difficulties are with the timescale for reducing subsidised exports by 21 per cent.  In other words, it is saying that it does not want to suffer too much of this 21 per cent cut in the first and second year; it wants it postponed until the fifth and sixth year.  What the Minister is actually saying when he puts this out &mdash; and this is an admission by him that what I am saying is true &mdash; is that he wants the European Community to ask Mickey Kantor, the US negotiator, not to hang us quickly but to strangle us slowly instead.</P>
      <P>I wonder is it the understatement of the century that the Minister said tonight that &ldquo;it remains our view that the current proposed commitments would create difficulties for Community and Irish agriculture&rdquo;? What is the man thinking of? What does he mean by difficulties? Milk producers are facing a 20 per cent reduction in the price of their product over the next five or six years.  Therefore, from receiving £1 a gallon now they will be down to 80p a gallon in five years' time in today's money terms.</P>

      <P>In addition to that they will have the right to produce 2 per cent less milk than they are producing now.  What will they do to support their families? How much jargon from Democratic Left will they be able to use to put bread on the table and to run a farm with a further quota cut of 2 per cent?  Some of the Deputies opposite might know a little about that. There are still a few small milk producers in my constituency of Kildare.  They are still a few in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. There are not too many in Longford-Roscommon; they have other things to <Col N="2080" /> do there.  There are still a few in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly and they will be seeking guidance from the Minister, but all he will offer them is his understanding of their difficulties when they cannot pay the bills.</P>
      <P>Beef producers are facing a reduction of 30 per cent in the price they get for their product and the volume of Community production will be cut by 9 per cent.  That will mean that the volume of production in this country will be cut by even more than that.  Therefore, people already under pressure and who cannot make a living will be told they will have to make do with less, all because ex-Commissioner Ray MacSharry got the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, to agree that we should all support this famous CAP reform driven from Washington.</P>

      <P>The decision by Neodata Services Incorporated to concentrate their data processing business in Boulder, Colorado, has sent shock waves through the communities and the workers in Newcastle West, Kilmallock, Listowel and Limerick City.  The two service locations in County Limerick &mdash; Kilmallock and Newcastle West &mdash; employ 214 workers.  They have become an integral part of both communities and have been in existence since the early seventies.</P>
      <P>As the workforce is predominantly female with secretarial skills the likelihood of they finding alternative jobs is remote.  Many of the employees are married and they are the main source of income in their families.  The single women may have to emigrate if they wish to continue doing secretarial work.</P>
      <P>The economy of west Limerick, which is already reeling because of the 140 job losses in Aughinish Alumina, will suffer the loss of more than £2 million in wages. Many of the workers, some of whom have given considerable service to the company, will join the dole queue.  Now that the company has indicated that these changes will take place from March 1994 it is imperative that the early response unit in the Department of Enterprise and Employment swings into action.  Also, Bord Tráchtála should assist the company in their market research of European companies to ensure that the skills in the company continue to be used and the jobs are saved.  This is vitally important. The Tánaiste, who is in the US, should go to Boulder, Colorado, and plead with the company on the importance of these customer service centres for the mid-west region.  I sincerely hope that every effort will be made to ensure that the jobs are protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>The announcement by Neodata Services Incorporated that it is consolidating its present subscription fulfilment operations at Boulder, Colorado, which in the absence of new business will lead to the closure of its plants at Listowel, Limerick City, Newcastle West and Kilmallock, came as a major shock to the mid-west region.  While I will give every support to the Minister and the IDA to get the required business to keep the plants open, it will not be an easy task.  What the management of Neodata Services Incorporated is saying is that it must win major orders from European companies who have their own arrangements in place at present.  What can Neodata offer them to change their suppliers? It is very difficult to get the required business.</P>
      <P>The Listowel plant employs 101 people, all of whom are women.  Their annual wages amount to more than £1 million.  This money is spent locally and makes a major impact in the town of Listowel and the surrounding villages.</P>
      <P>Neodata is an excellent employer.  The working conditions in the plant are excellent with good rates of pay.  The plant is equipped with state-of-the-art technology with direct lines of communication to the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of the plant will also be a serious blow to the social fabric of the area.  Over the years many of the women <Col N="2085" /> employed in Neodata married locally. Their children are now attending the local schools, etc.  If the plant is closed many of the single women among the workforce will be forced to leave the area.  This would be extremely sad for both the women and their families.  It is estimated that nowadays it costs £50,000 to create each individual job.  If the 100 jobs in Listowel are lost it will cost approximately £5 million to replace them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the people of Listowel which has a 20 per cent unemployment rate, to use all the resources in his Department to intervene immediately with the parent company to ask it to reverse this decision and also to convince it to postpone the March deadline until every avenue is explored to save the jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Finucane for sharing his time with me. Like my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, my main concern is for the loss of jobs in Listowel and the announcement yesterday by Neodata Services that it intends to implement, in the next 12 to 15 months, a broad restructuring of the company to improve customer service.  This is most unfortunate in that Neodata, particularly in Listowel, has given tremendous service.  It has an excellent workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to quantify the loss of 100 jobs, from a social and economic point of view, to an area such as Listowel which is already starved of employment as the vast majority of the employees are breadwinners.  I am informed that Neodata Services Incorporated in Listowel was most efficient. This is a tribute to the workers and management. For this reason I appeal to the IDA and Shannon Development to pull out all the stops &mdash; which I have no doubt they will &mdash; and to prepare a package, financial and otherwise, to retain the jobs in the region, with particular emphasis on Listowel.  Kerry Airport should be a major boost to Neodata and other industries in the area.  It is interesting to note in the statement issued by Neodata in <Col N="2086" /> Colorado that it has assigned a senior vice-president, Mr. Pat Donnellan, to seek viable business opportunities.  This phraseology leaves an opening for discussion and for this reason I appeal to the Minister to do all in her power to secure the retention of the jobs in the Limerick and Kerry areas.  If necessary, the jobs should be subsidised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who spoke on this matter this evening.  Quite rightly, the Deputies who contributed focused attention on their constituencies but other Deputies from the Limerick region raised the issue with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and me.</P>
      <P>It was with great regret that earlier this month we learned that Neodata had taken a strategic decision to consolidate all its business activities into two businesses and in two locations in the US. This will impact on us but there will be no impact on employment levels in Ireland before March next year.  Therein lies the opportunity.  The three Deputies who contributed to the debate this evening, Deputies Finucane, Deenihan and Foley and other Deputies from the region who have been involved referred to the time between now and March which must be used positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neodata currently employs 390 people in four operations at Limerick, Kilmallock, Newcastle West and Listowel and are valued employers in the region. Everyone to whom I have spoken stressed the high level of co-operation between the employer and the employees.  Everything possible will be done to address the issues and all will work to find a solution to retain as many jobs as possible.  We are working closely with Neodata which, over the next 12 to 15 months, will be implementing a broad restructuring of the corporation and will include a consolidation of subscription fulfilment operations.  Even before the announcement of the restructuring, I was encouraged to see that a specific team had been set up in Ireland by Neodata to <Col N="2087" /> identify new business alternatives for its Irish based operations.  This team is headed by Mr. Pat Donnellan, a senior vice-president of the corporation who has been specifically assigned to Ireland for this purpose.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has already spoken to Mr. Donnellan and advised him that we will provide whatever assistance we can to maintain as many existing jobs as possible. The State agencies will be working closely with this team.  In addition, a very experienced official in my Department has been assigned to work specifically with Mr. Donnellan and he has already gone about that business.  This official has been very much involved in the industrial side of the Department and he has great skill in these matters.  The fact that he has been assigned to work specifically with Neodata shows the importance we attach to it and a hands on approach will be taken to this very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Neodata has been a major employer in the region and all the Deputies who spoke stressed this point.  It is important to stress that the decision to centralise subscription fulfilment operations into what the corporation calls &ldquo;customer service centres&rdquo; in Colorado is not a reflection on the performance of any one individual operation but is primarily in direct response to the demands of clients.</P>
    <P>Last year Neodata experienced operating difficulties in a number of key areas, including magazine subscriptions.  Earlier this year the board moved to address the problems to restore profitability and confidence of clients and to organise the business to meet these objectives.  This entailed Neodata reducing its spread of four businesses in 22 locations to two businesses in the US.</P>
    <P>At present the Irish operation carries out a number of functions on a centralised basis for magazine subscriptions. In recent years approximately one-third of order inputting had returned to the US for processing due to demands from clients for shorter processing time cycles. Although the computing area generally continues to be very volatile, Ireland continues <Col N="2088" /> to be an attractive location for, US companies.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by Neodata's high priority to seek viable business opportunities for its workforce in Ireland and to retain as many of the existing jobs as possible.  Let me assure the House that we will continue to work closely with all our existing companies to maintain employment at the highest possible levels.  Deputies from all parties have expressed the real concerns of the workforce in all those locations.  The highest priority is attached in the Department to retaining as many jobs in Neodata or to attracting existing branches of industry to those locations.  There is a strong work ethic in those regions, the workers have been used to working hard and have industrial experience which is very highly valued.  The Minister and I are very keen to maintain the momentum and we cannot let it drop in the four to five months we have at our disposal.  I will keep in touch with Deputies from all parties on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is on Government business in Brussels this evening and tomorrow.  We have already spoken about this matter and he has spearheaded the drive to find an urgent solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond to the matter.  The livestock industry is extremely important to the economy.  There will be enormous opportunities for job creation if the correct environment is provided by the Government and the European Community. There is a great deal of anxiety among the workers in the meat factories and there are two such factories in Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency I represent, Meadow Meats in Clones and Liffey Meats.  They believe that exporters of live cattle have an advantage because of the export refunds payable on exports to <Col N="2089" /> third countries.  Some may argue that there is a difference of between £30 and £100 for cattle exported live and those exported in processed form.  I realise the importance of the live export trade to underpin the price of cattle and provide competition which results in reasonable prices being paid.  However, there is a danger when too great an advantage is given to the dead meat trade or the live export trade that farmers &mdash; and the nation as a whole &mdash; will suffer in the longer term.  We have had bitter experience of this in the past when we had very few live exports.</P>
      <P>There is an additional problem that some farmers are afraid to finish top quality cattle for the dead meat trade because of the weight limit on intervention stock. The present intervention limit of 380 kilos will be lowered to 360 kilos from 1 January 1994 and further reduced to 340 kilos on 1 July 1994 and at that stage 60 per cent of our cattle numbers would be ineligible for intervention.  This means that many of our cattle, most of which have great potential, are being exported live solely because of the failure of the Minister to have this regulation changed. The worry among farmers is acute as farmers obviously have to think ahead. They realise that without the live trade, the Iranian and other dead meat contracts, the safety net now available is extremely weak.  I would urge the Minister to have the export refunds increased for the dead meat trade to bring them into line with the live export trade so that both sectors can compete on an even playing field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some farmers are so worried about grading standards that they are inclined to be drawn towards the live trade where they will know exactly what they will get, rather than to the factories.  The Minister should make sure that there are opportunities for those who want to work in the industry.  With so many people unemployed we need to keep as many people as possible at home.  I would rather see people being kept here and cattle being slaughtered and processed here than <Col N="2090" /> cattle being exported live, provided a reasonable price is paid to the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the substance of this debate, I want to put on record the policy of this Government in relation to the beef industry.  In simple terms, our policy is to encourage the industry to exploit all market opportunities which facilitate the processing of beef to the maximum extent possible and at the same time to ensure adequate returns to the farmers involved. Clearly, it is in the interests of the State that the industry maximises the added value and employment content of our beef exports and this objective underpins the criteria laid down by my Department and the IDA for the provision of grant-aid to the beef sector.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that competition between the live export trade and exporters of beef has been a feature of the beef industry for many years.  Each side has claimed from time to time that the export arrangements confer an advantage on their competiors but both have managed to co-exist reasonably peacefully for the most part. As far as the Government is concerned, while our strong preference is for our beef to be processed to the maximum extent possible, we see a role for a limited live export trade.  The reality is that there are some markets in third countries which unfortunately prefer to secure their beef import requirements in the form of live cattle rather than in the form of beef. Furthermore, some third countries simply do not have the necessary infrastructure to handle frozen beef and, since the distance is too great to export fresh or chilled beef, the demand in those countries is for live animals.  However, an advantage should not be conferred on the live trade and I would prefer that exports of beef should be encouraged and facilitated over exports of live cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the position of live cattle and beef under the export refund system, I am aware that the amount of <Col N="2091" /> export refund payable on live cattle is higher than that on beef.  The extent of the advantage in favour of live cattle depends on a number of factors, most notably the kill-out percentage of the animal and the boneless meat yield of the carcase.  As I said earlier, I do not favour giving an advantage to the live trade but I must explain that responsibility for fixing export refunds rests with the EC Commission following a vote in the Beef Management Committee.  Other member states and the EC Commission see the live export trade as a useful mechanism for disposing of surplus cattle without recourse to intervention.  We have to see this approach against the background of enormous sales into intervention in recent years and intervention stocks of over one million tonnes of beef at the beginning of the year.  Indeed, the Commission consider that this policy has been rather successful this year in that sales into intervention both in Ireland and the Community as a whole have only been a fraction of the quantities purchased into intervention in recent years.  Clearly, other factors have contributed to this development but, nevertheless, the Commission believe that equalising refunds as between live cattle and beef would result in higher sales into intervention.</P>
    <P>As regards the weight limitations on carcases sold into intervention, the Deputy will be aware that we have opposed this regulation with all means at our disposal, including taking the matter to the European Court of Justice.  I find it a little difficult to understand the connection being made between the export of live cattle and the introduction of the intervention weight limit, particularly since the bulk of animals exported live have been the lighter animals which were unlikely to reach 380 kgs dead weight even if they were brought to maturity. The Minister is very pleased that the meat factories have been able to cope with the 380 kgs weight limit this autumn.  That they have been able to do so is due to the substantial contracts which they have secured for the export of boneless beef to Iran and which take carcases up to 420 <Col N="2092" /> kgs.  This follows on strenuous efforts by the Minister and the Department to reopen the Iranian market.  Nevertheless, I want to congratulate the beef industry on their success in securing these contracts, which have helped to maintain cattle prices at relatively high levels this autumn.  Indeed, the beef industry has made magnificent efforts this year to secure commercial markets for their beef and to reduce reliance on intervention.</P>
    <P>Some statistics will help to illustrate this point.  In the period January to November last year, the beef industry sold some 633,000 steer carcases into intervention and 147,000 carcases on the commercial market.  This year they sold 159,000 steer carcases into intervention and 500,000 on the commercial market. In other words, they have increased their commercial sales of steer beef by 240 per cent this year.  This was a tremendous performance and I hope that the industry will be able to build on it next year and in the years to come.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, our policy will continue to be to encourage the beef industry to fully exploit all the opportunities for maximising the added value and employment content of our cattle and beef industry and, in the context of this policy, we will endeavour to ensure in so far as we can, that the beef industry does not operate under a disadvantage compared to the live trade.</P>

      <P>I wish to highlight for the Minister's urgent attention the situation which arose yesterday when a District Court judge once again severely criticised the Government for failing to provide adequate accommodation for seriously disturbed children.  Ireland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and we will be reporting to the UN monitoring committee in September next year.  Will the details of this case form part of our report?  How can we hold our heads high if we allow situations like this to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> Our children are our future and we must invest in them.  It is outrageous in this day and age that this child's ticket to care is to be labelled &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;.  The development of services for children has received much attention recently here because of the Kilkenny case.  However, clearly that was not the end of the story. This is another example of the breakdown in our services for children.  This case illustrates very clearly that there is urgent need for good planning and coordination between the different agencies and Departments involved in the provision of services for children.  It has been said that the mark of a civilised society is how we approach our children, more particularly our disturbed, needy, vulnerable children.  Is it not outrageous that a nine year old boy had to be classified as being criminal in order to secure facilities to help him?  If we cannot provide suitable therapeutic care and facilities for a nine year old boy how can we cope with the demands of many young troubled people as they grow into adolescents? How can we provide suitable services for older age groups if we cannot provide for the smaller number of nine year olds who will need these services? This situation illustrates the need to update our 1908 legislation in relation to juvenile justice.  Is the Department of Justice prioritising this issue?</P>
    <P>The professionals working in this field say there is a constant problem with a small number of very difficult, out of control and disturbed children.  If we do not provide adequate care and facilities, some of those children are likely to face the risk of homelessness, prostitution and other forms of abuse and exploitation, I believe this is happening already.  The court system constantly faces difficulties in trying to help such children.  The professionals are tired writing to various Ministers and to one another seeking solutions. It is clear that a range of care services must be provided for disturbed and out of control children and adolescents. The most extreme form of care we need to secure, therapeutic units for a small number of children, which are <Col N="2094" /> open, halfway houses and a support to families.</P>
    <P>This position arises also with mentally handicapped children who face particular behavioural problems at times, who are beyond parental control and face the lack of respite care and appropriate units. Many of those families are under extreme stress.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Ministers for Health, Education and Justice work together to solve this problem. The children and their families suffer and future generations will bear the cost.</P>
    <P>There is a deeply felt level of frustration on the part of the many dedicated workers involved in trying to help those children at what appears to be a total lack of cohesion, planning and liaison between Departments and health boards in tackling this problem.  Will the Minister put in place a system that, once and for all, will examine this issue, analyse the needs and plan the resources needed to provide care for those children?  This is not necessarily a matter of providing buildings, but of taking a serious, coordinated and high level approach to the problem and it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that approach is adopted.</P>

      <P>The increasing frequency with which young offenders are appearing before our courts on serious charges and attracting custodial sentences is a matter of serious ongoing concern.  Indeed, it was in response to this development and the resultant need to provide adequate and suitable places to accommodate such cases, that the Government embarked on a programme of expansion of young offender facilities in 1991.</P>
      <P>As a result of this programme, a new custodial facility for young male offenders has been opened at Oberstown Boys' Centre in Lusk, County Dublin.  In addition, the existing remand facility for girls at Oberstown has been expanded to incorporate a new long-stay facility for girls, the first such long-stay facility for girls to be provided in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now five centres for juvenile offenders committed by the courts.  Trinity <Col N="2095" /> House in Lusk, provides secure accommodation for up to 30 boys.  The Finglas children's centre comprises St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Centre for up to 20 boys and St. Laurence's industrial school which can accommodate up to 55 boys on long-stay detention.  St. Joseph's industrial school, Clonmel, can accommodate up to 75 boys on long term detention.  In addition, the new facility to which I referred, at Oberstown boys' centre, can accommodate up to 30 boys.</P>
    <P>In the case of young female offenders, Oberstown girls centre is able to accommodate up to seven girls placed on remand and a further eight girls in its newly commissioned long term unit.</P>
    <P>In addition to these recent developments, work is taking place on the planning of a new and expanded facility for young female offenders.  This development, which is expected to commence next year, will not only make additional places available for young female offenders but will have the added benefit of releasing accommodation currently occupied by girls for use by Oberstown boys' centre.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the nature and purpose of young offender centres is such that very careful planning is necessary at all stages to ensure that the best interests of the inhabitants are served while at the same time ensuring that the special nature of the facility is not undermined.</P>
    <P>The developments which have already taken place and those currently in the pipeline will make a significant contribution to meeting the demand for places for young offenders.  The question of whether, or to what extent, any further provisions may be necessary is a matter which is kept under ongoing review by an interdepartmental group comprised of representatives of the Departments of Education, Justice and Health.  If a need for further provision is indicated, the necessary steps will be taken.</P>
    <P>However, it is extremely important that recourse to custodial measures should not be seen as the panacea to <Col N="2096" /> present difficulties.  In this regard, I would be in strong agreement with the views expressed by the Dáil's Select Committee on Crime which studied the question of juvenile crime in great detail. In its first report, that committee attached particular importance to the need for maximum possible reliance on non-custodial and early intervention measures and emphasised the overriding importance both for society and the individual of preventing a child from slipping into a lifetime of crime.</P>
    <P>A further area of great importance is the need to ensure that inappropriate referrals to young offender centres do not take place simply because of a lack of more suitable alternative provision. Some recent cases, which have attracted media attention, suggest that current responses are not always fully satisfactory in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that the primary consideration in dealing with young people who came into conflict with the law must be to provide a response which addresses their real needs.  The fact that a child commits an offence may only be a symptom of much deeper problems and may perhaps result from serious psychiatric, psychological or other difficulties.</P>
    <P>Where such is the case, recourse to custody in a young offender centre is not necessarily the proper response and may in fact only exacerbate the child's difficulties.</P>
    <P>The process of predicting future demand for young offender accommodation is extremely difficult and given the very high cost factors involved, requires very careful planning.</P>
    <P>The considerations which I mentioned can have a significant bearing on the ultimate level of demand for accommodation in young offender centres.  In this regard, I am confident that the forthcoming juvenile justice Bill will give positive expression to the importance of non-custodial measures in dealing with those children who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in conflict with the law in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for selecting this topic and the Minister for coming into the House to respond.  It has been a long day for the Minister and I appreciate the fact that she has made herself available to reply to a simple issue in many ways, but not simple in respect of the impact it has had on a number of substitute teachers in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>The problem arose because of a change in the procedure of payments in the payments section of the Department of Education. As a result, a problem arose and was first brought to my attention on 22 October when salary cheques due to substitute teachers did not arrive.  A total of 700 substitute teachers did not receive a salary that week and a number of them are still awaiting payment in respect of that week.  I understand there have been improvements in the meantime and that the list of teachers now awaiting payment has been reduced to approximately 500. Nonetheless, that is an unacceptable number of people in the public service left without pay.</P>
      <P>Substitute teachers have enough difficulties to contend with.  In most, if not all, cases substitute teachers are as highly qualified as teachers in the permanent service.  When employed they carry out their work as conscientiously and as competently as any permanent teacher and that matter has been well adjudged by the inspectorate and school principals. They should not be treated in that manner.  If a delay of that nature was visited on our permanent teaching force, intense union pressure would be applied, there would be intense ministerial activity and the matter would be settled before now.  It is grossly unfair and unjust that a greater sense of urgency has not been applied in dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these substitute teachers are married with families.  Indeed, some are the sole breadwinner.  Like the rest of us they have to meet mortgage repayments, rent payments and other demands.  They can ill-afford to do without or wait for three weeks for a salary cheque.  Given the high cost of living all of us need every <Col N="2098" /> last penny of what we earn.  If our salaries are not paid on time we are placed at a severe disadvantage.  It is grossly unfair that substitute teachers have had to wait for so long to have the matter resolved.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to intervene at this stage to find a solution to the problem and, having found that solution, she should be able to say to these teachers that this delay was unacceptable and will not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the Deputy the position in relation to the payment of substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out first that the conditions of service of substitute teachers have improved considerably in recent times.  Qualified substitute teachers are now granted, subject to certain conditions, both incremental and pensionable credit for their service in primary schools.  The rate of daily pay of qualified substitutes has increased from £38 in January 1990 to the current rate of £60.22.</P>
      <P>I have also established this year three pilot projects of supply panels whereby the short term substitution requirements of designated schools in the project areas are provided by temporary teachers.  The information I am receiving indicates that the pilot projects are very satisfactory. The teachers providing these substitution needs are paid as temporary teachers.</P>
      <P>A new payroll system for the payment of substitute teachers was introduced by my Department on 29 October last.  The new payroll system is an extension of the main payroll system for the payment of permanent and temporary teachers which was introduced last December.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the new substitute payroll system has a number of advantages over the system it replaces.  Payments for service given by qualified substitutes in different schools can be issued in a single payment.  In the old payroll system only one payment could be issued to a teacher in any one week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new system enables my Department to deal effectively with claims for <Col N="2099" /> the reckoning of incremental and pensionable service for substitute teachers. This was a very difficult and cumbersome process with the old payroll system.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new system has enabled the amount of time for the input of applications to be extended.  In the old payroll system it was only possible for staff of my Department to input claims for four days per week.  It is now possible to input for a minimum of 4.5 days.</P>
    <P>The new payroll system has many controls to avoid overpayments.  Unfortunately, if the application form for the payment of a substitute is not completed fully and accurately by the principal teacher and the chairperson of the board of management the claim cannot be input into the new payroll system because of the inbuilt controls.  In such circumstances it is necessary for the staff of my Department to return the form to <Col N="2100" /> the chairperson for completion.  This can result in delays in the payment issuing to a substitute teacher.  At present there is a one week delay in the issue of payments.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised both the INTO and the managerial authorities of the difficulties in relation to the filling of the application form.  I am confident that, as chairpersons realise the difficulties being caused by the incomplete filling of forms, they will ensure that only properly completed forms will be submitted.  This will enable my Department to issue payments promptly.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that substitute teachers will be paid on a fortnightly basis in the future.  The introduction of fortnightly payments is being delayed until the present difficulties with the application forms are resolved.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 November 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 150 and 156 together.  I am aware of the significant growth in participation in the post leaving certificate (PLC) element of the vocational preparation and training programme operated by my Department.  Approximately 16,000 students participate annually on these courses.  They are aimed at those who have completed senior cycle or a VPT-1 programme but who need to further develop their vocational skills in order to enable them to secure employment commensurate with their general level of education.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these courses prepare young people effectively for active participation in the labour market.  The latest placement surveys suggest that approximately 75 per cent of participants are placed in employment or further training.  The programme is designed to provide a flexible response to local labour market needs and emerging job prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The running costs of these courses, <Col N="1855" /> which are delivered outside the third level sector, are already funded by my Department with support from the European Social Fund.  I am sure the House will appreciate the need to strike a balance between competing demands for resources in the education sector, funding for the different levels of the system, initial and second chance education, student supports, investment in quality assurance and special measures to combat disadvantage and underachievement.</P>
    <P>To provide a maintenance grants scheme for participants would cost of the order of £8 million per annum.  In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification assessed arrangements, in programme development, in inservice training, and in ensuring that courses continue to be available in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have set up an independent advisory group to review the present grant schemes, and I am pleased to inform my colleagues that their review is expected shortly on my desk.  I hope to have the report published before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 60 together.  I do accept that schools, particularly the larger schools, are complex organisations which require careful management if they are to be run effectively and efficiently.</P>
      <P>The principal has a pivotal role in this but she or he requires the support and assistance of the vice-principal and other holders of posts of responsibility within the school if she or he is to fulfil this role.</P>
      <P>My Department recognises the role played by vice-principals in the running of post-primary schools.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the recognition, on an ex-quota basis, of the vice-principal post in schools of 500 or more pupils to be implemented on a phased basis commencing in 1992-93. To date two thirds of the schools concerned have benefited from this provision and the remainder will qualify for the allocation next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made at present for the reduction in the teaching hours of vice-principals to enable them to devote time to management and administrative duties in the school.  The reduction in hours <Col N="1857" /> varies depending on the size of the school.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that the larger the school the greater the administrative input required.  However, this does not necessarily mean that extra vice-principal posts have to be created.  Holders of posts of responsibility should be involved also.</P>
    <P>The larger schools have greater numbers of post-holders and it is open to the authorities of the school concerned to allocate specific duties to post-holders to ensure the smooth and efficient running of their schools.  There is an ongoing debate about the selection, appointment and training of teachers for posts of responsibility including principal and vice-principal. These matters were discussed at the recent National Education Convention.</P>
    <P>The question of allocating additional vice-principal posts to schools has to be considered in the context of the competing demands for the resources available for education generally.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a psychological service which carries out individual assessments is at present provided by the health boards throughout the country.

      <P>My Department's psychological service carries out individual assessments in post-primary schools to the extent possible within resources.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Erasmus programme, which is funded by the Commission of the European Communities, encourages third level students to pursue their studies for a period of up to one year in another member state.  While participating in the programme, students receive a mobility <Col N="1861" /> grant from the EC Commission.  This student mobility grant is not a full grant but should be seen rather as a contribution towards such costs as travel expenses between home and host country; costs of language courses taken in preparation for the period of study abroad; and extra expenses arising from higher costs of living in the host country.</P>
    <P>The scheme does recognise that students can face higher living costs when studying in other member states.  Factors taken into account include the length of the period to be spent abroad and the student's destination.  Participants who are in receipt of higher education grants in Ireland continue to have their fees paid and to benefit from their grants during the period of study in another member state.</P>
    <P>The success of the Erasmus programme is high lighted by the large number of applicants each year, and by the exceptionally high rate of participation by Irish students.  With such a high level of participation, it is inevitable that the level of grant assistance is lower.</P>
    <P>The Erasmus programme is widely recognised as a most successful EC programme. The current phase of the programme terminates in 1994 and I shall make every effort at EC level to secure a commitment to the provision of additional resources to support large scale student exchanges and a higher level of student mobility grant to individual students under the eventual arrangements for the new phase of the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 26 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The retention of individual pupils in national schools is a matter for the board of management in each case and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister to give any guarantee in this regard.</P>
      <P>I would, however, be seriously concerned at any suggestion that a pupil who is capable of benefiting from receiving an education in an integrated setting might be denied access because of a disability.</P>
      <P>Where children suffering from a disability, including Downs Syndrome, are integrated into mainstream schools, a range of support services is provided.</P>
      <P>In some cases, the service of a remedial teacher is sufficient and there are currently 1,033 such teachers in place.  In other cases, the support of a visiting teacher or a resource teacher may be an appropriate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, my Department appointed an additional eight teachers to the Visiting Teacher Service in 1992 as part of a development aimed at extending the role of that service to embrace Downs Syndrome children. Arrangements for the delivery of this extended service are now in place and the initial concerntration will be on those children specifically identified by the <Col N="1864" /> Downs Syndrome Association as requiring the service.  The intention is that this expanded service will embrace as many additional children as possible having regard to the case loads of the visiting teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>In certain situations, the alternative of allocating resource teachers to support ordinary teaching staff in dealing with handicapped children is pursued. Already, seven such appointments have been made and I expect to announce some further appointments in the near future.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the child in question will be taken fully into account in the context of these developments.  I should also mention that the special education review committee, whose report I have just recently received, has produced a range of detailed recommendations on future services for children with special needs, including those attending mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>I will be giving consideration to these recommendations as part of an overall review of services in the special needs area.  I should also mention that I am holding a special seminar on 6 December next to facilitate a full debate on future services for special needs children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 38, 78 and 86 together.  I wish to reject the suggestion that there has been lack of action on my part in relation to this particular issue.  It is, and has been, regarded as a very serious matter and strenuous efforts have been made to have it resolved.</P>
      <P>There are differences in the conditions of service of teachers in the three post-primary sectors.  The number of hours which a teacher is required to teach is just one element of these conditions and it is not appropriate that this one element should be dealt with in isolation.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in the service to which the Deputy refers amounts to approximately 2.4 per cent in total in teaching hours. The shortfall has arisen as a direct result of the unilateral action of the Teachers Union of Ireland.  There has been no agreement on the reduction of teaching hours for vocational teachers.  There can be no question of making good this shortfall in present circumstances.  The cost involved would be in excess of £2 million in a full year.  I cannot justify the expenditure of this amount to make up a small loss of teaching service when there are so many other pressing needs in the education sector particularly as the voluntary secondary sector and the community and comprehensive school sectors are operating on a maximum of 22 hours teaching per week.  Vocational education committees are being instructed to take the necessary steps to ensure that their authorised teacher allocations for the 1993-94 school year are not exceeded.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the teachers who graduate from the various third level institutions should be proficient in both knowledge of and pedagogical skills in the teaching of arts and culture.</P>
      <P>The area of arts and culture is a significant and distinctive curricular area within Irish education at all levels.</P>
      <P>I am also of the view that through learning and appreciating art students not only acquire a particular competence in this area, but are also afforded the opportunity to develop their imagination.  I intend, therefore, to have this issue addressed in some detail in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, while a lot has been achieved in the area of in-service for teachers in the arts and culture in the past, a more extensive range of courses will be planned for the future.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been involved for a number of years in the organisation of a number of National and International Art Exhibitions which, I think, has given teachers and students the opportunity to experience art and culture from a broader perspective.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Primary Curriculum Review Body made certain recommendations regarding the Arts in the Curriculum.  The NCCA have established a committee representative of the interested parties to examine these recommendations and advise me regarding future content in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When decisions are taken on these curriculum matters, it will be necessary that pre-service training incorporate the new <Col N="1867" /> approach and that in-service training be developed to ensure that changes agreed upon are implemented at classroom level.</P>
    <P>With regard to second level, a new syllabus in art, craft and design was introduced at junior certificate level in 1993. A report on the answering of candidates in the art examination 1993 reflected the success of the recent changes in that syllabus. A new syllabus in music will be examined, for the first time, in the junior certificate examination in June, 1994. This new syllabus places greater emphasis on performing skills and on simple composition.</P>
    <P>At senior cycle level, a new syllabus in music was introduced for the leaving certificate examination in 1991 and subsequent years.  Revised syallabuses for other leaving certificate subjects, including art, craft and design, are currently being prepared on a phased basis by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 39 and 98 together.  The survey in question was one referred to by me when addressing the Association of Remedial Teachers of Ireland conference in September, 1993.  It involved a national sample of fifth class and 11-year old pupils and was carried out in 1988.</P>
      <P>The results of this survey showed that no significant changes in average levels of reading attainment had taken place since 1980.  Comparisons between the 1988 survey and a survey which was carried out in 1972 indicated that reading standards of primary cycle pupils improved by approximately eight months in terms of reading age during the intervening period.</P>
      <P>The national surveys suggest, therefore, that there has been some improvement since the early seventies.  While these are largely in line with European standards, that is not to say that I am fully satisfied with the level of improvement that has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I would like to draw attention to the fact that I have provided for a further increase in the number of remedial teachers and for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in 1993.  In-service <Col N="1869" /> courses on the identification, remediation and prevention of learning difficulties in pupils is a priority for the in-service programme for teachers.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the 1988 survey report a further survey of 11-year-old and fifth class pupils to establish their reading attainment levels and to monitor trends in reading achievement over time was conducted in May 1993.  That is a more detailed survey which is taking into account the views of parents and teachers.  Data is currently being analysed and I will take these results into account when deciding further measures in this whole area.</P>

      <P>My Department was directly involved in the organisation and delivery of 13 courses during the summer of 1993.  A total of 394 teachers participated in those courses.  In line with the recommendations of the Primary Education Review Body, the role of the Department inspectorate in the direct organisation and delivery of in-service courses was significantly reduced in 1993.  The Review Body also recommended that for the most part the inspectors' role should be one of co-ordination and monitoring rather than direct provision.  In this regard my Department approved 465 such courses during 1993.  While final figures on participation on these courses are not available as yet, it is expected that approximately 11,000 teachers would have participated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that an In-service Committee was established in 1992.  Following consultation with interested parties, this committee decided on priority areas for in-service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>I have been aware for some time of an increase in the reported incidence of bullying in primary and post-primary schools.  Accordingly, last April, I established an expert working group to produce draft guidelines for me to counter such behaviour in schools.  The group's draft guidelines were forwarded to me in June 1993 and subsequently to the relevant groups, that is managerial authorities, teacher unions and the National Parents' Council, for observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to be in a position to say that I launched the finalised guidelines on 30 September last, and I am confident that they will prove to be of very real benefit and assistance to schools in both preventing, and dealing with, bullying <Col N="1873" /> behaviour in our schools.  Every child has the right to attend school in an atmosphere of caring and calm.  Victims of bullying behaviour are clearly denied this right.  Bullying behaviour is unacceptable and must be seen as such by teachers, parents and pupils.  The guidelines state that the creation of a positive school climate which focuses on respect for the individual, is at the centre of a whole school response to bullying.  When staff, pupils and parents are involved in the development of a school behaviour policy, they are more likely actively to support it.  I am confident, therefore, that the guidelines, which are being issued to primary and post-primary schools this week, will assist schools in identifying the incidence of bullying and in reducing the level of bullying in our schools.  I expect the guidelines to be adopted by each school board of management.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in my guidelines that schools monitor the effectiveness of school policy on this issue and their views will, of course, be taken into account in my review of the guidelines.  I will be closely monitoring the number and type of bullying behaviour cases reported to my Department during the present school year and I will review the situation at the end of that school year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grades obtained in Irish at the leaving certificate over the last three years show no particular trend in that <Col N="1874" /> the percentages of students obtaining the various grades have, to a large extent, remained fairly constant.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, that of the order of 20 per cent of candidates fail to secure a grade D in the subject particularly among those taking the ordinary level papers.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that pupils who took the foundation level Irish for the junior certificate examination in 1992 may have a difficulty in taking the ordinary level syllabus in the Leaving Certificate course.  A programme exists &mdash; the present senior certificate course &mdash; which has an Irish component in it.  As an interim measure only, pending review of the leaving certificate syllabuses, it is open to pupils taking the leaving certificate examination in 1994 and 1995 to study Irish from the senior certificate programme as an alternative to the leaving certificate Irish ordinary level programme. I have arranged that a new leaving certificate syllabus at foundation level will be introduced in 1994 and it will be examined for the first time in the leaving certificate examination in 1966.</P>
    <P>The new applied courses at the leaving certificate which will replace the existing senior certificate and vocational preparation and training courses will also have an Irish component.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is at present revising the Irish syllabuses at higher and ordinary levels and it is anticipated that these new syllabuses will be introduced for the school year 1995-96.</P>
    <P>Through these measures, a variety of new courses in Irish will be introduced over the next few years and this will give all students the opportunity of studying Irish at a level appropriate to their abilities.</P>

      <P>In line with established practice, my Department is prepared to consider the provision of a course to train additional teachers in braille, subject to the emergence of a reasonable level of demand for such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would not expect that the demand would be such as to warrant the establishment of a centre dedicated to that purpose.  Accordingly, I would not <Col N="1876" /> envisage the establishment of such a centre.</P>
    <P>Children suffering from serious visual impairment are catered for in two special schools which are dedicated to meeting the particular needs of such children. Instruction in the use of braille is available in both these schools.</P>
    <P>Children with less serious visual impairment can often function very satisfactorily in an integrated setting.  Where necessary, such children receive special additional support from the Visiting Teacher Service which includes teachers who are competent to deliver instruction in the use of braille.</P>
    <P>The allocation of classroom, or childcare, assistants has for some years been the subject of a general embargo on appointments in the public sector. However, I am very conscious of the need for a wide availability of this valuable support resource and I will be examining the possibility for some initiative in this area in the context of the recommendations in the report of the Special Education Review Committee.</P>

      <P>The annual survey of school-leavers from second level schools in 1990-91 was carried out for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The data in the report of the survey is based on an analysis of a sample of some 2,200 school-leavers out of a total of almost 67,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the sample studied 103 leavers left the education system in 1990/91 without <Col N="1878" /> a formal qualification.  Using this number it was estimated that the total number of unqualified leavers was 5,200.  This estimate is subject to sampling error.  The corresponding numbers in 1989-90 were 88 and 3,600 respectively.</P>
    <P>As stated in the commentary to the survey, caution is needed in interpreting some of the results especially those relating to school-leavers without any formal qualifications as the numbers in the sample sub-group in this category are relatively small.  Also the possibility of random fluctuations in the numbers of unqualified leavers is greater than for qualified leavers due to the statistical methodology used to weight sample results.  Consequently the increase in the number of unqualified leavers between 1989-90 and 1990-91 may not be statistically significant.  Indeed it has been calculated that, using sample numbers of 103 and 88, there is at least a one in three probability that the difference of 1,600 occurring in the estimated numbers of unqualified leavers between 1989/90 and 1990-91 is due to random sampling fluctuation.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary to wait the findings of the survey of school-leavers in 1991-92 carried out earlier this year to see if the results for 1990-91 were exceptional or representative of a trend.</P>

I also consider it desirable that school authorities should be made aware of the progress of their particular project as it advances through the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> All approved major projects have been reviewed and placed in priority categories in accordance with objective criteria in preparation for the approval of the building programme for 1994.  This programme will be decided when the capital allocation for 1994 has been approved.  Boards of Management will be advised of the position when the programme has been approved.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that many schools need improvement and in recognition of this fact the Programme for Government states: &ldquo;We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing substandard school buildings&rdquo;.  As evidence of that commitment, the 1993 capital allocation for post-primary school represents an increase of 26 per cent over the 1992 allocation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the approval of major projects, pressing needs for additional accommodation for the 1994-95 school year will be met by the provision of good quality temporary accommodation, where appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by the pupils and staff of Ballyowen Meadows Special School at present.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that my Department is actively engaged in seeking a solution to this difficult problem. As part of this process, a range of possible alternative locations for the school have already been investigated.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, most of these have ultimately proved to be unsuitable.</P>
      <P>However, further investigation of possible options is continuing on an urgent basis and I can assure the Deputies that every effort is being made to provide a solution which will meet the special needs of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the locations chosen for special schools are largely determined by the level of demand for special services in particular <Col N="1882" /> areas.  In the case of the Ballyowen Meadows School, the vast majority of pupils come from the west side of the city and there is ongoing demand for service in this general area.</P>
    <P>For this reason, my Department would be most anxious that any relocation which takes place will result in the retention of this special resource on the west side of the city where the demand for its service exists.</P>

      <P>The third-level institutions are autonomous in relation to their day to day affairs which would include their admissions policies and the determination of levels of deposits for course places.</P>
      <P>I understand that in relation to applicants for higher education grants in the universities and all applicants in other third-level institutions these deposits are set at levels which the institutions consider are necessary in order to secure a firm commitment from applicants in relation to the acceptance of offers of course places.  For applicants in the universities who are ineligible for higher education grants the deposit is in fact the first instalment of the tuition fee.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy will appreciate that in the circumstances I am not in a position to issue directives to the institutions in this matter efforts were, however, made by my Department in 1992 to have significantly reduced initial deposits introduced by the universities for the latter category of applicants.  The universities were not, however, prepared to depart from the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course concerned that these deposits would not operate as a barrier to access to third-level and I will keep the <Col N="1883" /> matter under review in consultation with the institutions and where appropriate the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with pupil performance in the junior certificate and I believe that general public reaction has, by and large, been one of satisfaction.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the junior certificate programme represents a significant departure from the style and content of the intermediate certificate and the day group certificate programmes, both of which it has replaced.</P>
      <P>It has enabled teachers to move away from prescribed texts.  This means that teachers can introduce material of more immediate interest to the pupils and so improve their motivation.</P>
      <P>The pupils too have been encouraged to become more actively involved in their own education, to become more assertive and enterprising and to accept responsibilities.</P>
      <P>By and large the junior certificate examination is more user-friendly than its predecessors, being offered at three levels in Irish, English and Mathematics and at two levels in other subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provision of syllabuses at two or even three levels, there is come concern that the programme at junior cycle is unsuitable for a small but important minority of students.  In recognition of this fact the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has recommended the introduction of an alternative programme, called the junior certificate schools programme, to be made available for students whose particular <Col N="1884" /> needs, for one reason or another, appear to be beyond the scope even of the present broadly based junior certificate. My Department is at present examining the Council's proposals.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grants for primary schools.  This enabled an increase of £5 to be provided in the standard rate of grant bringing it to a level of £33 per pupil with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for certain other categories of school.  It also enabled me to introduce a new initiative aimed at channelling additional funding to selected primary schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Schools currently included in the disadvantaged areas scheme already receive extra financial assistance in addition to concessionary ex-quota teaching posts. The level of assistance involved currently stands at £17 per pupil which is comprised of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a supplementary capitation grant of £10 per pupil,</P>
      <P>(ii)  a grant of £5 per pupil for books and materials, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  £2 per pupil towards home/ school/community liaison initiatives.</P>
      <P>There is a total of 258 primary schools in the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of my policy of targeting additional resources at schools serving children from disadvantaged areas, I have also made an additional £250,000 available this year as a special initiative <Col N="1885" /> to alleviate the burden on certain schools in disadvantaged areas which have been identified as having particular heavy financial difficulties at present.</P>
    <P>Schools have been selected for receipt of this support on the basis of claims supported by financial data submitted by schools management.</P>
    <P>Based on the level of claims thus received, it has been decided to allocate each selected school a sum equivalent to 30 per cent of its declared financial shortfall.</P>
    <P>A total of 44 schools have been selected for assistance under this initiative and the schools in question have been advised in recent days.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined will have a significant impact in alleviating the problems of those schools which are experiencing serious financial difficulties at present.</P>

    <P>At present there are 106 primary and 38 post-primary schools in the home/school liaison scheme and these embrace a total of approximately 55,000 pupils.  This includes 27 primary schools and 12 post-primary schools newly included in the scheme at the commencement of the current school year. This extension was made possible by the appointment of an additional 27 coordinators to the scheme in 1993.  The <Col N="1888" /> scheme now has a total of 98 locally based co-ordinators working under the direction of a national co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>Each co-ordinator is responsible for a particular area and acts in support of local schools in establishing contact with parents, encouraging parents to become involved in their childrens' education, organising locally based activities which contribute to close contact between parents and teachers and establishing links with pre-school and other voluntary and statutory groups in the area.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans to undertake a cost benefit analysis of replacing the school transport service on the basis outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operating costs of the school transport scheme, which in 1993 will be in the region of £39m., are under constant review to ensure an efficient and cost-effective service.  Indeed, the Deputy <Col N="1889" /> may be aware that two detailed consultancy studies have been conducted into the operation of the scheme in recent years.  I have made both of these studies available to interested parties to facilitate a fully informed debate on the best means of operating this service in the future and I will give full consideration to any proposals put forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would be somewhat concerned at the Deputy's reference to the &ldquo;dangers of transporting children&rdquo;, lest it be interpreted as suggesting deficiencies in the present system as far as the safety of children is concerned.  In this regard, I am satisfied that Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on my behalf, are fully conscious of their responsibilities and indeed are justifiably proud of their safety record in operating the school transport service.  Nor do I consider that the distances which children are currently required to travel are such as to justify the approach suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I should also make the point that attendance at school is not only educationally beneficial to pupils but has the added and very important social benefit of allowing children to mix with their peers and to gain from this experience.</P>

      <P>In 1988 the Government approved a multi-annual capital programme for the provision of regional and local sports centres at designated locations throughout the country within a budget of £16.910 million.  A total of nine regional locations were identified for funding.  A grant of £1.75 million was allocated for the provision of a regional sports centre at Cork. This project involves the provision of a 25 metre swimming pool complex with ancilliary indoor facilities.  Cork Corporation is the client for the project. Following a planning process the Department, in consultation with Cork Corporation, invited proposals for the project in 1991 on the basis of a design, finance, construct and management package.  The proposals received raised complex issues which required detailed consideration by my Department in consultation with Cork Corporation.  No satisfactory proposals emerged from this process.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with Cork Corporation it was agreed that the project should proceed on a traditional design and tender basis.  However, in view of the lapse of time since the grant was originally allocated Cork Corporation is undertaking a reassessment of the facilities to be provided taking account of the needs of the area and the competing facilities which have been established in the intervening years.</P>
      <P>In the light of this report the proposals already designed by Cork Corporation can, if required, be amended, following which the detailed design can be completed and tenders invited.  It is expected that construction work on the project could commence in 1994.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of regional sport centres which have been established, the location and the total cost of each centre is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the official report.</P>

      <P>A revised structure and format of the curriculum at the senior cycle of post-primary education is being implemented from September 1995.  These are intended to provide maximum flexibility in catering for different needs, aptitudes and abilities of pupils within an overall three years in senior cycle.</P>
      <P>The structure of the leaving certificate with effect from September 1995 has three main orientations: the leaving certificate to be offered at Higher and Ordinary levels with revised syllabuses provided on a phased basis; the leaving certificate applied programme which is a self-contained course incorporating and expanding on the current senior certificate and vocational preparation and training programme; a modified and expanded leaving certificate vocational programme.  The new arrangements are all based on work that has been in progress in schools for some time and will, particularly in the case of the applied and vocational programmes, involve use of the out-of-school environment and links with industry, business and the community generally.</P>
      <P>The manner in which to organise these elements of the new programmes appropriately is at present the subject of active consideration by my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  While there will be need for in-school co-ordination work in connection with the new programmes, I am satisfied that this can be catered for within flexible time-tabling arrangements.</P>

      <P>Under the national lottery funded multi-annual sports capital programme, introduced by Government in 1988, Waterford was designated a regional sports centre and a grant of £0.5 million was allocated for the development of further sports facilities at Kilbarry to complement the existing facilities provided by Waterford Corporation during the eighties.  The project comprised the provision of a synthetic surface on the athletic track, security fencing, new entrance, car park, athletic equipment and other ancillary works.  A furher grant of £200,000 was allocated in 1991 for the provision of an athletics pavilion, including spectator accommodation and dressing rooms adjoining the athletic track.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of this development, based on plans prepared by Waterford Corporation, is £0.6 million and additional funds have been sought.  These proposals and the request from Waterford Corporation for additional funds are under consideration by my Department. A decision in the matter will be made in the light of the funds to be provided in 1994 for the sports capital programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to provide suitable equipment, books and tuition for visually impaired children attending ordinary primary and post-primary schools on the basis of individual need, as identified by the Visiting Teacher Service. Each visually impaired child who needs a brailler is supplied with one, on the advice of the visiting teacher, where learning through the medium of braille is considered necessary.  In addition, the cost of providing books in braille is paid for by my Department.  The textbooks are brailled at Arbour Hill Prison, Dublin, by arrangement between my Department and the Department of Justice. My Department also funds the cost of typewriting lessons and, in some cases, braille lessons for visually impaired children in ordinary schools where this is recommended by the Visiting Teacher Service and the Special Education Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The Visiting Teacher Service has itself been restructured in order to be able to respond more effectively to the needs of pupils with disabilities, particularly those in isolated areas.  The new arrangement will enable such pupils to receive the support of a local visiting teacher on a more frequent basis, while retaining access to the specialist teacher of the visually impaired, as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Education Review Committee report, which has just been published, examined the full range of supports required by pupils with disabilities, including those with visual impairment, and I am considering the committee's recommendations at present.  Also, in keeping with the policy of encouraging the maximum amount of discussion and debate in relation to educational issues, a seminar dedicated to special education and the committee's report is being organised for 6 December 1993.  Among the objectives of this seminar <Col N="1896" /> is to allow those involved in special education, including the visually impaired, to convey their views on the nature of support services required for the future.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 79, 85, 89, 93 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government I am committed to widening access to third level education, including continued improvement of the student support schemes.  As the Deputies will be aware, important and significant changes were introduced in the student grants system in 1992 and 1993.  Those changes include more equitable and rigorous procedures for assessing income, major improvements in income eligibility limits and fee grants and an increase in the income limit for those with more than one child in full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it was not possible, because of the constraints on Exchequer resources, to increase maintenance grants in 1993.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies about the difficulties of low income and PAYE families in putting children though college are being examined by the Expert Advisory Group which I established earlier this year.  The group has been asked to recommend, <i>inter alia</i>, appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay. The report of this group will be available in the near future.</P>

In accordance with research findings internationally, the evaluators, whilst acknowledging the positive outcomes from the programme, recommended that a more effective response would be to focus on preventive measures targeted at the early years of education. I have therefore proposed a range of special education initiatives in the National Development Plan in order that those at risk of early school leaving and under achievement leading to economic and social exclusion are provided with the additional supports necessary to optimise their participation in, and benefit from, the educational system.  These initiatives will be complemented by existing educational programmes to combat disadvantage, by curricular reforms especially at the second level, and by specific staff development measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these initiatives will help improve retention rates in school, there will be a continued need for programmes such as Youthreach to allow a second chance to those who leave the system early.  I do not consider that an employment placement scheme would be appropriate to meet the needs of young people with no qualifications.  There is a clear link between education qualifications and employment experience, and a range of studies have substantiated that education is the most predictive variable of occupational and economic attainment.  For intervention programmes to be successful at this level, a strong emphasis on personal development, literacy, numeracy <Col N="1900" /> and communicative skills is essential, in addition to marketable technical and vocational skills.  This is what Youthreach offers, integrated with work experience.</P>

      <P>At present some 22,000 young people participate on vocational preparation and training, VPT, courses with support from the European Social Fund. The programme operates at two levels, catering for those who would otherwise leave school after junior cycle, and for those who wish to pursue courses at post-leaving certificate level.</P>
      <P>The VPT programme provides training in over 60 different vocational areas, ranging from horticulture to upholstery, from woodcraft and furniture to video production and animation, as well as the more traditional areas of engineering, construction, electronics, computer studies, catering and tourism studies, secretarial services and commerce.  The programme offers an integrated approach focusing on the development of specific skills in the chosen discipline, personal development including literacy, numeracy, communicative and computer skills, and a work experience programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards, with the active involvement of the social partners, is responsible for assessment and certification matters relating to such courses at post-leaving certificate level, including the structure of courses on a modular basis and the design and review of programmes to ensure ongoing relevance to industry needs.  The work of the council will be further strengthened and enhanced by <Col N="1901" /> the establishment on a statutory basis of a National Education and Training Certification Board to provide assessment and certification for vocational training programmes delivered by both the education and training sectors.</P>
    <P>The programme at post-junior cycle level will shortly be assimilated into a new applied leaving certificate programme which is being developed at present for introduction into the senior cycle in 1995.  This reform, coupled with an expansion of the leaving certificate vocational programme, will ensure a strengthened vocational and technical dimension within senior cycle programmes, developing both specific vocational skills and the knowledge, adaptability and initiative which are essential to cope in a climate of increasingly rapid change.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the employment of caretakers in national schools was introduced in 1979.  There are currently 275 caretakers serving 353 Primary Schools under this particular scheme.  Under phase one of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) introduced from 1 September 1992, 97 primary schools are being paid an extra capitation grant for the provision of caretaking and/or secretarial services.  A further phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was introduced from 1 September 1993 as a result of which an additional 136 primary schools have benefited for the provision of caretaking and/or secretarial services.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provisions set out above, there were also 721 schools catered for under Social Employment Schemes for Caretakers and Clerk Typists at June 1992.  This scheme is operated by the Department of Employment and Enterprise through FÁS.  My Department has no information on the number of these schools that have caretakers rather than secretaries.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain present commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it is intended to continue this phased programme and expand the provision of caretaking and clerical services to national schools with 100 pupils upwards and to post primary schools with 200 pupils upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the private secondary school sector, caretakers are employed by the authorities of the schools they serve rather than by my Department.  The annual grants paid by my Department for general running expenses of schools may be used for the employment of caretakers if schools so wish.  Information on the number of secondary schools in which caretakers are employed is not, therefore, readily available.  The first phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> scheme allowed for the provision of caretaking or secretarial assistance, <Col N="1903" /> or a combination of both, to 69 secondary schools.  Details of the next phase, which will cover the 1993-94 school year, will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>There are 318 full-time caretakers employed by the 38 Vocational Education Committees.  Caretakers are appointed to a Vocational Education Committee rather than to a school and it is a matter for the committee to deploy them among its schools.</P>
    <P>There are 117 full-time caretakers employed at present in the community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>Vocational Education Committees and community and comprehensive schools benefited under the first phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> scheme and further schools will benefit under the second phase of that scheme of which details will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>Under Rule 66 of the Rules for National Schools publishers may submit draft copies of their textbooks to the Department for approval to be placed on the list of books sanctioned for use in national schools.

      <P>I am aware of the media report referred to by the Deputy. I agree that such reports are deeply troubling and that they have a negative effect on Nationalist perceptions of the evenhandedness and accountability of the security forces.  I have already raised the report refered to by the Deputy with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  The Government remain absolutely determined to ensure that the British authorities take the necessary steps to avoid any recurrence of the unacceptable series of leaks of security force information which occurred several years ago, and which gave rise to the Stevens Inquiry.  The Government will keep the issues raised by the Deputy under close review and will continue to emphasise to the British authorities the importance of the security forces operating within the rule of law at all times.</P>

      <P>In the period since <Col N="1910" /> the Government came into office on 12 January of this year, a total of 696 parliamentary questions have been tabled to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Of these, 337 were for oral answers and 269 for written answers.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost involved, the Deputy will appreciate that the costs of researching and answering individual parliamentary questions can vary considerably, depending on the nature and extent of the information sought.  A precise response to the Deputy's question would involve detailed costing of each of the questions dealt with in the period in question.</P>
      <P>I would however refer the Deputy to a reply given by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD, to a question by Deputy James McDaid on 13 February 1992 on the average cost of answering a parliamentary question.  The Minister on that occasion indicated that an extensive survey of Government Departments undertaken in 1982 had revealed that the average cost of answering a parliamentary question was about £40. Based on the general level of inflation since 1982, it is calculated that the equivalent cost now would be about £65.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs produces a twice yearly report on &ldquo;Development in the European Communities&rdquo; and an annual report on &ldquo;Ireland's Official Development Assistance&rdquo;. The Department also produces other reports from time to time, using its own resources or those of other Departments; such reports are normally for internal use and not for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past five years the Department <Col N="1911" /> has been responsible for commissioning and publishing two studies in the area of cross-Border economic co-operation. The &ldquo;North West Study&rdquo;, dealing with the economic development of the Donegal/Derry/Strabane region, was published in April 1990.  The cost of the study was shared equally between the Irish and British Governments; the Irish Government's share was £69,614 (of which 75 per cent was refunded by the European Regional Development Fund).  A second study, &ldquo;Ireland in Europe: A Shared Challenge&rdquo;, dealing with economic co-operation on the island of Ireland in an integrated Europe, was published in June 1992.  The total cost involved, including production and printing costs and fees to consultants commissioned to write individual sectoral chapters, amounted to £58,317.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of £11.5 million under section 35 having been raised by the film industry in respect of 17 films in the period to mid-February last.  Tax relief would represent approximately 40 per cent of that amount.</P>
      <P>As it is not necessary to obtain approval centrally from the Revenue Commissioners for section 35 investment in film projects the full information requested is not available and could not be obtained without undertaking enquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>With the extension of section 35 to individuals in the 1993 Finance Act, a system of recording relief similar to that in operation under the Business Expansion Scheme was introduced.  At this early stage no worthwhile results are available.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to allow all people who live with a parent or other relative and who apply for unemployment assistance to be assessed in their own right without reference to their parent's or relative's income in view of the fact that the effect of the current system of assessment is to cause families to separate as young people leave home in order to qualify for their full unemployment assistance entitlement, and also qualify for rent allowances; if he will introduce an amendment which will allow these young people to qualify for their full entitlement of unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In assessing the means of a young person who is claiming unemployment assistance and living at home, account is taken of the value of free board and lodgings.  The means assessment is made by reference to the parental income, disregarding a standard amount and dividing the remaining income between the non-earning members of the household.  There is also an overall limit on the value of board and lodgings in many cases.  The assessment aims to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants and different household circumstances.</P>
      <P>The means test, including the assessment of board and lodgings provides a mechanism for targeting limited resources to those who are most in need. While the assessment procedure is kept under review, any measure to remove the assessment would be expensive.  In 1991, it was estimated that it would cost over £50 million to abolish the board and lodgings provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to provide a measure of financial independence to young people living at home and claiming unemployment assistance, a minimum payment <Col N="1916" /> of £5 was introduced in the 1991 budget for single people whose only means comprise board and lodgings.  This was in line with the general recommendation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Under the lone parents allowance scheme which applies to deserted wives with children, the first £6 per week of means is disregarded, together with a further £6 in respect of each child.  Travel costs to work and childminding expenses are also disregarded.  After this, the allowance is reduced by £2 for each £2 of earnings.</P>
      <P>A lone parent who works for twenty hours or more per week may also qualify for family income supplement if he or she meets the conditions for eligibility for that scheme.</P>
      <P>These arrangements mean that lone parents can take up part-time work and in most cases retain a significant portion of their weekly allowance.  Any proposal to increase the present disregards would involve additional costs and could, therefore, only be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> Under the back-to-work allowance which I introduced recently a lone parent may take up work in indigenous sectors or try out self-employment and retain 75 per cent of weekly payments for the 1st year and 50 per cent for the second year.</P>
    <P>My purpose in extending the back-to-work allowance to lone parents is to ensure that they have access to new opportunities to get a foothold in the jobs market again.</P>

      <P>A total of 2,819 parliamentary questions has been tabled for my Department since the formation of the Government. Of these, 2,200 (78 per cent) were withdrawn by the Deputies and the remaining 619 (22 per cent) were answered.  The bulk of the 2,200 questions withdrawn related to problems that claimants were experiencing which could be resolved immediately or where the problem had already been resolved.  In these cases a letter confirming the position was issued to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Of the questions answered, 467 received a written reply and 152 were answered orally.</P>
      <P>The costs associated with answering a question can vary considerably depending on the nature of the inquiry and the level of detail that needs to be obtained from local offices of the Department around the country.  Based on a recent survey carried out in my Department, the total cost of dealing with the 2,819 parliamentary questions received was £193,000 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to facilitate Deputies making enquiries about individuals' entitlement to Social Welfare without having to resort to parliamentary <Col N="1918" /> questions.  In this regard, my Department operates a special &ldquo;hot-line&rdquo; telephone service for Deputies to enable them make such inquiries.</P>

      <P>As part of a larger research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, my Department has commissioned two reports from the Institute.  One of these reports concerns the identification of factors which are associated with short or long term poverty, based on the 1987 survey of poverty and income distribution which was carried out by the Institute.  The Department has also been involved with the Institute in the development of a computer-based system to model the tax liabilities and social welfare entitlements of households and the Institute is preparing a report which outlines certain results from this in relation to the Family Income Supplement scheme.  It is anticipated that both reports will be available for publication in 1994.</P>
      <P>Identification of the cost of each report is not feasible, given that they represent only a part of an ongoing research programme with the Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working group on the treatment of households in the Social Welfare code was published in May 1991. The Working Group was established in May 1989, arising from a Supreme Court judgment concerning the treatment of married <i>versus</i> cohabiting couples under the unemployment assistance scheme, for the purpose of identifying ways in which the social assistance schemes could be adapted to ensure that households with similar needs are treated in a consistent and equitable way.  The cost of <Col N="1919" /> publishing the report is not readily available.</P>
    <P>In line with a commitment in the Partnership Programme for Government, an expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was established in July 1933.  That group is considering a wide range of issues in that area and is expected to submit an interim report shortly and to have completed its deliberations by the end of next year.</P>

      <P>All participants on the vocational training opportunities scheme receive a weekly payment equivalent to their unemployment payment or lone parent's allowance.  In addition, they are entitled to retain any existing secondary benefits, including rent supplements, for the duration of the course.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Education and partially funded from the European social fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, rent supplements payable to VTOS participants are paid through the Vocational Education Committees in <Col N="1920" /> addition to the weekly VTOS allowance but, where this is not possible, payment of the rent supplement continues to be made by the Health Board.</P>
    <P>To avoid any confusion in the matter, Health Boards have now been instructed by my Department to pay rent supplements, where appropriate, in the case of all new VTOS participants from the beginning of the current 1993-94 academic year and in any other cases where payment by the Vocational Education Committee is not possible.</P>

Some checks remain to be carried out in respect of acreage declared on his application before payment can be processed and I have arranged for these to be carried out without delay.</P>

      <P>Thirteen cows listed on the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme application from the person <Col N="1937" /> named were found in her son's herd on dates before and after the date of application. It will be necessary for the person named to explain satisfactorily how this occurred before a final decision can be made.  With regard to her 1993 suckler cow premium application the position is that the herdowner applied for grants in respect of 16 cows but only presented three cows at inspection.  Under EC regulations governing the scheme no grants are due as the applicant did not maintain the number of cows equal to that on which grants were applied for.</P>

Based on the average cost of answering a parliamentary question, as quoted by the Minister for Finance in February 1992, and allowing for movements in the Consumer Price Index since then, the estimated total cost of answering the 255 parliamentary questions would be of the order of £17,000.</P>

    <P>As to the cost involved, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar question on 23 June 1992.  In that reply it was stated that an extensive survey of Government Departments in 1982 revealed that the average cost of answering a parliamentary question was about £40. Taking into account the general level of inflation since 1982 the equivalent cost today would be in the region of £65.</P>

      <P>The principal recommendations of the Hamilon report to which the Deputy refers are (i) the establishment of a national authority for safety at sports grounds and (ii) the preparation of a code of practice for safety at sports grounds.</P>
      <P>A working party was established under the auspices of the Department of Education which has recently finalised codes of practice relating to (a) safety at sports grounds and (b) safety at pop concerts and other outdoor musical events.  These codes have been prepared following a very detailed consultative process with sporting and other interested groups and organisations.  It is intended that these codes of practice will be avilable later in the year.</P>
      <P>The recommendation referring to the establishment of the national authority is being considered following completion of the codes of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993, which is before the Dáil at present, contains provisions &mdash; along the lines of recommendations made by the Hamilton committee &mdash; giving the gardaí statutory powers to control access to certain events and to allow for the surrender and seizure of intoxicating liquor, etc.  The committee's proposals in relation to licensing <Col N="1950" /> arrangements for particular events are being dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>In so far as implementation of the recommendations by the Garda Síochána is concerned the Garda authorities report that they use prepared guidelines on operational planning for control of spectators at sporting and other events which gather large crowds.  These guidelines include arrangements for policing both outside and inside stadia and on the main routes used by spectators.  As part of their planning for major events of this kind the Garda authorities meet the organisers and the necessary arrangements are planned in advance.</P>
    <P>In addition, seminars on the subject of public safety and crowd control are held as required by the Garda College, Templemore to ensure that Garda personnel in charge of operations and sections of the ground at major events receive appropriate training.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing consultations between my Department and the Departments of Justice and Environment in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>Following full consideration of the matter I have decided that exemption may be granted to pupils in the following circumstances: (i) where primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland; (ii) where pupils who were previously enrolled as recognised pupils in a primary or second-level school are being reenrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years has elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State; (iii) where pupils function intellectually at average or above average level but have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the mother tongue or where pupils have been assessed as having a general learning disability due to serious intellectual or sensory impairment and are also failing to obtain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother language.  The evidence of such a disability should be furnished by a qualified psychologist and in addition a full report on the pupils should be furnished by the school, and (iv) where pupils from abroad, who have no understanding of English, are enrolled, they will be required to study one language, only, Irish or English.</P>

      <P>At present there are 106 primary and 38 post-primary schools in the home/school/liaison scheme.  This includes 27 primary schools and 12 post-primary schools newly included in the scheme at the commencement of the current school year.  This extension was made possible by the appointment of an additional 27 co-ordinators to the scheme <Col N="1955" /> in 1993.  The scheme now has a total 98 locally-based co-ordinators working under the direction of a National Coordinator.</P>
      <P>The post-primary schools concerned have been allocated 11 part-time teaching hours each per week to assist them to participate in this scheme.  The allocation is additional to the concessionary teaching post for the alleviation of disadvantage which has already been allocated to each of the second level schools concerned.</P>

      <P>Children in urban areas, whose parents wish them to attend a school under Protestant management, an all-Irish school or a multi-denominational school, may be issued with bus tickets, provided that they otherwise satisfy the conditions of the school transport scheme, on both age and distance grounds.</P>

      <P>Rosary College, Springdale Road, Raheny, is currently being phased out as a secondary school and will finally close in 1995.  As the school is privately owned and managed, the question of the disposal of the premises would be one for the school authorities, subject to recoupment being made to my Department in respect of the capital grants paid to the school.</P>
      <P>I understand that the City of Dublin Vocational School Education Committee are currently negotiating with the school authorities for the rental of surplus accommodation in the school during the phasing out period for the purpose of conducting certain adult education courses.</P>

      <P>The report of the special education review committee has now been published. I attach an extract from that report which sets out the committee's views and recommendations on school transport services.  I will be giving early consideration to the committee's overall findings.</P>
      <P>My Department has not yet completed its review of the particular case raised by Access for the Disabled.  As part of the process of seeking to advise the best possible solution for all concerned, contact is being established with the relevant health authority who may be in a position to make a positive input into future arrangements.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> Special Education Review Committee</P>
    <P>Extract from Report</P>
    <P>7.3.4. <i>School Transport Services</i></P>
    <P>The current annual cost of school transport is approximately £36m.  Of this, about £6m is spent on special school transport services.  Bus Eireann acts as the agents for the Department of Education in the administration and delivery of the service.  This is done in accordance with the rules regarding eligibility and the unit-cost limits set but the Departments of Education and Finance.</P>
    <P>The Committee has considered submissions outlining certain problems which have arisen in relation to the transport of pupils to special school and classes.  Concern has been expressed about individual cases of students with disabilities living significant distances from their school and from established special transport routes.  In some cases, even if the services were to be extended to more adjacent pick-up points, the pupils might still be required to spend as much as two hours per day travelling to and from school.  In other cases, because of the financial constraints imposed by existing limits, it has not been possible to extend some services to pick-up points adjacent to the homes of a minority of students.  In this situation, the Department gives the parents an annual subvention of £600 maximum towards the cost of transporting the pupil to the most convenient pick-up point of an existing service.  This system has been criticised on the grounds that some parents are not in a position to drive their children to and from a pick-up point every day, and that the allowance is inadequate.  It has frequently been pointed out that the cost to the State of maintaining these pupils in residential schools would be considerably higher.</P>
    <P>Reservations have also been expressed to the Committee in regard to the absence of escorts from buses.  It is asserted that certain pupils should not be allowed to travel on buses without adult supervision, in addition to the driver. <Col N="1960" /> Submissions have also drawn attention to the need for wheelchair lifts, ramps, clamps, harnesses and seat belts, particularly on buses which carry physically disabled pupils.</P>
    <P>The Committee, therefore, recommends that:</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp; Increased funding should be made available by the Department of Education, so as to allow for the extension and restructuring of existing transport services for pupils with disabilities.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; In cases where and extension proves not to be feasible, the present range of transport grants, at present limited to a maximum of £600 per pupil per year, should be doubled and subsequently increased in line with authorised increases in mileage rates payable to private contractors by Bus Eireann.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Department of Education should grant-aid the provision of escorts on school buses, where the need for them has been shown to exist.</P>
    <P>(iv)  In the context of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee recommended in Chapter 8 (&ldquo;Linkages&rdquo;) below, the Departments of Education and Health should clarify, as a matter of urgency, their respective areas of responsibility for providing escorts and special equipment on some school transport services.</P>
    <P>(v)&nbsp; The maximum passenger loading for students of post-primary age with special needs should be the same as that for all other post-primary pupils.</P>

      <P>The pupil teacher ratio second-level was reduced in 1991-92, in 1992-93 and again in 1993-94.  A further reduction will occur in 1994-95 as a result of the allocation of additional teaching resources arising from the implementation of the provision in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to ex-quota guidance and vice-principal posts.</P>

As a result of this allocation 91 per cent of pupils in County Kildare now have access to a remedial service.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint a substantial number of additional remedial teachers in the coming years.
