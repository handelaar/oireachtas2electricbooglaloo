      <P>I would like to assure the House that I fully discharge the duty placed on me by Article 28.5.2º of the Constitution to keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and international policy.  I would not, however, regard it as appropriate or in keeping with the constitutional position <Col N="2" /> to depart from precedent by giving details of such meetings.</P>
      <P>Meetings take place frequently both by specific appointment and on occasions when we meet in the performance of our respective duties.  Additionally, our offices keep in touch on a daily basis on a wide variety of matters.</P>

I am not looking for the details of the meetings, however I want to know the number of times the Taoiseach has attended at Áras an Uachtaráin to discharge his constitutional duty as required by Article 28.5.  I do not accept also that messages passed between the respective Offices of the Taoiseach and the President are sufficient to allow the Taoiseach to claim he has discharged his constitutional duty.</P>

      <P>The most recent meeting of the central review committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was held on 18 February.  The agenda for this meeting included new initiatives and strategies on employment, a draft progress report on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>, the national development plan for EC Structural Funds and the area-based strategy-county enterprise boards.  There was a useful exchange of views on these issues and the committee will meet again on 25 March 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the projected increase of 25,000 in the number of unemployed, as forecast by the Minister for Finance, discussed at that meeting? Did the trade union movement express their disquiet at this throwing in of the towel?  Is it accepted officially that the projected increase in unemployment for 1993 will be 25,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Programme for a Partnership Government, the forthcoming national development plan for EC Structural Funds, the area based strategy-county enterprise boards and all aspects of unemployment were discussed.  We discussed ways of tackling the very serious unemployment problem.  The Deputy can be assured that the unemployment problem is of concern to all of us.</P>

      <P>Did the central review committee discuss the decision of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to withdraw the community enterprise development programme, which has had a very serious effect on the partnerships set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  I understand &mdash; although it is not very clear as there has been no written confirmation &mdash; the Minister varied his decision subsequently.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when the new initiatives on employment which he referred to are likely to be announced?  Will he indicate also if the social partners at the meeting in question agreed to the Government's proposal for a separate national economic and social forum?  Finally, will the Taoiseach indicate if that forum will be in place in time to enable it to have a realistic input to the Government's development plan before that plan is submitted to the European Community?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive, and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I made a very successful visit to the United States from 11 to 18 March 1993. I met President Clinton on three occasions &mdash; at the White House where we had discussions on St. Patrick's Day, at a lunch of the Friends of Ireland in the US Congress on Capitol Hill later that day, hosted by Speaker Tom Foley, to which the President and I travelled together, and on the occasion of a dinner of the American-Ireland Fund in Washington, the previous evening, 16 March. In Washington, I had separate meetings with Vice-President Gore, Speaker Tom Foley and Mr. Dan Rostenkowski, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives, as well as chairing the meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board.  I also attended and spoke at a reception for the Irish-American community and at the annual dinner of the Washington Chapter of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.  I also gave interviews on CNN television and on the Larry King radio programme which is widely syndicated across the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, in Los Angeles from 11 to 15 March, I, accompanied by senior IDA executives, met executives of a number of US industrial corporations that were considering establishing plants in Ireland, spoke at an IDA reception for about 30 other corporations, some already with a presence in Ireland, others that were IDA targets for future investment here, met the Governor of California, Mr. Pete Wilson, attended and spoke at a reception for the Irish-American community in southern California and met the editorial board of the Los Angeles Times.  I also attended a fund-raising function of the International Breast Cancer Foundation, for Ireland, and a dinner hosted by the directors of <Col N="10" /> Hilton Hotels.  In the course of my visit, I made seven public speeches.</P>
    <P>I was accompanied on my visit by my wife, Messrs Pádraig Ó hUiginn and Walter Kirwan, respectively Secretary and Assistant Secretary at my Department, Mr. Seán Duignan, Government Press Secretary, Mr. Donagh Morgan, programme manager at my Department and Mr. Terry Blessing, security officer. For the Washington leg of the visit, I was also joined by Mr. Seán Ó hUiginn, Assistant Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and by my Private Secretary, Mr. Colm Butler.  As to the cost of the visit, invoices are not yet to hand for some elements but if the Deputy concerned wishes to put down a question after a suitable interval, I can give a comprehensive figure for the cost.  None of the Ministers of State at my Department visited other countries for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.</P>
    <P>I had two principal objectives for this visit, mirroring the two top priorities of this Government.  First, I sought to explain Government policy in regard to Northern Ireland and to enlist US support for it and, in particular, to explore how the strong and very encouraging interest of President Clinton and of the US Congress could most constructively be harnessed and channelled to help advance a durable and balanced settlement that would end the agony besetting Northern Ireland.  Secondly, I aimed, in direct contacts with leaders of US business and in discussions with political leaders on such matters as world growth, taxation and the Uruguay Round, to bring forward action that would help expand employment in Ireland and to pre-empt any steps that would have the contrary effect.  The visit was extremely successful in respect of both these aims.</P>
    <P>My discussions with President Clinton covered Northern Ireland, possible new initiatives to increase world growth and trade, the Uruguay Round, Somalia, the Irish economy and US investment in it; and ideas under consideration to amend the provisions of the US taxation code in regard to deferral of taxation on certain earnings and assets of US corporations <Col N="11" /> operating in other countries.  My discussions with Speaker Foley covered broadly the same area while some of the subjects listed also arose with Chairman Rostenkowski and Vice-President Gore, with whom I also discussed global environmental issues and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I found President Clinton to be very well informed about the situation and sensitive to its different dimensions.  He is most anxious and ready to do whatever the United States can do constructively to help resolve the problem.  I brought the President through its history, the Irish Government's analysis of it and our approach to bringing about a durable and balanced settlement.  I briefed him on the talks held last year and the Government's efforts to bring about an early resumption and a successful outcome.  This I indicated was our priority and it would be best advanced at this stage if all parties adhered to the previously agreed basis for talks and refrained from setting unsustainable and unattainable pre-conditions. I welcomed the President's interest and concern for Northern Ireland and the wish he had expressed to see a resumption of the talks process and to have the US play a constructive and supportive role.</P>
    <P>In our discussions, we explored how the potential for benefit of such a role could best be realised, given the position of the US as a friend to both Governments concerned and to what the President called &ldquo;the two great traditions in Ireland&rdquo; and the importance attached by both Governments to resumption of the talks process and to a successful outcome. We agreed that, as indicated by the President in his public statements after our meeting, he would closely monitor the situation, that he would maintain the closest consultation with our Government and with me personally, and that all the options that have been mooted as to how the US might contribute to the search for a solution remain open.</P>
    <P>I believe that the outcome of our meeting in Northern Ireland is just what was <Col N="12" /> needed.  It demonstrated support for the co-operative efforts of the two Governments to bring about a settlement through, as we hope, a resumed talks process, or in whatever other way may be necessary.  Our meeting also provided a focus for democratic politicians and all those with a constructive concern in the US and thus help to marginalise the tiny minority of proponents of violence and terrorism.  I know that it is an outcome very much welcomed by Speaker Foley who shares that latter objective.  When I met him, he gave me his views on all relevant aspects of the Northern Ireland situation.  The Government attach great importance and value to his views since he is a very committed and consistent friend of Ireland and occupies a most influental position in the US scheme of government.</P>
    <P>My discussions with the President and with the Speaker also covered the International Fund for Ireland.  I expressed the appreciation of the Irish Government and people for the very generous US contributions to the fund, which, with those of other supporters, have enabled it to undertake such valuable work on a cross-border and cross-community basis. I am very happy to acknowledge, with great appreciation, the announcement made by President Clinton at the Capitol Hill lunch that, for the 1994 US budget, the Administration will itself propose an appropriation of $20 million for the fund. In previous years, it was through the support of Speaker Foley and other friends of Ireland in Congress that such appropriations were added to the budgets proposed by the Administration.</P>
    <P>At our meeting, and in his subsequent public remarks, President Clinton expressed American admiration and appreciation for the generous response of the Irish people to the needs of Somalia and for the wonderful work being done there by the Irish non-governmental organisations.  The President also conveyed his sincere sympathy on the deaths of Valerie Place and Seán Devereaux, while engaged in that selfless endeavour.</P>
    <P>Following my meeting with the Danish <Col N="13" /> Prime Minister and current President of the European Council, Mr. Paul Rasmussen, in Dublin on 10 March, I conveyed to President Clinton the strong desire of the European Community for a concerted and co-operative approach by the EC, the US, Japan and others in order to stimulate growth in the international economy, an approach I first advocated at the Birmingham Summit last October.  The President was very receptive to this idea and undertook to pursue it positively with the Danish Presidency.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the Uruguay Round of GATT talks and agreed on the strong desirability of bringing them to a successful conclusion as soon as possible and on the stimulus this would give to growth throughout the world.  The President confirmed that he would be seeking from Congress a relatively short extension of the &lsquo;fast-track&rsquo; authority for these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In my meetings with the President and vice-President, with Speaker Foley and with Representative Rostenkowski and other public representatives, I raised the concern of the Government about an idea that was mooted during the presidential campaign and has now been taken up in the US Treasury.  The idea in question involves a limitation on the deferral of tax liability, now enjoyed by US overseas subsidiaries, so long as they have not repatriated their profits earned abroad.  I explained that this idea, if followed up, could have disproportionately adverse effects on Ireland, while very likely failing to realise any significant increase in revenue for the US.  In addition, I pointed out that there are specific reasons why Ireland should be exempted from any such legislation.  In the course of my meetings, I received a number of sympathetic indications of understanding for our concerns and a readiness to take them fully into account.  In particular, President Clinton agreed that the two Governments and their experts should work closely together on the matter, with a view to avoiding any adverse impact on US investment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Securing further such investment was <Col N="14" /> my principal objective in California.  Following my meetings with US corporations, two of these companies confirmed their intention to locate here, in Mullingar and Roscommon.  A third company, which will take a decision within, perhaps, four months, indicated that the meeting had strongly influenced it towards a positive decision quite likely for Dublin.  The employment potential of the companies who are considering locating or expanding their existing operations at a number of locations here is 2,000 people, many in high-quality jobs. There is extremely keen competition for mobile international investment, including for the firms in question.  Against this background, it has never been the practice to give names of companies or other particulars which would serve to alert our competitors and suggestions that I should do so are disingenuous.  More seriously, allegations that the jobs in question are bogus are thoroughly reprehensible and reflect very poorly on Deputies who made them.  The IDA know the companies in question, their potential employment and the present status of negotiation, and they are in full agreement with the indications I gave while in California.</P>
    <P>Other firms whom I addressed in Los Angeles include a number of prime IDA targets which are contemplating the establishment of new plants or businesses in Europe.  I have every confidence that the contacts I and my party had with them will ultimately be reflected by new plants and jobs in Ireland, in a significant proportion of cases.</P>
    <P>The same objective will be advanced by the very valuable second meeting in Washington of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board attended by some of the top people in American business. The meeting identified a number of significant opportunities for Ireland in investment trade and tourism, particularly in the context of this country's unique advantage to the US as a gateway to Europe.  The meeting laid a basis for an active interaction between our promotional agencies and the extremely well-placed and well-connected members <Col N="15" /> of the board.  I have no doubt that it will lead to concrete results in investment and positive developments in trade with the US and in the whole area of tourism, leading ultimately to an increase in the number of jobs on the ground.</P>
    <P>The visit as a whole was a tremendous success which amply vindicated the point I made in reply to a question on 9 March, that St. Patrick's Day provides an invaluable opportunity for Ministers going abroad to promote Ireland as an attractive and profitable location for investment, trade and tourism.  In the Irish-American extended family in the United States we have an immense asset of 44 million people of Irish descent who cherish feelings of identification with Ireland.  Many of these people have risen to the highest positions in Government, in business and other fields.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my questions which refer to Speaker Foley, who has always been an effective, responsible and consistent supporter of constitutional nationalism on this island, would the Taoiseach agree that the comments to which I refer in my questions, as reported in our newspapers last week, from that source have to be given very careful consideration?  For example, did the Taoiseach &mdash; in his reply he did not refer to this matter &mdash; discuss with President Clinton, Speaker Foley or anyone the criticisms by the Speaker of elements in Sinn Féin, for example, who are opposed to the International Fund for Ireland?  That fund has been a great example of practical patriotism and ought to be supported by all of us.  I suggest <Col N="17" /> to the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that on an all-party basis we should state our support for the International Fund for Ireland and our criticism of those in the United States and elsewhere who are opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his sentiments in relation to the success of the visit and the very important role that can be played by the US President, <Col N="18" /> the Congress and the Senate.  I agree that we should all openly proclaim our full support across party lines for the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to my discussions with Speaker Tom Foley on the International Fund for Ireland, we discussed the fringe elements that exist in the US who are and have always been against that fund.  By and large they are supporters of violence in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Foley conveyed his abhorrence of people who support violence and I agreed with him on that. In relation to the International Fund for Ireland, the Speaker asked me to raise with the President the question of putting it into the budget rather than having to fight on the floor of the House to have it added.  After lunch on Capitol Hill the following day the President responded by saying that it would be in the 1994 budget. We are fully conscious of the need for investment in Northern Ireland to tackle unemployment.  Speaker Foley's sentiments are such that he does not want any opinion voiced which might be a disincentive to investment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

Deputy Currie should understand exactly where the Government stands on this issue and that it is a new beginning for an Irish Government to have such active support from the US President in trying to get the talks process back on the rails.  The President sees that as a prerequisite in trying to find a new peace formula for Northern Ireland.</P>

Is it a fact that the proposed 2,000 jobs depend on that measure being waived?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all understand that this tax proposal has not come out of the Treasury yet and that it must go through the Ways and Means Committee. It is for that reason that I had a long meeting with the chairman and other members of that committee on this proposal which could adversely affect US investment in Ireland should it become a reality.  This type of proposal is nothing new.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I had to go to Washington on two occasions, and again as Minister for Finance, to study similar type proposals coming from the Treasury and which have not found their way into legislation. Deputies should understand that Ireland is one of the few countries with which the US has a trade surplus.  I leaned heavily on that aspect and said that we are entitled to consideration when any adverse tax proposals are being put forward. American companies have been locating here for years.  They are not just companies which close down in America and relocate here.  That is a real problem in America, especially having regard to the new trade agreement with Mexico.</P>

      <P>I will address my supplementary questions to Questions Nos. 7 and 8 in my name.  The Taoiseach indicated that it would be disingenuous of anybody to expect that he could indicate were the jobs would be, who would provide them and when the start-up date would be.  Could the Taoiseach at least indicate a possible start-up date for the 2,000 jobs announced in the US?  If he is not able to do so would he not agree that what he is doing is returning to the bad <Col N="20" /> old days when the IDA announced job proposals and job approvals which never bore any relationship to the actual job start-ups, and that what he engaged in in the US were no more than St. Patrick's Day pipe dreams?  If the Taoiseach announces 2,000 jobs in the US, this House is at least entitled to an indication of when those jobs will start.</P>

      <P>The unemployed are also entitled to the same information, particularly in the areas the Taoiseach identified &mdash; Roscommon, Mullingar and Dublin.</P>
      <P>In relation to my other question the Taoiseach indicated that he had agreement from President Clinton that one of the major objectives of any assistance which the US might offer in relation to Northern Ireland would be to get the talks about Northern Ireland going again. In view of the statement by Mr. Molyneaux at the weekend that he regards these talks as dead, could the Taoiseach indicate what steps it will now be possible to take to revive them since they are so important in terms of any attempt to end the violence in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the Deputy's questions, he may not be unaware that local elections will take place in Northern Ireland in May and that consequently we are hearing statements that we might not normally hear.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has issued invitations for meetings to all the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland.  He has already met the Alliance Party and he awaits an opportunity to meet the other parties.  We have heard before, statements that the talks are dead and that they will never be reconvened, and we have to take such statements in the context in which they are made.  We would all deplore an attitude that would not take us back to the negotiating table for the resumption of the talks process.  It is precisely in this area that President <Col N="21" /> Clinton pointed to his support for a resumption of the talks process.  The President is a friend both of the British and Irish Governments and he spoke warmly of the two great traditions in Northern Ireland.  He wants to see the talks being given a chance.  He is leaving open his other options in relation to fact finding missions and a peace envoy and will keep in touch with the Irish Government and indeed, with me personally as he said in public.  That is the aspect in relation to the talks.  Let us hope that the invitation extended by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be responded to positively and that there can at least be bilateral talks before we all get around the table again.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of jobs, I am sure the Deputy, as an experienced TD, is aware that there are two reasons the specifics are not given at any particular time.  The first is that because international investment is so scarce and there is a tough battleground to get it, the IDA, until it is absolutely satisfied that a company are prepared to announce start-up plans, do not make specific announcements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2,000 jobs will come both from new investments in Ireland and by way of the expansion of existing ones.  The jobs will be provided over a period.  In fact, today, the first announcement in relation to Roscommon is being made with the full consent of the company.  It is a matter for them to agree with the IDA as to when the actual detailed announcement can be made.  The first announcement is being made today and I do not think one could ask for a quicker response than that.</P>

      <P>The taxation provisions proposed by the US Treasury are expected to bring in $700 million over a five year period which, I am sure Deputy Bruton will agree, is a very small sum in relation to US total revenue collection. The Deputy is correct in saying that <i>Fortune</i> magazine has identified the three areas to which he has referred.  There is also another tax provision that could be advantageous to Ireland.  It envisages possible changes in taxation for companies set up in Puerto Rico, so it is not all a minus factor.  The Deputy can take it from me, as I said in my reply, that President Clinton did say the two administrations should get together so that there would be no adverse effects on investment in Ireland.  I pointed out to him in relation to the other areas that the United States enjoy a trade surplus with Ireland &mdash; I do not know whether any of the other areas do better but I doubt it very much &mdash; that US investment in Ireland, because of the importation of raw materials, services and other areas, is responsible for sustaining 35,000 jobs in the US economy and that, consequently, the argument about run-away plants does not stand up in relation to the criteria being spoken about.  There is room for discussion to ensure that Ireland could be spared, in so far as possible, the disadvantages of any change.</P>

Secondly, is there any validity in the Taoiseach's claim to have secured 2,000 jobs for the country?  Would he consider that he might best serve this country by going back to the United States within the next four or five weeks and securing some 10,000 jobs?

I do not know what kind of cost benefit analysis the Deputy may have carried out in relation to those trips but I should like to inform him, the House and the Irish taxpayer that I am absolutely satisfied that the Irish economy and Ireland in general will get more than value for money as a result of the most recent trip to the United States.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach a question in respect of the multinationals in Ireland at present. Does he accept that if the American Congress requires multinationals to make up the difference between the tax regime here and what would normally be the corporate rate in the United States it could have a devastating effect on this economy?  With regard to his statement to the effect that there were special reasons which could be made for Ireland, will he enumerate what those special reasons for Ireland are?  Is he saying that he thinks it is possible a law may be enacted by the Congress which could exclude Ireland?  I put it to the Taoiseach that this is simply not realistic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware of an amendment tabled a few years ago in the names of three good friends of Ireland which sought to do precisely what he says is not possible and is unthinkable.  I will leave it to the friends of Ireland and Congress to deal with this matter.  I was in the United States to give my views on how the issue of tax in relation to Ireland could be addressed and looked at.  I have enumerated the special reasons in regard to Ireland.  First, the United States has a <Col N="29" /> trade surplus with Ireland, specifically arising out of the extensive investment in Ireland which sustains approximately 35,000 jobs in the US.  This point is well recognised, and has been highlighted by consultants here.  That is the number of jobs sustained in the US by American investment in Ireland.  There needs to be American investment in Europe to benefit from the Single Market.  Consequently, Ireland is a good base for many companies.  Ireland does not suit some companies for various reasons, for example, market share and so on, but in regard to the companies already here and those who are looking at Ireland, there are very solid reasons why they should invest here.  The American Administration should take into account the factors I have enumerated in regard to this issue.  If this tax legislation was introduced in the manner being talked about &mdash; it has not been passed by the Treasury yet &mdash; it is possible that some multinationals here might decide to set up on mainland Europe where the corporate tax rate would be more or less equivalent to the United States rate.  Consequently, the benefits of the 10 per cent corporate tax rate here could be negatived.  That is the type of position which could arise, and we want to guard against it.  There are other opportunities in relation to other aspects of American taxation which could be beneficial to Ireland if we grasp them in time.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any instance where a conflict of interest has arisen between the various functions of the Attorney General which has created any difficulty in practice over the years.

      <P>I am surprised at the Taoiseach's reply, given the experience in regard to the X case and the beef tribunal.  The Attorney General advised the Government in relation to the setting up of a tribunal and also advised a team to challenge, and essentially obstruct, the work of that tribunal.  I do not believe the current circumstances can justify a continuation of the situation where the Attorney General attempts to serve the Government by way of legal advice and also serve the public interest.  Will the Taoiseach at least indicate that he is prepared to have the functioning of that office reviewed in some way so that these <Col N="31" /> clear conflicts of interest which we have experienced can be avoided in the future?</P>

I am not aware that any difficulty has arisen in regard to representation of either the public interest or the interest of the State agencies before the tribunal.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the constitutional role of the Attorney General is set out in Article 30, which I have no proposals to change at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 44, 45 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been actively involved in the search for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Yugoslav conflict since the outbreak of the crisis two years ago.  The principal elements of the Government's policy were set out in detail in response to questions in the Dáil on 10 February.  These involve: support for the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia chaired jointly by David Owen and Cyrus Vance; involvement in efforts in the region by the UN and the EC to establish the conditions necessary for a settlement; sustained international pressure, including sanctions, against Serbia and Montenegro; support for efforts to prevent a spill-over of the conflict; assistance to refugees and displaced persons, and assistance for the victims of rape and support for the efforts to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>I fully share the Deputies' feelings of outrage and frustration at the carnage and sheer brutality which we have witnessed in recent weeks at Srebrenica and other Muslim towns in eastern Bosnia.  It is almost beyond belief that whole communties of innocent people can be shelled, starved and held hostage in the pursuit of military and political objectives. I utterly condemn these atrocities.</P>
      <P>We will achieve our objectives only through the determined resolve and the collective efforts of the international community.  The overriding priority must therefore continue to be to work together with our EC partners and the international community generally to maximise our collective weight in order to bring to an end the horrors which we are witnessing in Bosnia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve, acting in close liaison with the UNHCR, which is the lead aid agency, have demanded that the leadership in Belgrade make the Bosnian Serbs halt their offensive towards Srebrenica, allow the UNHCR to evacuate all <Col N="35" /> wounded persons and vulnerable groups by land and by helicopter, and allow UNHCR aid convoys to pass through the blockades.  I pay tribute to General Morillon of the UN Protection Force for his determined efforts to end the tragedy in Srebrenica.  He has our full encouragement and support.</P>
    <P>Recent events underline the importance of finding a comprehensive settlement to the Yugoslav conflict, but immediately and most pressingly in Bosnia.  Ireland is continuing to play its part fully with its Community partners, at the CSCE and the United Nations to this end.  The International Conference, of which Ireland is a member, is spearheading the effort, with very wide international support.  Their plan for Bosnia is, as the UN Secretary General has said, fair and viable.  Much of this plan is now agreed.  Negotiations are continuing on the outstanding points.</P>
    <P>It is vital at this critical stage that we should stand firmly behind David Owen and Cyrus Vance, in their efforts to obtain the agreement of all Bosnian parties to their plan.  When secured, we wish to see the Security Council act speedily and with determination to ensure its implementation.  The alternative to this is likely to be further violence and the break-up of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>With our EC partners, we are increasing the pressure on the Serbian leadership in Belgrade.  Sanctions are now becoming more effective.  We are working both in the framework of the UN and of the CSCE to tighten these.  More stringent measures to isolate Serbia and Montenegro completely, should the peace talks fail, are being further developed.</P>
    <P>While we are all frustrated by the failure to bring an end to this appalling conflict, we must give priority to the search for a peaceful, negotiated settlement. This approach is in line with the basic approach of Irish foreign policy that international conflicts should be resolved by negotiation, rather than by military means.</P>
    <P>If these efforts to find a negotiated solution fail, the Security Council will <Col N="36" /> need to consider all the options open to it under the UN Charter.  I profoundly hope that all sides in the Yugoslav conflict &mdash; and in particular the Serbs in Bosnia and in Belgrade &mdash; will reflect on the consequences of failure, and by co-operating with the UN and the European Community, obviate the need for the consideration by the Security Council of enforcement measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it was not the actions of the EC or the UN but the personal courage and audaciousness of General Philippe Morillon which has brought food and some supplies to the people of Srebrenica?  It is still not enough.  Will the Council of Ministers, or the Minister, take a more personal interest in ensuring the humanitarian aid can get to these towns, in agreement with the UN?  Does the Minister agree that it is time for the UN mandate to be widened to protect vulnerable groups such as women and children, the sick, the dying and the injured?  Clearly the normal rules of war are not being heeded.  Will the Minister press for a widening of the UN mandate in Yugoslavia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>General Morillon has shown tremendous bravery, for which I commend him.  This matter has been considered at the two Foreign Affairs Councils I have attended.  I also raised the matter with the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd.  The matter is being pursued.  At the most recent meeting of Foreign Ministers we were addressed by David Owen, who gave details of the way his plan was being pursued.  He was optimistic that he could bring it to a resolution.  He was adamant that he wanted the support of the Community to the same extent that he has received support in the United States.  In the first instance he wishes to be allowed time to bring about a resolution to this conflict. At this stage it is best that we pursue the Owen-Vance plan to see if it can be brought to a conclusion.  It is important that there should be no let up in regard to sanctions.  Detailed consideration was <Col N="37" /> given at the last meeting to the implementation of effective sanctions.  If efforts to find a negotiated solution fail, the matter will have to go back to the security council with a view to looking at the United Nations charter.  In the first instance we should wait to see what happens to the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Several questions are begged by the Tánaiste's reply.  He referred to the consequences of failure for the Serbian community.  I should like to know what those consequences are. They have continued to tighten the screw on the Bosnian Muslims and to carry out agressive acts.  At present they are completely encircling Sarajevo.  They have continued barbaric atrocities against women and children.  I do not believe the sanctions are stopping them or that the &ldquo;no fly&rdquo; zones are having any effect.  It is time the western powers spelled out to Serbia the consequences of failure.  They will not stop until somebody indicated to them the nature of the consequences of not stopping.  They must be told what they can expect if they continue this campaign.  It seems they are adopting a hard negotiating stance and delaying the negotiations to establish a <i>fait accompli</i> on the ground which involves the killing of innocent people day after day. Would the Tánaiste agree that it is not enough to talk about General Morillon's general bravery and commitment?  His actions were born out of complete frustration at the western world's failure to do anything.  He put himself effectively as a human pawn into the equation in order to focus attention on what was happening. It is not enough to say that we fully support the Vance-Owen plan.  We will have to spell out that if the Serbians do not go to the negotiating table in a meaningful way they will face very severe military action to reverse the situation.  It must be shown that this kind of brutality will be reversed by international determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the frustration the Deputy feels in relation to what has been happening.  The matter was discussed at <Col N="38" /> considerable length at both meetings of the Foreign Affairs Councils I attended. The seriousness of the difficulties being experienced in the former Yugoslavia were not lost on any of the Minister's attending.  We heard a lengthy address from David Owen.  The agreed resolution of the meeting was that we should do everything possible in the first instance to assist in the acceptance of the Owen-Vance plan.  Three elements of that plan, the constitutional principles, the map and the arrangements for the cessation of hostilities, would have to be agreed by the Bosnians, the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims.  It was felt at that stage that the best course to be pursued, despite the difficulties, was to allow the negotiations to continue.  They are difficult negotiations. Nobody should attempt to underestimate the difficulties involved in those negotiations.  If they cannot be brought to a satisfactory resolution then it will have to go back to the Security Council of the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not much consolation to the relatives of those who have died horrible deaths in Srebrenica that there are sanctions imposed against Serbia that are not working.  Will the Minister tell us whether there was a discussion at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers about the fact that it is alleged that Greece is breaking the embargo by sending in train loads of oil to the Serbian forces and has any action been taken against Greece which, after all, is a member of the EC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern was expressed at the lack of effectiveness of the sanctions at the last meeting and efforts were to be made to ensure that the sanctions would be implemented, especially in relation to the delivery of oil by use of the waterways. The Council of Ministers resolved that sanctions should be increased and implemented as intended from day one. There was failure in that area but I would like to think that that is not now the case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to inform the House that I have decided to include for the first time support for democracy and human rights as an integral part of Ireland's Official Development Co-operation Programme.</P>
      <P>The measures to be taken include project and technical assistance support for electoral activities and participation in electoral observer missions.  In addition, Ireland will in 1993 contribute £30,000 to the UN Trust Fund for Electoral Assistance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the first Irish Observer Mission under this programme is on its way to Lesotho where it will join delegations from other countries to monitor the elections which will take place there on 27 March.  It is appropriate that Ireland be present at these elections, which will mark the long-awaited return to civilian government in Lesotho, which is one of the priority countries for Irish aid.</P>
      <P>Assistance will be provided for the referendum processes in Eritrea and Malawi later this year and Irish observer missions will be present for both the referendums. A request from the United Nations to provide polling station officials for the elections in Cambodia in May is now being processed by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that Ireland should play its part in assisting South Africa in the transition from apartheid to a nonracial democracy.  My Department is currently examining how this might be done. Similarly, in the case or Mozambique, I intend that Ireland will help that country in the progress to multi-party democracy.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome the <Col N="40" /> renewed commitment to overseas development aid and the extension of the aid into this type of democracy-building and electoral education programmes.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister give an assurance that this will not be a once-off effort this year as other requests have been received and a number of elections and referenda are due to be held?  Will the Minister ensure that there is continued support to these emerging democracies?  Otherwise they are in danger of collapse.</P>

It is extremely important and I welcome the immediate support offered by the parties in this House.  We should insist on developing this in the coming years.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent statements made by the President of the European Parliament, Dr. Egon Klepsch, suggesting that Irish neutrality was out of date; the response, if any, he has made to these comments; if he intends to publicly reject the views expressed by Dr. Klepsch; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The remarks to which the Deputy's question refers were made, in Brussels, in response to questions by journalists, prior to Dr. Klepsch's visit to Dublin on 1 and 2 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> The position of the Irish Government is clear.  Ireland accepts the common foreign and security policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, including the relationship that has been established between the European Union and the Western European Union.  When the Maastricht Treaty is ratified Ireland will take up its rights as an observer to the Western European Union but it will not be a member of the Western European Union, which remains a separate organisation based on a separate treaty.  Any further arrangements agreed at a future review conference will require the unanimous agreement of all member states and will in our case also involve a referendum. The Programme for a Partnership Government makes it clear that this will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Government will approach a future negotiation in the light of values and concerns which we have always brought to bear on the discussion of international security issues.  We will also be paying close attention to the experience gained between now and 1996 in implementing the common foreign and security policy defined in Maastricht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of my question relates to whether the Tánaiste has expressed these views to Mr. Egon Klepsch arising from the remarks he made.  Did the Minister convey the views he expressed today to Mr. Egon Klepsch when he was in Ireland?  Would the Minister agree that Mr. Klepsch, who is President of the European Parliament, had no mandate from that Parliament to express those views.  What response, if any, has the Minister received from Mr. Klepsch to any representations he made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Klepsch expressed a number of views in response to questions by journalists.  His remarks involved no criticism of Government policy but he referred to what he sees as the possible future development of that policy.  As far as I am concerned, he is entitled to his <Col N="42" /> views just as is any politician.  I do not believe he was expressing a view on behalf of the European Parliament.  My responsibility is to state Government policy when required and I am always ready to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that Mr. Klepsch is not just any politician; he is a relatively powerful politician, given that he is the President of the European Parliament, restricted and all as the powers of that parliament are.  In view of the statement of the Minister that he sees the current policy of traditional military neutrality remaining in place until such time, as he says, the people decide otherwise, will he say what steps the Government proposes to take to develop the debate on the question of Irish neutrality and the role Ireland may play in the future with regard to European security?  Would he, for instance, agree to the Government publishing a Green Paper on the possible development of foreign relations between Ireland and the Community and, indeed, the rest of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The common foreign and security policy does not alter Ireland's position outside military alliances.  The Twelve will seek to develop systematic co-operation and joint actions on a range of security issues with the emphasis on arms control and non-proliferation; in general on preventive and long term approaches to security.  I have not considered the publication of either a Green Paper or an information booklet on neutrality but I suggest to the Deputy that the foreign affairs committee of this House which is about to be set up would be a possible vehicle for discussion.  I would welcome any discussion on foreign policy and foreign policy matters.</P>

      <P>I hope the foreign affairs committee will address the development of our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of the world.  It would be helpful, however, if the Government published its views on how it sees these relationships developing.  In the course of his reply <Col N="43" /> the Minister referred to the fact that we would take up our position as observers in the Western European Union when the Maastricht Treaty is ratified.  My understanding is that we have attended Western European Union meetings as observers.  Is the Minister telling the House that that practice has ceased until such time as the Maastricht Treaty is ratified?</P>

      <P>I explained on 10 February in this House that we became an observer of Western European Union on 20 November last because our interest and observer status derives from the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I should like to make a brief statement to the House in relation to the tragedy that occurred in Warrington.  With your permission also, perhaps other party leaders might be allow a few minutes in which to express their condolences.</P>
      <P>I know that the House will join me in expressing grief and anger at the shocking act of IRA violence which took place in Warrington last Saturday.  A peaceful shopping precinct thronged with parents and their children was turned into a scene of utter carnage by an act of premeditated evil.</P>
      <P>I extend the deep condolences and sympathy of the Government and people of Ireland to the parents of young Jonathan Ball, a three-year-old child who lost his life in the bomb attack, and to all of those who were injured in this act of savagery.  The Government was prepared to be represented at the funeral, but the wishes of the family for privacy must be paramount.  I extend our support and best wishes to those who now lie grievously injured in hospital, fighting for their lives, and to their families.</P>
      <P>This bombing, whose victims were the young and defenceless, is the latest outrage in the long series of cruel and cowardly acts perpetrated by the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland and further afield.  Their expressions of regret at Saturday's bombing are rightly viewed with contempt and incredulity by all reasonable people in Ireland, North and South, and in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRA's campaign of violence has served not only to increase human suffering, but has deepened divisions within Ireland.  It is long past time for it to be brought to an end.  The events at Warrington and other attacks in Britain show a cynical disregard for their effect on relations with the Irish community there. I know that the Irish community in Warrington and throughout Britain have made it clear that they share the revulsion of their British neighbours at this horrible <Col N="318" /> act.  I am confident that responsible British opinion is well aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>The bomb attack in Warrington and its perpetrator stand condemned by the Government and by the people of Ireland.  I am sure that the House will join me in expressing the sense of outrage we feel at this callous and brutal act, and in conveying our deepest sympathy to the families most closely affected and to all the people of Warrington.  It must strengthen our determination to pursue the early resumption of political dialogue and the establishment of peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy on behalf of my party to the family of Jonathan Ball and to all who suffered as a result of the awful outrage in Warrington.  It is important also that the House give expression to its feeling of sympathy with all the British people, who now, as a result of the activities of the Provisional IRA, feel vulnerable as they go about their normal daily business.  We should indicate that we share with the people of Britain an urgent anxiety that the people responsible for these kinds of activities are brought promptly to justice and that if those people attempt to seek refuge in this island from justice in Britain for their activities they will be sent as quickly as possible back to Britain to face justice. We should make it clear that any deficiencies that may exist in our extradition law will be rapidly put right in order that that can be given full effect. We should make it clear that there should be no hiding place anywhere in the civilised world for people who are willing to commit atrocities of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is also worth recalling that the political supporters of those who planted the bomb in Warrington achieved less than 1 per cent of popular elective support in the most recent general election in this State.  There is no support in this State for those people, their cause or their methods.  I believe that it is very important that all parties in this House should be seen &mdash; as we are, I believe, as a result of the Taoiseach's initiative in allowing these statements &mdash;<Col N="319" /> to stand together in sympathy and in fellow feeling with those who have lost their loved ones, those who have been injured, the people of Warrington in particular and the people of Britain in general, in this awful experience that they have undergone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the Taoiseach and by Deputy Bruton.  The Progressive Democrats and I regard the excuses tendered in the wake of this appalling crime as being devoid of any substance whatsoever.  Terrorism is designed to instil terror, because it is based on the fact that people fear that they will be killed.  Those who engage in terrorist activities, North and South in this country and abroad, all do so on the basis that they put the lives of innocent people at risk.  That is what terrorism is all about.  Apologies afterwards are no good, and the Irish people speak with one voice in condemning and repudiating the apology tendered as adding insult to a terrible injury done to innocent people in Warrington.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to add that I am in total agreement with the statement made by Deputy Bruton that in terms of expressions of sympathy and solidarity we can go so far as must unite behind the politics of progress and peace in Northern Ireland.  Most of all, we in this country must as far as we possibly can show that every sinew is stretched to the task of preventing people from doing things of that kind and using this country as a base from which to plan operations, assemble bombs and make statements afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Bruton's remarks. The most fitting tribute which this House could pay in the circumstances is to indicate that all the existing deficiencies in our extradition laws which are being availed of and which cause problems at the moment will be immediately remedied.  By doing so this House will demonstrate to the people in Britain, particularly to the Irish people living <Col N="320" /> there, a sense of solidarity and commitment that this kind of appalling atrocity will not prevail and that terrorising innocent people at their workplace and when they are involved in leisure activities cannot be allowed to succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity which the Taoiseach has given us to express our views on this latest savagery by the Provisional IRA.  We hear daily on the news that a man or woman in Northern Ireland has been killed by a Loyalist or Nationalist gang and to some extent we react within ourselves. However, perhaps we tend to become complacent about it and the constant killing in Northern Ireland helps to diminish our humanity because of our failure or feelings of helplessness in regard to doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>But every now and then the Provisionals carry out a killing that sparks a degree of revulsion which generates a response from ordinary people to which we must respond.  I am not sure why this happens every now and then.  Perhaps the fact that a three year old child &mdash; innocent in every respect, totally dependent on and trusting every adult around him &mdash; was killed by adults who coldly and calculatedly laid a bomb outside McDonalds restaurant, a bomb which was bound to maim or kill young people, is the reason for the non-comprehension of most people.  That is why Members, and people outside the House, feel such disgust, annoyance and anger at what the Provisionals have done.  However, it is a mistake to believe that we are helpless. As politicians we have a role to play in trying to ensure that Members, North, South and in Britain, talk to each other to try to find a political solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ordinary people also have a role to play.  The Provisionals cannot exist without safe houses, dumps and money. Much as we would like to deny it, unfortunately there are elements in Irish society who continually provide safe houses, dumps and money for the Provisionals. We must ask why that continues to be the case.  I do not have any wish to make a divisive or party political <Col N="321" /> point in this debate, because we are speaking primarily in relation to conveying our sympathy to the family of the young boy who was killed and to the other families whose children or relatives have been maimed by the bombs and who will suffer this nightmare for the rest of their lives.  Even if those who carried out the appalling atrocity are arrested, charged and go to prison for a long time, they will come out more or less intact. Even people who were not injured physically will be psychologically affected for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>As politicians we have a responsibility to try to break away from the traditional responses in relation to Northern Ireland and Irish unity, the constant shibboleths which are trotted out about a united Ireland, Articles 2 and 3 and regarding some people in Northern Ireland as outsiders. If we are serious about ending the appalling tragedy of Northern Ireland we must try to stop bending the knee to what are regarded as untouchable truths.  That is one of the most important things we in this House can do for the public who are appalled by the savagery over the weekend.  Unfortunately, it is almost inevitable that it will happen again and we must be seen to take steps to end it and seriously address the issues.  We must try to break free of the traditions in which we were reared.  Of course, that does not apply solely to us; but we must not wait for others to step forward, we must do so.</P>

I urge that all steps which can be taken in this country be taken to apprehend the perpetrators of the savage attack in Warrington and other attacks in Britain and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the perpetrators of this crime, and <Col N="322" /> those identified with them, state what kind of society they wish to create for people living in these islands?  The killing of a three year old child and the maiming of many others is a tragedy.  Today the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children held a forum for TDs &mdash; ironically to ask for our support in ending physical violence against children, &mdash; which is a poignant reminder of the extremes to which adults will go to achieve selfish ends.</P>
    <P>We must look at short term solutions to the type of violence which occurred over the last few days, but we must also plan for the long term.  In the short term obviously, we must, reject all violence and condemn those who support it.  We must also show that courage, peace and self-sacrifice defeat selfishness and violence. In the long term we must demonstrate to young and old that violence in the home or in the high street will not resolve any problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This year's Social Welfare Bill is the first major piece of legislation to come before the House in fulfilment of the new partnership Government's programme to protect and improve the position of those dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>We are more than maintaining the real value of social welfare payments; substantially improving payments for children and providing extra support for families at work; restoring the confidence of workers and employers in the Social Insurance Fund; and providing improved benefits such as better maternity provision, including entitlement to maternity benefit on their return for volunteer development workers, easier access to invalidity pension for people who are very ill, and a free colour TV licence for certain pensioners, which I am introducing from the beginning of April next. Social welfare today is complex and far reaching.  It touches the lives of almost every person in the country in one way or another.  We provide a weekly payment to almost 1.5 million people &mdash; 800,000 persons and their 700,000 dependants &mdash; and spend over £10 million each and every day of the year.</P>
      <P>In the recent MRBI opinion poll about the most beneficial aspects of the budget, the two items that by far made the most favourable impact were the increase in child benefit and the general social welfare increases.  I am not surprised with that reaction given the role of social welfare in today's society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reversing measures introduced last year.  I am restoring disability benefit and dental and optical benefits to people <Col N="325" /> who are long-term unemployed and people who have retired under the PRETA &mdash; pre-retirement allowance &mdash; scheme and pensioners who lost out under the 1992 change.</P>
    <P>I am bringing back into entitlement to treatment benefits &mdash; this is dental, optical and aural benefits &mdash; workers earning up to £30,000 per annum, or £60,000 if the worker has a dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>I am increasing substantially the amount of daily earnings to be disregarded for the purpose of unemployment assistance for casual workers. I am easing the conditions for receiving unemployment payments for the 27,000 part-time workers who, for the first time, came into benefit this year by reducing from two days to one day the loss of employment which a part-time worker must incur to claim.</P>
    <P>I am providing an extra £12.5 million to address the needs of people who have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance for assistance with their exceptional needs.</P>
    <P>Overall, we are providing an additional £180 million a year for social welfare. The extra money brings the overall expenditure this year to £3.7 billion, that is over £10 million a day for each day of the year.</P>
    <P>The main improvements provided for in this Bill are: an increase of 3.5 per cent from next July in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payments; a special increase of 4.9 per cent from next July in all short term rates of payment; a substantial increase of 26.6 per cent from next September in child benefit to £20.00 for each of the first three children.  The rate for the fourth and subsequent child is being rounded up to £23.00; a new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins; increases in the income limit for family income supplement from next July.  All families in receipt of FIS will be £12 a week better off; a special increase of 11.7 per cent in the carer's allowance gives a new rate of £59.20 a week which is in line with long term payments; increases in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity <Col N="326" /> benefit; a special increase of 20.6 per cent in the orphans's non-contibutory pension which will now be the same as the orphan's contributory allowance of £39.00 a week and the alignment and consolidation of parts of social welfare legislation to facilitate the introduction later this year of a Social Welfare Consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>The main business of my Department is ensuring that those who, through illness, unemployment or old age are unable to provide for themselves, are looked after financially.  We are continually developing new ways of carrying out that business through improvements in the delivery of services and the introduration of alternative payment methods.</P>
    <P>Faced, as we are, with the overwhelming problems caused by current levels of unemployment, I plan to expand our traditional role and become more pro-active in our response to this huge problem.</P>
    <P>There are two key requirements for those who are seeking either their first job or a subsequent one.  They are education and experience, preferably both. If we want to help job seekers who are unemployed, we need to provide more training, education and work experience for them.  This applies in a special way to young people who are not receiving the State financial supports which go to those in third level education.  It is right that we as a country invest heavily in third level education.  But it is also right that we should invest in young people between 18 and 21 who do not get this opportunity. They especially need training, skills, work experience and often &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we encourage younger unemployed people to avail of further education and training as soon as possible after leaving formal education. They must be diverted down that route rather than on to the unemployment cycle and dependency on social welfare.</P>
    <P>We have made considerable progress in the last few years through initiatives which I introduced to make the regime of unemployment payments more flexible to the needs of our customers and <Col N="327" /> more responsive to changing work patterns. We have now a range of educational oppportunities schemes which give unemployed people a second chance to complete or extend their education. They can even go further and take on third level courses.</P>
    <P>Over 2,000 unemployed people are currently participating in second level courses and a further 330 are in full time third level study.  Young lone parents also need access to this type of second chance education.  I intend to encourage lone parents to take up these opportunities which do not affect their weekly payments.</P>
    <P>I have provided also opportunities for part time work which include payment of a weekly allowance from my Department and opportunities to do voluntary work without interfering with the flow of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In my view it is far better that unemployed people get work experience or training than be excluded from the workplace and left on the dole.  It was for this reason that I proposed to the Government in 1991 that we pay the unemployment payments and the extra benefits for a period of, say, six to 12 months and allow people to work as an employee, or a self-employed person or to receive training.  The proposal in relation to the self-employed was adopted by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and put into action in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> unemployment black spots.  At present we pay extra benefits to 2,200 people who are at work through these schemes and 240 self-employed people are receiving a payment while seven thousand five hundred are now at work in the work experience scheme &mdash; the employment subsidy scheme &mdash; and 610 in training, the job training scheme.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are the success stories of the past few years.  I intend to build on that success and expand them further. In addition, I will be paying particular attention to the needs of people with <Col N="328" /> disabilities and groups such as lone parents.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the greatest challenge facing this Government.  In real terms that means creating enough jobs. To achieve that we need a realistic and pro-active approach.  I am considering at present a new programme of measures to support people in making the transition back into the workforce, either as employees or working for themselves.  It will also embrace training opportunities, work experience and further second chance education.  This programme of measures will build on the success of the area-based companies set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> working closely with the new county enterprise partnership boards.</P>
    <P>The new initiatives will be directed to long term unemployed people and will offer a range of supports to get them back into the workforce in a manner and at a pace that suits their circumstances.  They will also provide those working in the black economy with an opportunity to put their affairs on a proper footing.  I plan to bring my proposals to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>As part of our job creation drive, the Government announced last year the introduction of a new PRSI exemption scheme.  The scheme applies to employers who took on additional full-time employees in the period from 19 October 1992 to 19 March 1993.  The additional employees taken on must represent a net increase in the number of employees in their employment since September 1992.  To date, applications have been received in respect of some 1,100 unemployed people.  I am now in section 18 of this Bill, making legislative provision for this scheme and extending the date for applications to 19 September 1993.</P>
    <P>The exemption means that employers will not have to pay their element of the PRSI contribution for each additional employee for the tax years commencing April 1993 and April 1994.  Employers will also be exempt from payment of the employment and training levy and the <Col N="329" /> health contribution where the new employee holds a medical card.</P>
    <P>At the average industrial wage of £260 per week, the PRSI exemption amounts to a direct subsidy to employers of £31 per week of £1,647 per annum for each new employee taken on.  This is a very valuable incentive for employers and I would urge as many employers as possible to avail of it before the closing date next September.  The extended closing date will allow the exemption scheme to be included in the range of initiatives which I have already referred to in the context of back to work supports.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about students in fulltime education and the proposal in this Bill concerning their eligibility for unemployment assistance during their summer holidays.  Each year about 12.000 full-time students &ldquo;sign-on&rdquo; for the dole during their summer holidays. This summer dole costs in the region of £8 million.  In addition to receiving unemployment payments, many students also claim rent supplements while living away from home during the holiday period.  This cost could rise to at least £60 million a year, plus the cost of rent allowance, if all students were to take up this practice.</P>
    <P>In future students in fulltime education will no longer be eligible to claim unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance for their summer holidays other than in circumstances which will be prescribed in regulations.  This measure will not apply to mature students or those in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education schemes.  This will bring our arrangements for full time students into line with what happens in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>I have under consideration at present a scheme of summer work for students which would give them a weekly payment in place of what they would have got on unemployment assistance.  I have in mind that this scheme will cater particularly for those students who depend on a summer job to supplement their grants and who cannot find summer work.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what I have in mind is a scheme which would allow students to <Col N="330" /> do community work, voluntary work or work provided by public sector bodies and receive a &ldquo;wage&rdquo; approximating to their unemployment payments.  I would envisage the scheme operating for a fixed period over the summer holidays with the student working a certain number of hours or days in return for the payment he or she receives.</P>
    <P>The total amount invested by taxpayers in a full-time third level student is in excess of £10,000 over the course. Contrary to what student representatives are suggesting, there are many thousands of students who would be anxious to put back into the community their skills, energy and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there are many voluntary organisations working the community who would welcome the opportunity to utilise the skills and expertise of our third level students for a number of weeks during the summer holiday period.  Simiarly, local authorities, health boards and other public sector bodies could avail of that expertise for work which needs to be done in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>My Department is working on the details of the proposed new scheme and I will be consulting with organisations such as those in the voluntary sector, regional interests, the new partnership groups as well as local and public authorities. I intend to bring the scheme into operation this summer.</P>
    <P>Section 14 also provides that young people leaving second level will not be eligible for unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance for a period of three months after completing their second level education.  I am making arrangements to ensure that these young people can register for FÁS immediately and that their eligibility for courses will be continued.  Parents on social welfare payments will continue to receive the child dependant allowance in respect of children aged 18 or over for the three months in question.  Up to this it was only families on long term payments who were entitled to child dependant allowances in respect of children over 18 in fulltime education.</P>
    <P>I have outlined to the House already <Col N="331" /> the adjustments which I propose to make to measures introduced last year.  I have today made regulations which revoke a number of those measures and adjust others to substantially improve the position of people adversely affected by them.  In addition, I have a number of regulations in hand which I propose to bring into force as soon as the Oireachtas passes this Bill.</P>
    <P>The regulations revoke the condition for disability benefit requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year for people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance; revoke the condition for dental and optical benefits requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year for people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance.  These measures will benefit some 140,000 people on long term unemployment assistance and 15,000 people on pre-retirement allowance immediately and many more in future; restore dental and optical benefits to workers earning up to £30,000 per annum; restore dental and optical benefits to pensioners affected by the change in the contribution conditions requiring five years paid contributions; relax the condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit for part-time workers by reducing from two days to one day the loss of employment which a part-time worker must incur.  These regulations come into force immediately. They increase substantially the amount of daily earnings which will be disregarded in assessing earnings from casual insurable employment for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for regulatory powers to prescribe the amount of the daily disregards.  The current level of disregard amounts to the daily rate of unemployment assistance for each day worked plus an additional amount of £10.</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the total disregard to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an extra £15 for each day worked.  This is a significant increase <Col N="332" /> which makes casual employment a real option for unemployed persons.  For example, a married man with two children will now be allowed to earn up to £34.42 for each day in which he works without affecting his rate of unemployment assistance for the days on which he does not work.  The regulations will come into effect from the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline to the House how I propose to address the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for dealing with payments to meet exceptional needs.</P>
    <P>The measures which were introduced last year were not intended to remove the basic discretion which health boards have to make payments when they consider that circumstances warrant this.  I recognise, however, that despite the various clarifications which issued last year, the circulars as they stand have given rise to serious concern.  I want to ensure that the discretion which health boards have is exercised in a sensible way to ensure that people in genuine need are helped sympathetically and effectively.</P>
    <P>I am drawing up a code of practice for dealing with fuel debts, which will involve fuel providers such as the ESB and An Bord Gáis.  The code of practice, when developed, will replace the guidance originally offered by the circulars issued last year and those circulars will be withdrawn. I am consulting with the ESB, An Bord Gáis and with the health boards in relation to developing this code of practice.  I am providing an additional £12.5 million this year to meet additional demands on the scheme and I will be publishing revised guidelines covering all aspects of the scheme following the review which is taking place at present. It is important that we have a consistent approach to the way the scheme is administered and the measures I am taking are designed to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I would now like to mention briefly the main provisions of the Bill.  However, for the benefit of Deputies, I wish to clarify some confusing statements that are not based on the facts which were made outside this House.  I have made a <Col N="333" /> great many adjustments, by regulation, and I have done so today.  However, some changes require new powers and they will be dealt with in the legislation today.  I have covered the changes that will be made in the Bill and by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for a significant increase in the weekly rate of carer's allowance from £53 to £59.20. This increase brings it into line with other long term assistance payments.  I want to ensure, in so far as we can, that people who give up work or another social welfare payment to become a full-time carer will not find that their long term entitlements are adversely affected. I have under consideration at present the question of entitlement to credited contributions for periods in receipt of the carer's allowance.  This is important because periods out of the workforce can have a detrimental effect on pension entitlements later in life.  Section 10 provides for the extension of &ldquo;after death payments&rdquo; to a spouse in receipt of carer's allowance to include the adult dependant allowance.  At the moment persons in this situation qualify for six weeks payments of the personal rate only.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide for the increases from July next in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payments as announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the increase in child benefit from 1 September next to £20 per month for each of the first three children.  The rate for the fourth and subsequent children is being rounded up to £23 per month.  This section also provides for the new £200 grant for twins, which will come into effect from 1 July next.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded for pay-related benefit purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 7 increases by £20 the weekly income limits below which families can qualify for family income supplement. The new income limit for a family with four children will now be £235 per week <Col N="334" /> and £314 per week for a family with eight or more children.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for increases in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity allowance payable from July next.  The new rates will be £65 minimum and £159 maximum.  This section also provides for regulatory powers to entitle to benefit certain applicants who do not meet the employment and contribution conditions attached to the scheme.  This measure is designed to facilitate volunteer development workers who wish to claim maternity allowance on their return home.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for regulatory powers to entitle to invalidity pension persons who are very ill but who cannot qualify because they have not been incapable of work for at least 12 months. That is, of course, an improvement.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a further improvement and extends the definition of an adult dependant to include one of a cohabiting couple who does not have the care of children.  Formerly, only dependants having the care of a qualified child qualified for an increase as an adult dependant. This section brings the provisions for an adult dependant in the case of cohabiting couples into line with those applying to married couples for all social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Section 12 improves the provisions for entitlement to disability benefit.  Payment of disability benefit is limited in certain cases to a maximum duration of 52 weeks, but a current claim may link with a claim in the previous three years for the purpose of reducing the duration of entitlement.  The purpose of this section is to reduce that three year &ldquo;linking&rdquo; period to one year.  Under existing provisions the total amount payable to a couple where one spouse/partner is getting unemployment assistance and the other spouse/partner is getting a social insurance payment or old age pension is limited to the appropriate married rate of payment.  Section 15 brings the legal provisions for pre-retirement allowance into line with the arrangements for unemployment assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, section 13 provides <Col N="335" /> for regulatory powers to prescribe amounts to be disregarded in assessing income from employment under a contract service.  In addition, this section provides that long-term social welfare payments received by a spouse-partner, as in the case of short-term payments, will not be assessed as means.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 provide for the usual increase, with effect from 6 April 1993, in the earnings ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable.  The ceiling for employees and the self-employed is being increased by £1,000 to £20,000 per annum.  The corresponding ceiling for employers is £21,300, also an increase of £1,000.  These sections also increase the minimum annual contribution from the self-employed from £234 to £250 and the special reduced rate contribution payable by the self-employed from £116 to £124.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the introduction of a PRSI exemption scheme for employers who take new employees from the live register, which I have already explained.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for regulatory powers to assign the collection of social insurance to persons other than the Collector General of the Revenue Commissioners. This section enables regulations to be made, subject to approval by the Minister for Finance, to assign part of that responsibility to other people.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that old age (contributory) pension and widow's (contributory) pension will not be payable on the basis of an insurance record of a self-employed person unless all self-employed contributions which that person was liable to pay have been paid. The section also contains a provision enabling the Minister to exempt people from this requirement having regard to the circumstances of a particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 21 exempts recipients of pre-retirement allowance who are in self-employment from their liability for social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>Section 22 disqualifies persons found to be fraudulently claiming a social welfare payment from receiving any social welfare <Col N="336" /> payment, other than child benefit, for a period of nine weeks.  Under current provisions, where a person is convicted of fraudulently receiving a payment, an automatic disqualification applies for the receipt of any social welfare payment, other than child benefit, for a period of three months.  This section also provides that a person who receives an automatic disqualification for either nine weeks or three months shall not be entitled to claim supplementary welfare allowance during the period of disqualification other than in respect of his or her adult or child dependants.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the allocation and issue of personal social services numbers and requires any claimant to furnish his or her number and that of dependants when required to do so for the purposes of any social welfare payment. The personal social services number, formerly known as the RSI number, will become the social services number for all social welfare schemes and should not be confused with the former proposal for an ID number.  I regret Deputy Allen is not listening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want the Deputy to note my reference to the personal social services number because it is not an ID number and does not involve the technicalities of such a number.</P>
      <P>Section 24 is designed to remove an ambiguity relating to the assessment of non-cash benefits as means in the lone parent's allowance scheme.  Section 25 removes the requirement that the sex of a person be taken into account in determining whether the person is unable to obtain suitable employment.  Section 26 provides that unemployed people participating in certain prescribed training courses will be insurable for occupational injuries benefit only, that is class J PRSI. It is intended to include courses such as EUROFORM, Horizon and the NOW programme under this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate the introduction of a Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill <Col N="337" /> later this year, the opportunity is being taken in sections 27 to 41 to align and consolidate various provisions of the social welfare code.  Among the provisions dealt with in this part of the Bill are claims and payments arrangements, the powers and duties of social welfare inspectors, offences and penalties for offences, overpayments and their recovery, suspension of payments, notification of increase in means, and consequential repeal of existing provisions.</P>
    <P>The last consolidation of social welfare legislation was in 1981 when I introduced the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  That was, in fact, the first consolidation of the legislative provisions since the unified social insurance system was introduced in 1952.  I intend, in introducing this new consolidated legislation, to provide a simple layman's handbook for easy reference by community, welfare and social groups who provide information and advice on social welfare matters. I hope to have that Bill in the House before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 52 provide for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990.  This Act, which I introduced into this House, was a major step forward in the protection of members of occupational pension schemes.  It is inevitable with any new major development like this that there will be a need to effect changes in the light of experience in operating the legislation.  Consequently, I am introducing a number of amendments which have been recommended by the pensions board.  They are mainly technical changes aimed at further enhancing the protection of scheme members and include such items as new definitions, regulatory powers to deal with problems arising in the calculation of preserved benefits and provisions relating to the winding up of pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Act currently applies very effectively to occupational pension schemes established in the State and to their members based within the State. As well as the technical items already mentioned, I am seeking to ensure that the Act operates more effectively for <Col N="338" /> Irish members of pension schemes established outside the State and for employees based outside the State who are members of Irish pension schemes. This Bill provides for the making of regulations to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>This is another substantial Social Welfare Bill.  The increases provided for in weekly payments will more than maintain and safeguard the position of those who depend on social welfare.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of other improvements.  I hope to bring forward a new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill before the summer recess which will promote greater access to and understanding of our legislation.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the issues raised in the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1993, has been introduced against the backdrop of horrific and growing unemployment figures, serious alienation of many people in society manifesting itself in crime in both urban and rural areas, in the growing problem of suicide, witnessed so tragically in recent weeks, and in a growing underclass throughout our society.  What we need is a Social Welfare Bill of vision and direction but instead we get a Bill that will increase dependency among our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has no vision or direction.  It does not indicate the Minister's principles or policies in regard to the many social problems that must be faced and supported by the State, nor does it give any indication as to how the Minister plans to integrate the unemployed back into the workforce as soon as possible.  In this Bill items and issues have been moved around, the main issues are dealt with in a small number of sections and the remainder of the Bill contains technical adjustments to make the social welfare code more practical from a bureaucratic viewpoint.  It makes no attempt to get rid of the poverty trap.  The reality for many people working full time and on low incomes is that they would be better off on the dole, and there is little hope for the sick or those on long term unemployment benefit.  The Bill lacks imagination, deals <Col N="339" /> inadequately with aspects of welfare and gives no indication as to how we might integrate the unemployed into real and meaningful employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives no clear statement on the EC Directives on Equality or on matters relating to social welfare inequalities between men and women.  This outrageous situation has gone on for far too long.  There are still thousands of women who do not know whether they are eligible for benefits and many women who have received some benefit do not know if they are due further moneys.  Some of them do not know to whom they should apply or if there is a standard method of application.  Some do not know if they must prove their case through the legal system and others have been told that they must employ a solicitor to pursue their case, with all the costs that this involves for the claimant.</P>
    <P>More than 1,500 women in Cork have been forced to sue the Government in an effort to secure the social welfare back payments due to them following the EC Directive on Equality.  I understand there are thousands of other women who have been forced into a similar situation due to a reluctance by the Department to make those payments.  It is unacceptable that anybody should have to employ a solicitor to get their just entitlement.  If people are entitled to back payments following an EC Directive, they should be paid automatically; legal representation should not be necessary.  The allegations I have made can be backed up by a Cork solicitor who confirmed that on behalf of 900 women he has sued the State for failure to implement the EC Directive and that a High Court order had been made in that regard.  Furthermore, he confirmed that a number of other solicitors are taking similar action.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government must face up to their responsibilities on this issue and make a clear-cut statement at the end of this debate which will fully inform women as to their entitlements. Without the efforts of voluntary groups, who regularly publish information on the matter, the general public and women in <Col N="340" /> particular would be totally ignorant of their rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being spent on bureaucracy and on the delivery of the social welfare services is unacceptable; far too much money is being swallowed up by this type of red tape.  I would welcome any moves to simplify the social welfare code and any such moves will be welcomed wholeheartedly by this side of the House.  Few people understand the social welfare system and there is far too much waste in administrative costs in employment exchanges and offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The time has come to tidy up the social welfare system and to make it more user friendly.  I welcome the Minister's declaration of his intentions to do this in a Bill he will introduce later this year.  Very often the system is anti-people and it attempts to block people from gaining information rather than giving them the information to which they are entitled. Basically the system is a largely complicated and confusing one which creates many barriers to work.  The lines of communication between the general public and the Department need to be harmonised and made more user friendly.</P>
    <P>We should remember that persons who draw social welfare are either victims of illness or of our economic failure.  There is a definite need for a clear-cut code of practice which would inform people as to their entitlements under the social welfare scheme and ensure that people are treated as human beings, not merely as individuals who are looking for something for nothing, because too often people feel that way.</P>
    <P>When will the Department of Social Welfare organise a scheme of gradual eligibility which would provide that persons only marginally outside the limit may not be deemed entirely ineligible for a scheme?  Far too often the position is either black or white and people are victims of the inflexible eligibility limits.  I regret that the carer's allowance scheme is as inflexible as ever.  Even though there are welcome changes in the scheme the same barriers exist for those who wish to claim the allowance.  There are still only <Col N="341" /> 4,000 people eligible for the allowance and the improvements made are limited to them.  There is a need to initiate a comprehensive policy centred around the needs of carers and those for whom they care.  The ageing of the Irish population has major implications for families and social policy.  Our response should be to place greater emphasis on community care as a means of meeting the needs of frail and dependent elderly persons.</P>
    <P>At present community care is largely care by families, more often than not by women.  Due to the limitations placed on the scheme carers who are under considerable strain receive very little practical support.  There is an urgent need for a co-ordinated integrated approach, incorporating the areas of health, social welfare and housing.  There is an overdue need for a short term policy as well as a long term strategy.  Even though the Minister may plead that there are budgetary constraints on his efforts, much cost could be saved in the long term in areas such as geriatric care and acute hospital care if there was a proper and adequate carer's policy.  The Minister must create priority principles in relation to the carer's allowance scheme.  He must make the adjustment necessary to ensure that the needs of the elderly are fully met without imposing strains on carers.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report on carers shows that care in the home is provided almost exclusively by one individual, usually a woman, and that this individual is usually the spouse or the offspring of the elderly person being cared for.  Carers provide an average of 46 hours care per week, more than six hours per day.  The report highlights the fact that carers receive little or no help from others and that the average support received from health boards and State agencies is about two hours per week.  The report found that carers experience a considerable amount of stress and are under constant physical and emotional strain.  The findings of the report show that an integrated management approach should be adopted, acknowledging the important role played by the carer.  Since the carer is the key provider of care in the home more support <Col N="342" /> services are needed to ensure effective care without placing undue strain on the carer.  This support should include direct payment to the carer as well as other back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister has taken the easy option once again by increasing the allowance to a limited number of people.  His policy in this area could be described as short-sighted and narrow-minded. It does not recognise the importance of 1993 as European Year of the Elderly and it does little to foster solidarity between the generations.  In spite of what has been said today the major barrier, the means test, still exists for the many thousands of carers throughout the country.  In the past 12 months people's hopes were raised and they thought there was a line of salvation for them but their hopes were cruelly dashed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an allocation to combat the problem of moneylending. However, the practice he is addressing on one hand he is encouraging on the other.  The recent circulars to community welfare officers regarding payment of supplementary welfare allowances and aid to thousands of local authority tenants towards their outstanding rent bills will certainly create a paradise for moneylenders.  The decision to impose a £100 limit on the amount of aid to be provided for clearing emergency electricity and gas bills is short sighted in the extreme and is causing widespread hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and his Department, by issuing these circulars, have contributed more to the growth in the practice of loan sharks in recent months than has any previous decision by the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department has failed miserably to deal with the matter in this Bill.  The Minister announced today that regulations will be issued to deal with those vicious circulars but I will not be convinced that the problem has been resolved until further guidelines are issued.  We do not know what is involved in these regulations.  They should have <Col N="343" /> been contained in the Minister's speech so that we could make an informed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>All we heard was a general statement &mdash; there was no detailed information &mdash; of the Minister's interpretation of the regulations and how they will deal with the vicious circulars that were sent out in late 1992.</P>
      <P>The so-called household budget scheme proposed in the Bill is nothing but a token gesture to deal with this problem. The Minister, and the Department, do not seem to understand that thousands of people are living at and below subsistence level.  They are living from hand to mouth, trying to keep the wolf from the door, and the wolf has many guises.  The unrelenting pressure for money at certain times such as Christmas, First Communion, Confirmation and back to school time leaves people with no choice but to borrow, and if the money is borrowed from a moneylender the wolf returns in the form of the weekly knock on the door for repayments.  These people are in a no-win situation and it is very difficult to break the vicious circle.</P>
      <P>When will the Government introduce the consumer credit Bill about which we have heard so much in the past four years?  We have yet to see details of this Bill. I hope it will be introduced shortly and that it will set down standard rules for all forms of credit, particularly moneylending. Courts should be given power to impose penalties, including jail sentences, on loan sharks.  I hope that the legislation introduced will have jail sentences included in the penalties.  I pay tribute to the many credit unions who have saved people from the abyss. However, expecting credit unions to bail people out of the poverty trap is simply shifting the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody remember the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;?  This was the term used by the Minister, Deputy Stagg, and many others in the Government who promised on behalf of the Labour Party to reverse <Col N="344" /> Deputy McCreevy's &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts.  When that is added to the recent increase in hospital charges one can wonder if we are not experiencing sleight of hand governing as the norm in this country.  The &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; became a major issue for many Deputies in this House, especially Labour Party Deputies, who made names for themselves on the Opposition benches.  These cuts in social welfare were made in a number of different ways in 1992.  A leaflet was dropped in to the households in the Kildare constituency of Deputy Emmet Stagg and Jack Wall who said that if they were returned to power Deputy McCreevy's savage social welfare cuts would be reversed.  I understand this leaflet was dropped in many constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It had a major impact in Kildare, seeing that Deputy McCreevy topped the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These issues were the subject of a major battle in Dublin.  Many of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; proposals will remain in place, to the shame of any party or individual who promised to reverse them.</P>
      <P>The restrictions introduced into the supplementary welfare system will add to the growing problem of illegal money lending and all that entails.  The supplementary welfare allowance cuts were introduced in a sneaky way by circular and did not appear in any legislation.  The Department of Social Welfare circular 14/92, issued last summer, stated that exceptional need payments should not be used to provide recurring help with electricity or gas bills and specified that a claimant could receive only one such payment in any one year to a maximum of £100.  It also precluded exceptional need payments in respect of local authority rent arrears.  Circular 18/92, issued in October, reaffirmed the broad thrust of the earlier circular by specifying that in the case of fuel bills a superintendent community welfare officer could not authorise payments exceeding these guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the views of some <Col N="345" /> people working in the community welfare area I will not be convinced that the damaging thrust of these circulars has been withdrawn until I see the regulations. It was the opinion of legal advisers of the EHB that circular 14/92 was <i>ultra vires</i>.  I wonder is it now being withdrawn because it was illegal in the first place.  Will the Minister address that issue in his response?</P>
    <P>There was not any consultation with health board personnel on the effect of the circular.  The reason for issuing the circular was said to be a large increase in expenditure on supplementary welfare allowances over the past few years. However, an analysis of the increase in the Eastern Health Board indicated that the increase in expenditure was caused by an increase in the level of substituted payments and in the level of rent supplements brought about by the Government's inactivity on housing.  What the Government were saving on housing they were paying to private landlords by way of rent supplements.  I hope the Minister will let us have the regulations quickly.</P>
    <P>The Department estimate that there would be a saving of £1.4 million, but that has been strongly challenged by community welfare officers who believe that the thrust of these circulars was illegal.  I would ask the Minister to respond on that point.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to publish all circulars issued by his Department to community welfare officers in recent years so that we as legislators and the public know what is happening.  At the moment circulars can be issued and there is no accountability to anybody for their contents.  Will the Minister also set up a social welfare advisory group representing Members of this House and all organisations that deal with poverty, as is done in other countries, and allow it to consult with the Department?  It should be possible to examine such circulars and to consult with the Department on them. Such a group could advise the Department and other legislators in relation to the development of social welfare and social security.</P>
    <P>The changes to which I referred were <Col N="346" /> the subject of a document widely circulated by the Labour Party.  They should be ashamed to come in here and support a Bill in which many of these provisions are retained.  The promises and commitments made are now forgotten for the sake of power.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill deals with students' unemployment assistance.  It says that unemployment assistance will not be paid to students.  The Minister has come in here today talking about grandiose schemes of community based jobs.  If the jobs are available, why are they not available to the long term unemployed, the young people and not so young people who have been unemployed for years and who are crying out for jobs?  Instead of victimising students over a two month period in the summer why does the Minister not give these jobs to the hard pressed, disillusioned long term unemployed people?  The Minister's figure of £60 million is fictitious, a figure that would apply only if every one of the 12,000 students got unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>It is £60 million plus the rent allowance.  The attack on third level students must be separated from the attack on second level students.  The scheme put forward today is not a work scheme; it is a cost control measure, just like previous programmes which were good in theory but which in reality were coercive measures.  This programme, which the Minister says is community based, will taint other programmes which could be introduced.  These measures will hit low income and middle income families who are doing their utmost to get <Col N="347" /> their children through college.  There are enough barriers already to families in the middle and lower income groups.  These measures will adversely affect those families. In fact, these measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the number of students going to college from the lower economic sectors is reducing steadily.  Well off families will find this measure an imposition but poorer and middle income families will find these measures an almost impossible barrier to overcome.  This is the thin end of the wedge to introducing a work for the dole programme.  Work programmes for the long term unemployed must be programmes in which they are encouraged and not coerced.  This is the first sign of a programme of coercion which will be introduced gradually.  I am amazed and disappointed that the Labour Party are so silent on this issue.</P>
      <P>The saving of about £6 million, despite being a substantial amount, is in fact shortsighted and disastrous.  The Minister referred to experience in Great Britain. The system introduced in 1987 by the Thatcher Government has had detrimental effects on students in the United Kingdom and I have seen reports which verify that.  This is a repeat of the last kicks of the Thatcher Government in 1987.  I am ashamed and surprised that the Labour Party and people in the Government who were supposed to have social consciences are going along with it.  I will be tabling amendments to this proposal on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> Is the Minister being realistic when he says voluntary groups and community groups throughout the country will assist and participate in a scheme to take on an individual for two months?  If the Minister were close to reality he would realise that voluntary groups are dissatisfied with the 12 month span in the FÁS schemes and to ask voluntary organisations to get involved for a two month period, during the summer, is unreal.</P>

The political credibility of the Government's reneging on the specific commitments made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is surprising to say the least.  I hope the social partners will be vocal in their objection to a major reneging on some of the provisions. The deferral of child benefit payments is sneaky.  Its deferral to September is a cost cutting exercise and is seen as an act of hypocrisy especially in view of what we have heard about child care recently.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and some of the measures he is introducing.  The Social Welfare Bill, 1993, is the first Social Welfare Bill of the new Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour.  It is introduced into this House at a time when unemployment is high and rising, when there are difficulties with the public finances, when direct and indirect taxes are severe, when interest rates are high and social welfare expenditure is expensive.  This is a huge area of public policy and as a new Deputy it appears to me that it gets scant intellectual attention from this House.  It affects the lives of 1.3 million people, two out of every five households in the country.  The total expenditure this year will be in excess of £3.7 billion, as the Minister has clarified.  Social welfare deals with the economics of the poor and as far as this House is concerned it has a separate existence from the economics of the contented in Ireland.  A reform approach is needed instead of the <i>ad hoc</i> relief approach of adding on percentages every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare set out several years ago to look at the whole area of policy.  Much ongoing lip service has been paid to the recommendations <Col N="350" /> made by that commission which was a very good commission.  All that was necessary to ensure substantially greater progress in combating poverty and increasing social welfare payments was to maintain the percentages of national income being spent on social welfare at levels pertaining in 1986.  This has not been done.  It is interesting to note that the priority rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare for income have not been reached in 1993.  These were set at £65 to £78 for a single person and, for couples, £104 to £124.  This is the only specific commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has not been honoured.  What we need at this stage in relation to social welfare is to acquire a clear statement of policy from the Government.  To this end we need an all-party committee of the Oireachtas to examine the entire social welfare code.  I would envisage the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and other interested groups working with this committee in both research and on a consultative basis in real partnership so that the many and varied complex social issues can be dealt with and to monitor the implementation of the outstanding recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare within a specified time-frame.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a regular and healthy debate in this House on social welfare a number of myths have evolved in the public mind.  The first is that the social welfare bill is out of control and is getting worse by the minute and that is unsustainable in some way.  Let us deal with these myths and put them to bed.  During the six years from 1986 to 1992 our GNP increased substantially.  However, the percentage of GNP spent by Government on social services, health, housing, education and social welfare has declined during the same period while the number of people on social welfare has increased. The percentage of our GNP spent on social welfare has declined from 14.7 per cent to 13.8 per cent.  There has been an increase of 94,000 people on social <Col N="351" /> welfare.  The percentage of national income spent on social welfare declined from 14.7 per cent to 13.8 per cent in those years.</P>
    <P>It is useful to look at the public service bill which has increased by more in absolute terms than the social welfare bill between the years 1986 and 1992.  The public service pay bill increased by £1,097 million whereas the total social welfare bill increased by £938 million.  When we compare the gain in public sector pay we will see there has been a gain of £5,877.92 In relation to average industrial employees there has been a gain of £2,889.64 and for social welfare recipients there has been a gain of £972.96. The rise in income for public service employees has been six times that of social welfare recipients. These are shocking figures.  This disparity between the growth in the public sector income and the growth in social welfare incomes is unjustified.  The 1993 budget failed to tackle the rising costs of public service pay which has increased by 9 per cent this year.  Therefore, it is clear that the social welfare bill is not increasing.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a certain public begrudgery often badly articulated by some people in society concerning social welfare recipients.  Let us look at the people who receive social welfare because it will serve to clarify some of the myths which abound in relation to social welfare recipients.  There are 776,982 recipients of social welfare and when one includes their dependants the figure rises to 1,390,050.  It is interesting to note that one in every three social welfare recipients is an old age pensioner. Could anybody begrudge payment to an old age pensioner?  I think not.  One in every eight social welfare recipients is ill &mdash; begrudgery is out of order here too &mdash; one in every four is on family income support or supplementary welfare allowance and other schemes which support families and other people in need, and one in every three is unemployed.  One can see that there are the same number unemployed in terms of percentages as there are old age pensioners.  Who among <Col N="352" /> us would begrudge giving support to the poor, the old, the ill and the unemployed?</P>
    <P>One of the main areas which the budget failed to tackle was that of exclusion.  A third of our people are trapped in this triangle of exclusion.  We ignore this fact at our peril.  We must look at all the side effects of exclusion &mdash; suicide, unhappiness, depression, alcohol abuse and disfunctioning families.  All of these effects flow from our flawed policy in dealing with exclusion.  It is time for an imaginative way forward in this area.  We need an integrated holistic approach which not only throws increased percentages at the problem every year but which seeks to improve the quality of life of those people who are excluded.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to sections 3-7 in Part II.  This Part provides for the increases in the rates of social welfare payments announced in the budget to be paid from July.  I welcome these increases, particularly the increase in the carer's allowance. However, as the previous speaker said, some aspects of the carer's allowance require urgent attention.  There is a very low take-up of this allowance &mdash; only 4,000 people are eligible to receive it &mdash; because of the very restrictive means test. This means that the people we want to see included are not included.  The Commission on the Status of Women has recommended that the means test for this allowance should apply to the person being cared for rather than to the carer. This entire area needs to be looked at.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should look at this allowance in the context of care in our community.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to increase to £20 per month the rate of child benefit for the first three children and to £23 per month for the fourth and subsequent child.  This is the only area where the promises outlined in the Labour Party manifesto appear to have been implemented.  I very much welcome these increases, as promised.  However, I note that the child benefit premium payable to families for the fourth and <Col N="353" /> subsequent child is not being significantly increased.  This is to be regretted, given the fact that poor households with three or more children account for over 60 per cent of children living in poverty.  The increase from £20 to £23 in this instance is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has always argued that adequacy in relation to need should be the cornerstone of our payments system.  We regard child benefit as an effective and necessary mechanism for achieving this.  We also believe that further increases in child benefit are warranted for older children. There is universally accepted evidence that the costs for adolescent children are significantly greater than those for younger children and infants.  Therefore we suggest that a supplement should be paid in respect of all children aged 13 years and over.  I will move an appropriate amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that children are part of the bounty of life.  The Progressive Democrats Party believes that the State should share with parents the costs of rearing and maintaining children.  Child benefit should become the central plank of our child income support policy and, more importantly, should be age graded. A case can be made for a totally unified and simplified system of child income support, as is the case in most European countries.  Any new system of child support should eliminate the need for the present family income supplement.  It is time that the entire area of adult dependency and child dependency was looked at so as to avoid poverty traps.  The prevention of poverty traps and the elimination of disincentives can be brought about in the long term by more generous child benefit payments and reducing higher marginal tax rates on low paid employees.  As resources permit, family income supplements could be discontinued and child benefit payments, plus realistic marginal tax rates on low paid employees, could be used to prevent poverty traps and eliminate disincentives to work.  I wish to remind the Minister that the Commission on the Status of <Col N="354" /> Women has recommended that so long as it remains with us the payment of family income supplement should be directed towards the primary care giver in a family.  I welcome in general terms the provisions in section 7.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for changes in the conditions for the receipt of maternity benefit, invalidity pension, etc.  All these changes are to be welcomed.  However, I should say that I grieve for the ground we have lost in terms of the payment of maternity benefit to unemployed pregnant women and women who did not, as a result of the 1992 cuts, have sufficient contributions.  I will be putting down amendments which will seek to restore those rights to pregnant women.  The extension of payment after the death of a pensioner to his or her spouse is both timely and welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the extension of the definition of an adult dependant. This provision should be welcomed in that it provides for equality between cohabiting couples and married couples. In future a cohabiting couple will receive a personal rate plus an adult dependant rate, which was not the case previously. However, this raises a series of questions for me as a woman about the extension of the dubious concept of adult dependency as it applies to women.  The Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1985, fell short of the spirit of the EC Directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978, which proposed that each married couple was to receive equal treatment in regard to social welfare matters. Because of all our previous legislation and procedures &mdash; we had fostered the notion of adult dependency in relation to unmarried women &mdash; we were unable for financial reasons to equalise the provisions upwards and were therefore forced to equalise them downwards, thereby allowing cohabiting couples to benefit substantially at the expense of married couples.  This anomaly was rectified in the 1992 Act.  To continue to foster the notion of adult dependency runs against the spirit of the EC Directive. I wish to issue a warning to women that, having won the right to claim benefit <Col N="355" /> in their own right inside of marriage, they should be wary of extending the flawed concept of adult dependency outside marriage.  By opting for the dependent status contained in section 11 women will allow the Minister for Social Welfare to have them anomalously removed from the live register, thus artificially adjusting the live register and perhaps disentitling them in their own right to training and other opportunities in, for example, the VTOS and other schemes.</P>
    <P>The issue of social welfare practitioners in trying to establish whether cohabitation is occurring is somewhat of a minefield.  The Minister and his Department have failed over the years to issue guidelines to field staff as to what constitutes a cohabiting relationship.  In Britain this issue has given rise to widespread criticism of the entire notion of adult dependency, whether in marriage or in a cohabiting relationship.  If this type of dependency is going to continue to be recognised in the foreseeable future I should like the Minister to set out for everybody's information the grounds on which a finding of cohabitation is allowable. For example, does there have to a common household, financial support, a stable relationship, a sexual relationship, public acknowledgment of the relationship, etc.?</P>
    <P>The recently published report of the Commission on the Status of Women deals extensively with adult dependency and how it impacts on women.  I would refer the Minister to the recommendations in that report which aim to ensure that adult dependants receive payments in their own right and that child dependant allowance is paid to the primary care giver.  To judge from the many submissions received by the commission, both the nomenclature and the concept of dependency are unacceptable in terms of equality for women.  Economic dependency has a negative impact on women's morale, status and overall welfare.</P>
    <P>I had some problems with section 12, but the Minister clarified these points in his speech.  I will get in touch with his <Col N="356" /> Department later in order to clarify them further.</P>
    <P>Section 14 proposes the most major changes in the social welfare system &mdash; it goes to the heart of the entire system.  The system's guiding principles of adequacy, redistribution, comprehensiveness, consistency and simplicity have been shattered by the provisions in section 14 which proposes to disqualify third level students from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months.  It is a <i>sine qua non</i> of any social welfare system that payment be made on an equitable and deserving basis.  The political question here is quite simple: is the Labour Party going to allow Fianna Fáil to continue to engage in these sort of cutbacks or will its alleged social welfare commitment win through?  I note that some of the cuts referred to as the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; have been reversed, but the irony is that they will be financed by students. I was staggered and shocked at the provisions contained in section 14, and the subsequent half-baked announcement by the Minister offering work schemes to the 12,000 students concerned only added insult to injury.  This panic reaction by the Minister has served to draw further attention to the overall inadequacies of both the educational and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This panic reaction by the Minister has served further to draw attention to the overall inadequacies of both the educational and the social welfare systems.  Our grants system is generally regarded as useless.  A student in receipt of a full grant is a rare species.  If this measure were proposed in the context of an overall review of the grant <Col N="357" /> system perhaps it would be more acceptable to students.</P>
      <P>Where is the Labour Party?  There is not one Labour Member in the House to defend this.  Where is their commitment to students, to the unemployed, the marginalised and the alienated?  Where is the justice of the Labour Party's manifesto? The Minister for Education has been droning on about her concern for hungry and cold children going to school, and quite rightly so.  Does the Minister for Education not see that 20-year-old students can be hungry and cold too? Third level students are her concern. Did she agree to this provision?</P>
      <P>Under the proposals in this section school leavers will be unable to sign for unemployment assistance or claim supplementary welfare allowance for three months from the end of July.  If they are not going on to college they will not be eligible for their first social welfare payment until November 1993.  For this group the only State assistance will be the extension of the child dependant allowance to their parents' social welfare claim, if their parents are in receipt of social welfare.  Alternatively they may qualify for one of the 12,000 jobs the Minister has miraculously pulled out of the hat.  Where are these jobs?  Will the Office of Public Works participate in the scheme?  The Minister in his speech used the phrase &ldquo;I will be consulting&rdquo;.  It is irrational to introduce this legislation when the Minister is only intending to consult in relation to these works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary and community groups have not received details.  They are worried that there seems to be no provision for training and that there will be no vetting procedure if students are assigned to work with them.  The care of children and the disabled cannot and should not be carried out by untrained students.  There has been no consultation with the various groups on whom the Minister intends by compulsion to dump our students to work with.  The success of all voluntary activity is voluntarism.  Will the Minister outline the discussions he has had with interested parties who will provide such employment? <Col N="358" /> What number of places has he secured by way of jobs for students? What will be the hourly rate of pay? Will students be insured under the Social Welfare Acts?  Will public liability insurance be available?  Will the work be full time or part time?  Was the Minister for Education consulted?  Was the Minister for Enterprise and Employment made aware of the Minister's new job creation proposals?  What role, if any, did the junior Minister at the Department of Social Welfare play in bringing these proposals before the House?  Does it not fly in the face of the role of the Minister of State in supporting people in poverty and in need?  Has the Minister decided on students' rights to travel?  Will they be able to travel freely around the country to avail of these works schemes?</P>
    <P>If this was a well thought out programme of voluntary work in lieu of State financial support, it would receive a much healthier debate in this House.  Sooner rather than later the Department of Social Welfare will be forced to draw up community development employment programmes as an anti-poverty strategy. This is not in dispute and I wholeheartedly support it.  With one stroke of the pen the Minister may have antagonised a substantial number of community-based groups whose support he will need in the months and years to come.  He has discredited what was originally a very good idea.  Such a partnership with voluntary and community development should be a positive policy, not a benefit sanction, as presented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What will be the real effect for the average student who has just completed the leaving certificate examination?  It will delay eligibility for benefits and opportunities.  For example, there will be a delay for a further three months, from 12 to 15 months, before he or she is eligible for FÁS schemes or social employment schemes.</P>

      <P>I am glad that is clarified. It assumes that all school leavers want to go on to third level education. This is not the case.  Such an assumption penalises a substantial number of young people.  As unemployment assistance is already means tested quite restrictively, this provision reduces the income to households already on low income.  It discriminates against 18-year-olds who have stayed at school.  It continues a childlike dependency and assumes a good and supportive relationship between parents and young people which does not always exists.</P>
      <P>The blanket exclusion from welfare of third level students shows a deep distrust of students and young people by the Government and a corresponding disregard for hard pressed low to middle income parents, on whom students will be forced to depend if they cannot find jobs and are ineligible for work schemes. It is also a serious erosion of the social guarantee that should exist between the State and young people.  This policy change is arbitrary and discriminatory in regard to young people.  How many student bank loans whose repayment schedules were dependent on welfare payments will be put in serious jeopardy? Before taking up paid employment the Minister, by his action, will have consigned their credit rating to zero.  Is the Minister not aware that most students work their butts off in a very competitive environment?  In the present economic climate they are not even guaranteed a job when they leave college.  Far from penalising students like this, we should be supporting and encouraging them at third level, including the holiday periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment of section 201 of the Principal Act, which debars students from receiving supplementary welfare allowance, seeks to change the words &ldquo;full time education&rdquo; to &ldquo;a course of study&rdquo;.  I seek assurances from the Minister that students will be allowed to continue receiving supplementary welfare allowance where they have an adult or child dependant or where there are urgent or exceptional circumstances.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that <Col N="360" /> these categories of students will be afforded the benefits of supplementary welfare allowance.  I refer him to section 201 (2) and (3) of the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>Will the voluntary training opportunities scheme be affected?  Will students who become orphaned be precluded from receiving supplementary welfare allowance?  Will disabled students in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance be affected?  Will students who are lone parents be affected?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all those questions is no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  These questions have to be asked.  The section is a disaster and the Minister would do well to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Part V, section 22 of the Bill deals with fraud.  The Progressive Democrats are committed to the elimination of fraud in the social welfare system.  There appears to be considerable concern at the extent of real or perceived fraud in the system. In 1985 the special investigation unit of the Department of Social Welfare interviewed 8,000 people in connection with unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  As a result of these interviews 15 per cent ceased to claim. In the period 1987 to 1989 the current Minister requested Craig Gardner to report on the extent of social welfare fraud.  The Minister has consistently refused to publish the findings.  Discussions I have had with people working in the field indicate general concern within the Department at the high incidence of fraud, yet the Department does not appear to have the resources to tackle it on a huge scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled recently the Minister stated that 530 people are employed in the detection of fraud nationwide.  This, when compared with a figure of 1.3 million people in receipt of social welfare payments, would seem to be insufficient.  While I welcome and support any measure to eliminate abuse in the social welfare system, I will not agree to benefits being <Col N="361" /> withdrawn for a period of up to nine weeks, as provided for in this section, on the report only of a deciding officer without due process of law and adherence to the rules of natural justice.</P>
    <P>Section 22 (2) extends the provisions of section 22 (1) to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As the chief executive officers of the regional health boards are the deciding officers for the purposes of establishing entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in accordance with section 204 (4), the section referred to, section 22 (2) of this Bill, does not have any legal effect unless the appropriate amendment is made to section 204 (4).  I would respectfully suggest that this section be deleted.</P>
    <P>On section 23, has the Data Protection Commissioner, who had misgivings in relation to a social services number and expressed reservations about the ID card, been consulted?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the role of community development and an interaction between community development and social welfare.  No discussion on poverty and social welfare is credible any longer without a recognition and analysis of the vast potential contributions to be made by the community development and voluntary sectors to job creation and anti-poverty strategies.  There was a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and by the Minister to a charter for the voluntary sector. Much lip service has been paid to the concept but as yet there is no formal structure through which this sector can truly participate in policy development at any level.  For the much bandied about doctrine of subsidiarity, under which decisions are taken at local level, to become a reality we need more decentralisation. This must occur in the context of a total reform of local government.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one further point in regard to students.  It is interesting that the Minister seems uncertain as to the amount students are costing the State by signing on in the summer.  His figures seem very vague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than £8 million <Col N="362" /> and that does not include the supplements. If every student did what certain students are doing that is how much it would cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ascertain the number of cases of fraud?  What lies behind these proposed policy changes? Is it abuse-based?  If that is so, I would like to see the figures relating to the abuse.  I do not think legislation like this is justified without bringing before this House the reasons for it, and if it is abuse-based we should be told.  I am not convinced.  The Minister's figures are uncertain and wavering.  I would like to see figures and details of any prosecutions brought for fraud.  What the Minister has said is not enough and I will strenuously oppose this measure.  If I were a student I would be outside the gates of the House protesting.</P>

      <P>(1)  the inadequacy of the increases provided and the long delay in their implementation,</P>
      <P>(2)  the failure to reverse the social welfare cuts introduced in 1992 which have caused such widespread hardship,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  the lack of any progress towards integration of the tax and <Col N="363" /> social welfare system, declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many people who are dependent on social welfare had hoped that the election of the Government would mark a fundamental change in the approach to poverty and social deprivation.  They were particularly hopeful that with such a substantial number of Labour Party Deputies in the new administration the fight against poverty would take its place among the most urgent national priorities.</P>
    <P>They feel very badly let down.  Successive reports produced by the Combat Poverty Agency have highlighted the extent of poverty in Ireland.  Let me remind the House that the Combat Poverty Agency is the agency which this House established some years ago to advise the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister of the day on what steps should be taken to deal with poverty in Irish society.  One such report, prepared by a team of British and Irish experts and published by the agency last May, found that the rate of poverty in Ireland was one of the worst in Europe and growing. A further report from the agency in June last showed that there was a huge gap in income levels between families on social welfare and those on the average industrial wage.  This report, hopefully, will help to dispose of the myth that life on the dole is too easy and that the unemployed do not really want to work.</P>
    <P>In their pre-Christmas review the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors said that almost one million people were living in poverty.  Those findings again are based on studies carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI. They pointed out that the percentage of national income spent on social welfare had declined from 14.7 per cent in 1986 to 13.8 per cent last year.  At a local level a study by the Combat Poverty Agency reported in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlights the level of poverty and deprivation in Limerick found that 86 per cent <Col N="364" /> of Limerick Corporation tenants were dependent on social welfare, with 32 per cent in receipt of an unemployment payment. It pointed out that Moyross, a community of 1,000 households, had only two grocery shops, no public phones, no chemist and no resident doctor.</P>
    <P>Against this background one would have at least expected that measures for combating poverty and reforms of the social welfare system would have figured very prominently in the Programme for Government.  Instead, poverty got little more than a token mention, and social welfare was dealt with in less than half a page of the 58 page document, receiving virtually the same space as sport.</P>
    <P>Social welfare measures on their own cannot end poverty.  That requires far greater structural changes in our economy and our society and is especially dependent on getting the huge numbers on the dole queues back into productive, well paid employment.  It will also require the integration of the tax and social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government contained a commitment to examine the feasibility of this move but, unfortunately, the matter has been taken no further and neither the budget nor this Bill provides for any moves in this direction.</P>
    <P>We strongly urge that the complex issue of how to fully integrate tax and welfare systems should be examined speedily and in the context of a major drive to ensure full tax compliance in all sections of the income earning population. This, combined with an expansion of employment through well targeted fiscal and industrial policies is the only secure basis for a significant redistribution of income which integration around an acceptable minimum income would involve.</P>
    <P>What social welfare measures can do, in tandem with tax reform, is to attempt to lift people above the poverty line. Judged against this objective, this is a totally inadequate response to the plight of those living in poverty.  While the Bill introduces some minor reforms, the overall thrust of it is a continuation of the <Col N="365" /> pattern of cutbacks and restrictions which had been the dominant feature of the policy of the last two Governments in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>Despite the criticism made by the Labour Party last year regarding the delays in implementing the new rates announced in the budget, the meagre increases are again being withheld until the latest possible dates in July.  The child benefit increase will not be paid until September.  Up to the early eighties these increases were paid in April.  They have been pushed back further and further each year so that now there is almost a six month gap between the announcement of the increases in the budget and the dates on which recipients actually get them. In the meantime those on social welfare have had to endure price increases on a range of items, which have gone up from 1 March as a result of VAT increases.  In addition important benefits like disability and unemployment benefit, unemployment allowance and supplementary welfare allowance remain, in real terms, below the priority rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The decision to deny unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare payments to third level students during the summer period and second level students for three months after finishing school is an unacceptable attack on young people. It is clearly designed to improve the appearance of the live register figures, without actually putting any more people to work.  It will further impoverish students, many of whom are already existing on the breadline due to a totally inadequate grants system.  In many third level institutions the summer break can be for up to four months.  Those students who are available and willing to work during this period but who are unable to find employment either in Ireland or abroad should be entitled to unemployment assistance on the same basis as any other unemployed people.  The decision will further penalise working families who are already struggling to keep their children in college at great sacrifices to themselves.</P>
    <P>This proposal has already been <Col N="366" /> strongly condemned by youth and student organisations.  The National Youth Council of Ireland described the proposal as arbitrary and pointed out that it would take no account of family circumstances. The council forecast that the move would reduce the number of young people from non-professional backgrounds attending third level education. The Union of Students in Ireland pointed out that, as there are no jobs to be had in Ireland, the move was effectively telling young people to emigrate.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to draw attention to a chart on participation in third level education provided by the Union of Students in Ireland.  I ask Members to bear in mind the point made that the unemployment assistance restriction on those who are already participating in third level education could well result in a reduction in the number of participants who come from non-professional backgrounds.  The document containing the chart, &ldquo;The Case Against Section 14 of the 1993 Social Welfare Bill&rdquo;, issued by the Union of Students in Ireland and dated 19 March 1993, does not give a source for the chart, however, I presume that it is based either on college statistics or on CSO statistics.  It is pointed out that the number of students in Higher Education Authority designated colleges who come from farming, higher professional and lower professional backgrounds amounts to 63 per cent, while the number of students whose parents are salaried employees, intermediate non-manual workers, other non-manual workers, skilled manual workers, semi-skilled manual workers and unskilled manual workers amounts to a grand total of 37 per cent.  It is significant that the number of students from the socio-economic grouping of unskilled manual workers amounts to 0.3 per cent; the number of students from semi-skilled manual worker backgrounds comes to 2.4 per cent; the children of intermediate non-manual workers make up 12.7 per cent of the total and children whose parents are salaried employees make a total of 8.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those statistics compare with the following: <Col N="367" /> the number of students whose parents are employers and managers amounts to 17.4 per cent of the total; students whose parents are lower professionals make up 11.1 per cent; children whose parents are higher professionals amount to 17.1 per cent of the total and those from from a farming background make up 17.5 per cent.  Already there is a huge imbalance in the make-up of the student population, and the Minister's proposals will do nothing other than aggravate the imbalance.</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing aspects of this Bill is its failure to reverse the social welfare cuts &mdash; the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;&mdash; introduced by the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  Indeed, the failure of the Labour Party to insist on a reversal of the cutbacks can only be seen as a cynical betrayal of the electorate by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that he is reversing a series of cuts made last year.  I find that difficult to believe: there is no action on the issue of maternity benefit; there is some stepping back on contributions in relation to disability benefit, but the pay-related benefit is still abolished; there is no action on injury benefit; there is no action on redundancy factors; there is a promise of some rolling back in relation to part-time workers but there is no proposal for the abolition of last year's cutback; with regard to dental and optical benefit, the long-term unemployed are restored to benefit and there is an increase in the exemption earning limit from £25,000 to £30,000 but the principle of means testing social insurance still remains; there is no action on the deserted wife's benefit; there is no action on equality transitional payments; there is no action on disqualifications; there is no action on health board payments, supplementary welfare allowance; there is some rolling back with regard to part-time firemen and firewomen but again there is no abolition of last year's ruling in relation to part-time workers.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when in fact he is only tinkering with them.  I propose, as I go along, to give some examples of the way in which the cuts are affecting people.  The Labour Party opposed those cuts when they were introduced in the 1992 Social Welfare Bill.  Labour Party candidates campaigned strongly against the cuts during the general election campaign and, as a result, won many votes from those who had suffered as a result of Minister McCreevy's cuts.</P>
      <P>When the new Administration was criticised for failing to include a commitment to reverse the changes in the Programme for a Partnership Government, Government Deputies indicated that the matter would be dealt with in this year's Social Welfare Bill.  However, the Bill leaves virtually all of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts intact, with only minor changes made in a number of areas.  As I have already said, cuts which hit women on maternity benefit, deserted wives, redundant workers and part-time workers are all untouched.  There is no reversal of the cuts in pay-related benefits and there has been no withdrawal of the controversial circular from the Department of Social Welfare which restricts the ability of community welfare officers to make payments to those in acute need. Fianna Fáil Deputies may not have fully understood the extent of the cuts when the Social Welfare Bill was going through the Dáil last year, but they must now be well aware of the severe impact of these measures on many of their own constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that there has been a general election and a change of Government since the cuts were introduced, it is important that the Dáil be allowed to vote on these matters once again.  The people have a right to expect some political <Col N="369" /> consistency from the Labour Party in particular.  If the cuts were wrong and merited opposition last year, Labour Party Deputies should vote against them again this year.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if Deputy Kemmy and his backbench Labour Party colleagues were interviewed about the Bill, about the withdrawal of student dole and about the failure to reverse Minister McCreevy's cutbacks, they would &ldquo;tut-tut&rdquo; about them and warn that the Fianna Fáil Party cannot take the Labour Party for granted, but do they have the courage to come into the Dáil Chamber and do something about it?  Deputy Kemmy may recall speaking in the debate on the election of the Taoiseach in July 1989, when, in comments directed at his constituency colleague, now Minister O'Dea, he said, &ldquo;You cannot play Mighty Mouse in your own constituency and behave in this House like a churchmouse&rdquo;.  Deputy Kemmy seems to have turned out as the greatest churchmouse of all.  I suggest to Deputy Kemmy that he cannot play Mighty Mouse on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and play Mickey Mouse in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the cuts which concerns me most is the secrecy surrounding the operation of the supplementary welfare schemes.  One of the most damaging cutbacks introduced last year by Minister McCreevy was the restriction placed on the ability of community welfare officers to make discretionary payments for such matters as ESB bills and rent arrears. The cut was particularly mean as it hit people who, through no fault of their own, are unable to spin out inadequate social welfare payments to cover all bills. I draw the Minister's attention to a specific case in my own constituency.  A husband and wife have an income of unemployment benefit of £92 per week, an income that is inadequate for them to survive.  They have outgoings of about £110 per week.  That does not include any payments or expenditure on food, clothing, cigarettes, drink or going to the pictures.  That woman has been refused assistance by the community welfare officer in regard to her ESB bill simply <Col N="370" /> because she got assistance last October and is not entitled to any more because of the existence of circular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want the Minister to deal with a specific case, I want him to withdraw the circulars to which I referred.  Dealing with one individual will not solve the problems of others who are being refused help daily by community welfare officers because of circulars 14/92 and 18/92.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said he was reviewing the matter, looking at a code of practice, issuing new guidelines and then withdrawing circulars 14/92 and 18/92.  In the meantime, people are being refused assistance.</P>

      <P>What is wrong with reverting to the situation which pertained before July last year?  It will not cost Deputy McCreevy a night's sleep as he is already out of the firing line.  The Minister has a reputation as a man who responds to real need.  I ask him to live up to it and to withdraw those two circulars.</P>
      <P>I want to make a final point in relation to the Minister's proposal to introduce a Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, which is a good idea.  However, this House does not really need to spend a great deal of time looking at the consolidation of something which is already in place.  We need to spend a lot of time looking at how the system can be reformed and how we can integrate the tax and social welfare systems to eliminate the poverty traps and to lift people above the acknowledged poverty line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>A cursory examination of the Bill may suggest that there are increases here and there.  However, they do not address the real needs of the people we represent.  For those on the breadline &mdash; about one third of the population &mdash; the reality is that the increases will not be introduced until July and that the general rise in the cost of living, compounded by a rise in VAT, will cause a <Col N="373" /> lower standard of living.  Why must there be such a delay in implementing budgetary proposals?  What is the difficulty in introducing measures which will correspond with the tax year?</P>
      <P>I note that other changes will not be delayed, social welfare officers will not have to wait until July to operate additional powers.  Will the Minister spell out in more detail the exact powers given to his officers?  From what I am told by my constituents, an inspector can call to a single person whose door may be opened by a visiting brother or sister and the inspector jumps to the conclusion that the person is cohabiting or married to the occupier, with the result that he or she is penalised on the basis of suspicion.  What control exists over the powers of social welfare inspectors?  What safeguards are in place to avoid mistaken judgments such as the kind of one to which I referred?  I hope that the Minister subscribes to the principles of fairness and equality with regard to inspectors; similarly I should like to affirm that all children &mdash; as provided for in the Constitution &mdash; should be cherished equally.  Will the Minister, therefore, say why varying amounts of money are shown for children in the list of revised benefits?  The recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency is something of a yardstick for measuring the humanitarian content of provisions in social welfare legislation.  One glaring departure from the recommendation is the lack of any adequate supplements for people on social welfare towards ESB bills, television licences or &mdash; where applicable &mdash; telephone bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perplexed by the frequent use of the term &ldquo;family&rdquo; which can mean different things to different people.  For instance, does &ldquo;family&rdquo; mean two parents only?  What about one parent families or one adult with a parent dependant?  Is this a family within the context of the Bill?  We must have consistency as well as fairness and in relation to fairness the Green Party welcomes the provision that the sex of a claimant for unemployment benefit or assistance will no longer be a factor in determining whether employment <Col N="374" /> is suitable for the claimant involved.  However, in the interest of consistency why is there a reference to pensions for widows but not for widowers? I have already tabled a parliamentary question in regard to the issue as a result of representations from people directly affected by this discrimination.  Does the Minister realise that a husband can be financially dependent on his wife?  In Germany the term &ldquo;houseman&rdquo; is used commonly, but in Ireland if a wife dies her widowed husband, who may have three or four young children, is left high and dry.  If he is sufficiently lucky to have paid employment he must make arrangements to have his children minded while he works outside the home.  He will have to get help with the housework as he finds himself assuming responsibility for the work of two people in the home.  To employ such type of help is often very expensive, yet no such assistance is available. If a widower becomes unemployed following the death of his wife he is again considered to be single, footloose and fancy free, even though he could have three children and has to maintain repayments on the family home, not to mention a family car.  This anomaly between the position of widows and widowers needs to be resolved urgently.  We must remember that we are in the year 1993 and the age of the &ldquo;houseman&rdquo; has arrived.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this anomaly obtains throughout the social welfare system. The most glaring hang over from Dickensian values can be observed in the farcical amendment being proposed to section 25, Part V of the Bill, which requires that if one &mdash; male or female &mdash; is to be eligible for unemployment assistance, one must be genuinely seeking but unable to find suitable employment having regard to age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  How depressing.  More than 300,000 people are to be forced to keep the sunny side up, to keep on seeking the elusive 40-hour week, five days a week, until they reach the age of 65, when they will receive the gold watch and have a little <Col N="375" /> time for their grandchildren, probably having been too busy in their own children spent much time with their own children as they grew up.</P>
    <P>However, all is not black; there is a sign of some hope in the provisions of this Bill.  For example, one is entitled to work one day a week and claim assistance for the remaining four days.  However, work does not often become available in eight-hour, calendar day packages.  What about two hours' work per day, say, cleaning a public house in the morning, or one and a half hours' daily doing deliveries for a shop?  Taken over a week that amounts to one days' work.</P>
    <P>It behoves all of us, especially the Ministers for Social Welfare, Finance and Enterprise and Employment, to recognise that the nature of work and society is changing.  If we allow the IDA to grant-aid machinery to extract timber from forests, putting a number of people out of work, then we simply cannot turn around and say &ldquo;Off you go now and genuinely seek paid employment&rdquo;.  A Government that promotes automation, rationalisation and competition must transform or adapt its values and rules to suit the society it has intentionally, or unintentionally, helped create.  I am glad that boring and dangerous work can now be done by machinery, but I am angry that the wealth such machinery creates will not pay the people it will have displaced. I am also angry that employers find it easier to get grant-aid for machinery than to employ people on a part-time, shared work or full-time basis.  Can the Government begin to see that the link between work and income is breaking down? People need an income for a week, but they may never have paid work for a week.</P>

      <P>If there were a shorter working week and work-sharing more widely available, more people would have some work in a week.  The big stick <Col N="376" /> of losing a benefit still hangs over people who are shareholders in the nation rather than children of the nation being given pocket money.  We are entitled to some dividend from the State's business activity &mdash; a dividend is not a handout &mdash; a citizen's dividend, otherwise known as a guaranteed basic income, which in the long run constitutes the only hope for this country, so that such work as can be found is more widely available.  This would mean that those with paid work would also receive a dividend, as would those without paid work.  However, those in full-time employment would have such dividend removed or annulled through tax anyway, just as people on high incomes are taxed at a higher rate.  The net effect of such a guaranteed basic income would be elimination of this ridiculous polarisation between employed and unemployed.  The ultimate effect of a guaranteed basic income is that we would all receive a dividend from the State and be able to contribute to society through paid or voluntary work.  Goodness knows, there is plenty of work needing to be done.  I might add that a basic guaranteed income scheme has already been costed and has been shown to be feasible.  However, such costing would be the task of the Minister and his Department. Suffice it to say that, even though the Greens have advocated a guaranteed basic income since the early eighties when the party was formed, individual Members of my party and those of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left share the belief that a basic guaranteed income scheme carries huge merits over the present system, notwithstanding amendments tabled to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister proposes bringing back into the dental, optical and aural scheme those workers earning between £25,000 and £30,000 annually, while at the same time announcing that those in full-time education will no longer be eligible to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holidays except in some very vague circumstances.

      <P>I should like to refer to a couple of provisions of this Bill with which I am concerned.  According to last month's budget there are approximately 4,400 people in receipt of carer's allowance who receive payments of up to £59.20 per week.  While the decision of the Minister for Finance to increase the long term assistance rate by 11.7 per cent to £59.20 is welcome, I contend such carers do not receive due recognition from the State for the services they provide.  By providing service for old or incapacitated family members carers take on a massive burden which would otherwise be borne by the State. The present total cost to the State of carers is estimated at £8 million.  Without such carers there is no doubt that the cost would be much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the rigid means-testing for the carer's allowance adversely affects the numbers of claimants who, generally speaking, would have a limited income. According to official statistics an estimated 450 people have appealed, having been refused the carer's allowance, suggesting that the system under which such allowances are granted is not sufficiently clear to its potential users.  I contend it should be rendered more user-friendly. For example, from the outset people <Col N="378" /> should be informed whether or not they are eligible for such allowance.</P>
    <P>In view of the numbers of aged and incapacitated people being cared for by relatives, the figure I have mentioned reflects the rigidity of the means-testing applied in respect of this service resulting in minimal expenditure of approximately £8 million.  We must remember that such services provided by relatives represent a massive saving to the Exchequer.  For example, without carers the State would be faced with a bill of several millions of pounds for the provision of long term accommodation for those people.  Therefore, I contend there is a need for an urgent, comprehensive review of the means-testing mechanism in respect of carers.  As a first step I would suggest that the income ceiling per week be raised by £20, bringing the lower category of income earners within the provisions of the scheme, thus affording them the opportunity of receiving a small amount of benefit.  Second, I contend that people in this income bracket should be given some tax relief in respect of their work as carers.</P>
    <P>I might bring to the attention of the House that the vast majority of carers are women.  It is unfair to expect Irish women to provide such service in a totally free, gratis fashion.  I am aware of some people in receipt of a carer's allowance who when they reach the requisite age to qualify for the old age non-contributory pension are deprived of their carer's allowance.  I am also aware of women who must give up their job in order to look after the elderly relatives rather than put them into full-time care.  Such people should be compensated.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the questions of low wages and the family income supplement.  It is clear that poverty affects not only those people dependent on long-term social welfare assistance but also many thousands of families who subsist on low wages.  In many cases low wage earners are worse off than people in receipt of social welfare payments.  I know of many families who subsist on a weekly wage of approximately £130 to £160.  However, if family wage earners <Col N="379" /> on low income engaged in overtime, that can preclude them from receiving the family income supplement.  In addition, many families do not qualify for a medical card with the result that they are exposed to medical expenses, school transport costs and do not qualify for any free school books.  Unfortunately, such families claim that they would be better off, financially, if they were unemployed.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is an effective one and it is aimed principally at aiding the low wage earner. Since it was introduced in 1986 it has been changed considerably.  It is estimated that the income limits have been raised by 50 per cent on average, substantially ahead of the rate of inflation.  As a result of the increases provided for in the budget an extra £2.5 million will be provided for the scheme this year and over £5 million in a full year.  However, the Minister for Social Welfare should review the guidelines for eligibility to ensure that families caught in the poverty trap will not be precluded from availing of the much needed family income supplement if they work short periods of overtime.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the issue of self-employed seasonal workers &mdash; there are many such workers in my own constituency. There is a major problem in assessing the income of these workers. Indeed, I am aware of cases where an arbitrary amount of income has been attributed to such workers and the workers concerned have not been told how the figure was arrived at.  I am also aware of cases where documentary evidence of actual income has been rejected by social welfare officers.  This results in people being awarded £5 to £10 per week in unemployment assistance for about six months of the year.  How can these people prove that their actual income is lower than the figure decided on by the social welfare officer?  Why should the onus of proof lie with the applicant?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine these issues as people are being arbitrarily deprived of their rights and expected to survive on extremely low rates of unemployment <Col N="380" /> assistance during the winter months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Social Welfare Bill which has come before the House the good parts of this Bill have been welcomed while the bad parts have been condemned.  I wish to emphasise the good parts because they have not been highlighted sufficiently in the debate so far.  In particular we should welcome the increase in child benefit.  We should also welcome &mdash; perhaps last year we did not think we would see this happen &mdash; the reversal of some of the cuts made last year which resulted in some entitlements being curtailed.  The most telling cuts have been reversed in the budget which is not bad going for the first budget of the Government, the first of possibly four or five annual budgets.  I welcome this because the cuts were severe and hit the long term unemployed and those in receipt of long term sickness benefit.  The remaining cuts have not been reversed but they were not as severe as the cuts which have been reversed.  I hope, as the term of office of this Government proceeds, that improvements will be made to the social welfare code to rectify any anomalies which have arisen from the remaining cuts.  As I said, the most important cuts have been reversed in the budget and this is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Despite the criticism which has been expressed about this Bill from the Opposition benches many improvements have been made.  The Labour Party in Government is committed and will continue to endeavour to ensure that the Programme for Government continues to improve and protect the position of those on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Social Welfare Bill the payments for children have been substantially improved and extra support for families at work will be provided.  Under this administration, child benefit will be increased from £15.80 to £20 per month, an increase of 26.6 per cent, for each of the first three children and from £22.90 to £23 for the fourth and each subsequent child from September 1993.  These improvements should go some way <Col N="381" /> towards making life somewhat easier for the many families who depend on social welfare.  In addition to the increases in child benefit the Government is also providing a new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins.</P>
    <P>With regard to the family income supplement the income limits are to be increased as and from next July.  As a result of these measures families in receipt of family income supplement will be £12 per week better off in real terms. The family income supplement scheme has been changed substantially to cope with new developments since it was introduced in the mid-eighties.  During this period the income limits have been increased ahead of the rate of inflation and the scheme has been extended to cover a wide number of people in receipt of social welfare.  This, coupled with the relaxation of the minimum hours requirement, has worked to increase the number of people eligible to receive the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the difficult question of money lending the Government has made available an extra £1.3 million in grants to the voluntary sector.  These have been designed to combat money lending.  There has been a number of appalling cases where people have been forced to rely on money-lenders.  I hope these new measures will allow people to avail of money from sources other than illegal money-lenders.  In total the Government is spending an extra £62 million a year on child income support, £50 million in the form of increases in child benefit and £12 million in the form of higher child dependant allowances and increases in the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>In the budget last month the weekly rate of carer's allowance was also increased, to the long term social welfare payment rate.  Although the system needs to be improved further this increase is most welcome.  The carer's allowance was introduced in 1990 and was designed as an income support for carers providing full-time care and attention for social welfare pensioners.  It plays a vital role in recognising the sacrifices made by those <Col N="382" /> who care for their elderly relatives at home.  However, it is fair to say that the qualifying conditions need to be improved to allow more people receive the allowance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the carer's allowance should be updated continually as statistics prove that people are now living longer; medical science has made it possible for elderly people to leave acute general hospitals but in many cases they have to receive full-time care and attention at home.  The health services cannot provide an adequate hospice care service to cope with the problem.  However, this should not be a problem as a nation or a Government are judged on the way they look after the old and infirm.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Social Welfare, together with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Health, will take a good look at this matter which is the source of increasing concern for relatives who have to give up work and make immense sacrifices. The carer's allowance, as presently constituted, will not suffice.  I am aware that there are many good private nursing homes but, unfortunately, there are not that many homes that public patients can go to.  These people cannot afford to stay in a private nursing home as on average it costs twice the rate of the old age pension to keep an elderly person in a private nursing home.  If relatives can keep the person out of the public hospitals by caring for them at home it would save money in the long term.</P>
    <P>I now make a special appeal on behalf of widows, particularly those whose husbands had the free electricity allowance and free telephone rental.  When a husband dies, his widow, especially if she is under 66 years of age, loses those benefits immediately.  To lose one's husband is a traumatic experience but in addition a woman has to face losing a major part of the family income as well as other benefits.  Even if we could arrange to put a stay of 12 months after the date of death of the spouse, on the benefits in question, it would give a woman some time to readjust.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague in asking the <Col N="383" /> Minister to give further consideration to the assessment of unemployment assistance claims.  Because of the high level of unemployment, unemployment affects as many self-employed as those in jobs.  The method of assessing those who were self-employed for unemployment assistance seems to be very severe.  The self-employed who have not found employment for many years find that assessments for income are still being raised against them.  This area should be examined. I accept that contradictory appeals may be made to the Minister: Members may be appealing to him to curtail the number of social welfare officers while others talk about alleged abuses of social welfare and call for more vigilance on the part of social welfare officers.  These are the contradictory arguments put forward in this debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to emphasise the positive aspects of this Bill.  They are very welcome and will go a long way to help the poor, the needy and the aged in our society.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely outrageous that we should have to share time on Second Stage.  The limitations on Second Stage debates are totally artificial and are designed to make life comfortable for the Government by gagging Members of this House.  I am confirmed in that view after listening to the two previous speakers from the Labour Party who could barely conceal their burning desire to oppose the Bill because it does so many things they opposed in the past and fails to do so many of the things that they would like to see happen.  To be accentuating the positive must have been a labour of some considerable difficulty for Deputy Pattison and I congratulate him on having the stomach to come in here and do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> There are a great many holes in this Bill.  When I looked at the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government, I found the promise to provide &ldquo;in the short term&rdquo; for maternity leave for adoptive mothers.  We would have expected to find such provision in this Bill, but it is not there.  Unless something is done about this during this year, it will not come into effect until 1994 at the earliest. Even if something is done before the end of this year, it cannot come into effect before the beginning of the next benefit year.  Another promise made by this Government has been reneged on very quickly.  We are entitled to ask: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  I wonder if Fianna Fáil is being hidebound and obstructive as usual or if the Labour Party is not doing its job?  Was this, perhaps, another cosmetically attractive promise blithely entered into without any consideration as to how it could be implemented?  If we reflect on this we find that the cost of implementing such a maternity benefit would not be very substantial at all.  In 1991, for example, a total of 590 adoption orders were made, and as we know the number is declining every year.</P>
    <P>If every adoptive mother in whose favour an adoption order was made was entitled to the maternity allowance paid at the new rate set out in this Bill the maximum theoretical cost of implementing this undertaking in the Programme for Government would be £1.3 million in a full year.  Now, of course, the actual cost would be considerably less than that because a number of those who would qualify for it would qualify for maternity benefit and a substantial number in whose favour adoption orders would be made would not claim for either maternity benefit or allowance and, of course, numbers would not make that claim in the current year.  Therefore the cost of implementing that particular part of the Government programme would be very small indeed in this year.  It is one of five measures listed in the Government's programme under the heading of &ldquo;Women's Rights&rdquo;, which we might realistically have expected to be implemented this year especially after the <Col N="385" /> birthing of this Government, which was such a long drawn out affair.  None of the five measures which might have been implemented this year has been put into effect.  I am forced to come to the conclusion that the Government's commitment to women's rights as set out in the programme is simply lip service and nothing more than a pretence.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that in certain circumstances, which are not yet specified, persons who are incapacitated for less than one year may be entitled to receive an invalidity pension &mdash; this will apparently be dealt with by way of regulation. I hope that such regulations will have to be debated in this House rather than the kind that come into effect unless they are opposed within 21 sitting days.  I take a particular interest in this area because I believe the system currently in operation for deciding whether people are entitled to an invalidity pension actually oppresses some people.  It has been the vehicle for some of the most unjust, prolonged and wasteful administrative pettifogging that has ever been my misfortune to see.</P>
    <P>I have a case on file which has been ongoing since February 1988.  The individual in question has been in receipt of disability benefit for a good part of that period, but he has never been continuously on disability benefit for 12 months.  When he gets near that point, &ldquo;hey presto&rdquo;, he is hauled off to appear before a medical referee, who solemnly pronounces him fit for work so that his disability claim very often comes to an end.  He then spends some time with the Department pretending he is looking for work and has some chance of getting it but they finally believe the evidence of his own doctor and of another medical referee who say he is not fit for work so he goes back on assistance.  When he gets near the point again when he might qualify for an invalidity pension: &ldquo;they say &lsquo;no&rsquo;, we have changed our minds again.&rdquo;  He is hauled before another medical referee and the whole merry-go round starts all over again.  That is institutionalised torture but it is not by any means an isolated case. Members on all sides of this House will <Col N="386" /> have come across such cases.  In the particular case I mention, I have been in contact in regard to it at length with the director of the social welfare services office on 14 separate occasions and I have been in touch with two successive Ministers for Social Welfare about it on five separate occasions but the nonsense goes on.  The State is oppressing that individual and others, but this Bill will do nothing to change that.</P>
    <P>Some small changes are proposed in the method of assessing means for unemployment assistance.  Those changes are welcome as far as they go, but they do not go very far.  There are still some nonsensical features in our means testing system.  An example brought to my attention recently was that of a small farmer who applied for an old age non-contributory pension.  An officer of the Department of Social Welfare solemnly assessed the capital value of his farm and concluded that it had a net yearly value of £450.46.  I have seen the assessment and it shows that that officer does not know a great deal about the value of farm land.  That conclusion was reached in spite of the fact that audited farm accounts showed a net loss of £591 in 1991 and £621 in 1992.  The assessment was carried out just before that individual stocked his farm last summer and he had £4,250 in the bank which he used to buy stock.</P>
    <P>Did the Department assess the net yearly value of that £4,250 as a capital sum?  No, that £4,250 was treated as income for the year and when the two were added &mdash; the £4,250 plus the fictional net yearly value of the capital value of his farm &mdash; he was assessed as having a weekly means of £91.39 whereas in reality that farmer was recording a loss of £10 a week in one year and almost £13 a week in another year.  He was disqualified from receiving an old age non-contributory pension.  That is the type of means testing that is being carried out and bears no relation to what is happening in the real world.  Neither does the system we use for means testing young people living at home who apply for unemployment assistance.  I am sure <Col N="387" /> Deputies on all sides are aware of this problem.  Such young people are frequently credited with an absolutely improbable proportion of their parents' income resulting in them leaving home to live in a miserable flat where they will qualify for the full personal rate of unemployment assistance plus a rent allowance.  The State ends up paying out more money and a whole series of new social problems may be created, alienation or even worse and we call that a social welfare system.  We are creating new problems that will come back to haunt us in the future.  In the long term, the State is paying out more money than it would if it paid those young people a reasonable amount of unemployment assistance while they are living at home.</P>
    <P>The crowning glory of this Bill is the iniquitous section 14, which is designed specifically to exclude third level students from unemployment assistance.  The &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; that were so trenchantly criticised by the Labour Party prior to the election have now become the baker's dozen with this extra measure thrown in and the Labour Party is one of the bakers. This must be one of the meanest and discriminatory measures I have ever seen in a Social Welfare Bill.  We are told that students on vacation will be considered for participation in some new form of community work schemes.  We have not yet seen the details of those schemes although the Minister waffled a little about this earlier.  Why should those schemes be specifically reserved for students on vacation if they are worthwhile schemes?  Surely nobody can say that students on vacation have some unique talents not to be found in any other group in the population?  This is a charade; the Government realises it has made a mistake in introducing this bone headed provision but it cannot bring itself to remedy that mistake in the only honest and decent way that exists, which is to remove this section from the Bill.  If those schemes for which students would qualify are worthwhile they should be introduced, but we should get rid of the nonsence of pretending that they are reserved <Col N="388" /> for students who are otherwise being discriminated against.  Bureaucracy is running wild in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 33 is an interesting section.  It requires a person who has made a claim for assistance to notify the Minister in writing of any increase in his or her means even where the investigation of that person's means has not taken place.  Therefore, when one applies for assistance, one waits for a social welfare officer to carry out a means test and if there is an increase in the meantime, even before the assessing officer makes his assessment, one must write to the Minister or cause somebody else to write to inform the Minister that one's means have increased.  The Minister who proposed this measure and the Government who solemnly put it before this House in a Bill would qualify as the shadowy tyrants in a work by Kafka.  They certainly do not live in the real world.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister found it necessary to have old age contributory or retirement pensions paid four weeks in arrears rather than one week in advance as was the case up to now?  If the purpose of this provision is to avoid the cash flow problem of having to pay some extra weeks' pension to those qualifying pensioners who opt for the direct debit payment system this year, it is another example of petty and mean-minded administration which will place an unnecessary &mdash; even if it is temporary &mdash; hardship on a group of vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>The oppressive, mean-minded and repressive nature of this Bill is clearly illustrated in Part VI which rejoices in the title of Pre-Consolidation Amendments to Align and Consolidate Various Provisions of the Social Welfare Code. We will have a Consolidation Bill, but we have an appetizer in Part VI of this Bill with the pre-consolidation amendments. We would usually look to such a chapter in a Social Welfare Bill for evidence of a sympathetic approach to the operation of the system, but nothing of that kind is to be found here.  An examination of the provisions in Part VI of the Bill reveals that they are all either <Col N="389" /> restrictive or punitive in character.  If that is pre-consolidation, I would not like to see the real consolidation; that chapter is perfectly in tune with the character of this entire Bill which is cold, unfeeling and uncaring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if my comments are repetitive but, unfortunately, there is no great departure, new ethos or idealism in this Bill and, therefore, I will have to dwell on more or less the same areas as previous speakers.  I do not wish to be in any way disrespectful to the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, but in reading the Bill and listening to the speeches here, it is difficult to find any section which would indicate that the Minister or the Labour Party had any impact on the type of policy as enunciated in the Social Welfare Bill.  If any of our constituents had been sent on a round trip to Mars last October and returned either on budget day or last week, following the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill, at best they would say that the more things change, the more they stay the same and, at worst, they would find it difficult to believe that a general election took place and that a new Government is in office.  There is no evidence in this Social Welfare Bill of a new Government whose agenda is based on change.  The social welfare system continues to be dominated by red tape and bureaucracy. There is no initiative to take people out of the social welfare system, the Bill is based on keeping people in the system. A figure of £3.7 billion was given for the total social welfare bill for 1993.  That is an enormous sum of money and it is difficult to say we are getting value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our social welfare system is based on fire brigade action.  We tackle the problems but do not deal with the causes.  We spend hundreds of millions of pounds on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance but do little to take people out of that system and put them back to work.  A person on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance who wishes to take up employment for three or four weeks or perhaps <Col N="390" /> for two or three months, finds it extremely difficult to get back onto social welfare.  For weeks afterwards they are on a merry-go-round of meeting the social welfare officer and being sent to the supplementary welfare department of the health board.  Therefore, it is not worthwhile for a person to take up short term employment because by the time they can return to the social welfare payments they have lost both time and money.  This problem should have been addressed in this Social Welfare Bill.  We should have done something to ease a person's re-entry into the social welfare system.  The result of that omission will be that persons who are offered short term jobs will refuse them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the incentive which may help take a few people off the dole, that is, the change in the PRSI exemption scheme.  Unfortunately, while the Minister for Social Welfare is making progress in that regard, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, through the FÁS programme, is abolishing the FÁS employment incentive scheme.  Therefore, what is given to the employment sector on the one hand is taken away on the other. That is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention some specifics of the Bill.  In regard to the carer's allowance, when Minister Woods introduced this scheme some years ago he announced with pride and good intention that it would benefit 28,000 people.  During the course of the last Dáil the Minister was asked on several occasions the number of people who qualified for the carer's allowance.  The information supplied showed that the figure never reached the 4,000 mark.  Therefore, a scheme which was designed to assist up to 28,000 people but which is now assisting perhaps only 4,000 or 5,000 people is a failure.  We must admit that and go back to the drawing board.  I welcome the small increase in payments under the scheme but when one thinks of the thousands of people who would benefit from full time care and attention and who would prefer to have that care in the confines of their own home or with their families, it is obvious <Col N="391" /> that the scheme has not worked and must be redirected.</P>
    <P>If one contrasts the amount of money the State spends on keeping a person in health board funded institutions &mdash; from £300 to £500 per week &mdash; with the miserly £50 or £60 per week which we are refusing to give a person to keep a relative in the comfort and confines of their own home, one would have to suggest we are adopting the wrong approach.  We must redirect our efforts to keeping people at home rather than in institutions.  That approach, too, would involve a saving to the State.  We must review the carer's allowance scheme in order to make it work.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the Minister's attack on students in this Social Welfare Bill.  In his speech this afternoon he tried to gloss over the proposed change by saying that it is similar to the position in Great Britain or continental Europe.  That is not comparing like with like because in continental Europe and, indeed in most parts of the United Kingdom, students have some possibility of obtaining work. Students here are facing a search for employment at a time when 305,000 people are unemployed.  The majority of students who claim unemployment assistance during the summer months do so because they have no opportunity of obtaining work.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell when she asked the Minister to produce evidence which suggests that some students are making fraudulent claims.  It is wrong for him to attack all students on the basis of fraudulent claims by a few, if there are such claims.  I hope the Minister can produce evidence to back up the draconian measures he has introduced.</P>
    <P>I would support the comments made by Deputy Dukes in relation to means testing.  We need to review our means tested social welfare schemes at all levels. The present system is very cumbersome. Those who undergo means tests are drawn through a web of confusion and red tape which is mind-boggling in its intent and is demeaning.  We should <Col N="392" /> streamline the system of means testing in all respects.</P>

      <P>There is much I could say about social welfare, but because of the time limit, I will confine my remarks to some very important basic issues.  I have always been struck by the complexity of the system.  I pay tribute to the Minister who, over a number of years, has slowly but surely succeeded in making some dent in simplifying the system.  Most social welfare recipients at times have problems in regard to the delivery of the service. It is only fair to recognise that there has been an improvement in the supply of information and in the delivery of service to clients of the social welfare system, but that being said there is still much work to be done.  For the ordinary social welfare recipient the social welfare code is a mystery and many people do not understand how the means test is applied. Therefore, there is a need to continuously review the delivery of service and the supply of information to the social welfare client.  If such reviews were carried out less work would be placed on the social welfare service in the long run and people would not be asking the same questions about how calculations are made.  If we are to make progress in the social welfare sphere it is necessary also to tackle, in a very radical way, the complexity of the system.  There is a plethora of different types of payments and different means tests for different schemes, though many are similar.  That makes it virtually impossible, unless one has studied the system, to understand how assessments are calculated.  This area must be examined.  I hope that during the lifetime of this Government a major effort will be made to produce a streamlined and reformed system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to consider also the potential of our people.  I have always resented the idea that social welfare recipients are considered to be different from others. They have the same potential as have other members of society if they are provided <Col N="393" /> with the same structures, but the system often inhibits that potential.  We sometimes think of motivation and incentive in the realm of tax breaks for the high tax earner but I have always believed that if we could motivate the mass of people here, the result would be much more spectacular.  However, to motivate people it must be made profitable for them to work.  For example, at present there is effectively a 100 per cent tax on the efforts of small farmers, fishermen, and others who are self-employed and that tax inhibits those people from increasing their incomes.  This area must be considered in the long term.  There is a well of talent that could be released if the opportunity to do so was provided.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would like to refer to the importance of the social employment schemes as an outlet for this demand in many areas.  In the west and, particularly in the Gaeltacht area of Connemara, there is a great demand from the people on the ground for opportunities to take up social employment schemes.  They see the advantages of these schemes as being non-means tested and of giving them an opportunity to work and contribute to their communities.  However, there are limits to the number of schemes available and to the finance provided for such schemes.  There are rules stating that you can be on a scheme for only one year and in order to get back onto a scheme you have to first go on the dole.  One rule I can never understand is that in order to be eligible for these schemes you have to be over 25 years of age; if you are under 25 years you have to go on a Teamwork scheme.  That is total nonsense.  As a person who worked in this area for a number of years I found that the integration of workforces of various age groups led to a sharing of skills.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a Regional Technical College in Castlebar, County Mayo, and to make the necessary arrangements to commence the promised third level education courses in Castlebar from September 1993.</P>
      <P>The case for the provision of a regional technical college in County Mayo has been well made and accepted over the years.  I formally welcome the new Minister for Education, Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, on what is her first occasion to respond to Private Members' Business. I wish her well in what is a difficult and onerous Department.  I trust that, following her deliberations in Brussels and in view of her understanding of this problem, she will ensure that it is resolved successfully for the people of County Mayo.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that of seven western seaboard counties, five have regional technical colleges &mdash; Donegal, Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Kerry.  There is no regional college in County Mayo, which is the third largest county in Ireland and has one of the highest participation rates in third level education. Students from Mayo have to travel great distances on a weekly basis to attend colleges.  The recent report on education, <i>In a Changing World,</i> indicates quite clearly that there will be a need for 30,000 extra third level places by the year 2001.</P>
      <P>I am privileged to have the opportunity to open this debate and I do so on behalf of all the people of County Mayo &mdash; industrialists, manufacturing interests, parents and students.  I am sure public representatives from all parties representing County Mayo will endorse this motion this evening.  It is important to give a brief summary of the history of this project, and I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979 the Leader of the Fine Gael <Col N="395" /> Party, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, met a deputation from County Mayo.  Having assessed the case made by them, he formally approved their proposal to have a regional college sited in the county.  On 17 December 1981 the then Minister for Education, Mr. John Boland, stated in the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The provision of such a facility to serve Castlebar and the adjoining region has separately been raised with me some time ago and as a result I wish to reiterate my commitment to the provision of such a facility in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question on 17 February 1983 the then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, said she was aware of the decision of her predecessor and that she was satisfied as to the validity and strength of the case for a regional technical college in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government, <i>Building on Reality</i>, produced by Fine Gael when in Government, stated at paragraph 7.85:</P>
    <P>New Regional Technical Colleges in Tallaght, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown and the commencement of planning of new colleges in Thurles and Castlebar have also been proposed. Subject to further examination of the need for each project and to availability of capital as many as possible of these projects will be commenced in the plan period.</P>
    <P>On 16 May 1985 the Department of Finance issued formal sanction to commence planning and design of the Castlebar and Thurles projects.  On 7 June 1985 the then Minister, Gemma Hussey, announced the go-ahead for Castlebar and Thurles. On 28 June 1985 a design team of architects, service engineers, structural engineers and quantity surveyors was appointed by the Department of Education. The Castlebar college was designed to cater for an eventual enrolment of 800 students at an estimated cost of in the order of £9 million.  Proposals were discussed with County Mayo <Col N="396" /> Vocational Education Committee and a final schedule was eventually drawn up.</P>
    <P>I served for a short period as Minister of State at the Department of Education and during the period 1986-87, 14 different sites were examined as being potentially suitable for development of a regional technical college as proposed by the Government.  Agreement was eventually reached in early 1987 on a site; but complications arose in that the site was owned by Mayo County Council and Castlebar Urban District Council, with four acres in the ownership of the Office of Public works.  The late Michael O'Malley, go ndéanfaidh Dia trocaire ar a anam, did a great deal of work as county manager to ensure that approval was given to make available to the Department of Education up to 20 acres of the site if necessary.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, issued a letter on 7 June 1985 stating:</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to your representations concerning the provision of a regional technical college in Castlebar, County Mayo.  The position is that I have authorised commencement of planning and design work for the proposed college.  My Department will be writing to the Vocational Education Committee in relation to the procedures involved.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Minister gave specific authorisation for commencement of planning and design as agreed following discussions with Mayo Vocational Education Committee and others.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1987, near the time of the change of Government, the Minister for Finance issued a letter to the then Minister for Education, Mr. Paddy Cooney, stating: &ldquo;I am writing to sanction the release of second level building projects proposed by your Department for the following areas&rdquo; and he indicated those areas.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I am also agreeable to the purchase of a site for the proposed Castlebar Regional Technical College.  As soon as an appropriate application is received my Department <Col N="397" /> will sanction it&rdquo;.  Following that there was a change of Government and the proposed regional technical college never saw the light of day.  Apart from spurious and vague allegations, made principally by the Fianna Fáil Party, nothing was done, although I would say to the present Minister that the Labour Party at local and national level were sympathetic to this case.</P>
    <P>On 15 and 16 May at the 67th Fine Gael Ard Fheis in the RDS the following motion was unanimously adopted by delegates:</P>
    <P>That this Ard Fheis calls for the establishment of a Regional Technical College for County Mayo in view of the growing demand for third level education and the high participation rate in third level of students from the county and region and that Fine Gael, in Government, will make the proposal a reality.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised subsequently by way of Question Time and Adjournment debates in the House.  It was also raised by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on the Regional Technical Colleges Act. However, despite all these efforts, nothing further was done in regard to the proposal for the college.  It is for that and other reasons that this motion is being moved.</P>
    <P>Support for the college proposal from the initial political response to it by former Deputy FitzGerald has led to other political party leaders giving their consent to this proposal, including the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey; the present Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds; Deputy Alan Dukes; Deputy John Bruton; former Deputy Frank Cluskey, go ndéanfaidh Dia trocaire ar a anam; the former Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. O'Leary; the present Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring; former Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla; the Leader of Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa; and the former Minister and present Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley. Those people gave their tacit consent and approval to the concept that this regional <Col N="398" /> college would go ahead and be endorsed by Government.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has a great deal of correspondence on her file from the Mayo regional technical college action group.  Great credit is due to the leader of that group, Mr. Paddy McGuinness from Castlebar, who has consistently, at great expense, stress and hardship to himself pursued this matter over ten years.  His group got support from almost every industrialist and organisation in County Mayo.  For example, Killala Precision said:</P>
    <P>We know from past experience how difficult it is to locate a suitably educated workforce locally and therefore it would be of enormous benefit to us to have a regional technical college in the region where graduates could assist us in the development of Killala Precision Components to operate competitively in the European Market.</P>
    <P>Rowear, a company employing 250 people, said:</P>
    <P>As an employer of 250 people engaged in manufacturing, I very much welcome the positive steps being taken by your group to provide local industry with suitably educated young people who will have the correct attitude towards work and productivity....</P>
    <P>From Volex Interconnect, formerly Cable Products (Ireland) Ltd.  I received a letter from the managing director which states:</P>
    <P>My company employs two hundred people manufacturing a range of sophisticated data and communication cable assemblies for the European market.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years we have put major resources into training our local workforce in Castlebar, and have developed a world class manufacturing site at our Castlebar factory, which has now become a leader in its industry in Europe.</P>
    <P>To maintain our position, as a leader in our industry, it is essential that resources be devoted to the training and education of our workforce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> We perceive that it will be of considerable advantage to Cable Products to have easy access to a third level college in Castlebar.  We would welcome the opportunity it would provide for further development and education of our present staff.</P>
    <P>Baxter Healthcare products said:</P>
    <P>As the largest single industrial employer in Mayo, employing 800 people at Castlebar and Swinford, we support all activities and initiatives which in any way contribute to the educational development of people in the county.</P>
    <P>They went on to point out that the advantages accruing from a regional technical college in County Mayo would, among others, include the fact that:</P>
    <P>Industry would avail of the research capabilities provided by such third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Mature students, already in employment, would avail of courses leading to NCEA diplomas and/or degrees, thereby increasing enormously the skill base within industry.</P>
    <P>The ability to attract and retain mature senior management personnel to run industry in the region would be enhanced considerably.</P>
    <P>Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Westport who employ more than 500 people said:</P>
    <P>It is a considerable disadvantage for a company such as ours, which is a hi-tech industry serving all the major markets around the world, not to have easy access to a 3rd level college.</P>
    <P>Asahi Synthetic Fibres (Ireland) Limited said, through their director and general manager:</P>
    <P>The Asahi Irish project at Killala is part of a very large Japanese Corporation (annual sales of 9.2 billion U.S. dollars), and we hope to encourage our parent board to consider further investment at the Killala site.</P>
    <P>One possible future project which has been studied, will involve state of <Col N="400" /> the art technology and the absence of a third level technical training facility in Mayo is certainly not helping our case for future investment, and the subsequent increase in employment which would follow.</P>
    <P>Almost every industry and manufacturing base in our county give full and unequivocal support for this project.  The Developing of the West Together group, organised by the Catholic bishops, give their full support for it as do the GAA, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Supplier's Association, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Mayo County Council, Castlebar Urban District Council and every parent and student in the country.</P>
    <P>Another reason for tabling this motion is to ensure that political promises are kept.  In a letter to the Chamber of Commerce on 2 July 1982 the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Padraig Flynn said:</P>
    <P>As you will understand, the Department of Education is presently awaiting a report from the Higher Education Authority in regard to future needs in Third Level Education.</P>
    <P>You can rest assured that I am pressing our claim for a Regional Technical College in Castlebar at every available opportunity.</P>
    <P>On 3 April 1984 the same Minister said:</P>
    <P>I put it as strongly as I could to her that it was necessary to fulfil the promises of Ministers and Taoiseachs, but to no avail.</P>
    <P>The present Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring in the <i>Mayo Post</i> of 22 February 1990 is reported to have met with a delegation from Castlebar and to have promised full support for the college.  He is reported as saying that his party had ensured that the Castlebar regional technical college was included in the 1985 plan &ldquo;Building on Reality&rdquo;, but he claimed that the Castlebar regional technical college was scrapped by the Fianna Fáil Government when it was returned to office in 1987.  The courses were to start in 1990, 1991, 1992 and now in 1993.  The <Col N="401" /> Tánaiste told that delegation that he had delivered in Tralee and that if Deputy Flynn wished to deliver in Mayo he could do so.</P>
    <P>In July 1982 the Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, met a delegation from Castlebar to discuss these proposals.  He said that proposals on the regional technical college would follow from that meeting and they did, through the Minister, Deputy Flynn.  On 11 November 1992 the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> carried a report headed, &ldquo;Mayo regional technical college Courses Get The Green Light&rdquo;. That was the third or fourth time that happened.  The report went on:</P>
    <P>Third level courses are to be available in Castlebar from September 1993, Justice Minister Padraig Flynn has confirmed.  The initial intake will be for 200 students and the subjects to be covered in the facility have been identified....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is beyond politics.  This is a vital service for all of the people of Mayo ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The project has been given my positive support for some time now. And a lot has been done quietly behind the scenes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education will be aware that on 12 November the Minister, Deputy Flynn, met with civil servants from the Department of Education in Castlebar, one from the administration unit, one from the planning unit and one other senior official.  Following that meeting, the Minister announced that six courses were to start in September 1993, four of them academic and two technological. These were to be full-time courses in Castlebar with an independent principal in the college, starting from a base of 200 to 250 students in the first year rising to 800 after three years.  It was agreed that there would be an alliance with Galway regional technical college for the initial start-up.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her reply should state categorically that the commitment given on behalf of the Government will be honoured by this Government.  When he was <Col N="402" /> a Minister, Deputy Flynn, agreed to meet with the action group every six weeks in case difficulties arose.  He went on to say that the decision conveyed by him on behalf of the Government was irrevocable if the Fianna Fáil Party was returned to Government and that it was well nigh irrevocable if the Fianna Fáil Party was not returned.  The Minister appealed to the action group, and to people of his own town and county to accept his proposals as worked out on behalf of the Government.  The time has come for this decision to be honoured.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very important and onerous task.  I know she will be inundated with claims for regional technical colleges in Blackrock, Blanchardstown and other areas, and obviously her own area will make its own case.  As an elected Deputy from Mayo, together with my fellow colleagues from Mayo, a specific Government commitment &mdash; I stress &ldquo;Government commitment&rdquo;&mdash; was given to our people that this college would be provided and that the courses would commence.</P>
    <P>Every Sunday evening hundreds of students leave by bus, train and car for regional technical colleges in Waterford, Letterkenny, Carlow, Dundalk, Galway, Dublin and elsewhere.  The exodus is a weekly one and puts great stress and pressure on parents and students alike. It takes longer to drive around County Mayo than it takes to drive from Dublin to Charlestown.  It is a region in its own right.  The Minister may not have studied this brief fully before her initial response on the matter.  I would remind her that on 10 November 1992 the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, said in a letter to the SIPTU members in Castlebar:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Labour Party recognises the enormous contribution which the siting of a regional college in an area can produce, both socially and economically, and the Party remains committed to the establishment of such a college in the Castlebar area.  When in Government in 1987 we approved the <Col N="403" /> allocation of funds for the purchase of a site to allow building work to commence and we are still fully committed to its early provision.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be clearer than that.  I would dearly love to have the opportunity to sit in the office in Marlborough Street for six months.  I understand the pressures under which the Minister is operating, but I appeal to her not to fail a county of the most western country in Europe.  The Minister has it in her power to deal with this motion effectively.  On behalf of the students, parents and business people of the county I await her response eagerly.  I trust she will be able to deliver on this commitment, which was a Government commitment given by a former Government Minister, Mr. Pádraig Flynn.  Having served with him in this House since 1977, prior to his departure for Brussels, I do not want to hear that the commitments he gave were untruths or vague statements made specifically for election purposes.  I should like to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Jim Higgins, the Fine Gael spokesman on Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time with me.  This year in Mayo we are celebrating Mayo 5000.  We are proud that the oldest agricultural sectors in Europe are to be found in the farthest flung corner of Europe, high up in the Céide Fields, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and some of the most beautiful cliffs and scenery in the world. Unfortunately, because of the manner in which things have happened and are happening in Mayo, there will not be a Mayo 5500 to celebrate or there may not be much to celebrate in the year 2050.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo has been one of the most acute victims of the national economic mismanagement of this country.  Depopulation has eaten like a cancer into the county.  In 1926 Mayo had a population of 172,690.  In the 1991 census of population Mayo's population had plummeted to 110,696 &mdash; 62,094 had fled and emigrated, a 36 per cent drop in 65 years.  It is interesting to note that the population <Col N="404" /> of Leinster increased by 62 per cent in exactly the same period.  I am not saying that the lifestyle or standard of living in Leinster has improved for those people. What I am saying, however, is that the basic and fundamental ingredient for the survival of an area or a region, people, has increased substantially in Leinster whereas Mayo has been progressively stripped of this resource.  Not alone is the rot continuing, but the rate of drop in population is increasing and accelerating. In the five year period between 1986 and 1991, 5,021 people fled the area.  I agree that although the reasons are simple to diagnose, the solutions are not easy to come by.</P>
    <P>In that period alone we in Mayo lost traditional large employers, such as Castlebar Bacon Company Limited and Claremorris Bacon Company Limited. Those who commuted to the nearby Tuam sugar factory &mdash; at least those who have not emigrated &mdash; are still hanging around on the growing dole queues waiting for the promised replacement industry that never materialised.  We have seen Irish Spinners Limited close in Kiltimagh with the loss of 150 jobs.  We have seen the closure of Babygro in Belmullet with the loss of over 100 jobs.  We have seen Creagh Agricultural Institute &mdash; the only agricultural institute in the county, directly linked to and servicing agriculture, which is the mainstay activity &mdash; closed, dismantled and sold off.  Ballinafad Agricultural College opened and closed inside a decade.  Claremorris Limited, manufacturers of light productive rainwear, is scheduled for closure on 14 May.</P>
    <P>The twin pressures of Common Agricultural Policy and GATT, with their copperfastened regulations and their restrictions and quotas, mean that thousands of small farmers &mdash; the traditional backbone of rural Ireland &mdash; will inevitably go to the wall.  The &ldquo;Euro bible&rdquo; pays eloquent tribute to the theoretical concept of the family farm, but the reality is that European economic policy operates a tyrannical scorched earth policy where small farming is concerned.  The result is that we in Mayo and in the <Col N="405" /> regions generally are witnessing the last generation of small farmers, of small retail family outlets, small shops.  These are people who have been in business for generations, good conscientious employers of local people often giving credit &mdash; or, as we would call it in rural Ireland, &ldquo;tick&rdquo;&mdash; to hard-pressed customers. They are closing down by the dozen.  They are being mowed down and cannibalised by the unfair and ruthless competitive advantage of the vulture-like supermarket chains which are descending from the outside as predators on rural Ireland.  Apart from the odd spark of local defiance and resistance here and there, the pressures of decay and decline have not been in any way resisted officially, let alone thwarted.  There have been no coherent plans from Government to cope with the problem, to harness natural resources, to develop alternative enterprises, or to create real jobs.</P>
    <P>Mayo is dying.  We are not begging for favours tonight; we are asking for fair play.  We are not asking you for anything for nothing.  What we are saying is: give us the tools, the implements and the wherewithal and we will save ourselves. A feature of Mayo over the years, long before the era of free post-primary education, has been the large participation rate in education in the county.  In an economy that was not capable of supporting its population education has always been the main hope of survival and progress.  The very sensible and pragmatic attitude of parents has been that if we cannot get them a job locally and if they must emigrate, then at least equip them with the best possible education available so that they will be able to compete and stand shoulder to shoulder with dignity in any corner of the world to which they have to go.</P>
    <P>It was said in Mayo that the young person got a suit of clothes for each of the three &ldquo;ations&rdquo;&mdash; confirmation, graduation and emigration.  Our young people now pack the already overcrowded lecture rooms in universities, the regional technical colleges and the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology. <Col N="406" /> There are many more who cannot afford to go because they are too far from Galway or Sligo to commute and their family income is marginally too high to qualify for higher education grants and too low to enable them to borrow and repay.  As Deputy Kenny has said, the distance from Belmullet to Galway is 110 miles and the distance from Belmullet to Sligo is in excess of 75 miles.</P>
    <P>As a county with proven high esteem and valuation on third level education, and with the third highest participation rate in the country, we in Mayo look at the distribution of third level facilities. We look, for example, at Dublin which has three universities, six colleges of technology, commerce, art and music, three teacher training colleges and a mushrooming private third level sector.  Cork has the fine University College Cork, a regional technical college and Crawford College.  Limerick has the prestigious University of Limerick, its Co ACT Thomond College and Mary Immaculate Training College.  Galway has UCG and a regional technical college.  We want to make it absolutely clear that we do not begrudge anybody anywhere their colleges or universities.  What we are saying is, please recognise the strong case Mayo has for a third level facility in its own right.</P>
    <P>One of the strongest recommendations in the Culliton report has been the need for further emphasis on technological education.  The Regional Technical Colleges Act, enacted by this House last year, allows and encourages the regional technical colleges to immerse themselves more fully in research and development and to actively foster an interaction between the colleges and the economy in the surrounding hinterland.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that the direct and immediate value of a regional technical college to a region is estimated to be worth more than £7 million per annum to the local economy, I have looked at the locations of the colleges and seen the thriving industrial bases in Tralee, Letterkenny, Waterford, Carlow, Athlone and Sligo.  It is clear in all of these cases that the presence of a <Col N="407" /> third level educational facility is a catalyst for growth.  It is equally clear that a region which does not have a third level educational facility is simply not in the marketplace when it comes to attracting industry from outside.  A key and decisive factor in any decision by an industrialist to locate in a region is the availability and accessibility of higher education.  It is patently obvious also in terms of developing and growing one's own industry and enterprises and creating jobs that modern third level facilities in a region are vital.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kenny rightly said, Mayo is not simply a county, it is a region in its own right; it is a very large region with the resources, potential and the ingredients for survival, but which has been deprived for generations of the essential means and mechanisms for doing just that.  Like Mayo, the regions of Ireland have been the victims of central Government. There has been absolutely no regional policy whatever, no devolution of any real decision making and no meaningful or real powers given to the people in the regions.  What was supposed to be good for the regions was all decided by central Government, but what central Government thought was good for the regions has proven to be disastrous and has been largely responsible for the plight in which we find ourselves today.  Now that this has been at least officially acknowledged and recognised and the new &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; words of regional development, integrated resource development and rural development have come into vogue, surely it is a logical follow-on that the regional development of Mayo should be assisted and supported by the presence of a regional technical college within the county.</P>
    <P>There has always been a strong case for a regional technical college in Mayo. As Deputy Kenny said, the Coalition Government led by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, having looked at the obvious success story of the first phase of the regional technical colleges, decided, quite rightly, on a phase two development and for the erection of new colleges in Tallaght, Castlebar and Thurles.  Thankfully, the Tallaght <Col N="408" /> regional technical college is now a reality.  The Fine Gael-Labour Government assigned responsibility for the project to the then Minister of State, my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny. Officials, architects and planners descended on Mayo, a fine site was identified and earmarked for the project and the courses of study designed and agreed.  It was all systems go.  The Fine Gael led Coalition Government left office in 1987 and since then Fianna Fáil or Fianna Fáil in Coalition with its previous partners have effectively allowed the project to die.</P>
    <P>Here I wish to pay tribute to Councillor Paddy McGuinness and his regional technical college group, the Mayo Action Committee.  For the past five years they have refused to allow the project to die in the minds of the people.  As a result of Fianna Fáil indifference to the project, that has been the policy.  It was their &ldquo;never say die&rdquo; attitude, their tenacity, which grudgingly extracted from the then Minister, EC Commissioner Pádraig Flynn, in November 1992 a commitment that third level courses would be made available in existing accommodation in Castlebar as and from September 1993. It was not what the people wanted.  It was far removed from the regional technical college concept envisaged and planned by Fine Gael in Government but at least it was a start, a stepping stone to a fully fledged regional technical college. Imagine the disbelief of the action committee when it was told by the Minister for Education three weeks ago that there was no possibility whatever of the Flynn promise going ahead.  The mind really boggles when one thinks that someone in such a position of power as Commissioner Flynn could make such a promise which affects the lives, aspirations, expectations, livelihoods and survival of an entire community and then stand idly by or scurry off to Brussels and see it discarded at the stroke of a pen.</P>
    <P>There is a seething anger in Mayo, and this is not simply based on the dashed expectations of people.  It is based on the failure of the Government, Fianna Fáil and its now divorced partners to acknowledge <Col N="409" /> and deliver on the strong case for a regional technical college for Mayo.  I want to make it perfectly clear that we are not simply demanding a regional technical college for Mayo students.  We are talking by and large about catering for Mayo students, but we are also talking about putting on new innovative courses of study which will attract students from all over the country.  The existing colleges are bursting at the seams.  For example, last year students had to take lectures in the corridors of Galway Regional Technical College.  Recently we received an official document from UCD which stated that the &ldquo;house full&rdquo; signs are up in Belfield.  Only last week, the Central Applications Office confirmed that an all-time high figure of 52,000-plus students had made applications for the CAO and CAS courses.  If these students are put on top of the already choc-a-block overcrowded student population in colleges there will be campus chaos in September.</P>
    <P>The £4 million increase in building grants in the recently published Estimates for 1993 is hopelessly inadequate in the context of the demand.  It has been estimated that with the emerging growth in the number of students attending third level colleges the equivalent of seven new regional technical colleges will be required.  Obviously a considerable portion of this number will be catered for by extensions to the existing colleges. Indeed, I have noticed with considerable interest the new extension sanctioned for the regional technical college in the Tánaiste's home base of Tralee.</P>
    <P>What we the people of Mayo are saying is, &ldquo;We want our college now.  We want it in two phases and we want absolute clarification on this issue tonight and tomorrow night&rdquo;.  This is the month of March, and the colleges will not begin their 1993-94 school year until next September.  There is adequate and ample time &mdash; a full six month period &mdash; to arrange and facilitate in existing accommodation in Castlebar the third level courses promised by Commissioner Flynn and Fianna Fáil four months ago. We want a crystal clear commitment to the principle of a fully fledged regional <Col N="410" /> technical college in Mayo with a specific projected starting date.  Mayo people are sick to the teeth of broken promises.  It is easy to understand the bewilderment, frustration and anger of the people of Mayo when they look at the millions of pounds of public money spent in setting up tribunals, investigations and courts of inquiry to investigate the actions of some of the main captains of industry in this country, not to mention the millions gobbled up in building, equipping and staffing luxurious Government offices, and are then told that there is no money available to provide a college in Mayo which would provide a lifeline for survival.</P>
    <P>I could go on and quote case history after case history.  As the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, will testify, there was no problem in moving an emergency Estimate in the Dáil during Christmas week two years ago to make £9.5 million available to purchase Carysfort College to relieve a friend of the Fianna Fáil Party of a building with which he was evidently stuck. There is not alone anger in Mayo; there is also a sullen determination.  If this regional technical college is not delivered upon then the people of Mayo West will use the forthcoming by-election as a very welcome opportunity to send both Government parties a very clear signal that people will not be duped, conned and fooled any longer and that the day of the false election promises has at long last come to an end.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, commending the Minister for Education for her commitment to investment in Higher Education in order to provide sufficient places for all able to benefit and to ensure that additional resources are used to widen access for all students to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity and economic development, notes that the Minister <Col N="411" /> is urgently examining the needs of different regions, socio-economic groups and the overall education needs of society with a view to developing an integrated plan in the context of third level education generally and in the context of the White Paper on Education.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, to review the current position on higher education and to look to the future needs and policy in the area, with particular reference to regional technical colleges and the needs of Castlebar.</P>
    <P>I begin by outlining the dramatic changes which have taken place in higher education over the past generation.  The number of students in third level education has more than doubled from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 80,000 in 1992-93. Current projections indicate that there will be more than 100,000 students by the turn of the century.  This increase in absolute numbers is reflected in the increasing proportion of the age group proceeding to third level &mdash; 20 per cent in 1989, over 40 per cent last year and heading towards 50 per cent by the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>It is worth at this stage looking not just at numbers but at the diversity of institutions within which courses are operated.  The universities continue to be the largest providers of higher education with almost 46,000 students.  The arrangement initiated by the Government with the universities in 1990 whereby the universities were to provide not less than an extra 3,600 undergraduate places over a three to four year period is currently running above the annual target of 1,200 additional students.</P>
    <P>The growth in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology has been particularly dramatic.  In the period since 1980 wholetime student numbers in regional technical colleges have risen from 6,500 to more than 22,000.  In the same period wholetime enrolments in the Dublin Institute of <Col N="412" /> Technology have risen from 4,000 to almost 9,000.  The new Regional Technical Colleges Act and Dublin Institute of Technology Act which came into effect on 1 January give a new legislative framework for these institutions and, very importantly, will allow the development of interaction with industry.  Other colleges, including the teacher training colleges, the National College of Art and Design, Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland add a further 2,500 students to the total in higher education.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure on education in 1993 amounts to £1.8 billion, representing approximately 19 per cent of Government expenditure and about 6 per cent of GDP.  This represents an unprecedented increase in allocation of available resources to education compared with 1965, when the corresponding figures were 13.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>Of this expenditure third level education now acounts for about 22 per cent of the Education budget, compared to 8 per cent in 1966.  Additionally in the current year the total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State is about £84 million compared to £75 million in 1992, a 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the Government's commitment to widening access to higher education, I would like to speak briefly about the higher education grants scheme.  Following on proposals contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a range of significant improvements was introduced in 1992.</P>
    <P>Income eligibility limits were substantially increased, as was the size of the grants.  Lone parent's welfare payments are now disregarded for grants purposes. Mature students, new and existing, are now automatically considered to meet the academic requirements for grants and they may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes rather than on their parents' income.  I am satisfied that the schemes are making a significant contribution to meeting policy objectives.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently carrying <Col N="413" /> out a review of the third level student support schemes as part of the process of preparing the 1993 schemes.  If there are obvious elements of inequity or distortions in the schemes, they will be changed, within the constraints of Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital investment, the current European Regional Development Fund infrastructure programme costing approximately £85 million has been targeted at projects which are firmly linked to key technologies and which have been clearly identified as national priorities.  It includes developments in the education and training sector which will strengthen the links between the institutions and industry, particularly in information technology, marine science and aquaculture, biology/technology, food science, microelectronics, tourism and management, areas which are vital to the achievement of the Government's strategic objectives for economic expansion. Selected institutions for development have the capability to build on existing strengths and have a proven record of excellence in the respective technologies.</P>
    <P>Investment in the physical resources will also enable the institutions to support existing industry, particularly indigenous industries, to introduce new technology and to upgrade and develop new projects. In particular it will ensure the supply of highly skilled manpower for existing and new industries.  The strengthening of institution/industry links is central therefore to the success of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to meeting the increased demand for places generally in the third level education and training sector, it should be noted that a separate five-year programme of capital works has been initiated for designated institutions in the university sector, at an estimated cost of £15 million over a three year period with the objective of providing an additional 3,600 places.  A similar investment programme costing £3 million in 1993 was introduced to assist the regional technical colleges in providing additional accommodation for the growing numbers of students in the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> The programme is also particularly geared to strengthening institution/ industry links which is essential for the viability of many companies and for economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>A new programme is being designed to build on the success of the 1990-93 programme and many of the recent responses from the universities, Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical colleges are clearly targeted at the Government's policy of economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>These are very positive indicators of progress which highlight the Government's commitment to the systematic expansion and development of our higher education sector and underline the willing co-operation that has been forthcoming from all higher education institutions in maximising the use of existing facilities and resources.</P>
    <P>From this account it can be seen that overall developments in higher education have been quite extraordinary.  It is also evident that the major phase of expansion in the capacity of the third level system has already taken place.  Numbers have increased by more than 300 per cent since 1965, whereas the projected increase between now and the year 2000 is 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is clear that higher education requires a very large investment by the State and by individuals.  There is, therefore, a very heavy responsibility to ensure that this investment is maximised so that the system operates on an effective, well co-ordinated, equitable and transparent basis.  This cannot be achieved through &ldquo;ad-hocery&rdquo; or through responses based only on pressure from competing interest groups.  Proper planning is essential to allow all students able to benefit to maximise their &ldquo;life chances&rdquo; and to contribute fully to the society we live in. There is an expectation abroad that the anticipated increase in funding can cater for an unlimited number of projects.</P>
    <P>The increasing demand for higher education and the value placed on the siting of institutions is reflected in the increasing pressure from various locations for <Col N="415" /> the provision of new institutions.  Castlebar, Thurles, Blanchardstown and, last but not least, Dún Laoghaire, have made their views known in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>While I anticipate a significant increase in the allocation of funding under the new programme it must also be recognised that having regard to the present economic climate the Government must give priority to projects which will generate sustainable employment and economic growth.</P>
    <P>The cases made are, of course, worthwhile and in an ideal world each of these and, indeed, other communities could have their own institutions of higher education. Realistically, however, even with increased EC funds, the budgetary scenario means that very tough decisions have to be made in considering any expansion of existing provision.</P>
    <P>In deciding on any new regional technical college or other institution we must learn from the past 20 years' experience. Any new institution must have a clear focus and play an important role in enterprise development and in development of the local economy.  While some institutions have made significant contributions in these areas not all institutions have developed their full potential.</P>
    <P>Decisions on investment must have regard to (1) priorities in educational provision with particular regard to the disadvantaged; (2) most effective use of scarce resources; (3) additional places required overall; (4) viability of establishing new centres as against the expansion of existing institutions &mdash; considerations of critical mass and cost effectiveness cannot be overlooked; (5) local and regional participation rates; (6) the contribution such investment will make to regional development and overall economic welfare and (7) type and level of courses needed bearing in mind their contribution to productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>With all this in mind I believe it is time now for an overview of demands and needs in higher education to include the <Col N="416" /> university sector, the technical and technological colleges and the range of course provision currently in place throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that scarce resources are used to maximum advantage I am proposing to examine the needs of different regions, socio-economic groups and the overall needs of society with a view to developing an integrated plan in the context of third level education generally and in the context of the White Paper on Education.</P>
    <P>The needs analysis would have to be grounded in rigorous statistical analysis and projections, covering participation rates, demographic trends, second level populations, etc.  In addition, the analysis should take full account of budgetary and financial realities.</P>
    <P>Further, it would be important to set the needs analysis in a context of developing arrangements for course modularisation and credit transfer arrangements across the third level system as well as the international and EC dimensions.  In other words, there will be greater flexibility in the future in terms of how and where a student studies for third level qualifications.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's objective of achievement of aims through the highest level of democratic participation such a review would be expected to consider submissions from various parts of the country for the location of higher education institutions in their areas.  Such submissions would be expected to address the issues I have already outlined. Cases must be logical, cogent and coherent and should not stem solely from localism, understandable though that impulse may be.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a review of the magnitude outlined could be expected to take some time to complete.  I intend, however, that the review should be initiated with the greatest urgency and to that end I will be inviting the Higher Education Authority to discussions without delay.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I am aware of the particular pressures which relate to the Castlebar situation.  I am aware of statements <Col N="417" /> made recently with regard to the provision of courses in Castlebar.  On 2 March I met a delegation from Castlebar and listened to what they had to say.  I have read also with interest and sympathy the case for a regional technical college for Castlebar which was submitted to my predecessor by the Mayo Regional Technical College Action Group. I note particularly the wide-ranging letters of support from local organisations and industry.  The submission does not, however, make any proposals with regard to courses required, student numbers or delivery arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have stated already that I believe that a review of the third level provision generally is required before any decisions could be made with regard to new institutions.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of Castlebar I have noted the paucity of post-secondary provision in that area and the high levels of participation in higher education from County Mayo.  I am also aware of the very high expectations generated in recent times through public discussion and comment.</P>
    <P>At the recent meeting I was pleased to invite County Mayo Vocational Education Committee to submit their views on appropriate developments in County Mayo.  I confirmed this invitation by letter of 23 March to Mr. Langan, chief executive officer of the vocational education committee.  I look forward to the receipt of comprehensive proposals in this regard.  As part of this development I would be willing to approve of the first year of a number of national certificate programmes on an outreach basis.  Subject to viability including adequate demand, resource availability &mdash; including availability of suitable accommodation &mdash; and, of course, agreement with interested parties it is hoped that programmes could commence in September 1993.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is my intention after the Easter conferences of the teacher unions to visit Castlebar and to discuss this issue further with all interested parties. I look forward, also, to meeting <Col N="418" /> interested parties in the other various locations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the House again of the Government commitment to investing in higher education to a level where sufficient places will be available for all able to benefit.  The Government recognises that with the increasing sophistication of the world economy, the capability and knowledge of the workforce becomes more and more critical to providing the impetus for economic growth and job creation.  Clearly investment in education is the key to future prosperity and to equality and equal opportunity for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by complimenting Deputies Kenny and Higgins on the strong case they have made for the provision of a regional college in Castlebar.  They have outlined the background, the support that has been received, the commitment that has been made, the promises that have been given, the hopes that have been raised and the hopes that have been dashed because no delivery has been made on the commitment. Unfortunately, the case they have outlined could equally be made for at least another dozen regions in Ireland. Indeed, the case could be made to most of the other Ministers in Cabinet.  The case could be made to the Minister for Finance or to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment because most of the argument had to do with the economy, the depressed nature of Mayo and the overall effect on the region.</P>
      <P>The strongest promises were made at election time.  Education in particular has, it seems, become a political football and promises to build schools are made in a manner similar to the throwing of confetti at a wedding.  As Deputy Higgins indicated, there is a by-election on the way and now we have Fine Gael gearing up to try to rouse the people of Mayo behind them on this business of a regional college for Castlebar.  We are moving into the area of cynicism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue.  There <Col N="419" /> was a specific Government commitment given on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael made a commitment in this area as well.  The timing of this motion &mdash; and it has been confirmed by Deputy Higgins &mdash; seems to be related to the forthcoming by-election. As I see it, this has been typical of the way in which education has been used in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's own party leader has given us full support for this. What is the Deputy talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please allow the Deputy to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply referring to an indication already made by Deputy Higgins, that this issue is being made a political football to be used in the upcoming by-election in Mayo West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making no apology for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state that fact, and to state it clearly.  I come from the west, my sympathies lie in the west and I am well aware of rural disadvantage; so, naturally, I would have strong sympathy in this regard.  My professional background is in education and I know of the needs for the renovation and refurbishment of substandard buildings and of the needs for new schools at primary, second level and third level.  Again, this would heighten my sympathy for this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency I represent, that of Dublin Central, would also lead one to an acute awareness of disadvantage in access to third level education &mdash; indeed, in access to full second level education. The socio-economic group strongest in <Col N="420" /> that area has the lowest level of access to third level education; there is virtually no access at third level.  Figures provided recently in the &ldquo;Healthy City&rdquo; survey carried out by Dublin Corporation showed that there were approximately 6,000 youngsters not attending school on a daily basis and that the school attendance officers were least available in the most depressed and deprived areas. Although there might have been six or seven school attendance officers to cover outlying areas, there was only one school attendance officer for the inner city areas, which have the greatest degree of disadvantage and deprivation and where the officers are most needed.  Worse still, 25 per cent of those school attendance officers were older than 65.</P>
    <P>There is considerable work to be done in the provision of access to education and in making the playing field level. The Clancy report of 1986 highlighted the inequality in access to third level education and indicated &mdash; an ironic observation in terms of this debate &mdash; that the western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry, had the highest level of third level participation.  One of the Fine Gael Deputies from Mayo said in the debate today that Mayo has the third highest level of participation in third level education. That is a figure to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for the approach she has taken to this matter.  She could have come to the House and made an empty promise along the lines of one of the promises made in the past decade and not fulfilled.  The present Minister, however, made a positive commitment to the provision of the first year of third level education in the county of Mayo, the local base.  That was a major breakthrough; provision has not been made on a gradual basis before.  Previously we had a promise but nothing to back it up.  Now the Minister has made a commitment to a process which could lead to much greater access within County Mayo itself.  The Minister has said that she will endeavour to provide that first year of third level education in County Mayo by September next.  Youngsters who would have gone <Col N="421" /> to regional technical colleges in Sligo, Galway or elsewhere should now be able to have their first year of third level education in Mayo.  The Minister is to determine from the local vocational education committee the accommodation that can be provided to ensure participation in third level education at local level by students from County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The second important indication from the Minister is that the days of the political football in education are over. The Minister is to prepare a plan that deals with the wider issue of participation in and accessibility to education. Included in this proposal is the Minister's intention to examine the need for third level education participation and access to third level education throughout the country.  The Minister will prioritise the location of educational institutions, which decision will be made in the context of participation, accessibility, demography and need.  There is no sense in any Minister or any Government making a promise in the middle of an election campaign to build a school somewhere and then finding when the election is over that a new Minister for Education is left with a raft of promises that cannot be delivered on.  It is important to regulate the position and to form a policy.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government is specific in reference to education.  A first priority is for democratic devolution.  The commitment made by the Minister for the first year of third level education is a very good example of an attempt to develop democratic intermediate education at the county level. In relation to the Structural Funds and resources, it is stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government:</P>
    <P>We anticipate that under the new Structural Funds extra resources will be available to assist with the cost of third level education.  On that basis, it is the Government's intention to ensure that these additional resources are used to widen the access of all students to third level education in the interest of social justice and equity. The promotion of social justice and <Col N="422" /> equity will include continuing improvement of the Higher Education Grants Scheme to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third-level education, because of his or her financial circumstances;</P>
    <P>The programme has given a statement of policy, which the Minister has articulated, in terms of devolution, accessibility and participation.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Minister for Education is prepared now, at the beginning of her term of office, to state categorically that the days of the political football are over and that when a by-election comes up the old promises for the provision of a third level institute or for a primary or secondary school&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already stated that a policy will be put in place and criteria for prioritising educational institutions will be established.  She outlined one by one the elements of the criteria that will determine priority in terms of location of educational establishments. Once the policy is put in place it will be the policy to be followed for the term of the present Government and into the term of the next Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We want a policy to continue from the previous Government, which gave a specific commitment in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When European Structural Funds become available those funds will be put in place for the long term benefit of the country.  In the area of education they will be used to the maximum benefit of the participants.  The resources will be used for the real needs in education, not for a specific need that might be thrown into the arena from time to time.  Today we have heard the first clear statement of an educational policy that will target the disadvantaged and put in place certain criteria and procedures. It was heartbreaking to hear of the <Col N="423" /> number of promises and the number of commitments made for a regional technical college in Castlebar.</P>

That will find favour not only on the Government benches but also on the other side of the House.  If that policy is followed we can be sure that Mayo and Castlebar will get their entitlements on the basis of agreed criteria as to what constitutes the need for third level education in the county of Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret that the Mayo West constituency is not adequately represented in this House.  It was a three seat constituency at the last general election; three Deputies were elected in November but only two are in the House.  It is a matter of great regret that the Government has not yet moved the writ to ensure that the third voice for Mayo West can be here.  If the Deputy-elect, Frank Durcan, was here there would be no question of accepting the offer of an Outreach course from a regional college as a substitute for a full, independent regional technical college in County Mayo.  However, as he is not yet here I am, more or less, speaking on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Mayo, being the third largest county, with a population of 115,000, has long felt that a third level educational institution would meet the needs of many of the hundreds of young people who travel from Mayo each year to attend third level colleges in Galway, Sligo, Athlone and other places.  A national survey on participation in higher education carried out some years ago showed that Mayo had higher than the then national average of 25 per cent of the relevant cohort entering higher education; the figure was 31.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years a group of dedicated people in Mayo, particularly in the Castlebar area, have campaigned to have a regional technical college provided in Castlebar, which is generally agreed to be the most suitable location for such a college.  This high figure &mdash; and other studies carried out for the Department of Education &mdash; have, on different occasions, led to ministerial approval for a regional technical college being provided in Castlebar.  However, despite the pronouncements with much trumpeting, nothing has happened.  This motion is as a result of the negative response by the Minister for Education to the case made by the Mayo regional technical college Action Group who, I understand, walked out in disgust from a recent meeting with her.</P>

      <P>The timing of this motion by Fine Gael might be seen by some as a cynical, political exercise hastened by the imminence of the by-election to fill the vacant seat in Mayo West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;following the appointment of Deputy Flynn as an EC Commissioner.  Fine Gael, when in Government with Labour, promised this college for Mayo in 1981.  I should like to quote from a letter from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, dated 14 January 1982, to the President of the Castlebar Chamber of Commerce. He stated:</P>
      <P>You will be aware that on 17 December, 1981 the Minister for Education, John Boland, reiterated this Government's commitment to provide a regional technical college in Castlebar. The timescale for the provision of this technical college is dependent on, among other things, the provision of a possible suitable site.  However, I understand that Deputy Kenny has been in touch with the Minister in regard to this.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Garret FitzGerald.</P>
      <P>On 13 April 1984 &mdash; they had been in office since 1982 &mdash; the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, wrote to Deputy Enda Kenny as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You wrote to me regarding a meeting with the Castlebar Chamber of Commerce regarding a regional technical college.  I would prefer not to meet the Chamber of Commerce, not because I have an objection to meeting <Col N="426" /> the gentlemen themselves but because I think the position of the Government has already been made perfectly clear with regard to the regional technical college.  We strongly recognise the claims of Castlebar for a regional technical college because of its situation and because of the population structure in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in 1984 the then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, put a spanner in the works when she revealed in June that the project was on ice.  Another letter from the Minister to Deputy Enda Kenny dated 25 June 1984 stated:</P>
      <P>As you are aware a decision was made by my predecessor, Mr. John Boland, TD, regarding the location of a regional technical college in Castlebar and I am satisfied as to the validity and strength of the case for such a college.</P>
      <P>However, I desire to draw your attention to paragraph 6.17 of the Programme for Action in Education 1984-87 where it is stated in relation to capital projects at third-level that &ldquo;the provision of funds for capital purposes either by way of new buildings, extensions or equipment poses particular problems in view of the magnitude of the costs involved&rdquo;.  Decisions in relation to the projects which may be given priority are made in the context of Government decisions with regard to the Public Capital Programme.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the acquisition of a site or when the planning procedure involved in relation to the proposed Regional Technical College in Castlebar may be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, did not stop Deputy Kenny sending out literature during the general election of 1987 to the effect that a site for the college had been purchased and planning authorised which, when completed, would cater for 800 third level students.  Deputy Kenny went so far as <Col N="427" /> to include in his election literature a schedule of courses for Castlebar regional technical college which made it all look very efficient and which, no doubt, was meant to impress the voters of Mayo West.  Deputy Kenny said that the site for the new technical college would be on Breaffy Road, Castlebar. He listed the courses which would be run at the school including technical level courses, training of apprentices, woodwork, metalwork, the catering trade, agriculture, transport, commerce, electronics and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>They were all agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This was done to impress the voters of Mayo West.  Little did they know that this was only the first of many elections in Mayo at which the regional technical college issue would be trotted out to fool the electorate, a favourite ploy in the Flynn-Kenny election charade which has passed for politics in Mayo West over the past ten years.</P>
      <P>The regional technical college featured in the general election campaign in 1987, 1989, 1991, in the Euro election of 1989, the local elections in 1991 and is set fair to be the great hoodwink of the 1993 by-election if we are to correctly interpret the reason for this debate.  Deputy Kenny &mdash; and the efforts of Fine Gael &mdash; pale into insignificance, however, compared to the grand gestures of Padraig Flynn in pulling this rabbit out of the hat each time it was electorally appropriate.  My files show his first firm commitment to the Mayo regional technical college in a letter dated 2 July 1982 to the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Castlebar, which said:</P>
      <P>Dear Jim,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 8th July concerning the proposed location of the Regional Technical College in Castlebar.  I note that you have written to the Taoiseach concerning this matter and I am hoping that we can have a satisfactory result for you in the near future.  As you will understand, <Col N="428" /> the Department of Education is at present awaiting a report from the Higher Education Authority in regard to future needs in third level education. You can rest assured that I am pressing our claim for a Regional Technical College in Castlebar at every available opportunity.  I have already spoken with the Minister for Education concerning this matter and I will be in touch with the Taoiseach in the near future.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Padraig Flynn,</P>
    <P>Aire na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn left office in 1984 and he then decided to ridicule the ineptitude of the then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, in classical P. Flynn speak in a letter to the manager of the AIB in Castlebar on 3 April 1984, which stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Hugh,</P>
    <P>Further to our recent chat concerning the possibility of a Regional Technical College for the Town, I have raised the matter by way of Dáil Question with the Minister for Education, Mrs. Hussey.</P>
    <P>The whole business was most unsatisfactory and she simply used the tactic of referring to her new Action Plan, section 6.17 which in effect says that nothing will happen in the capital front until total reviews and whatever take place.</P>
    <P>She did confirm that Boland had made the decision on the 17th December 1981, that there was a <i>prime facie</i> case there for the location of such a College, but left nobody in any doubt that it might never happen.  I put it as strongly as I could to her that it was necessary to fulfil the promises of Ministers and Taoisigh, but to no avail.  Any movement in this area is going to be very difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Padraig Flynn.</P>
    <P>I became aware of the regional technical college campaign in 1989 and was informed by the Department of Education <Col N="429" /> on 11 July 1989 that the proposed regional technical college in Castlebar had been deferred.  This information was conveyed to me shortly after the election. One need only read the local Mayo papers to ascertain what was being said about the regional technical college during that campaign.  One will not find statements to the effect that it was being deferred, postponed or put on the méar fada, but there were local elections held in 1991, when the regional technical college was again rolled out, to such an extent that the Mayo regional technical college Action Group wrote to me on 25 June, 1991 on the following lines:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Molloy,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 19th inst and also previous correspondence regarding the provision of a Regional Technical College in Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education's promise to examine the possibility of providing third level courses in Castlebar has received widespread publicity in the local press for the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>The attached Press Release accurately reflects the view of the people involved in the ongoing campaign to get a regional technical college in Mayo.</P>
    <P>The attached press release from the Mayo regional technical college Action Group begins as follows:</P>
    <P>The Mayo regional technical college Action Group deplores the opportunistic nature of the recent announcement of courses to be run in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Firstly, this is not the first time that such an announcement has been made. In March 1990 the Minister for the Environment announced that third level courses would commence in September 1990.  Then in October 1990 the Minister for Education promised that the courses would start in September 1991.  Both promises turned out to be hollow, dishonest and a sham response to intense pressure from within County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Throughout all that period, since I was <Col N="430" /> first approached in 1989, I had made my personal representations in support of a regional technical college for Mayo. Those representations were responded to by numerous acknowledgements, as was the wont of our then partners in Government, until 14 May 1992 when I received the following from the former Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan:</P>
    <P>The general question of provision of third level places in Universities, Regional, Technical and other third level colleges is kept under review within my Department.  I am satisfied that the projected increase in third level places can be met most effectively through the development of the existing network of Colleges.  Provision for such development is detailed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  There are no plans at present for the provision of additional Regional Technical Colleges.</P>
    <P>So, there were no plans on 14 May, 1992. Yet on 31 July 1992 the former Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, met a delegation from the Mayo regional technical college Action Group which led them to write the following to the then Minister:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I write to thank you for the warm and courteous reception given to our delegation on Wednesday.</P>
    <P>It was re-assuring for the members of the deputation to find you so well disposed towards our case.  We hope that your patient and careful hearing of our presentation will help you appreciate the urgency of providing a Third Level college in Mayo.</P>
    <P>On our side there is an acceptance of the budgetary constraints within which you must operate.  It is for this reason that Mayo is willing to grow it's regional technical college from a moderate start.</P>
    <P>The letter continues with great praise about what the then Minister was going to do.  Unfortunately, they had to write to the Minister again on 18 September 1992 as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Dear Minister Brennan,</P>
    <P>At a meeting of our executive committee held last night, I was directed to inform you of Mayo's great surprise and disappointment with the lack of response on the issue of the provision of a regional technical college in Mayo.</P>
    <P>You will recall that you indicated to the delegation, which you received on 29th July, that you would put proposals before us by the end of August.  While your office has maintained regular contact since then, our members are anxious to have the matter finalised quickly.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is that, if decisions on the matter are not made soon, monies might not be provided in the upcoming estimates.  I am to request, therefore, that your proposals be presented before 30th September.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, the October rumbles from the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry alerted former Minister for Justice, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, to the dangers of an imminent election, when the Mayo regional technical college was dusted down yet again.  This time his efforts elicited the following from the chairman of the action group, by letter dated 16 October, 1992 &mdash; only a month later &mdash; which read:</P>
    <P>Dear Pádraig,</P>
    <P>At a meeting of our Action Group held last night, I informed the members of my meeting with yourself and Sean Bourke, Chairman, Castlebar Urban District Council on 12th inst.</P>
    <P>The meeting directed me to convey to you it's appreciation of and welcome for your intervention in the negotiations with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The Members were pleased to learn of the objectives you intend pursuing with your colleague, Seamus Brennan T.D., Minister for Education, i.e.;</P>
    <P>(a)  Independent principal paid directly from Dept. of Education.</P>
    <P>(b)  Own autonomous board of management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> (c)  4/5 full-time courses to be completed in Castlebar and 2 of which would have a technological context.</P>
    <P>(d)  The start-up student population to be targeted at 300/400.</P>
    <P>The Action Group has taken a formal decision to back and support your efforts in obtaining these goals. Some reservation is held on the matter of the project being under the auspices of any of the adjoining R.T.C.'s and our preference would be for some link with the Dublin Institute of Technology. However this is something which, perhaps, can be teased out in our talks with Department of Education officials &mdash; a meeting with them has been fixed for Friday next 23rd October.</P>
    <P>The reason for such an optimistic reaction on the part of the action group is clear when one sees the notes taken during that discussion, some of which have been referred to already by Deputy Enda Kenny.  For example, they talk about courses &mdash; four academic, two technological, which will be full-time in Castlebar, not in outreaches; the student numbers to begin at approximately 250 with an upper limit of 800 after three years.  There was to be local involvement in the management of the regional technical college: they would have their own principal; the action group would be involved in ongoing discussions with the Department, with former Minister, Pádraig Flynn to meet the action group on a six weekly basis and be available to resolve any difficulties that might arise. Moneys were to be provided; the decision being irrevocable if Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
    <P>All of this led to a glorious headline in the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> of Wednesday, 11 November 1992 with the glorious heading &mdash;&ldquo;Mayo regional technical college Courses get the Green Light&rdquo;&mdash; nicely in advance of election day, 25 November 1992.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, left nothing to doubt that time.  He sent a personal letter to his constituents driving home the point from which I might quote as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> You will have heard about recent developments in our campaign for third level courses to be provided in Castlebar.  This exciting educational development will offer huge opportunities to many of our third level students.</P>
    <P>If one reverts to the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> article one reads:</P>
    <P>Third level courses are to be available in Castlebar from September 1993, Justice Minister Pádraig Flynn has confirmed.</P>
    <P>It says a whole lot more but ends as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn said that commitment now given could not be altered, even if there was a change of Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, former Minister for Justice, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, received the highest personal vote ever in any election in which he stood in Mayo on the strength of all of these kinds of shenanigans.  We see that he has given this firm commitment which could not be changed even if there were to be a change of Government.  Of course, we know there has been a change of Government but Fianna Fáil are partners in that Government with the Labour Party, whose Leader is the Tánaiste.  He said in a letter dated 10 November, 1992 to Councillors Mee and Kilcoyne the following:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Labour Party recognises the enormous contribution which the siting of a regional college in an area can produce, both socially and economically, and the Party remains committed to the establishment of such a college in the Castlebar area.  When in Government in 1987 we approved the allocation of funds for the purchase of a site to allow building work to commence and we are still fully committed to its early provision.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have placed on the record this evening that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have all reneged on their promises in relation to the educational needs of the youth of Mayo.  We in the Progressive Democrats support the need for a regional technical college in <Col N="434" /> Castlebar.  On behalf of my party I want to say the Government can be assured of our full support if they put a proper proposal before this House to establish this college forthwith.  It is now time to end the political game and put the real interests of the people of Mayo before any party interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion before the House this evening for the siting of a regional technical college in Castlebar.  I was delighted to be present to hear Deputy Molloy's contribution. The saga <i>vis-à-vis</i> a regional technical college for Castlebar is similar to our continuing request in Tipperary to have a regional technical college sited in Thurles, not a college along the lines of a traditional regional technical college but rather a business and rural institute.</P>
      <P>As politicians, I contend we do ourselves immense damage by continuing to make false promises to raise hopes, in particular among young people who see their only future is in having a third level college located adjacent to their homes.  Statistics and research have proven that participation in third level courses increases in line with availability of a third level college in the area concerned.  Unfortunately, a recent study revealed that in Tipperary we had the lowest participation rate in third level education.  We put this down to the fact that we do not have a third level college within the county.</P>
      <P>The reasons a third level college should be established in Castlebar are logical and reasonable and the campaign to have a third level college sited there has been ongoing for a number of years.  Hopes have been raised and dashed.  It is very unfair for any Government to continually commit itself to siting a college in Castlebar and commencing courses there but when the day arrives nothing happens. This has led to false hopes being raised and to the status of politicians being undermined.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Guinness Peat Aviation Equity Issue.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this <Col N="435" /> opportunity to seek to establish some of the facts and policy perspectives surrounding media reports during the past several days that the State, through the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, is contemplating undertaking an equity investment in Guinness Peat Aviation in the immediate future.  This was confirmed yesterday by SFADCo when it stated that it had been given the opportunity by the Government to consider taking up the equity option held by Aer Lingus in GPA.  The development company also stated in its statement that, having evaluated the proposal, it had offered to participate in an equity issue on terms and conditions consistent with a commercial investment of that nature.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to confirm tonight whether in fact the Government has asked Shannon Development to take up the Aer Lingus share option in GPA. Looking at the Book of Estimates for 1993, Vote 34 for the Department of Enterprise and Employment, under subheads C1 and C2, allocates to Shannon Development a total of almost £14 million.  The newspaper reports that I have read suggest that various amounts of between US$15 million and US$20 million worth of investment are being contemplated.  Converted back into Irish pounds, this single investment would exhaust virtually the entire allocation to Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>My second question to the Minister is: how does the Government propose that SFADCo should finance this investment and does the Government intend to provide a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose or, if not, can the Minister specify, what other means of finance is proposed?</P>
      <P>Clearly, by virtue of the overall size of the annual budget allocation to SFADCo or taken simply on its own account, this is a substantial public equity injection. Can the Minister specify what terms and conditions are being proposed by Shannon Development with regard to this investment following on the company's evaluation of the Government's proposal? Moreover, is the Minister satisfied that it is consistent with EC policy on State aid to industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> In the light of the above is the Minister prepared to state what rate of return such an equity stake will deliver, at a minimum, in the event of Guinness Peat Aviation surviving its current crisis? Furthermore, given the potentially huge catalytic effect which a State investment could have on GPA at this critical time, can the Minister say whether any premium will attach to the State's equity injection?</P>
    <P>Subject to being reassured that the tax-payer's probable investment in this currently risky enterprise will be rewarded to the maximum degree possible, let me say on behalf of the Progressive Democrats that we would welcome such an investment.  The international aviation industry is going through a severe economic downturn, which is one of the key explanatory factors underlying the current demise of GPA, though not the only factor.  However, from the point of view of an investor, if the company can ultimately return to profitability it is perhaps the best time in terms of the business cycle to take out equity, since, in the event of success the potential returns could be phenomenal just as the current risks are substantial.</P>
    <P>Guinness Peat Aviation plays a critical role in terms of the development of the new aviation cluster in the Shannon region.  The company employs 300 people directly.  In its link with Swissair and Lufthansa in Shannon Aerospace it currently employs 600 people, which is set to grow to 1,000.  It is also a key player in Shannon Turbine Technologies, which currently has 43 people on its books and which is set to grow to 235 jobs by 1996.</P>
    <P>This aviation cluster has already begun to spawn encouraging sub-supply industries locally in the Shannon region; indeed, the spillover even extends to the University of Limerick, which has ambitious plans to further develop its aviation engineering faculty.  Classically, this is the kind of cluster development recommended in the Culliton report; and it is right and proper that, subject to due caution and diligence and driving a tough bargain on behalf of the taxpayer, the State should seek to play a leading role in encouraging the investment community to provide the US $200 million <Col N="437" /> now needed to secure the future of GPA, which currently hangs by a thread. However, considerable progress is being made by GPA in restructuring its indebtedness. Much work has been done on the rescheduling of order books and in dealing with the banks to defer loans and to put this investment package together.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that, politically, the Progressive Democrats do not incline towards unfettered injections of State equity into public or private sector firms that are in trouble, but GPA is making monumental efforts to retrieve the current situation.  Considerable restructuring is in hand.  A valuable cluster of aviation jobs is in place and I would conclude that the risk, subject to tough bargaining on behalf of the taxpayer, is probably worth taking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make it clear that the Government's position on this issue has been fundamentally determined by the contribution GPA has made in the past and can continue to make in the future to the establishment of a vibrant aviation industry, which Deputy Cox rightly has spoken about this evening.  I can confirm that funds will be made available to Shannon Development to enable it to participate in this equity issue should it be proceeded with.  I can also say that SFADCo's contribution is emphatically conditional on all other aspects of the recapitalisation programme being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Shannon Development issued a statement on this matter yesterday to the effect that, having evaluated the proposal to take up the equity option held by Aer Lingus in GPA, it has offered to participate in an equity issue on terms and conditions consistent with a commercial investment of this nature.  Being particularly conscious of the limitations of a formal confidentiality agreement between the two parties, Shannon Development declined to comment further and clearly I must also take cognisance this evening of that agreement in any comments I make. Therefore I am not in a position to answer <Col N="438" /> in detail all of Deputy Cox's specific questions.</P>
    <P>In looking at the contribution GPA has made to the Shannon zone and to the mid-west region in particular, we see that the GPA group has direct employment of 300 with very sizeable spin-off benefits in terms of taxation, dividends, overheads, investments and contracts in respect of maintenance of aircraft and engines.  In addition, when combined with the contribution made by GPA's international commercial partners and other financing, GPA has succeeded in mobilising over £170 million in investment finance in its subsidiary companies in the Shannon zone.</P>
    <P>The majority of this finance has been spent in Ireland on building facilities, associated overheads and operating costs.  The subsidiary companies currently employ over 750 people at Shannon and on current plans this number is expected to reach 1,350 by 1996.  The employment is, as the House knows, of very good quality and involves high technology operations requiring strong educational skills.  Very importantly, the joint venture structure, involving the strong presence of a local partner, ensures that important influence and control over decisions effectively resides in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The foregoing, I believe, indicates the strategic value of a Guinness Peat Aviation to the economy.  This is the reason for the Government's strong and continuing commitment to a company which the Government believes has a bright and long term future; but, as I indicated at the outset, the Shannon Development approach to assessment of this equity participation has been on terms and conditions totally consistent with a commercial investment of this nature and doubtless reflects its convictions as to the potential for national benefits from this investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  It is fortuitous that it should come up for discussion the evening before the deadline expires for the making of bids for the <Col N="439" /> Government's remaining shareholding in Greencore.  During the course of statements in this House on 3 March last the Minister for Finance sought to put a particular gloss on the interest being expressed by the company, ADM, in the acquisition of the Government's remaining shareholding in Greencore.  According to the Minister for Finance on that date the prospecting of ADM was carried out by executives of Greencore, apparently during the latter half of the year and unknown either to the Minister for Finance or to his Department until 16 February last.</P>
      <P>There is a very healthy respect in food industry circles in this country for ADM; this is the respect which any group of operators would have for a well run and agile competitor.  ADM is a major manufacturer and trader of both sugar substitutes and cereal substitutes.  It has a strong record of growth and acquisition and already has a substantial presence in the Irish market.  It is not surprising there is disquiet in agri-industry circles in this country at the prospect that 30 per cent of shares in that company might pass into ADM's control.  Nor is it surprising that the sugar beet producers are concerned at the prospects that 30 per cent of the shareholding in the monopoly sugar processing company, the only outlet for their product, might pass into the hands of a major manufacturer of sugar substitutes. It is worrying, therefore, that we may not have been told the whole story about the matter.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, spoke on these issues in the House on 3 March last but made no reference to the fact that he, together with the secretary of his Department and a senior executive of the IDA, met executives of ADM in the United States in May of last year.  In the light of all the concerns expressed both inside and outside this House we are entitled to expect some account from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know the answers to the following questions.  At whose initiative did that meeting take place?  What transpired at the meeting?  Were any decisions or undertakings made during the course of that meeting, and if so, <Col N="440" /> what were they?  Did the meeting have any bearing on or any connection with Greencore's solicitation of an interest by ADM?  By what right did executives of Greencore solicit interest in the Government's remaining shareholding?  Can we really believe that this was done without the express or implied approval of the Government?  Did the Minister or his Department inform either the Minister for Finance and his Department or indeed the Government of what led to that meeting; what transpired at it and what resulted from it?  What is the significance of the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last evening that he would now like to see an Irish headquartered company where previously he was talking about a preference for an Irish company?  Finally, I would like to know if the Minister withheld from the House information relevant to the debate that took place on 3 March 1993 and, if so, why?</P>

      <P>The meeting referred to by the Deputy was part of a five day promotional trip to the US which I made with the secretary of my Department and a senior IDA official in May 1992, during which I met a number of large food and other manufacturing companies.  The purpose was to encourage the firms concerned to locate in Ireland or, where they already had a presence in Ireland, to expand their business here.  In the case of Archer, Daniels Midland, ADM, I met senior executives and discussed with them the possibility of increasing their existing production base in Ireland and- <Col N="441" /> or of making Ireland the base for future production still at the development stage.</P>
      <P>Questions of any link with Greencore or of the disposal of the Government's shareholding in the company were not at any stage discussed or mentioned by either side, neither was any interest in Greencore shares expressed by ADM at that meeting.  My visit to the company was purely in the context of the IDA promotional trip and had no relevance whatsoever to the current position in regard to a possible sale of the Government shareholding in Greencore.  I am afraid that suggestions by Deputy Dukes that this was a secret prelude to their share bid is simply untrue.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is only in the last month or so that ADM emerged as a possible purchaser of the residual Government shares in Greencore.  I want to state categorically that I had no prior knowledge that ADM were interested in making a bid for the Greencore shares, as I am not privy to the business of the board of Greencore.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I am not even a shareholder in the company, except for the special share which I hold to protect the Irish sugar industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish sugar industry is of immense importance to the Irish economy, and the special share will ensure that it is adequately protected.  I recall that one of the major justifications for restructuring Siúicre Éireann was to enable the development of a major food enterprise based on indigenous resources with a view to maximising added value, exports, and, of course, the creation of jobs, especially in the food area.  The sale of the residual Government shares affords a good opportunity for an Irish based company to bid for those shares.  It is no secret that I personally would like to see an Irish company make a successful bid for the shares.  Indeed, I have stated this publicly on several occasions, even as late as yesterday in Charleville where I was announcing 340 new jobs in the food sector.  The Government decided to afford time to all interested parties to put forward proposals for the purchase of the shares, and set a deadline for offers, which should reach the Department of <Col N="442" /> Finance by 24 March 1993 at close of business.</P>
    <P>The bids received will be examined, and the Government will make its decision, using criteria which will include price and compatibility and the long term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company which could consolidate and expand employment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I must repeat my demand that Deputy Dukes withdraw his baseless allegations.  Indeed, a Cheann Chomhairle, I believe that this episode is no more than an abuse of the Adjournment Debate by Deputy Dukes intended to grab cheap media headlines.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for him the allegations are at odds with the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled this matter for discussion on six or seven occasions clearly showing the seriousness of the situation at Raheen national school over the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Due to expanding numbers a secondhand pre-fab was purchased to accommodate a fourth teacher.  This was to be a temporary arrangement, but ten years later the same teacher is still trying to educate pupils in that structure.  At present, there are five holes in the floor and the exterior door is hanging off while two of the outside panels are damaged beyond repair.  There are no toilet facilities in the pre-fab and the grossly inadequate toilet facilities are situated in the original school building, which is separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original school, part of which has a flat roof, suffers from chronic damp, as indeed does the pre-fab.  The wiring and plumbing is inadequate throughout.  In addition, the windows are rotten and coupled with inadequate lighting and heating makes the school unsuitable and, indeed, dangerous.  Now the school is rat infested.  Everything I have said is attested to in a report from the health board's environmental health officer <Col N="443" /> which was submitted to the Minister last year.</P>
    <P>Raheen national school needs a proper extension and refurbishment programme immediately.  The local community are not prepared to patch up or stand for this situation any longer.  I pay tribute to the local community who at the drop of a hat were prepared to do their utmost to repair holes, replace chutes, slates and so on.  However, their frustration and anger has been worsened by the insulting disregard of the Department of Education and in representing the community on this matter I have come to share their anger.  Repeated requests for a meeting with the Minister have been refused. Representations from my office have been ignored.  When dealing with Civil Service channels was no longer of any avail, repeated telephone calls were made to the Minister's programme manager over three weeks and they failed to elicit even the courtesy of a reply until today.  A further reply promised this afternoon did not materialise.  Conversations between people in my office and the officials responsible in the Department yielded nothing but gross offence.</P>

      <P>As I am seeking a positive reply from the Minister and as frustration has been building up over some time, I must tell the real story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an official was questioned about the rodent infestation at Raheen the reply was, &ldquo;if there is a hole in the floor what can you expect?&rdquo;  That same official had already told the principal to spend a few bob patching things up.  The people of Raheen are no longer prepared to do that.  Were it not for the community in Raheen, the Minister would have had to build a new school years ago.  It is deeply insulting that they should have their <Col N="444" /> efforts in regard to their school sneered at with jibes about &ldquo;back-packing&rdquo; rodents. The project would cost approximately £50,000, excluding local contributions which are being raised enthusiastically. Officials have recently offered a new pre-fab which would cost in excess of £20,000 and would be only a temporary solution. Such a solution would be grossly wasteful of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider this problem logically with a clear eye on the long term.  The children of Raheen are not second class citizens and neither are their parents, their teachers or their public representatives and we are not prepared to be treated as such.  The Minister for Education's stated principles are laudable and I demand that they be put into practice at Raheen immediately.</P>

      <P>This is a welcome opportunity to clarify for the House the position regarding Raheen national school, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>The response to the Deputy's question derives from the budget reality that it is never possible to redress, in any one financial year, all reasonable demands for improvements in national school accommodation within the funds available. This has always been the case in the past and I suspect will continue to be the case in the future given that resources are always scarce in relation to the demands upon them.  This is not to deny that the project in question at Raheen is a very deserving case and that the improvements in accommodation should be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy is listening.  The present accommodation at this school consists of three permanent classrooms and one prefabricated classroom.  The staff comprise a principal and three assistant teachers, and the current enrolment is 97 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the application made to my Department for the provision of a permanent extension a major building project was approved including the provision of a classroom, staff room/library <Col N="445" /> and store room, together with necessary works to the existing building.  The new classroom is to replace the existing prefabricated classroom to which the Deputy has referred and which my Department accepts is not in good condition.</P>
    <P>However, the proposed extension is one of over 150 projects which were at pre-contract stage in the latter part of 1992.  Only a certain number of projects which were selected on grounds of priority could be listed to go to contract in 1993.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the project will continue to be sympathetically considered for inclusion in the capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister examine the surplus accommodation within our health boards with a view to providing long stay care for the elderly? In doing so he should be mindful of the financial hardship placed on families who are forced to send their parents or relatives into private nursing homes.  We are all aware of pensioners who are forced to pay £90 a week towards their keep in a nursing home and unemployed families who must club together to provide £100 per week to subvent a relative in a private nursing home.  The elderly are well cared for in those nursing homes, but the cost is beyond the capacity of people to pay. Obviously, there is not an adequate number of places available in public hospitals and some of the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 have not yet been implemented.  I welcome the provision of £4 million this year but that will not be adequate.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his Department could give any assistance to such people but he stated that this matter is outside the scope of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many unemployed nurses would be willing to provide a service for the elderly at an affordable cost.  If there are vacant hospital wards or surplus health board buildings available, will the Minister ask health boards to perhaps, lease some of those wards to those nurses?  The nurses merely want an adequate wage and they <Col N="446" /> have a great deal of expertise, care and compassion to offer and, above all, have great respect for elderly people.  They want to give of their services to these people and, therefore the Minister should consider taking this proposal on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his thoughtful contribution. A substantial amount of private long stay accommodation for the elderly is available in addition to the facilities provided by health boards.  At the latest count, there were about 330 private nursing homes providing approximately 6,400 beds for the dependent elderly. In addition, voluntary nursing homes were providing approximately 3,300 beds.  Arrangements are already in place under existing legislation whereby health boards subvent patients in private and voluntary nursing homes.  Under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 certain homes are approved for the payment of subvention at a current rate of £52.15 per person per week.  Health boards also make arrangements in certain circumstances under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970 to contract beds in private nursing homes for dependent persons who cannot be accommodated in health board long stay accommodation.</P>
      <P>The working group on services for the elderly, in its report, The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, recommended changes in arrangements between health boards and nursing homes in providing long stay care for the elderly.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides a new legal framework for establishing a closer partnership between health boards and nursing homes in providing long stay care for our dependent elderly.  The Act provides for the registration by health boards of nursing homes and for the payment of subvention by boards in respect of dependent elderly people who need nursing home care but who cannot afford to pay for it.  The new system of subvention will redress many of the current problems in relation to subvention of nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that health boards should consider leasing or entering <Col N="447" /> into joint ventures with private nursing homes to provide care for elderly people.  There may well be cases where a health board, in the interests of elderly patients, may decide to lease a premises for long term care or enter into arrangements with a private or voluntary home to provide long term care for patients. Health boards do not have the statutory authority to enter into joint ventures, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth noting that the Nursing Homes Act, while providing for the new relationships I talked about between health boards and the nursing home sector, respects in full the private and voluntary ownership and management of nursing homes.  A fundamental principle underlying the new legislation is respect for nursing homes as private or voluntary enterprises which have been established by individuals or philanthropic initiative.  The main objective of the new legislation is to ensure that all nursing homes have a high standard of accommodation and that care is of the best possible standard.  I am arranging for the drafting of the regulations under the Nursing Homes Act and I hope to see full implementation of the Act, with the agreement of the Nursing Homes Association, by 1 May this year.  That will bring about a substantial improvement in nursing home care throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board covers Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, an area with a population of more than 310,000.  The flagship hospital in the mid-west is Limerick Regional Hospital.  In 1991 Comhairle na nOspidéal recommended the appointment of a cardiologist to this hospital and the medical committee of the Mid-Western Health Board gave high priority to this proposal.  Patients in need of heart operations are referred mainly to Cork Regional Hospital and they experience long delays.  A recent nationwide survey by Professor Ian Graham of the Irish Heart Foundation showed an average delay of nine and a half hours between the onset of heart symptoms and admission to coronary units.  In addition to the <Col N="448" /> appointment of a cardiologist, equipment and accommodation are also required and it is imperative that a specific allocation of £500,000 be provided for this purpose.  It is vital to the mid-west region that a cardiologist be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the appointment of a consultant cardiologist at Limerick Regional Hospital.  The appointment of consultants is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.  In October 1989 the Mid-Western Health Board requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the consultant manpower requirements of the mid-west region in the light of the large number of consultant vacancies, both current and pending, in the region at that time.  Comhairle na nOspidéal established a committee to carry out a wide-ranging review of consultant services and its report was completed in July 1991. The report recommended that four new specialties be introduced into the region &mdash; cardiology, nephrology, haematology and dermatology.  It is envisaged that the major part of the expansion of specialties will occur through the restructuring of consultant vacancies as they arise.  The appointment of a cardiologist is high on the Mid-Western Health Board's list of priorities.  However, there would be a significant cost associated with such an appointment, including the capital and staffing costs of a catheterisation laboratory. My Department is discussing with the Mid-Western Health Board management plans for the introduction of additional specialties and the possibility of an expansion of the range of consultant services available in the region.  The stage has not been reached where the recruitment process for a consultant cardiologist can be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the urgency with which the Mid-Western Health Board view this matter.  I will examine the question of appointing a consultant cardiologist to the Mid-Western Health Board as sympathetically as possible in the context of the health board's priorities and the resources available to my Department <Col N="449" /> for desirable service improvements in the health service.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Education for being present here tonight. I think she is the first Minister for Education to be present in the House for this simple procedure.  Tarbert comprehensive school opened in September 1973 but no senior engineering and construction studies rooms were provided then, which was most unfortunate.  In 1978 the junior woodwork and metalwork rooms were adapted to take senior studies.  In 1985 a major extension was provided which included three classrooms, one music room and a biology laboratory.  However the board's request for senior engineering and construction rooms was refused.  The school's capacity in 1985 was 575 students while the school's enrolment was 625.</P>
      <P>A major campaign was embarked upon by the school authorities in 1987 for senior engineering and construction studies rooms.  All stages of planning and costings are complete at this stage.  In reply to a similar debate in 1992 the then Minister promised that the project would be considered in 1993, depending on the availability of finance.  The Minister gave the go-ahead for 35 projects in 1993. However, the parents and staff of the school were shocked to discover that the extension to Tarbert school was not on this list.</P>
      <P>The school enrolment is now 700 even though, as I have pointed out, the school has a capacity for only 575 students. There will be a further increase in enrolments in 1993 with the proposed closure of Mount Trenchard school in Foynes for first year students.  The school is finding it increasingly difficult to cater for the demand for technological subjects &mdash; indeed the importance of technology is highlighted in the Green Paper on Education and the Culliton report.  I appeal to the Minister to make a clear statement to the House explaining her future plans in relation to Tarbert comprehensive school.</P>

      <P>The project at Tarbert is an extension to bring the school capacity to 625 pupils in total.  It will <Col N="450" /> provide mainly specialist rooms for woodwork, metalwork and building construction and some ancillary accommodation. The costs will be in the region of £250,000.  Except for some minor architectural details the planning of this extension is complete.  The project is not, however, in the 1993 capital programme because of other demands deemed to be of higher priority which had to take precedence. For this reason the project will have to be considered for inclusion in the programme for 1994.</P>
      <P>It is intended that future decisions on the progress of major projects through the architectural planning process should be based on objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.  It is envisaged that the criteria by which projects are selected, prioritised and advanced through the planning process will be disclosed and individual schools advised where they stand on a regular basis.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate if Tarbert will proceed to tender in 1993 until the arrangements indicated have been put in place.  This will occur as soon as possible and schools will be advised as necessary.</P>

      <P>On 19 January 1991 the Sisters of Mercy announced their intention to withdraw from Mount Trenchard School, Foynes, in June 1995.  Since then four Ministers for Education failed to make a decision on the future role of this second level school.  On 20 March last a large public meeting was held at Foynes and a Department of Education official who attended was asked to bring back to the Minister the strong views expressed by the parents that they want the school to continue beyond 1995.  It is vital that the school, which is situated in an area designated for industrial development, remains open.  The Minister should stop delaying on this vital issue.  The parents, teachers and students have been treated unfairly by successive Ministers and it is now time for action.  I hope the report from the Department's official stresses the importance of the continuation of this fine school beyond 1995.  I look forward to a favourable response.</P>

      <P>The Mercy Order has, for some time, made known its decision to withdraw from the management of the Stella Maris school in 1995 and that, from next September, there will be no intake of new pupils into the school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a school action committee was formed in Foynes with the aim of keeping the Stella Maris school in operation after June 1995 under a new management, County Limerick Vocational Education Committee.  The action committee held a public meeting in Foynes on Saturday last, 20 March, at which a Department official attended and spoke, at my invitation.</P>

      <P>I am raising the question of the urgent need for a second science laboratory at Coláiste Chroaibhin, Fermoy, County Cork.  The coláiste is certainly one of the most successful vocational education committee schools in the country and has a pupil complement of 569.  Under the principalship of Mr. Hennessy, it plays a leading role in the educational and economic life of <Col N="452" /> Fermoy and the entire north Cork community. The vast majority of pupils in this school study one of the three science subjects.  Due to the interest in the science subjects there are 96 science classes per week.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of adequate science facilities, 56 of the 96 classes are held in either the general classrooms or in the social areas.  Fewer than half are held in a proper science laboratory.  There are 25 class groups in this school but unfortunately there are only 21 teaching spaces.  It is obvious from those statistics that there is an urgent need to provide extra science facilities.  There is a request before the Department for funding for a second science laboratory to be built at the earliest possible opportunity.  I strongly urge the Minister to make the funding available if at all possible during 1993.</P>

I made clear then that the balance of payments is in effect an accounting statement for a particular period of all transactions between residents of the State and non-residents. The estimates are based on information compiled from a wide variety of sources.</P>
      <P>The Exchange Control system administered by the Central Bank previously provided data on the following items:</P>

    <P>&mdash;imports of services &mdash; advertising, marketing and other technical services.</P>
    <P>The Exchange Control system was not specifically designed to provide statistics for balance of payments purposes and the quality and completeness of the information had seriously deteriorated as Exchange Controls were relaxed in the lead-up to their complete elimination in January 1993.</P>
    <P>A standing inter-departmental committee on balance of payments statistics considered the implications of this development.  Following extensive investigation and consultations during 1990-91 with other countries and international experts, the committee recommended that a new bank-based general direct reporting system to be operated by the Central Bank for international financial transactions should be introduced &mdash; such systems are used in all other EC Countries with the exception of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Pending the introduction of this new system the CSO initiated a range of new statutory inquiries in late 1991 and early 1992.

I hope that those member states which have still to ratify will complete their arrangements without undue delay so that implementation can proceed.  Implementing the treaty will provide the Community with a considerable challenge.  Ireland will be giving a particular emphasis to those provisions which have the effect of improving the lot of the Community's citizens and to strengthening its role in the world.</P>

      <P>The Government attaches great importance to the support of the United States for the efforts of the Irish and the British Governments to bring about peace in Northern Ireland. The generous contributions which the US has made to the International Fund for Ireland since its establishment in 1986 are a very practical expression of that support.  The Government appreciates in particular the interest and concern which has always been shown on this issue by the speaker of the House of Representatives, Tom Foley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the question of future contributions to the fund by the US is a matter to be determined by the Congress, I would very much hope that this practical expression of support for the effort to bring peace to this island will be maintained. I was particularly gratified to note the announcement by President Clinton during the Taoiseach's recent visit that he has agreed to include the annual appropriation for the Fund in his budget submission to the Congress.  In previous years the Administration has not done this and the amount in question had to <Col N="46" /> be added at a later stage by the Congress itself.  I may add that the Irish Government continues to attach great importance to the work of the fund.  We are very satisfied with its progress to date and in particular with what it has done to contribute to the economic and social regeneration of the most disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 37, 38, 49, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 73, 74, 83, 88, 89, 92, 93 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the Programme for a Partnership Government is to &ldquo;develop a strong sense of partnership, not only in terms of political structures but throughout the economy, our society, and our community &mdash; a partnership that will be dynamic and creative, geared towards totally confronting the major challenges that lie ahead of us&rdquo;.  The Forum will contribute to the formation of a national consensus on major issues of economic and social policy, and to the development of new initiatives to tackle unemployment.</P>
      <P>I want to make sure, that a wide ranging consultative process takes place, so that the Forum will be appropriately constituted and organised in such a manner as to ensure its success.  To this end, the Minister of State at my Office, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, is currently engaged in a process of consultation with various interests.  She has recently contacted the Leaders of the Opposition parties and the Whip of the Technical Group inviting them to consultations on the setting up of the Forum, and discussions have already taken place or are planned arising from that invitation.</P>
      <P>All issues relating to the establishment of the National Economic and Social Forum, such as its terms of reference, membership, appointment of its independent Chairperson, budget and working methods, are at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, in common with other such committees, ceased to exist following the dissolution of the previous Dáil last October. It is envisaged that the work of that <Col N="50" /> committee will be continued under the auspices of the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
    <P>The Government will be represented at all plenary sessions of the Forum by the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste.  It is envisaged that the Forum will have a small executive working group to plan its business and work programme, including making arrangements for the attendance of Ministers by invitation.</P>

      <P>The US embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations with Cuba was instituted by the United States in 1962.  It has not precluded other countries from developing trade and commercial links with Cuba, nor prevented the provision of humanitarian aid to Cuba.  In 1991 the European Community provided food aid to Cuba via the World Food Programme to the value of 1.6 million ECU.  In 1992 EC emergency aid was provided to Cuba in the form of medicines to the value of 250,000 ECU.  Quantities of milk powder, cereals, butter and vegetable oils were also provided.</P>
      <P>The normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba is essentially a bilateral question for those two governments.  However the recent changes which have occurred in the international political landscape hold out the hope that the conditions can be created for an end to Cold War animosities everywhere.</P>

To do this, it is desirable that they have wide experience of diplomatic life and practice, detailed knowledge of relevant policy areas and an ability to work effectively in a foreign environment.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 67, 84 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the constituent assembly elections in May the work of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is entering its critical phase.  In this period, the Irish Government will be following developments very closely.  I believe that the UN peace plan being implemented by UNTAC is the way to a peaceful democratic Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> In view of the recent bloody and tragic history of Cambodia, no one could expect that the task of bringing an enduring peace to the country would be an easy one.  The UN plan is being implemented and despite the outbreaks of violence which we strongly condemn, the plan has achieved considerable success particularly in the area of voter registration where 95 per cent of the population is now registered to vote in the May elections. This is a positive indicator of the people's wish to exercise a democratic right.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights, UNTAC has been fostering an environment in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can be ensured and where free and fair elections can take place.  UNTAC has also established its presence in the civil administration of the country and UNTAC's police component is now fully deployed throughout the country.  Ireland, through members of the Garda Síochána, is making an important contribution to the police component. In addition, under UN auspices over 300,000 refugees and displaced persons have returned to Cambodia without any major incident.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General is determined to see the elections held in accordance with UNTAC's mandate and he has the full support of the international community in this.  The main obstacle to the full implementation of the UN plan has been the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to allow UNTAC deploy in areas it controls. This refusal has been condemned by the UN Security Council and by the international community, including Ireland. By their action the Khmer Rouge have put themselves outside the election process and outside participation in the government to be formed following the elections.  Under a Security Council resolution UNTAC has recently taken new measures against the Khmer Rouge. The supply of petrol to areas they control has been restricted.  UNTAC has also strengthened its border control system and its monitoring of compliance with <Col N="56" /> UN provisions relating to the export of logs.</P>
    <P>The question of Cambodia is discussed regularly with our partners in the European Community.  A common Community approach exists and this is reflected in the policies of the three EC members of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The UN peace plan provides the essential framework for a better future for Cambodia and the elections are essential to its success.  In spite of the difficulties and the intransigence of the Khmer Rouge, I believe the United Nations, and particularly the five permanent members of the Security Council, have demonstrated their commitment to ensuring that free and fair elections take place in May.  The United Nations must not fail in the task now before it in Cambodia.</P>

      <P>Developments in Russia and the other former Soviet republics are a matter of serious concern to the Government.  We are monitoring these closely, together with our Community partners.  Yesterday, I met the Foreign Minister of Russia, Mr. Kozyrev, at Shannon.  He informed me of the background to the steps taken by President Yeltsin for the government of Russia and for the holding of a referendum on 25 April.  The referendum will address three issues: a vote of confidence in the President, the draft of a new Constitution, and a new electoral law for a Federal Parliament.  He stressed the commitment of the President and of the Russian Government to protect the process of political and economic reform, which has faced considerable opposition in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response, I underlined the importance <Col N="57" /> attached by the Irish Government to the continuation of the reform process. We recognise that this is proving to be more difficult and to take longer than many outside Russia anticipated.  We regard it as vitally important that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights should remain central to these reforms.  What is significant is that the Russian people will be given an opportunity to express their wishes in a month's time.  The referendum called by President Yeltsin is intended to strengthen the democratic foundation for the process of political and economic reform. That process is crucial for stability in Russia and in Europe generally.</P>
    <P>I also informed the Russian Foreign Minister that Ireland, in common with other EC member states, would maintain its support for the economic transformation under way in Russia.  This process of transformation in the post-Communist era has confronted Russia and the other Republics of the CIS with enormous challenges.  It is right that they should look to the international community for assistance.</P>
    <P>The European Community has made a major effort in response to the former Soviet Union's aid requirements.  Some 2.2 billion ECU have been committed in this regard.  Three Irish army officers were part of the EC Task Force which supervised the distribution of emergency food and medical supplies in Russia last year.</P>
    <P>Some 950 MECU was approved for technical assistance for the former Soviet Union in 1991 and 1992.  A further 520 MECU is available in 1993.  The Community is partially funding the International Centre for Science and Technology in Russia which will promote projects and identify opportunites for former Soviet nuclear scientists.</P>
    <P>The Community is also working on a set of agreements with Russia and the other former Soviet Republics to replace the earlier agreement with the USSR. These will provide a wide-ranging framework for the development of the Community's relations with these Republics. EC Foreign Ministers will consider how <Col N="58" /> to give momentum to the negotiations when they meet in Luxembourg on 5 April.</P>
    <P>A $24 billion aid programme was agreed by the G7 last year.  However, not all of this has been disbursed on account of Russia's inability to meet some of the IMF's criteria.  We welcome the prospect of an early G7 meeting to consider how assistance to Russia can be accelerated.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of European Political Co-operation, Ireland is in constant contact with its European Community partners regarding the situation in Russia and the other former Soviet Republics.  EC Ministers discussed the subject at their meeting in Brussels on 8 March, and they will have an opportunity to take it up again on 5 April.</P>
    <P>Contact is also being maintained by the European Community and its member states with the leadership in Russia.  The EC Ministerial Troika will visit Russia shortly for discussions and the outcome of that visit will be considered at the Luxembourg meeting.</P>
    <P>We are concerned at developments within and between a number of the former Soviet Republics.  We strongly support the active contribution being made by the CSCE and by the UN in resolving conflicts and reducing tensions in the area.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances of this case I believe it is <Col N="59" /> more appropriate that contact should be handled through the Embassy in London rather than through the Anglo-Irish Conference to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to a Dáil question from the Deputy on 16 February, 1993, the Embassy has paid particular attention to the case.  The Embassy was in touch with the British authorities about the matter and was in contact with legal representatives of the person concerned and with members of his family.  I welcome the fact that he has now been released and that all of the charges against him have been dropped.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the British authorities are fully aware of the Government's views on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  We have, for example, conveyed our views on several occasions to Lord Colville in connection with his annual review of the Act and we have consistently made clear to the British authorities our concern that the legislation should be applied in an evenhanded manner.  For its part the Embassy in London continues to monitor developments in individual cases and to maintain close contact in this area with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>The Government are gravely concerned at the announcement by North Korea of its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  We believe that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the most important instrument for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and that it should be adhered to by all states. North Korea's action threatens to undermine the Treaty as well as raise questions about its intentions with regard to developing nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>Article Ten of the Treaty provides for the withdrawal of States Parties if they decide that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of the Treaty, have jeopardised their supreme interests. However, we do not accept that the reasons given by North Korea are sufficient to justify the action they have taken.</P>

      <P>The USA is Ireland's second largest trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.  Following his visit to the United States in September 1992 the Taoiseach established the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board to avail, in a structured manner, of the advice and expertise of leading Irish-Americans in the business world.  The Board, which at present has 22 members, includes some of the most successful Presidents, Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of companies in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Board will act as a think-tank and I expect it to come up with advice and new thinking on policy in areas such as inward investment, export development and tourist strategy.  It is envisaged that it will meet about three or four times a year, with either a Member of the Cabinet or the Ambassador to the United States in the Chair.

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 66 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has recognised Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as sovereign, independent states.  The further steps of establishing formal diplomatic relations with these countries would have to be agreed in each case with the Government concerned and it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly in advance of such agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland nevertheless maintains good working contacts in practice with those former Yugoslav Republics which it has recognised.  Such contacts take place regularly at the United Nations and the <Col N="63" /> CSCE.  The Taoiseach met the President of the Government of Slovenia in July 1992.  In addition, and in the context of the efforts to bring about a settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, the EC Presidency maintains intensive contact at the diplomatic level on behalf of the EC and its member states, with the Governments of all of the Republics of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not recognised and, therefore, could not have diplomatic relations with the federal entity of Serbia and Montenegro. Any bilateral contacts with representatives of the federal entity are used to stress the imperative need for an end to the fighting in Bosnia and for full co-operation by Serbia and Montenegro with the peace process.</P>
    <P>I set out our attitude to the recognition of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in replies to questions on 10 February and 23 February.  Ireland has made clear its readiness to recognise that Republic, but in a manner which will avoid creating a further area of tension and potential conflict in the Balkans.  In this regard, I fully support the ongoing negotiations to secure agreement on the admission of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the UN under an interim name.</P>
    <P>While our relations at the bilateral level with this Republic are not intense, a close working relationship has developed between it and the European Community. This facilitates, for example, the provision of EC technical and financial assistance.  Such contacts also help to reduce the dangers of spillover of the conflict.</P>
    <P>Although arrangements for the consular protection of Irish citizens in the former Yugoslavia have not been formalised, assistance in emergency cases is available from other Community member states represented in the region. This reflects the growing co-operation among member states in the consular field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the continuing hazard posed to all the people of Cambodia by the widespread presence of landmines throughout the countryside.  This problem has been fully recognised by the UN, and was one of the first tasks addressed by UNTAC (the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) under the Cambodian peace plan when it began deployment last year.  UNTAC set up a mine-awareness, mine-marking and mine-clearance programme and began training civilians in mine-avoidance techniques. Mine-clearing teams have now been deployed and, as the progamme intensifies, increasing numbers of people will be involved in mine-clearing operations.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, commonly known as the &ldquo;Inhumane Weapons Convention&rdquo;, was opened for signature in 1981.  The Convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.  Ireland is a signatory of this Convention and the Government strongly support its provisions.  Cambodia is not a party to the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention states that ten years after it comes into force i.e. in 1993, any State Party may request the UN Secretary-General to convene a Review <Col N="65" /> Conference to examine its operation.  I am not aware that any State was asked for a Review Conference.  Nor am I aware of any review of the Convention's record as it pertains to the Cambodian conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government view the problem of dealing with the proliferation of landmines as falling within the wider question of restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons.  Together with our EC partners and Japan, Ireland has sponsored the introduction of a United Nations Register of Armaments to include information on international transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons.  The Register is now in place and the first returns are due to be made in April 1993 for transfers in 1992.  When the Register is fully operational, it is intended to examine the possible extension of its scope to include further categories of armaments, and Ireland and the other sponsors of the Register will seriously consider the inclusion of landmines at that stage.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations General Assembly in October 1992, Ireland tabled a proposal for a Code of Conduct for restraint in transfers of conventional weapons, with particular emphasis on transfers directed to areas of conflict. Ireland will continue to press in international fora for the maximum possible progress towards restricting arms transfers.</P>

      <P>Fundamental to Ireland's foreign policy is the view that international peace and security is based <Col N="66" /> on respect for and compliance with the rule of international law, including the decisions of the UN Security Council. In the case of Iraq we expect the Iraqi Government to comply with the Resolutions of the Security Council and to co-operate fully with the United Nations in implementing them.</P>
      <P>Resolution 687, adopted the Security Council on 3 April 1991, established the ceasefire arrangements at the end of the Gulf War.  It provides for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and for the demarcation by the United Nations of the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait.  On 11 January last, the President of the UN Security Council speaking on behalf of the Council, stated that Iraq was in material breach of Resolution 687 in respect of both those requirements. On 14 January, the UN Secretary General said that the military action taken by the US, France and the UK the previous day had received a mandate from the Security Council and conformed to the Resolutions of the Security Council and the Charter of the UN.</P>
      <P>For Ireland's part, we regret that a situation arose where force once again was necessary to ensure compliance with the mandatory Resolutions of the Security Council.  We remain convinced of the primacy of political action in international affairs.  The aim must be peace in the region that will obviate the need for recourse to force and avoid further loss of life.</P>

The voluntary repatriation of such a large number of people in such a short space of time is confirmation of the success of the programme.</P>
      <P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which acts as the lead agency in the repatriation process, oversees the movement of returnees, the provision of immediate assistance and food, and a reintegration programme.  The UNHCR is making every effort to advise returnees on the situation prevailing in their communes of final destination, particularly when they are unsafe or inaccessible.  The security situation in some parts of the country has affected the repatriation operation to a limited extent for the time being.  For the safety of the returnees the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) has declared some areas unsuitable for repatriation purposes.  I would hope that this will be only a temporary measure.  The shortage of safe, available land is also a factor in the reintegration of refugees in Cambodia.  In this regard, an extensive mine-clearing programme was adopted by the Cambodian Mine Action Centre last November with a view to making more land available to returnees.</P>
      <P>From the above, the Deputy will see that the United Nations is making every effort to ensure that the original principles of repatriation are adhered to. Ireland gives its full support to the UNHCR in this regard.</P>

      <P>I support a mandate for the United Nations which would help bring about a cease-fire and an end to the civil war which is killing thousands of Angolans.</P>
      <P>A few days ago, on 12 March, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 811, its second resolution on the situation in Angola in 1993.  It was a strong resolution. The Security Council condemned the persistent violations by UNITA of the major provisions of the Bicesse Peace Accords and UNITA's failure to fulfil its commitment to send a delegation to Addis Ababa to take part in peace talks under the United Nations. It also noted the Angolan Government's readiness to pursue negotiations to bring the resurgent civil war to an end.</P>
      <P>The Resolution strongly demanded an immediate cease-fire throughout the country and the resumption without delay of meaningful dialogue under United Nations auspices so that a clear time-table for the completion of the implementation of the Bicesse Peace Accords might be established.</P>
      <P>The Security Council further demanded that the two parties, particularly UNITA, produce early evidence, not later than 30 March 1993, that real progress has been made towards the implementation of the Bicesse Peace Accords.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General is asked to seek to organise a meeting between the Government of Angola and UNITA at the highest level possible to take place before 30 April 1993.  Both parties are encouraged to respond positively.</P>
      <P>The Security Council also decided to remain seized of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully endorse the Resolution of the Security Council and will, together with EC partners, use every <Col N="69" /> occasion to reiterate its message and encourage both sides to seek peace and reconciliation.  Both parties must respect the Bicesse Peace Accords, which they both signed.</P>

      <P>The allegations to which the Deputy refers cause grave concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>The response of the Turkish authorities to this very disturbing situation has not been adequate.  Although reforms were introduced on 1 December last to protect detainees, certain areas of the country as well as persons suspected of certain crimes will be excluded from the scope of the new law.  It is not clear, therefore, what impact the new law will have.  This is particularly disappointing given the concerns of many members of Turkey's parliament and of Turkish public opinion regarding the treatment of persons in detention, and given the commitments made when the present government under Prime Minister Demirel took office towards the end of 1991.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with its Community partners, has made clear on many occasions that we expect Turkey to fulfil its obligations in the field of human rights.</P>
      <P>The Turkish authorities can be in no doubt about the position of the Irish Government on deaths in police custody. But I can assure the Deputy that I will find further opportunities to pursue the matters to which his question refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Amnesty International in helping courageous Turkish citizens &mdash; lawyers, <Col N="70" /> journalists, victims' families, and others &mdash; to bring these grave abuses into the public domain.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 77, 99 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> envisages that the percentage of GNP committed to ODA will increase from 0.2 per cent in 1993 to 0.4 per cent in 1997, so as to make steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>I believe that the targets in the Government programme are appropriate, realistic and attainable bearing in mind our own difficult financial circumstances and the need to build up a capacity to implement a rapidly expanding programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members of the House, I <Col N="71" /> would wish to proceed as rapidly as possible towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the continuing levels of hunger and famine in many developing countries.  The increases envisaged in the Programme for Government will put Ireland's contribution to the alleviation of these conditions on a par with most of our EC partners and well on the way towards achieving the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The final outturn figures for expenditure on ODA as a percentage of GNP in 1992 are not yet available but the estimated figure is 0.16 per cent.</P>
    <P>International comparisons of ODA are usually based on GNP but since the GDP figure has also been asked for, I can confirm that expenditure on ODA as a percentage of GDP was approximately 0.14 per cent in 1992.</P>

      <P>In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  Diplomatic relations are conducted with China on that basis.  At that time, Tibet was recognised internationally as part of the People's Republic.  That situation remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a central concern of the Government's policy on Tibet remains the respect and protection of the human rights of Tibetans.  Ireland's concerns, and those of our partners in the Community, at the human rights situation in Tibet have been and will continue to be brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities.  As recently as 1 March at the annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EC Presidency on behalf of the member states of the Community noted that we were particularly concerned about measures which threaten the distinct cultural, religious and ethnic identity of persons belonging to minorities, and about the situation in Tibet, the persecution of religious believers, and the imprisonment of people for expressing their political beliefs.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report mentioned by the Deputy.  Support for human rights, including the promotion of religious tolerance, is fundamental to Irish foreign policy.  I view with great concern reports which provide evidence that violations of religious freedom occur in many countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Ireland is active within the United Nations in seeking to promote religious tolerance and to ensure that all persons can practice their religion freely, without discrimination and safe from persecution. Each year we are the main sponsor of a resolution on religious intolerance at the United Nations General Assembly and of a similar resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights under which the Commission mandates a Special Rapporteur to examine situations of religious intolerance and to recommend remedial measures.  Over the years, the Special Rapporteur has had occasion to consider the situation in a number of countries.</P>

While all the relevant procedures have been completed in Germany there are a number of challenges to the Treaty which have to be heard by the German Constitutional Court.  When the cases concerned have been heard by the court the German Government expects to be in a position to lodge the Instrument of Ratification.

      <P>The Government have announced that they are allocating £500,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance towards relief efforts in Southern Sudan.  The money is being channelled through Irish NGOs which are assisting in the region and through the United Nations Operation Lifeline Sudan.  We have also been in contact with our European partners and with the EC Commission in order to ensure that there is a concerted and speedy European response to this humanitarian crisis.</P>
      <P>Together with our EC partners, we have been pressing the Government of Sudan to improve the human rights situation in the country and to allow relief agencies access to those in need.  The Government of Sudan is now permitting airlifts of emergency food and medical supplies into Southern Sudan.  While the precise dimensions of the crisis have still to emerge, there is clearly an urgent need for large-scale emergency assistance for the people of the area, who are suffering as a result of war and drought and the displacement of large sections of the population.  We will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in Southern Sudan carefully in order to help avert the possibility of a tragedy of the proportions of the crisis in Somalia.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of agreements signed in the early 1970s between the EC and Sweden, Norway, Austria, Finland and Iceland free trade in industrial goods has been in operation for over ten years.  There has been no discernible adverse impact on Irish exports arising from this.  In addition, over the period in question Ireland has enjoyed substantial trade surpluses with a number of EFTA countries.</P>
      <P>Further liberalisation of the conditions of trade is planned in the context of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA).  This Agreement, which it is hoped will enter into force in July this year, effectively extends the Single Market to the countries listed by the Deputy.  It does not, however, cover the bulk of agricultural goods.  In the case of fisheries products a number which were of interest to Ireland have been excluded, alleviating concern about a possible impact on our exports.</P>
      <P>Our assessment of the overall impact of the Agreement including in the trade area has been positive.  This was made clear when it was debated and approved in the Dáil on 30 October last year.</P>

      <Quest>the policy being pursued by Ireland, in conjunction with its European partners, to prevent the possibility of systematic discrimination against the 26 million ethnic Russians still living in countries of the Confederation of Independent States outside Russia becoming a threat to peace in Europe.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tensions involving minorities in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Baltic States and in Georgia may well have a significant impact on the peace and stability of Europe.  Discriminatory treatment of minorities could militate against internal stability in some of these states and adversely affect their relations with each other.  It is important, therefore, that the rights of all minorities, Russian and others, be fully respected.  It is also important that minorities, for their part, behave responsibly and avoid exacerbating tensions.</P>
      <P>Ireland is active in discussions within the European Community, and in multilateral fora such as the CSCE, the Council of Europe and the UN Human Rights Commission in seeking to ensure respect for the rights of minorities, including those in the former Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Ensuring respect for human rights is an important element in the development of the European Community's relations with all the former Soviet Republics.  The guidelines on the reecognition of new states in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, adopted by the Community in December 1991, stressed the need to ensure full respect for human rights.  In addition, the new states were asked to guarantee the rights of ethnic and national groups and minorities in accordance with the commitments subscribed to in the CSCE framework.  All members of the CIS accepted these guidelines.</P>
      <P>The CSCE, in which all members of the CIS, the Baltic States and Georgia are now participating States, has a vital role to play in ensuring the protection of human rights.  The Charter of Paris acknowledged that the rights of persons belonging to national minorities must be fully respected as part of universal human rights.  In July 1992, the CSCE decided to appoint a High Commissioner on National Minorities.  The High Commissioner, Max Van der Stoel, has been mandated to provide early warning and, as appropriate, early action with regard to tensions involving national minority issues that could affect peace, stability or relations between CSCE participating States.  The High Commissioner has already visited a number of former Soviet Republics to look into minority rights issues.</P>
      <P>With the encouragement and support of Ireland and our EC partners, the Council of Europe is developing its relations with the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and is making an important contribution in assisting them in the process of transformation to democratic structures and on minority rights issues.  We also support the role of the UN and, in particular, the UN Human Rights Commission in this area.</P>

      <P>Ireland supports the establishment of a UN Commissioner for Human Rights or an office with similar functions.  We believe that the creation of such a post would constitute an important addition to the existing international machinery to safeguard human rights and would enhance the protection and promotion of fundamental rights and freedoms.</P>
      <P>The question has gained fresh momentum in the context of the World Conference on Human Rights which is due to take place in Vienna in June 1993.  We are among those countries of the Twelve which have consistently supported the concept and we will work actively at the June Conference for the establishment of the post.</P>

      <Quest>the current levels of representation, foreign service, disturbance and rent allowances paid to each officer of his Department serving abroad; the change, if any, in value of these allowances since 1 October 1986; and the way in which the real value of these allowances has changed in percentage terms by reference to movements in the value of currencies and relevant consumer price indices.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the Table which is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The purpose of foreign allowances is to compensate officers for the differential in the cost of living between Ireland and individual posts overseas including, in the case of diplomatic officers, the additional costs arising from representational activities. Ambassadors are supplied with a furnished residence and receive a representational allowance; other diplomatic officers receive a foreign service allowance and are also paid a rent allowance to cover a proportion of vouched accommodation costs.  Displacement and rent allowances are paid to administrative staff assigned from Dublin.  A disturbance allowance equivalent to 28 days subsistence in Dublin is paid to all staff on transfer to Dublin at the conclusion of an overseas assignment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's query about changes in the value of allowances since October 1986, I would point out that the current system is based on maintaining the real value of allowances at a constant level in terms of their purchasing power in foreign currencies.  The allowances as expressed in Irish Pounds are regularly adjusted to maintain those values in accordance with currency fluctuations and consumer price increases abroad.</P>

    <P>In a statement issued on 12 March the Twelve welcomed the adoption of the resolution and urged the Government of Burma to accelerate the process towards democracy and restore full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy to refer to the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 8 March, 1993, which reached agreement on an Interim Regulation to bring the Cohesion Fund money on stream in 1993, before the Maastricht Treaty comes into effect.</P>
      <P>The financing of the Cohesion Fund was agreed at the Edinburgh European Council in December last.  The amount of the cohesion funding involved is 1.5 billion ECU (about £1.2 billion) in 1993; 1.75 billion ECU (about £1.4 billion) in 1994.  The total for the Cohesion Fund between 1993 and 1999 will be 15.150 billion ECU (about £12.12 billion).  The Regulation specifies that Ireland will receive between 7 and 10 per cent of the money covered by the Regulation.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the funds within Ireland did not arise.  The Minister for Finance outlined on budget day the kinds of projects in Ireland for which funding will be sought in 1993.  They involve the transport infrastructure and environment areas.</P>

      <P>The increased resources available to Ireland's Aid Programme under the agreed Programme for Government will make it possible to extend our bilateral aid assistance to other developing countries.  Consideration is at present being given to identifying suitable partner countries and assessing the most effective way of providing bilateral assistance.  These issues will require serious study as the establishment of new programmes in additional countries will represent a long term commitment to providing bilateral development assistance to these countries in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> Our current focus is on seeking partners in the least developed countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.  Many countries in this region are among the poorest both in terms of <i>per capita</i> income and resources for development.  Field visits will be made in the near future to the region to assess the possibilities for development assistance programmes.</P>
    <P>It is true that many countries in Asia, such as Cambodia, are among the least developed and we will be considering these countries' needs as our Programme expands.  The Bilateral Aid Programme is currently funding a project managed by ESB International to improve the power supply system in Cambodia.  It has also provided assistance to programmes managed by Irish NGO's as well as a grant of £200,000 towards relief for Cambodian refugees.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the introduction of an additional form on the lines suggested by the Deputy would add to the costs of administration without making an effective contribution to compliance.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the PAYE system are designed to ensure that employers make appropriate PAYE deductions and pay over these amounts to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where changes in employment occur the new employer is obliged to notify the tax office of the new employee, to make the necessary deductions and to pay over these amounts monthly to the Revenue Commissioners.  In practice the vast majority of employers comply with their obligations.  Audit programmes operate to detect non-complying employers and to ensure that the PAYE/PRSI system operates properly.  These audit programmes are currently being extended. The Revenue Commissioners consider that effective auditing is the most appropriate way of encouraging compliance and ensuring that non compliant taxpayers are detected and pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A procedure on the lines suggested would involve the Revenue Commissioners in the processing of forms from employees the majority of whose employers would be compliant.  Without a visit to the employer concerned the form suggested would not facilitate the detection of non-compliance until the end of the year when the employers' annual return was lodged.  If the employee concerned was not shown on the return a visit to the employer would <Col N="107" /> be necessary to establish the extent of the liability.</P>

      <P>Provision of the volume of information requested by the Deputy, going back over a 20-year period, would require an inordinate expenditure of time and resources.

      <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector makes recommendations on the appropriate levels of remuneration for higher management grades in the public service.  As part of its examination the review body carries out a survey of remuneration levels in the private sector on a confidential basis.  The particular employments involved are not disclosed.  Apart from its survey, the review body also has regard to published information on executive salaries in the private sector, data in relation to movements in the CPI and average industrial earnings.  The review body has stated that full salary parity between top public and private sector executives is neither justifiable nor practical and that account has to be taken of differences in relation to factors such as job security, decision-making responsibility, accountability and general exposure to risk.</P>
      <P>Comparison with rates of pay for positions in the private sector by reference to information mostly provided on a confidential basis has also formed part of the examination by arbitration boards of special pay claims by various public service grades.  Other factors such as the pension arrangements and job security applicable to public service employment and the state of the public finances and the economy have also been taken into account.  However, there are no agreed lists of comparators in the private sector for such cases and the comparators used may vary from time to time.  In general the Official Side and the Staff Side have furnished separate lists to support the case they are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in the budget statement that the Government are totally committed to change in the pay determination systems in the public service.  It is their intention in 1993, through discussions with the public service unions, to press forward with the introduction of a new system which would be more transparent and operate on assessment criteria which, while being fair to staff, would be responsive <Col N="109" /> to the interests of the Government and the community as taxpayers.  Part of the exercise will be to ensure that private sector comparators used are fully representative of private sector employment and that the differences between the totality of the private sector employment situation and that of the public service are fully taken into account.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office does not compile information on income levels by county.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in the course of its administration of the income tax system, compiles and publishes an extensive range of income distribution statistics for the State.  The most recent information available is the Commissioners' Statistical Report for 1991 covering the income tax year 1989/90.  The Revenue Commissioners' existing statistical databases of income distribution contain no indicators of a taxpayer's county of residence, and hence a county by county breakdown of the income distribution statistics is not available.  Accordingly it is not feasible to indicate whether intercounty income differentials have widened or narrowed over the past ten years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Canals Act, 1986, transferred the Grand and Royal Canals to the Commissioners of Public Works with the duty to undertake their care, management and <Col N="113" /> maintenance as a public amenity.  The impact of canalside development on the system itself is an important consideration in the maintenance and development of the canals as a public amenity and the Commissioners of Public Works carefully monitor planning applications for such developments.</P>
    <P>They would as a matter of course oppose any development which would diminish the amenity value of the canals. The Commissioners policy in relation to the location of large scale piggeries or any other development close to the canal system is to examine each planning application on its merits and to oppose it where necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>Marked gas oil, which is used mainly for agricultural and domestic heating purposes, is subject to a substantially lower excise duty charge than auto-diesel. Under section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, as amended, marked gas oil may not be used for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle which is designed, constructed and suitable for use on the road.  As an exception to this general rule, the law provides for the use of the oil in agricultural tractors, road rollers and certain off-road dumpers.  There is no statutory provision, however, permitting its use in mobile cranes.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the past an administrative concession had been granted by them permitting the use of marked gas oil as fuel in mobile cranes and in a limited number of other kinds of vehicles which were claimed to be primarily for off-road use or to be of the nature of mobile machinery.  Over the years, experience showed that the operation of this concession was becoming more difficult to control and was giving rise to regular claims for extending the concession to more types of vehicles.  For these reasons, the Revenue Commissioners withdrew the concession in 1988.</P>
      <P>In the particular circumstances, the Commissioners ensured that owners of vehicles concerned were given notification of the intention to apply the strict requirements of the law and they followed a policy of considering prosecution only where there is continued use of marked gas oil after the person concerned was advised of the correct position. So far, no legal action has been taken against any mobile crane owner.</P>
      <P>The Irish Contractors Plant Association, representing mobile crane owners, made representations about the matter in June, 1992, and were informed of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures of the Exchequer effects of the <Col N="115" /> withdrawal of the concession as requested by the Deputy are not available.</P>

      <P>Under section 209 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, a supplement may be paid to a person whose means are insufficient to meet his needs.  Regulations made under this Act provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that a person may receive a supplement in respect of the interest portion of his mortgage commitment.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to supplements is determined by the Health Boards and the supplement is calculated so that, after payment of mortgage interest, the person has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family size less £5.</P>
      <P>Guidelines have been issued by my Department to assist health boards in assessing applications for such supplements. The guidelines indicate the factors which should be taken into consideration by health boards in assessing applications.</P>
      <P>An advisory group has been established under the chairmanship of my Department with representatives from all health boards.  The task of the group is to review all aspects of the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme with a view to achieving consistency in the operation of the scheme across all boards.  The group is currently completing an examination of the guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation and revised guidelines will be published later this year.</P>

      <P>There are three EC Directives which are relevant to my Department; Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978, Directive 86/613/EEC of 11 December 1986 and Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992.</P>
      <P>Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security provides that member states shall bring into force the necessary legislative and administrative provisions in order to comply with the provisions of the Directive.  The necessary provisions were implemented by way of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 which came into force in two phases with effect from May and November 1986.  Arising from the delay in implementing the provisions, equality of treatment for the period of delay was subsequently provided for by way of the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).</P>
      <P>Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a self-employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood contains a provision concerning access to social insurance for the spouses of self-employed workers which may require amendment of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of social insurance coverage for spouses of employees and the self-employed is being looked at by the Pensions Board in the context of its report on a new pensions system and I expect that this issue will be addressed in <Col N="123" /> that report.  The question of legislation in this area will be considered in the light of this report.</P>
    <P>Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breast feeding requires member states to implement its provisions not later than two years after the date of its adoption. The measures necessary to give effect to the Directive are being worked on at present.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance of the person concerned was reduced from £86.40 to £29.50 with effect from 29 July 1992.  The reduction followed a review of his means which were assessed at £86.54, derived from his self employment as an electrician and benefit from his wife's income.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.  Following an oral hearing on 3 February 1993 an appeals officer reduced the means assessment to £75.76 which has the effect of qualifying him for a weekly unemployment assistance rate of £53.00, inclusive of dependant allowances in respect of his wife and three children.</P>

      <P>Three regulations relating to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance have been made since September 1992.  No regulations have been made since that date relating to Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  A description of each of the regulations concerned is set out below.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 389/1992).</i>

      <P>
        <i>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) (No. 2) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 448/1992).</i>
      </P>
      <P>These regulations prescribed the amount of reckonable weekly earnings a claimant is required to have to qualify for unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  They also provided for the payment of reduced rates of Unemployment Benefit and Disability Benefit to claimants whose reckonable weekly earnings are below this prescribed amount.</P>
      <P>In addition the regulations outlined the circumstances in which a claimant will be regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment as provided for in section 28 of the Social Welfare Act, 1992 in order to qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>There are a number of fundamental differences between the means test arrangements for unemployment assistance and old age pension, including the provisions in relation to the earnings of a spouse.</P>
      <P>A recipient of unemployment assistance can continue to receive a full adult dependant allowance in respect of a working spouse, once the spouse's earnings do not exceed £55 per week.  In the case of a recipient of an old age non-contributory pension, an earnings disregard of £6 per week is applied and half of the joint means of the couple, including earnings, are assessed against the applicant.</P>
      <P>Therefore, where a couple have no other means, a recipient of a non-contributory pension could continue to receive, at current rates of payment, a reduced adult dependent increase in respect of a working spouse, once the spouse's weekly earnings do not exceed £120.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring about greater standardisation in the means test arrangements for different social assistance schemes and will be examining the scope for such standardisation within the limits of the available resources.</P>

      <P>Under current regulations persons who fail to qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension are entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of any contributions paid provided the person concerned was aged 56 or over when entering social insurance for the first time.  These arrangements apply equally to employed and self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>According to the records of my Department the person concerned was under 56 years when he first entered social insurance.  He re-entered social insurance in 1988 when the PRSI scheme was extended to the self-employed, and paid contributions for the next three years.  As the person concerned entered social insurance for the first time before he was 56 years of age I regret to say that he is not eligible for a refund of the social insurance contributions.</P>

The community of Boston is 40 per cent Irish, while 22 per cent of the population of Rhode Island is of Irish ancestry.</P>

    <P>The events planned around St. Patrick's Day by Irish Americans afford Government Ministers the unique opportunity to promote the benefits of investing <Col N="127" /> in Ireland to top American business men and women.

They also represent an opportunity to show Ireland's appreciation of the continuing interest and support of the US in Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>My programme included several addresses to hundreds of top Irish American business people.  It also included a prestigious invitation to address both Houses of the Rhode Island Legislature and to strengthen the links between our communities.</P>
    <P>I met with the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Clayburn Pell, a strong supporter of Ireland.  I also met with the Governor of Massachusetts, Mr. William Weld and had discussions with Speaker Flaherty and the Mayor of Boston, Mr. Raymond Flynn, another prominent supporter of Ireland.  I met the President of the Massachusetts Senate, Mr. William Bulger.  I attended functions of several prominent charities, which raise millions of dollars to help our emigrants in the Boston area and to fund welfare, cross Border and job creation projects in Ireland.  I had discussions about their problems with Irish American groups working with emigrants.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance introduced in November 1990 provided, for the first time, for a direct payment to be made to the carer on a means-tested basis.  It is directed at persons who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners <Col N="129" /> with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.  In July 1991 the allowance was extended to recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards and also to recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is a specific condition for receipt of the allowance that the carer must be living with the pensioner or disabled person for whom full-time care and attention is being provided.  In the case mentioned by the Deputy, the application was disallowed as the carer was not residing with the pensioner.  Any relaxation of the residence condition would have considerable cost implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards who provide the accommodation and handle the day to day administration of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ensure the provision of a service to social welfare clients which is of the highest possible standard and this also applies to claimants of supplementary welfare allowance.  The most effective way of improving service is by reducing the need for clients to have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance in the first instance.  In this connection I am taking steps to reduce the burden of health boards arising from payments <Col N="130" /> to people awaiting another social welfare payment, through speeding up the decision making process for those payments.</P>
    <P>Health boards are also active in developing improved methods of dealing with client needs including the introduction of monthly rather than weekly payments of rent and mortgage supplements and increased posting of payments to clients.</P>
    <P>Of particular importance in achieving service improvements is the introduction of computer assistance for Community Welfare Officers.  My Department is currently developing a new computerised system for short term payments which will include the computerisation of supplementary welfare allowance payments. Implementation of this system is planned for 1994.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing the guidelines for the scheme through an advisory group, chaired by my Department, which includes representation from all health boards.  This group was established in 1992 with the task of reviewing the operation of the scheme in order to improve consistency in the delivery of the scheme across health boards.  This group is developing, inter alia, comprehensive guidelines on all discretionary aspects of the scheme including supplements and exceptional needs payments.  These guidelines will be published when they are completed with a view to improving the level of information which clients have in relation to the scheme.</P>

      <P>I have consulted with the Commissioner <Col N="133" /> of An Garda Síochána on the desirability of supplying the detailed information which the Deputy has sought.  The Commissioner is opposed to such information being made available as regards any area on the grounds of security and crime prevention generally. I am in agreement with the Commissioner on this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out, however, that size and population are but two of the factors to be taken into account in determining the level of public resources to be assigned to any particular area.  Other factors would include the overall resources available such as support staff, transport and other facilities, the incidence of crime in that area and any special policing needs or problems that exist there.</P>
      <P>The current strength of Finglas station is one Inspector, ten Sergeants and 61 gardaí, including nine Probationers.  This shows an increase of 12 gardaí over the equivalent period in 1992.  One Sergeant and four gardaí are employed on community policing duties.  The divisional task force, which is based at Santry, augments local patrols in Finglas and the Garda Traffic Corps performs regular patrols in the area.  In addition, there are two civilian support staff in Finglas station and there are also two traffic wardens, one of whom was recently assigned to the area on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>Policing arrangements in Finglas are continually reviewed and changes to existing arrangements are made by the Garda authorities as the situation demands having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the incident referred to <Col N="138" /> by the Deputy occurred on 11 February 1993 and is being fully investigated by the gardaí.  I, of course, abhor such acts of violence particularly when they are aimed at the elderly and defenceless in our community.  The Garda Authorities are totally committed to ensuring that the perpetrators of such attacks are vigorously pursued.  I have been assured by the Garda Authorities that a number of specific measures have been taken to deal with the problems in the Cork area. These include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;regular analysis of crime trends resulting in the surveillance of areas at risk and the targeting of Garda patrols to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the operation of the Crime Task Force Unit.  This unit which was established last year is tailored to have maximum personnel on patrol during prime-crime periods and targets its activities at travelling and organised criminals and suspects for vicious attack such as that referred to in the Question.

    <P>&mdash;crime prevention advice given by the Crime prevention officer and members assigned to community policing and rural policing duties.

The Garda Community Relations Section have been undertaking a programme of crime prevention surveys of churches and presbyteries and I have asked them to include convents and other religious houses in this programme. The Garda Community Relations Section have also, in conjunction with Church and General Insurance Company, drawn up security recommendations for churches and pres-byteries and other religious houses and these will be available in leaflet form.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the application referred to by the Deputy, which is one of a large number of such applications, is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 which introduced certain amendments to the 1956 Act of the same name provides that a person born outside Ireland may register as an Irish citizen if he or she has an Irish-born grandparent or, in certain circumstances, great-grandparent. The applicant's details are registered in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs or in <Col N="140" /> the Foreign Births Entry Book kept in missions abroad.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act tightened up the provisions contained in the 1956 Act by providing, amongst other things, that the fourth generation applicant &mdash; that is, a person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland &mdash; can be registered only if the parent through whom he or she is claiming Irish descent was already registered at the time of his or her birth.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the 1986 Act contains a transitional provision which provided for a six month grace period ending on 31 December 1986 during which the previous provisions continued to apply.  The period, however related not to the receipt of applications but to the completion of the process &mdash; that is, registration.</P>
    <P>During the period of grace, the number of fourth generation applications for registration received by the Department of Foreign Affair and diplomatic and consular missions abroad reached unprecedented levels, in particular at the Consulate General in New York and the Consulate in Johannesburg.  Emergency measures were taken to deal with the large volume of applications, including the employment of additional staff and the sanctioning of overtime.  The result of that was that over 4,200 applications were processed in the 12 months ending 31 December 1986, a considerable achievement given that the overall total processed in the previous three years was somewhat less than that.  However, there remained over 3,000 applications from fourth generation and mixed third/fourth generation applicants which had not been registered by the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>When it was realised that the backlog of applications could not be dealt with by the end of the statutory deadline, the views of the then Attorney General were sought.  The advice received was to the effect that there is no legal basis on which to grant registration to those who had been caught by the deadline of 31 December 1986 and that amending legislation was required to allow for the registration as Irish citizens of those persons who had applied but whose applications had not been finalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> Since then, the position is that a number of other possible changes in the legislation governing Irish citizenship have been under consideration and consultations in the matter have been taking place between the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.  However, it is my view that the situation needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency bearing in mind the case cited by the Deputy and the many other similar cases which have remained unresolved for some years.  It is my intention to submit proposals to the Government as soon as possible.</P>

In addition, each applicant is informed that he may contact UNHCR or a local representative.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that members of the force based at Store Street Garda station operate in the Fitzgibbon Street area as required and were responsible for the large seizure of heroin referred to in the Question.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight Gardaí based at Fitzgibbon <Col N="144" /> Street station have received specialised training in drug law enforcement and this expertise is used on an on-going basis. Four members of the District Detective Unit at Store Street have special responsibility for targetting drug dealers in the general area.  They also receive back-up support from the Drug Squad at Harcourt Square when necessary.  In addition, a Task Force based at Store Street station comprising 1 Sergeant and 8 Gardaí deal with crime, including drugrelated matters in the locality.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that their strategies to tackle the activities of drug dealers are as flexible as possible and include the setting up of local specialised units when required.  Of course, all members of the Force have the power to make arrests if they suspect that any crime has been committed.  The situation in relation to Fitzgibbon Street District is being kept under continuing review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>My recent official visit to Australia had two purposes.  The first was to enable me, on behalf of the Government, to attend various functions associated with the celebrations of St. Patrick's Day in Australia &mdash; Irish Government representation at these functions is, incidentally, something which is greatly appreciated by representatives of the large Irish community in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose was to enable me, again on behalf of the Government, to meet with various State and business representatives in Australia.  I was especially pleased to have the opportunity of meeting the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Paul Keating.  The fact that the Prime <Col N="145" /> Minister was prepared to take time out from his extremely busy schedule to meet me, literally within hours of his re-election, is I believe a measure of the value which he attaches to his own &mdash; and Australia's &mdash; links with Ireland.  It was particularly useful to have the opportunity of discussing the Northern Ireland talks process, the prospects of increased Irish/Australian trade, the question of Australian contribution to the International Fund for Ireland and other matters with the Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>During my visit I also had discussions with State representatives concerning various Justice-related matters.  These representatives included the Deputy Prime Minister of Victoria, Mr. Pat McNamara who is also the Minister with responsibility for police and for prisons.</P>
    <P>On my return journey through Hong Kong I met with, and formally addressed, senior representatives of a range of business interests.  I would like to thank An Bord Tráchtála, in particular, for making the necessary arrangements in this regard.</P>
    <P>As the journey was completed only very recently, final details of the cost are not yet available.  I will arrange, however, for the details of the cost to be supplied to the Deputy in due course.</P>
    <P>My husband travelled with me as did the Secretary of my Department, my Private Secretary and a member of the Garda team responsible for my personal security arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department did not attend any St. Patrick's Day functions abroad.</P>

      <P>A number of candidates who passed the written test but were not placed high enough to receive an interview immediately were advised by letter that they were not being called for interview.

      <P>Accordingly, the development of local enterprise promotion activities, including decisions on whether to provide small scale grants or to offer loan facilities, comes within the day-to-day responsibility of the Partnership Companies and is not a matter for which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has any direct function.</P>

      <P>Assistance is not provided under the Social Employment Scheme (SES) towards the PRSI costs involved for sponsors of projects.  In the case of the Community Employment Development Programme (CEDP), which has replaced the SES in the 12 areas designated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> strategy to combat long term unemployment, sponsors may be exempt from payment of the employers portion of PRSI in respect of those participants who normally reside in a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area.  However, the J rate of employers PRSI is payable <Col N="154" /> by CEDP sponsors in respect of participants from outside the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area.</P>
      <P>The J rate of PRSI is also applicable to all SES projects and provides for total contributions of 2.75 per cent.  Participants who are medical card holders are placed on the J3 (Nil) rate, leaving the sponsor liable in such cases for the full 2.75 per cent contribution.  Participants who are not medical card holders pay the J1 rate of 2.25 per cent with the balance (0.5 per cent) paid by the sponsor.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>As I have recently indicated to the House, an Exchequer allocation of £83.811 million has been made available for the Social Employment Scheme in 1993.  This will allow for an average participation level of 13,500 compared with 12,000 in 1992.  However, as there were in excess of 15,000 people on the scheme at the beginning of 1993, some disruption of projects and the slowing down of recruitment will be inevitable as FÁS must manage the scheme within the resources provided.</P>
      <P>The processing of individual projects is a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <Quest>the reason two persons (details supplied) in Dublin who are on social employment scheme programmes in one of the 12 partnership areas, did not receive Christmas bonuses and retain their secondary social welfare entitlements although another participant at the same centre who is also residing outside the catchment area of CEDP did.</Quest>

      <P>The conditions for the Community Employment Development Programme (CEDP) which operates solely in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pilot areas specify that participants from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas retain their secondary benefits including Christmas bonus but that participants from outside the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas do not retain their secondary benefits.</P>

    <P>The payment of a Christmas bonus and some other secondary benefits to a person from outside the <i>Programme for <Col N="161" /> Economic and Social Progress</i> area is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare while health boards and local authorities are responsible for medical cards and differential rent.</P>

      <P>During the past week I undertook an intensive four day industrial promotion tour to the West Coast of the United States.  The tour involved individual meetings with sixteen separate companies as well as an address to over seventy prominent businessmen.  While this visit coincided with St. Patrick's Day, because of the intensive nature of my schedule, I did not attend any St. Patrick's Day functions in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce and Technology, Deputy Séamus Brennan, travelled to St. Louis to fulfil an invitation to the Taoiseach from the St. Patrick's Day Committee of St. Louis to attend functions and to be honorary guest at their St. Patrick's Day parade.  In addition to this, the Minister of State undertook industrial promotion work while in St. Louis.  The Minister was accompanied by his wife (the invitation extended to the Minister and his wife) and his Private Secretary.  While part of the costs involved were met by the St. Patrick's Day Committee, it is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer will be in the region of £6,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 283 together.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the difficulties currently being experienced on the Community whitefish market and am keeping the matter under close review to ensure that all possible steps are taken to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may know that the Community recently invoked the system of minimum prices at point of entry in respect of monk, hake, cod, haddock, saithe, and, more recently, Alaska pollack, in response to pressure from a number of member states, including Ireland.  This minimum prices system will remain in force until the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, however, point out that this system will be successful only if the prices <Col N="183" /> are monitored carefuly.  At last Thursday's meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan emphasised this aspect to other Ministers and called on them and the Commission to ensure that this monitoring be done.</P>
    <P>The Council also instructed the Commission to consider extending the minimum prices regime to species other than those mentioned above and, making proposals for a better control of direct landings from third countries in Community ports.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Commission will establish contact with the third countries involved so as to control and stabilise imports into the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out to the Deputies that I am taking a very serious view of any damage caused to consignments of Irish fish as a result of the current difficulties.  I have already been in touch with my colleagues in other member states with a view to ensuring that protection is afforded to shipments of Irish fish through their countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State had a special meeting last week with the French Minister at which he protested strongly against the aggressive actions of French fishermen over the past weeks.  I am happy to be able to inform the House that, as a result of that meeting, we have had strong assurances from the French Minister that all possible measures will be taken to ensure that such actions are not repeated in the future.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine undertook a site investigation at Darby's Point, Achill, County Mayo, during 1992.  The results of this site investigation will be used in the drawing up of designs for any development projects at this pier.  Due to ongoing fishery harbour development projects and limited financial resources, it will not be possible to undertake any development works at Darby's Point during 1993.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently finalising, in the context of the next round of Structural Fund allocations, a Fishery Harbour Development Programme for the 1994 to 1997 period.  To this end maritime local authorities, including Mayo County Council, were invited to submit proposals for fishery harbour developments for which they would be willing to make funds available. Mayo County Council included the development of Darby's Point among its proposals.  Pending finalisation of the programme and clarification of its funding, I am not in a position to indicate what works, can be undertaken at Darby's Point.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's current Fishery Harbour Development Programme which runs till the end of this year, makes no provision for works at the landing places listed with the exception of Kilcummin Harbour where dredging/clearing of the harbour was required.  This dredging was carried out in 1990.</P>
      <P>A new development programme for the period 1994 to 1997 is currently being drawn up by the Department of the Marine.  Proposals for harbour development works in the fisheries interests were sought from maritime local authorities for possible inclusion in the new programme. Mayo County Council in its submission proposed development works at the following harbours: Darby's Point, Ballyglass Pier, Porturlin Pier, Westport Pier, Blacksod Pier, Inver Pier, Rosmoney Pier, Westport, Royin Pier, Newport, Doohome, Clare Island, Belderrig Pier, Kilcummin Pier, Killala Pier, Newport Pier, Inishturk Pier, Old Head Pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Works at these landing places are being <Col N="188" /> examined by the Department of the Marine for possible inclusion in the development programme for the 1994 to 1997 period.  Pending finalisation of this programme and clarification of total funding available, I am not in a position to say what funds, if any, can be made available for works at any of the piers listed.</P>

      <P>Notice of the application will be published in the local press shortly which will afford all interested parties an opportunity of making objections and representations to the Department of the Marine.  The application will be thoroughly assessed by the Department from all relevant perspectives including the environmental ecological and fishery implications of the proposal.  All objections received will be rigorously evaluated as part of that assessment process.</P>

      <P>EC Directive 92/46 sets common hygiene standards which will apply to all milk sold within the European Community with effect from 1 January 1994.  Among these standards is a maximum somatic cell count.  I have taken measures to ensure that Irish dairy farmers are aware of this standard and of the measures which, if need be, they should take to meet it.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations leading to the adoption of this Directive, I succeeded in having specific provision made for the possibility of special criteria for the measurement of somatic cell levels where, as in Ireland, the seasonal pattern of production affects those levels. Detailed arrangements for the application of this special provision are at present being considered in my Department, in consultation with the industry, with a view to their adoption at EC level.</P>

      <P>EC Regulations provide for ewe premium quota to be allocated to those flockowners who were paid the ewe premium in 1991 and who applied for the premim in 1992.  These regulations also provide that flockowners who received no premium or a reduced premium in 1991 because of certain natural circumstances may be allocated a quota based on an earlier year when those natural circumstances did not obtain.  Furthermore, flockowners who were paid a reduced premium or no premium because of the application of penalties may be allocated a quota based on the number of eligible ewes found at the inspection which led to those penalties.</P>
      <P>These provisions require my Department to examine a substantial number of individual files in order to establish the precise entitlement of each flock onwer to a quota.  This exercise will be completed shortly and flockowners will be notified of their quota entitlement shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC Regulations also provide for the establishment of a national reserve and special reserve for the disadvantaged areas for allocation to special categories of flockowners.  The distribution of quota from these reserves is a complex issue and is receiving urgent consideration by my Department.  When a decision on this <Col N="207" /> matter is taken my Department will be inviting flockowners to submit a formal application for the reserve quotas and to support their application with appropriate documentary evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person is not entitled to a quota because he did not apply for ewe premium <Col N="213" /> in 1992.  However, the EC Regulations also provide for the establishment of a national reserve for allocation to certain categories of sheep producers.  I will be announcing the criteria for the allocation of this reserve shortly.  The person concerned may then submit an application to my Department, along with supporting documentation, seeking an allocation from the reserve quota.</P>

      <P>A post-mortem examination was carried out by the Irish Coursing Club following the national coursing finals at Clonmel in February 1992.  A report on the meeting in question was received from management staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Services. While a wildlife ranger was in attendance the NPWS did not have evidence prior to the meeting that the hares were sick or injured and further action is not envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Condition 9 of the licence to capture hares is difficult to enforce due to the problem of ascertaining whether or not a particular hare is perfectly healthy. Nevertheless, I believe that the condition is worth retaining as it places an onus on <Col N="214" /> the organisers to ensure that the hares are healthy.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are engaged in discussions with the Irish Coursing Club in relation to the investigation being carried out into the recent coursing meeting at Cloonanna.  Following the completion of this investigation the overall situation will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>In December last, efforts were intensified to reach agreement in the GATT negotiations, before the change of the US Administration in January 1993.  These efforts proved unsuccessful and this was one of a number of deadlines for the conclusion of these negotiations which have not been met since the GATT ministerial meeting in Brussels in December 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this juncture, it is difficult to say when the negotiations might be concluded. This will depend to a significant extent on the final shape of the trade policy of the new US Administration <Col N="230" /> which is still eagerly awaited.  Early indications are that the Administration may be committed to a rapid conclusion to the round.</P>
    <P>During his visit to the US in February, Sir Leon Britton, EC Commissioner for External Economic Affairs, was advised that the US will be seeking an extension of the &ldquo;Fast Track&rdquo; procedure, enabling a Uruguay Round agreement to be submitted to the US Congress as a package. While details were not provided concerning the length of any such extension, current thinking is that it may be for nine to 12 months, which is regarded as a realistic assessment of the time required to conclude the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As to the farm deal negotiated between the EC Commission and the US last November, this did result in the recommencement in Geneva of the negotiations on the other topics in the Round, but little real progress has so far been made in any of these areas.  A number of member states, including Ireland, hold serious concerns about the terms of the farm deal itself and it will have to be considered very carefully by the EC Council of Ministers in the context of any overall package submitted in the way of final agreement on the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains fully committed to achieving a successful and balanced Uruguay Round Agreement, because of the major stimulus it would give the world economy.  We continue to be of the view that a global and balanced agreement, which would contribute to a stable and well regulated world trading environment, would be very much in the national interest.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has statutory responsibility for the regulation of all activities involving exposure to ionising radiation, including that emitted from radioactive materials. As part of the regulatory process the exposure of workers using radioactive materials is closely monitored and the degree of exposure is compared with the limits imposed by law.  These in turn are based on the latest recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection &mdash; the recognised world expert body in this field of health and safety &mdash; as adopted by the European Commission, the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other reputable international bodies.</P>
      <P>The highest annual doses received by workers are usually only a fraction of the above mentioned limits and would indicate that the important principle of keeping doses as low as reasonably achievable is well understood by both workers and employers and is being followed in this country.</P>
      <P>The Institute believes that at the above mentioned levels of worker exposure there is no scientific basis for expecting the possible effects mentioned by the Deputy in exposed workers arising from their employment.</P>

      <P>A listing of EC Directives transposed into national legislation follows together with a listing of EC Directives due for implementation.

The provision of detailed information in this regard, however, would involve an inordinate expenditure of staff resources.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware there are relatively few complaints about aircraft noise in the Blanchardstown area.</P>
      <P>In the last two years, since Runway 28 came into operation at Dublin Airport, there has been a substantial decrease in flights over the Blanchardstown area.  Jet aircraft en route to Dublin Airport do not normally cross this area and only some 10 per cent of departing aircraft use a flight path which would bring them close to the area.  Furthermore, all departing aircraft must be at a minimum height of 1,500 feet before turning onto this flight path and must also adhere to special aircraft departure procedures introduced by my Department.  All of these procedures, as well as my Department's regulations on the flying of aircraft over populated areas, are kept under constant review and are designed to ensure the safe navigation of aircraft and minimise noise pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that, in accordance with EC and international <Col N="251" /> requirements, there is already legislation in place in Ireland specifically limiting the operation of noisy aircraft.  Shortly, I will be making further regulations to implement the most recent EC Directive on aircraft noise.</P>

      <P>The transport of radioactive substances is prohibited save under licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the RPII, in accordance with section 8 (j) of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 and regulations made under it.  The general regulations governing conditions laid down for the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation and disposal of such substances are contained in the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977 (S.I. No. 166 of 1977).  I have arranged for a copy of these regulations <Col N="252" /> to be forwarded to the Deputy.  The specific conditions relating to each licence are contained in a schedule to that licence.</P>
      <P>The incident mentioned by the Deputy occurred when a 25 litre drum containing low-level radioactive material, an aqueous solution containing Iodine-125, used as a diagnostic tool in medicine, fell from a vehicle which was transporting it from UCD's veterinary college at Ballsbridge to a radiation storage area at the College's Lyons research farm near Celbridge. The radioactivity level was just slightly above the level that requires material to be kept in storage for a period to allow radioactivity to decay prior to final disposal.  The drum was properly packaged and labelled.  The spillage which occurred was minimal, no person was contaminated and the label enabled the drum to be recognised and the alarm to be raised and responded to quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>The RPII inspectors on the scene satisfied themselves as to the origin of the material and made satisfactory arrangements for the onward dispatch of the material to its destinations.  The store at the Lyons Industrial Estate contains approximately 28 MBq of Tritium and 666 MBq of Iodine-125 which is kept in bags and drums.  The storage facilities are considered by the RPII to be appropriate for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The reports by UCD of the accident, required by section 34 (1) of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, and that of the institute inspectors' are now being studied with a view to taking corrective and legal action as may be considered necessary.</P>

      <P>The interim report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which was published recently, contains recommendations for a long term transportation strategy for Dublin city and an investment and implementation programme for the period 1994-1997.  As regards public transport, the interim report contains a range of proposals, including DART extension/upgrading, the development of a light rail system and the introduction of significantly enhanced quality bus services along dedicated corridors, as well as a range of traffic management and other measures.  This recommended strategy emerged following a very detailed process of study and testing, including cost-benefit analysis, traffic demand modelling, land use, engineering and financial evaluation, market research, extensive public consultation, social and community research and institutional analysis.  Both the recommended strategy and the investment and implementation programme will be the subject of further technical, financial, economic and environmental evaluation and public consultation in advance of the final report.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that under the ongoing DTI process, optimal solutions for the traffic and transportation problems and requirements of all areas in Dublin city are being developed.  It would not however be appropriate for me to pre-empt the final report of the DTI in relation to specific public transport options which may be recommended for any individual district.</P>

      <P>While I am not clear what the Deputy may have in mind by his reference to &ldquo;joint equal custody&rdquo; of children, particularly in the context of marital breakdown where the spouses no longer live together, it is the case that the position of children where marriages do break down is fully considered in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The legal provisions in relation to the protection of and financial support for children together with the issues of custody and access to children by parents are outlined and no specific changes in relation to custody are proposed. However, if there is any specific aspect which the Deputy might feel should be brought to my attention &mdash; if needs be on a confidential basis &mdash; I would of course be prepared to consider it fully.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> acknowledges the position of people with a disability as equal citizens of the State. As Minister for Equality and Law Reform, my role in relation to persons with a disability will be essentially a co-ordinating <Col N="256" /> one.  I would hope to enhance, through sharpening their focus, the effectiveness of the various services provided by the Departments of Education, Health and Environment and their associated agencies.</P>
      <P>I have already initiated the process of consulting the appropriate representative bodies and agencies in line with the Government's policy of trying to achieve the widest possible consensus and participation in decision-making.  Discussions have also taken place between staff of my Department and officers of the Department of Health to explore how the proposals in the programme can best be implemented.  Subjects under discussion include the degree of integration in current service arrangements, the effectiveness of the services provided, their impact on client groups, the implications which any changes may have and ensuring the clear definition of the two Departments' respective responsibilities in the future.</P>
      <P>In the area of education, I would see my role also as a co-ordinating one, involving an ongoing process of consultation and co-operation with the Department of Education and the relevant representative bodies.  This process will enable me to clarify the manner in which access to all levels of education can be enhanced for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of access to transport, the programme accepts the need for capital spending in the medium term to improve access to the public transport system.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-1997</i> I have been entrusted wih responsibility for articulating and implementing Government policy in relation to travellers.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the programme, it is proposed to set up a Task Force, which will be chaired by a member of the Oireachtas, to monitor implementation of measures in favour of travellers.  The Task Force can help to ensure that a fair share of the burden of providing halting sites is undertaken by local authorities and also within each local authority area. It will also ensure that appropriate, co-ordinating planning is undertaken in relation to Government aims generally.</P>
      <P>With a view to setting up the Task Force, I have had preliminary discussions with a number of organisations which represent travellers.  Discussions have also taken place with statutory bodies which provide services for travellers.</P>
      <P>I have committed myself to having further discussions with relevant interests in drawing up the precise terms of reference for the Task Force and selecting its membership. I hope to be in a position to engage in that process shortly.</P>
      <P>Without attempting to pre-empt these discussions, I can state that the Task Force will be provided with wide terms of reference.  Its membership will comprise travellers, travellers support groups, elected local councillors and also individuals who have experience and expertise in promoting the welfare of travellers.</P>
      <P>Pending the planned discussions, it would not be appropriate for me, at this stage, to detail my own proposals, beyond the broad outline which I have given, in relation to the precise terms of reference, composition, structure, role and budget of the proposed Task Force.</P>

    <P>The three-year term of office of the committee monitoring the implementation of Government policy on travelling <Col N="258" /> people expired on 31 December last.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, does not, as far as I am aware, have any plans to reconstitute it in the light of my plans to establish a Task Force.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 28 of 9 March 1993.</P>
      <P>Under Statutory Instrument No. 251 of 1991, Irish broadcasters have to comply with Article 22 of Directive 89/552/EC. It is a matter for other member states to ensure that broadcasters operating under their jurisdiction are obliged to comply with the terms of the Directive.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the transmission of satellite <Col N="259" /> broadcasts intended primarily for reception in other member states which comprise almost entirely explicit sexual material.

The success or otherwise of the attempts to prevent these broadcasts will provide a test of the effectiveness of the Directive's provisions and I will be following the developments closely.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that schools are just one of the many institutions and categories of persons that <Col N="263" /> would regard themselves as worthy of such an exemption.  The removal of the necessity for the payment of television licence fees by schools would have to be compensated for from other sources, for example, from the general body of licence fee payers through increased licence fees or by means of subvention from the Vote of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I should add that as one colour television licence at a cost of £62 would cover all television sets in a particular premises, payment of this fee could hardly be regarded as an excessive burden on the annual budget of any school. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Education is providing for an increase in the capitation grant to schools for 1993 to further assist them with their day to day running costs.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputy, television licences issued to certain social welfare recipients under the Department of Social Welfare &ldquo;free&rdquo; television licence scheme are in fact paid for by that Department.</P>

      <P>The committee operates independently of the Department of Health. Under its own terms of reference, it seeks to maintian standards in chiropody services provided to public patients.  The committee assesses persons by reference to their qualifications or experience.  The criteria for admission to the committee's list of approved chiropodist are: (1) the possession of a formal qualification in chiropody gained after a course of at least three years duration from a recognised School of Chiropody or; (2) completion of a number of years in full-time practice in chiropody prior to June, 1963, subject to assessment.</P>
      <P>These are the same as the criteria required by the statutory Chiropodists' Registration Board in the United Kingdom and for employment under the British National Health Service.  A longstanding reciprocity of standards with the United Kingdom has thus been maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting lists for particular specialties must be viewed in the context of the annual throughput for these specialties. The Deputy will appreciate that the relevant factor is the length of time a patient must wait for admission to hospital rather than the number of patients on any particular list.  In this context, the Deputy will also be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other procedures), opthalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these <Col N="270" /> specialties, and to set a maximum period of 6 months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  In so far as there may be lengthy waiting times for other specialties in particular hospitals these will also be addressed in the context of the Government's action programme on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>My Department will be in touch with the boards and the other agencies in the coming weeks and I am confident that considerable progress can be made this year in alleviating the most pressing problems throughout the country.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer disease, is between 20,000 and 30,000.  My Department has made a financial contribution to the Alzheimer Society to carry out research on Alzheimer disease, which will estimate its prevalence and identify the needs of carers of people with dementia.  I understand that the research is almost completed and that the results will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> emphasised the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation. The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly in October 1988.  Health boards have prepared plans to implement the recommendations of the report.  In 1990, 1991 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, particularly the strengthening of home and community support for the elderly.  This funding enabled boards to enhance their services for people with dementia and their families.  I am glad to say that two psychiatrists specialising in the elderly have been appointed in <Col N="272" /> Dublin and a third post has been proposed. The Government has introduced the carer's allowance in recognition of the burden on relatives of caring for dependent elderly people such as those with dementia.  These developments represent progress towards translating policy into a practical network of services for Alzheimer patients and their carers.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting representatives of the Alzheimers Society in the near future which will enable me to hear at first hand about the problems experienced by victims of the disease and their carers.</P>

      <P>Peamount Hospital is directly funded by the Eastern Health Board which has provided the hospital with resources to implement the salary increases due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP).  The arrears due to nurses who are paid on a monthly basis were paid on 19 March, 1993 and all other staff will receive payment not later than 2 April, 1993.</P>
      <P>A multiplicity of grades qualified for payment of arrears following these special salary awards.  The calculation of the arrears has been complex and, despite the best efforts of the Eastern Health Board and Peamount Hospital, the hospital was not in a position to make payments before these dates.</P>

      <P>Vasectomy operations are a matter for decision by the patients concerned in conjunction with their consultants.  Where vasectomy operations are deemed necessary, they are considered part of a hospital's normal activity and are performed on the same basis as any other medical procedure and according to the same eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>Vasectomy operations are performed for medical card holders in the following hospitals:</P>

      <P>The <Col N="275" /> admission of a child to hospital for treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned to determine, and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  In Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin the waiting lists are constantly reviewed so that urgent cases receive treatment promptly.  Should a parent feel that his or her child's condition has deteriorated, they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other procedures), ophtalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialists and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
      <P>My Department will be in touch with the boards and the agencies in the coming weeks in relation to disbursements of waiting list funds, and I am confident that considerable progress can be made this year in alleviating the most pressing problems throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451, 452 and 453 together.</P>
      <P>The National Aids Strategy Committee was established in late 1991 to provide a broadly-based structure within which the national aids strategy would be developed and implemented on an inter-sectoral basis.  The committee, of which I am chairperson, consists of individual experts in the area of AIDS/HIV: representatives of the voluntary sector working in AIDS/HIV and drug misuse, respectively; of the statutory sector working in AIDS/HIV and officials from the health boards and the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  The committee has worked through four subcommittees dealing with prevention, care and management, HIV surveillance and anti-discrimination. These committees are comprised of representatives from a wide range of voluntary and statutory bodies.  A significant number of meetings under the aegis of these committees were held in 1992.  The last plenary meeting of the main committee was held in April 1992.  I have convened a further plenary meeting for next month.  In the light of the reports which I will receive at that meeting I will consider the way forward.</P>

    <P>The 1993 Estimates for my Department include provision to maintain, in real terms, the 1992 level of services this year. In respect of the mental handicap agencies directly funded by my Department, an allocation of £104.7 million has been made available this year.  A detailed breakdown of estimated expenditure under the headings mentioned in respect of 1992 is not yet available in respect of 1993.</P>
    <P>A special additional allocation of £8 million was made available to my Department in the budget to provide significant improvements in services for people with disabilities.  This extra allocation is the largest additional allocation ever made in this area.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to implement a package of measures which will address the most acute needs for services, mainly for people with a mental handicap, but also for people with a physical or sensory disability.</P>
    <P>The following additional services will be put in place for people with a mental handicap and their families:</P>
    <P>&mdash;an additional 70 residential places</P>
    <P>&mdash;an additional 200 day places</P>
    <P>&mdash;an extension of respite services to support families.  This extension will make progress towards the point where planned respite breaks will be available, on a regular basis, to all families and carers</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" />&mdash;additional home support services for 800-900 families</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved services for those who are behaviourally disturbed</P>
    <P>&mdash;further transfers of people with mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements within the mental handicap services</P>
    <P>&mdash;an extension of early intervention and child development services.</P>
    <P>The actual services to be provided will be agreed in each health board area by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees, which are representative of the health boards, voluntary agencies and parents, and approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>Additional services for people with a physical or sensory disability which will be put in place this year will include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the opening of additional independent living residential units together with appropriate support services</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of support services to people with disabilities living at home</P>
    <P>&mdash;respite services for families and relatives caring for people with disabilities</P>
    <P>&mdash;additional day care places</P>
    <P>&mdash;extra community based therapists</P>
    <P>The details of the allocation of this additional funding are still being finalised.</P>

      <P>There can be a variety of reasons why certain children display difficult or disruptive behaviour within the normal education system.  In many instances it <Col N="288" /> is also the case that the behaviour in question proves to be of short duration.</P>
      <P>The precise nature and level of response required to deal with such situations will vary depending on the severity of the problem and the underlying causes involved.</P>
      <P>In very many cases, such difficulties are capable of being addressed in the ordinary school setting through a more intensive focus on the particular needs of the child.  Where necessary, this is achieved through the provision of back-up support to the ordinary teaching staff by way of remedial teachers, resource teachers or the special ex-quota teachers dedicated to the needs of children from disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Where there are indications of more serious or ongoing emotional disturbance, arrangements are made to have the child assessed by the relevant health authority and, if necessary, an appropriate placement is arranged in one of the 14 special schools dedicated to the needs of such children.  Eleven of these schools are in the Dublin area, and one each in Cork, Galway and Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Where a child has become totally alienated from the conventional school system, as evidenced by persistent truancy and perhaps indications of involvement in minor crime and delinquency, arrangements can be made for placement in one of the youth encounter projects provided to address the needs of such children.</P>
      <P>There are four such projects in operation at present.  Two are located in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 89/48/EEC on the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years duration was implemented by Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 1991 on 2 January, 1991.

Any variations in the text of the S.I. compared to the Directive are due to drafting considerations and do not relate to issues of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC is due for implementation before 18 June, 1994. <Col N="293" /> It is my intention to implement Directive 92/51/EEC by a Statutory Instrument which will be analogous to S.I. 1/91 before the due date for transportation of the Directive.  Council Directive 77/486/EEC on the education of the children of migrant workers does not require legislative action in the Irish context.  The requirements of the Directive are being met at present in the State by the administrative provisions of my Department.</P>

Accommodation is currently being made available in a local national school through an arrangement between KLEAR and the school authorities. While my Department supports and encourages such use of school facilities for broader community use, the specific arrangements in any one instance are a matter for the school authorities and those seeking use of the premises.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 512 and 513 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation and approval of departmental Estimates, including the provision for my Department's school capital programme, is a process which is initiated in mid-year and which continues until the publication of the Estimates for Public Services and the budget.  During the course of this process, spending plans are subjected to examination at various levels, up to and including Government, and to amendment and adjustment for a wide variety of reasons, including objective merits of proposals, perceived relative priorities, evolving needs, the overall financial position and budget strategies. Spending plans prepared in anticipation of the allocation eventually approved and confirmed must of necessity be, and be understood to be, provisional and subject <Col N="313" /> to review and adjustment when the final allocation has been approved.</P>
    <P>I have already detailed in reply to Question No. 164 of 10 March 1993 the major projects scheduled to commence in 1993 within the 1993 allocation.  These projects were selected following a review which was carried out once the allocation for 1993 had been made.  This review took account of the allocation available, the projects demanding inclusion in the programme within that allocation and the respective priority accorded to these projects. The projects approved were those which had been proposed for inclusion for some time, subject to some adjustments due to changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to detail the way in which the approved allocation evolved from my Department's original spending estimates.  Neither do I consider it useful to detail projects being considered before the 1993 allocation was confirmed and final decisions reached.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my conviction of the need for a more orderly approach to the process by which major building projects are selected for release to construction each year.  It is my intention that future decisions on the progress of major projects through the architectural planning process up to the signing of a contract be based on objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.  I also consider it desirable that school authorities be made aware, in an open and transparent manner, of the position of their particular building projects at the various stages. To this end, it is proposed to disclose the criteria on which projects are selected, prioritised and advanced through the planning process and to indicate on a regular basis where individual projects stand in relation to these criteria.</P>
