      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies John Bruton and Proinsias De Rossa.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office.  I call, first, Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking permission under Standing Order 30 to debate the following urgent and important matter: in view of the statement by the Tánaiste that there was certainty in regard to the figures for EC support for the National Development Plan and his further statement that he was 100 per cent satisfied that these figures would not unravel, the Dáil should debate a motion on the actual level of EC support for the plan, its consequential effect on the content of the plan as published and the implications of these discrepancies for the perceived competence of Ministers directly involved in conducting international negotiations on behalf of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with <Col N="1754" /> Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the reports that Ireland will not receive the full £7.8 billion in EC funds which the Government assured the House had been guaranteed and which it reported to the Dáil it had secured, that the Irish allocation is likely to be reduced by at least £800 million and that the implications of this for the National Development Plan, and in particular for job creation, should be debated by this House.  May I say also that the attempt by the Government this morning to provide for ten minute statements is totally inadequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything contained in <Col N="1756" /> Standing Orders, that statements shall be taken at 12.40 p.m. on the National Development Plan which shall not exceed 50 minutes and the following provisions shall apply in relation to the statements: (i) the opening statement of the Taoiseach and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and (ii) the Tánaiste shall be called on to reply not less than ten minutes before the debate is due to conclude.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  The problem is that we have been relying on statements by the Government and alleged statements to the Government by President Delors.  Statements are not good enough.  We want a clear motion from the Government where the Government affirms and the Dáil underwrites the Government's understanding of the situation. A series of bland statements will bring us no further.  It has been the reliance on apparently empty and incredible statements that has got the Government into the trouble it is now in.  This is the biggest difficulty it has confronted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly understandable, in view of the fact that it did not have the courage to table a motion on the National Development Plan this week, that the Government wants to <Col N="1757" /> avoid a debate on a motion today when the plan is unravelling.  It is essential that the Government table a motion where it nails its colours to the mast properly and does not attempt to get away from this issue by making provision for a series of bland statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not wish to anticipate today's debate.  However, the main debate will take place outside this House.  This is a serious matter and statements are not adequate.  That format gives us no opportunity to put forward a resolution.  The Government has been suffering from a political delusion about this plan since last December.  The plan should be withdrawn.  Not only every Cabinet Minister but every senior official here has been working under a false premise for the past number of months and it has made us the laughing stock of Europe.  It is not good enough that this Dáil cannot debate this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points need to be made on this proposal to provide for statements.  First, there were two requests here this morning that the House be adjourned to enable us debate this matter.  What the Government has done is to divert that debate to which we would have been entitled and which would clearly have been in order.  Unfortunately you, a Cheann Comhairle have decided to allow the Government to divert that debate by providing for ten minute statements.  I find that unacceptable and I intend to seek a meeting with you to discuss the way in which you are conducting the business of this House on serious matters relating to the national economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I will be seeking a meeting with you to discuss the matter.  The second point I wish to make, a Cheann Comhairle, is that President Jacques Delors indicated on radio this morning that the amount of money in question was not £7.8 billion even last July but £7.3 billion.  It seems we are to get £800 million less than the £7.3 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that there was a motion before the House, from Deputies Bruton and De Rossa, requesting leave to adjourn the House under Standing Order 30.  Clearly the Progressive Democrats did not consider it important enough to table such a motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that he has an agreement and that Standing Order 30 provides for a motion.  Given that the Taoiseach says he has an agreement, would he agree that the only way the House can actually unite as he wishes is if the Government tables a motion which states in words that we can read what the Government has actually agreed with President Delors?  I would urge the Taoiseach to put the agreement he has in the form of a motion, in accordance with Standing Order 30, which we can agree with in this House as a united body.  It is not in the Taoiseach's interest, or in the national interest, that he should proceed <Col N="1761" /> with mere statements which do not formalise anything.</P>

I should remind Members, as I have done before, that the only motion before the House under Standing Order 30 is that the House do adjourn to allow a discussion on a particular matter.  Statements under Standing Order 40 treat the matter in a similar manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for your ruling.  I am looking for clarification of it.  Would the Chair agree that if a motion for adjournment is placed before the House, as it should be, it would then be open to the Government to table an amendment to that motion which would state in writing what is actually agreed. Any motion can be amended, and a motion to adjourn can be amended.  It is important that at this stage we do not proceed any longer with statements or nods and winks but that we have a formal assertion in the form of a motion of what the Government has agreed.  Otherwise the Government does not have credibility internationally.</P>

      <P>In line with the helpful approach adopted by you, Sir, and <Col N="1763" /> Deputy De Rossa, I wish to seek agreement to add a paragraph to the statement. The first paragraph refers to opening statements and the second refers to the Tánaiste being called upon to reply.  May we add a third paragraph to the effect that at the conclusion of these statements the Government shall table a motion stating its understanding in regard to this matter and that the motion shall at that stage be voted upon by the House?

If I interpret Deputy Bruton correctly, he clearly indicated at the start, although he seems to be moving away from it, that if the Opposition knew the details of the figures reached and what was agreed upon, it would take a different position.  It would then have an opportunity of stating its full support in the national battle against the Commission, if that is what the Commission is going to do &mdash; we should remember that nobody knows as yet what it is going to do.</P>

      <P>I was making the point last evening that I felt we had to apply different standards to people's behaviour, how we controlled it in public places to which the general public had access, compared to private back or front gardens where people behaved in a particular manner.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, after &ldquo;reward&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and includes for the purposes of sections 5, 6 and 7 any place adjacent to, or in the vicinty of, a public place from which persons in that public place can see or hear the behaviour prohibited by those sections&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to deal with the realities, as opposed to the theory, of the situation to which the Minister's <Col N="1776" /> remarks yesterday evening were addressed.</P>
    <P>In an ordinary street or roadway it would be quite absurd to allow a group of young people to congregate on private property, say, an industrial premises, a disused building, the roof of a factory or the forecourt of a shop.  It would also be quite absurd to allow people to congregate on private property and engage in behaviour which was just as disruptive of public order as if they were standing on the thoroughfare itself.  It defies belief that the advice to the Minister can seriously suggest she should draw a distinction between what people can do in their front gardens on a suburban road in this city, at midnight or 2 o'clock in the morning, and what they can do outside their front gate.  It also defies belief that the Minister is advised it is right to give the Garda powers to prevent a cider party on the pavement but wrong to prevent them from doing precisely the same thing inside somebody's front gateway.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the Minister should come into the House with an amendment which leaves the Garda powerless to deal with, for instance, a very frequent happening, of, say, 20 youths up on the roof of a building, a factory or a disused building shouting and roaring all night, playing their transisters or ghetto-blasters, drinking and throwing bottles, bricks and stones.  Children do not stand in the middle of the street to do that; they do it somewhere just off the street.  When they know the Minister said in this House that that is legal but to do it on the public street would be illegal, she may rest assured that, when the word gets out she is drawing that distinction, the Garda will have to contend with more and more problems of that kind.</P>
    <P>How can it possibly be right that 20 children get up on the roof of a factory premises in one of the suburbs of this city, shout and roar all night, play ghetto-blasters, wake up everybody in the area and that the Garda can do nothing about it because, according to the section it is a matter for the civil courts?  The Minister told the Dáil it would be an infringement <Col N="1777" /> of civil liberties if the Garda were given powers to deal with that kind of happening. The Minister is mistaken if she thinks that a law of this kind which promises to deal with problems but which does not cover cider parties on derelict sites, in disused premises, on the roofs of premises and in people's front gardens, will work.  I warn her that she will be creating a recipe for a very big problem here if she attempts to draw the distinction which I think ought not be drawn between what is property dedicated to the public and behaviour conducted on property immediately adjacent to the public thoroughfare but from which all the adverse effects the sections in question are supposed to deal with can be easily heard and appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday &mdash; and I listened carefully &mdash; that there would be a danger, on a civil liberties basis, of saying that what people did in their back gardens could be the subject of Garda interference.  The Minister should just think that argument through.  For instance, what could somebody do in their back garden that would constitute an offence under the provisions of sections 4, 5, 6 or 7, that to stop it would involve an invasion of their civil liberties? For instance, if between the hours of 12 midnight and 7 o'clock in the morning someone in a back garden starts shouting, or playing a ghetto-blaster, is the Minister saying that Garda should not be entitled to intervene, that they should stand outside the front garden and appeal for quiet?  How could it possibly make sense that somebody can get out their ghetto-blaster, throw a cider party in the front garden, jeer and shout at their neighbours as they go up and down the road but, as long as they do not put their toe outside the gate, commit no offence? It simply does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Although the wording I propose in my amendment may seem to the Minister to be flawed in some respects &mdash; doubtless it could be polished up &mdash; I appeal to her to accept the principle that this Bill will be a dead letter unless rowdy, disruptive, intimidating and threatening behaviour is outlawed in a public place as long as it <Col N="1778" /> is audible or visible there.  That is the point I am endeavouring to get across. After enactment of this Bill incorporating the Minister's amendment, the Garda may come on a scene in a suburb of Dublin &mdash; Ranelagh, for example, because I will be accused of making a point if I do not mention my own area&mdash; and find 20 youths up on a school or factory roof, shouting and roaring all night, playing ghetto-blasters and the like.  When they politely request those youths to come down off the roof they will be told that the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, told the Dáil they were entitled to do this, that it would be an infringement of their civil liberties to provide any power of arrest, that if anybody had an argument with what they were doing, they could consult a solicitor and get a civil injunction.  It will bring the law of the land into grave disrepute.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 may not be perfect but it is proposed to say that, within the context of sections 4 to 7 inclusive of this Bill, the definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is to include, for the purposes of criminalising disorderly behaviour, places immediately adjacent to a public place from which the behaviour in question is audible or visible.  That is a perfectly rational, reasonable thing to do.  I know the Minister is sensitive about civil liberties groups arguing about the issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some of the points made contain some substance.  To shy away from making a workable law on the basis that in some way it would infringe people's civil liberties to allow a garda to prevent them from using a front garden or private property to create <Col N="1779" /> mayhem in their community is a major mistake.</P>
      <P>Our amendment No. 6 proposes to insert the following:</P>
      <P>and includes for the purposes of sections 5, 6 and 7 any place adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, a public place from which persons in that public place can see or hear the behaviour prohibited by those sections.</P>
      <P>If, for instance, a group of 20 children was found in the area of a Georgian house in any of the streets near here having a cider party, shouting and roaring and playing ghetto blasters, that would be covered by the offence.  The garda can tell them to turn off the ghetto blaster or whatever and to go home without infringing their civil liberties.  He is merely trying to preserve public order.  Our amendment is reasonable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attempt to deal with the issue in amendment No. 5, paragraph (b), is not enough.  There are plenty of places from which disorderly behaviour will be directed towards public places which are in private ownership and are not used for public recreational purposes such as schools, buildings, ruins of buildings, peoples' front gardens, gardens of abandoned houses and building sites. These are the places we have to deal with if we are to be realistic about the issue. For example, how would a melee on a building site fall into any of the categories of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; as set out in paragraphs (a) to (e) of the Minister's amendment? It is true that a building site is an outdoor area and an area to which people may have access as trespassers but it is certainly not used for public recreational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a law which must be practical and must deal with the real problems which will arise.  Disorderly youths will understand &mdash; as they will when word goes out from the Bridewell in Dublin and the equivalent courts in every city in the country &mdash; that when they are on private property or property which does not fall into any of the categories specified by the Minister they <Col N="1780" /> are safe.  The Garda will be in a most embarrassing situation and neighbours will be giving out socks to them to stop something happening on private property. Gardaí will be in a position to say: &ldquo;I am sorry but the Minister in Dáil Éireann deliberately chose to leave that kind of behaviour without any criminal sanction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment or to indicate now or in the Seanad that she will further amend the definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in this Bill so as to extend it to places adjacent to a public place, which themselves are not a public place, but where the prohibited behaviour is visible or audible in a public place.  If that is not done this Bill is a dead letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has made a very compelling case in relation to this issue.  As he is aware from the debate on Committee Stage I have no desire to exclude derelict buildings, schools, community centres or such places.  My main concern in relation to his amendment was that virtually everywhere would now become a public place.  However, having listened to him, I do not think that is what he wants to achieve.  I am concerned that places or premises in private ownership which may be unoccupied at the time may be used or that there may be a loophole in this legislation which would allow them to be used by gangs of youths engaging in the type of activity we are seeking to outlaw under this Bill.  I hope he will accept my bona fides when I say I will accept his amendment but that I need time between now and the Seanad debate to ensure that his amendment is fully in order.  It may be necessary &mdash; I am not saying it will &mdash; to add something to it on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We can go overboard about defending civil liberties when in fact we are impinging on other peoples' civil liberties.  I do not know whether any area should be defined but if misconduct takes place and it interferes with other people I do not understand why the Garda cannot protect the innocent victims.  Long ago when I was teaching I used to advise children going on holidays to enjoy themselves but to make sure they did not interfere with others.  For example, young boys who are full of enegry, can have great fun kicking a tin can up and down a street at 11 p.m. when elderly people in the locality may be trying to sleep.  I am not for one minute suggesting that they should be arrested but the Garda should be in a position to tell them to stop and move on.  If we define areas and are worried about civil liberties we may forget that there are victims of that defence of civil liberties. We can go overboard in giving rights to people which, in turn, interfere with the rights of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new departure.  I would like to echo the concerns expressed in relation to the civil liberty aspects of this legislation.  Under any circumstances we must regard the Bill as <Col N="1782" /> far-reaching and radical in dealing with behaviour which is generally regarded as acceptable but which previously would be perceived as an annoyance rather than a crime.  We are taking steps to deal with considerable problems in the community from hooligans and people engaging in abusive, insulting and intimidatory behaviour.  The line as to what constitutes a crime and what is, in effect, an annoyance in a democratic society is very narrow.</P>
      <P>In section 5 there is a distinction between the public and the private domain.  I was happy to go along with that distinction considering that we are going into the area of shouting, singing or boisterous conduct.  Under very few circumstances would boisterous conduct constitute a criminal offence.  Once we move beyond the public domain and impinge on the private domain, as propounded in amendment No. 6 and sections 5, 6 and 7 as any place adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, a public place that constitutes the privacy of one's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a disagreement while debating the Road Traffic Bill about gardaí entering the homes of people without warrants on suspicion that an offence had been committed.  While the argument can be cogently put by Deputy McDowell we are trying to ensure that the Bill is effective. Nevertheless, the step proposed goes beyond the intention of the Bill in terms of dealing with this type of behaviour in a public arena.  The definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is very wide.  There are no limitations to what is a public place.  A public place includes the places referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e) of amendment No. 5.  Obviously, these are only some of the public places.  If we extend it by adding &ldquo;any place adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, a public place&rdquo;, we are omitting nothing.  I think this is a dangerous amendment.  I hope the Minister will not accept it because it gives absolute authority to invade a person's privacy on reasonably flimsy grounds such as boisterous conduct, shouting and singing.  It would be very difficult to have a party at home without a little noise, or indeed to have a cocktail party on the south side in <Col N="1783" /> Dublin 2, 4 or 6 without a certain degree of boisterous conduct.  This amendment would mean that the gardaí could enter that home because it is in the vicinity of a public place &mdash; as all homes are &mdash; such as a public highway, which is specified in the Bill.  We could find ourselves in enormous trouble if we go down this road.</P>
    <P>We all agree on the intent of the Bill but if we spread the net of legislation so widely that we do not focus it, we will create more problems instead of resolving the present problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about this amendment.  As we have just agreed to amend the definition of public place, it is now widely drawn. The Minister is disposed to accept amendment No. 6 which would extend the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and includes for the purposes of sections 5, 6 and 7 any place adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, a public place from which persons in that public place can see or hear the behaviour prohibited by those sections&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Presumably, if one can see or hear from a public place what is going on in the front or back garden of a house &mdash; perhaps a row between a husband and wife, two brothers or a father and son &mdash; it could constitute a criminal offence under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.  It is not a public order matter but a private matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider sections 5, 6 and 7. Section 5 deals with disorderly conduct in a public place and the amendment to that section is reasonable.  Section 6 refers to abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place and section 7 relates to the display of insulting or obscene material. I want to home in on the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;. If a husband and wife are having an argument, it is inevitable that the odd insult will be thrown out, that happens in the best of homes, even in Progressive Democrats homes.  I should mention in passing that we have the odd cocktail <Col N="1784" /> party in Dublin 8, which Deputy Costello and I represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a north side and south side Deputy, it depends on where he is speaking.  If we are to accept the amendment as tabled it would be possible for a person in a public place adjacent to a house to have a prosecution taken against a couple who in the privacy of their own garden were having a row, or indeed, somebody who might want to put up a poster in his garden that is adjacent to Landowne Road which might be insulting to the Spanish football team. This would now become a criminal offence because it could be seen from a public place adjacent to the person's home.  When one considers that we are setting out to deal with criminals, vandalism, burglaries, car thefts, muggings, drug pushing, racketeering, riot, I think that is going a little too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has a point.  In my constituency there is an area which nobody takes care of between a youth club, a <i>cul-de-sac,</i> a block of flats and some nearby houses.  It could not be called a landscaped site.  We have had terrible difficulties with youths congregating there in the middle of the night using intoxicating substances and watching one of their number driving a stolen car up and down the canal and doing handbreak turns.  In order to solve this problem, we are going to build four or five houses on that site and on part of the adjacent flat complex, literally to get rid of the vacant site.  This is the bane of people's lives.  As that plot could not have been described as a place for public recreational purposes, the Minister's amendment does not cover it.  Deputy McDowell's amendment goes some of the way to cover it but I have reservations about his amendment as it affects sections 5, 6 and 7.  I am seeking to amend sections 6 and 7 by removing the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; and inserting the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;.  If that were done, that would cover my reservations on amendment No. 5.  I support <Col N="1785" /> the thrust of Deputy McDowell's amendment, but I have reservations about the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;, which is used in the later sections to which the amendment refers.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we have come to debate this issue so late in the debate because it could have been usefully teased out on Committee Stage.  I understand what Deputy McDowell is seeking to do and I can see the loopholes he is anticipating, although he is probably exaggerating a little when he paints a picture of the type of people for whom this Bill is clearly intended hanging on our every word to see if they can identify the loopholes in the legislation.  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that members of Deputy McDowell's profession might be trawling through the debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy McDowell who said it.  Clearly, there is a problem that needs to be addressed.  We have all come across cases of the very awkward neighbour who uses the sanctuary of his dwelling and its curtilage to hurl all kinds of insults and display all kinds of obscene signs to neighbours with whom he is having a row.  We have all come across cases of repeated noisy partying, which can cause distress in a flats complex or housing estate.  Very often, there can be very violent behaviour or behaviour approaching violence in a dwelling and people feel they are helpless to do anything about it.  However, there is a question about the extent to which the State can involve itself in what are essentially matters that are private to the individual, to a family or to a household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that Deputy McDowell who represents a party that wanted to give the State less control over the economy should suggest that the State become involved in the midnight partying of people in a private dwelling house.  The purpose of Deputy McDowell's amendment is to extend the provisions of section 5 which deals with <Col N="1786" /> shouting, singing and boisterous behaviour between midnight and 7 a.m. If a person holds a party which extends beyond midnight it is possible for a neighbour to call the gardaí and ask them to do something about it.  A distinction must be drawn in that regard.  How would such a provision be enforced in practice? Would the gardaí be faced with having to take action every time a cantankerous neighbour complaints about a person who he or she believes is having a wild party?  The problem lies at the implementation stage.  I know what Deputy McDowell wishes to address, but the matter must be teased out.</P>
    <P>It is regretable that at the end of the debate on this Bill we are discussing an interesting and important dimension to the legislation.  However, I share Deputy Costello's reservations and hope when the Minister put down an amendment that the Seanad will have an opportunity to tease out this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I intended to say has already been said. We should not forget that we are discussing the creation of criminal offences and we must make a distinction between activity which might be socially inconsiderate and criminal offences.  If I choose to play my radio after midnight in such a way that it can be heard next door, which I frequently do, that could be viewed as socially inconsiderate and perhaps I should not do that.  However, I should not be liable to a fine or imprisonment for such activity.  A distinction must be made in that regard and such distinction should apply most forcefully to activities in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Deputy McDowell's point about derelict building sites and so on. Perhaps &ldquo;public place&rdquo; should be defiend in such a way as to include those type of sites, but we must be careful not to include private homes in such definition. All parties held in Ranelagh, or indeed in my constituency, would be made up of people liable to criminal prosecution because parties are nearly always boisterous and cause annoyance to the occupants of houses nearby.  While the <Col N="1787" /> holding of such parties might be viewed as inconsiderate and most people would accept that the gardaí should be entitled to tell those involved to turn down the volume, clear off or whatever, they should not be liable to prosecution, fine or imprisonment.  We must draw that distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a number of the criticisms made in regard to the drafting of my amendment.  In principle, the fact that a person is on private property adjoining a public place does not give that person the licence to do something which, if he or she was only one or two feet away from the public place, would be an offence.  A person should not be entitled to stand in their front garden and bellow abuse at people passing merely because that person is standing in his or her front garden.</P>
      <P>People should be allowed make reasonable use of their own dwellings. If the legislation applies to dwellings, a garda could direct a person to leave his or her dwelling.  That would make a joke of the legislation.  I would stress to the Minister that she is not providing a safeguard by listing a series of places which she believes fall into the catogery of quasi public places.  She has not solved the problem if a person can stand in his or her front garden and shout insults at neighbours, play ghetto blasters and, in general, create mayhem in the area.  As it stands, the legislation would give a licence to people to behave unreasonably on their private property and create a defence to behaviour which most people would regard as anti-social.  A provision along the lines I suggested should be incorporated in the legislation which would include the words, &ldquo;reasonable use by people of a dwelling&rdquo;.  That is the correct way to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad is supposed to have some function and if it cannot come up with a solution to this problem there is no point in sending legislation from this House to the Seanad.  I acknowledged that I was unhappy about the formulation of words in my amendment.  I accept the arguments <Col N="1788" /> put forward today, especially in respect of people's dwellings, and I agree that we cannot adopt a procedure whereby the gardaí could tell people to leave their homes, but some middle ground must be explored in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tabled an amendment to remove the power of arrest for section 5 offences in respect of disorderly conduct in public places and that is welcome. Effectively, she is saying that a person cannot be arrested for disorderly conduct, but if the person ignores an instruction from the gardaí to stop, he or she can be arrested.  That is a much more sensible formulation of the law.  I am corect to the extent that the Bill will be useless if it does not address the issues I raised and, likewise, the points raised by other Deputies in respect of people's dwellings.  In so far as my amendment does not deal with the latter, I will withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a concern in regard to amendment No. 15, which relates to the insertion of, &ldquo;including a public park whether open or closed&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment 5 (b) states:</P>
      <P>any outdoor area to which at the material time members of the public have or are permitted to have access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise, and which is used for public recreational purposes,...</P>

    <P>Presumably it covers the point I made in my amendment in relation to a public park closed at night.  Does this mean that <Col N="1789" /> if I do not press my amendment the amendment already agreed covers the position and that if a criminal offence is committed and the public park is closed the gardaí will have the right to enter it to pursue the criminal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last night anybody in a public park closed at night is a trespasser and the position is covered under amendment 5 (b).  I also said that in relation to a public park which is padlocked or closed by whatever means a local authority has for securing such public parks, it would be a matter for the gardaí, local authority or the caretaker of the park to come to an arrangement in regard to obtaining the key.  This position can easily be worked out and arrangements have been made in relation to areas where the gardaí need to gain access, but they would be empowered to enter the park, to charge and remove the person causing the disturbance, which would be a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this Act applies, a court shall take into account, and may, where necessary, receive evidence or submissions concerning, any effect (whether long term or otherwise) of the offence on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and made the case that, as a general principle in criminal legislation, the impact on victims should be taken into account when courts hand down sentences. The Minister advanced two reasons she was not prepared to accept the amendment.  She said account was already taken of the victim impact assessment in the Criminal Jusice Act for cases <Col N="1790" /> of violence against a victim and that much of the legislation we are putting in place is addressing forms of victimless crime where it is not possible to easily identify an immediate victim and where the crime can be said to be more against society or the public than identifiable victims.  The concept of victimless crime needs to be further addressed.  If there were no victims of the type of crimes this legislation is attempting to address there would not have been a public demand for the legislation in the first instance.  The demand for legislation to deal with these types of public order offences has come from people who have been victims of the type of offences this legislation is seeking to address.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting of a residents' association to discuss the problems faced by residents in an estate located along the route from a local pub and adjacent to a number of bus stops.  I heard a litany of complaints about the singing and boisterous behaviour they endure after midnight, the pulling of a nail or some sharp object along the side of a motor vehicle parked on the side of the road, materials thrown into front gardens and various ways in which they have been victims of the type of offences we are discussing here.  We must accept they are victims.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of this legislation from the civil liberties perspective is that the offences created in it are subjective and there is validity in that criticism. Regarding the type of offences being created, the gardaí and the courts will be called on to exercise judgement as to whether an offence has been committed. Presumably in some cases the gardaí will have received a complaint from a member of the public, for example, a person who complains about a group of people standing at the corner of a street creating a racket and disturbing a family's sleep.  The gardaí are called and they exercise their judgement as to whether to move those people on.  If the case ends up in court the question must be raised as to how the court will assess if an offence was committed in the absence of hearing from the victim and, if it was, the <Col N="1791" /> court will have to determine how serious it is before imposing sentence.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ways in which offences in this legislation are phrased, it appears that account must be taken of the impact of the crime on the victim and, apart from that information being used to impose a severe sentence where it is warranted, it will also enable the court to form a judgment about the seriousness of the offence.  Section 5 refers to singing and boisterous conduct which would give reasonable cause for annoyance, but how can such conduct be assessed unless the people to whom the annoyance was caused are heard?  Sections 6 and 7 refer to threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene behaviour.  They are subjective terms, how will a judge assess such behaviour without hearing from the victims? Section 8 refers to loitering and the reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons; presumably one would have to hear from the people whose safety was feared for in those circumstances.  Section 9 refers to a person wilfully preventing or interrupting the free passage of another person and again one would have to hear from the victim in that case.  Section 13 refers to trespass on a dwelling which is likely to cause fear to another person and, unless one hears from the other person, and the extent to which the fear is caused, how can one form a judgment as to whether an offence was committed and, if it was, its seriousness.  The Bill continues in those terms.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general principle of the desirability of having the impact on victims taken into account when a judge makes a judgment, is particularly important in this legislation where many of the offences are or a subjective nature and to judge if an offence was committed, its seriousness and the appropriate sentence to impose, to hear from the victim to assess the extent of the impact on the victim.  A distinction will have to be drawn between cases where people may be singing and behaving boisterously on a street and a garda being over-enthusiastic in enforcing this legislation when nobody on that street was offended by <Col N="1792" /> the behaviour and cases where annoyance has been caused and people have been insulted and intimidated.  The impact on victims has often been spoken about in cases where people have sought increases in sentences.  In more severe cases the impact on victims should be taken into account in handing down sentences. The concept must also be taken into account from another viewpoint. Much concern has been expressed that this legislation may be abused, over-used in that some gardaí may decide to exercise their authority in regard to it.  In everyone's interest account of the impact on victims must be built into the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment is to be commended, although I am not sure that his wording covers my reservations in this area.  The amendment has given us an opportunity to debate the principle of what he is proposing.</P>
      <P>Under our criminal justice system the victim is no more than a witness in the court.  In the event that the gardaí apprehend a criminal, the victim of the crime will receive a summons similar to that received by the accused to appear in court and his status will be no more than that of a witness.  Some witnesses feel intimidated by our unsatisfactory court system but they are compelled to be in court at their own expense.  The offence is against the victim and also against the State in that it is an offence against the general public.  The victim must be brought to centre stage and should be considered as more than a witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to reform our penalty system which, for instance, imposes penalties of three months or six months in prison or in default a fine of £500 or £1,000 or both. We should do everything possible to unclog the overcrowded prison system and ensure that there are prison places for those who need to be contained. People should not be committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  We should ensure that fines are collected so that the 12 per cent of all committals for non-payment of fines is reduced.  When <Col N="1793" /> imposing a fine the judge should be empowered to allocate half of it or more as compensation to the victim of the crime, as he judges appropriate.  At the moment the victim is ignored.  The judge might ask the accused if he has made any attempt at restitution and he may or may not take that into consideration.  Notwithstanding any compensation or restitution that might have been made, the judge should be empowered to allocate part or all of the fine to the victim to compensate him for perhaps foregoing a holiday or a day's work to appear in the court.</P>
    <P>I once thought that victim support was not central to the issue but I have listened to the case made by the victim support group and I now feel strongly that victim support is central to the remedy for our problems.  If somebody knows that he will have to compensate for damage to property and will not simply get away with a sentence which does not reflect the cost of the damage, he may think twice about causing the damage.  It is time to start providing for compensation to the victim in our laws.  I support the general thrust of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too feel that this amendment has merit and the Minister should look at it closely.  The wording may not be satisfactory but the sentiments should be taken on board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that she will pursue the collection of fines on a more relevant basis so that large numbers of people will not go to prison for non-payment.  As recently as yesterday a person who owed three small fines amounting to approximately £50 ended up in prison even though the person was willing to pay the fines to the warrant officer on a gradual basis.  It would be no harm if a directive was sent out to all the warrant officers so that we could have a more orderly collection of fines and ensure that fewer people go to prison for non-payment of fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of this amendment is that it highlights the fact that there is no such thing as a victimless crime.  All crimes have some victims either corporate <Col N="1794" /> victims or individual victims.  In recent years we have not passed any legislation so community-based as this legislation. This Bill deals with the impact of certain types of behaviour on the general public, for instance intoxication, disorderly behaviour, gangs roaming the streets and insulting behaviour.  Deputy Gilmore outlined cases where the victim comes into direct contact with the offender.  We must ensure that the penalty fits the crime.  If we bring the victim to the fore in terms of the effect of certain behaviour on the victim, we will be in a better position to assess the type of penalty we should impose.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Mitchell that victims who have suffered have been left in isolation.  Victims are the people who are dealt with as a statistic in the whole procedure and they have not been encouraged to believe that the wrong committed against them is being put right.  If the victim was allowed to make a submission so that we could assess the effect of the offensive behaviour on him or her we would be going a long way towards satisfying them that their views are taken into consideration in deciding on the appropriate penalty.  This would be of benefit not only to the victim but also to the community.</P>
    <P>It is one of my old hobby horses that we have only seen fit to specify two penalties in criminal legislation, namely, a fine or prison sentence.  This is inadequate in guiding judges on how to decide on the appropriate penalty to be imposed.  A wider range of penalties is provided for in this legislation.  If the victim was brought into the picture the need to experiment and avail of the wider range of penalties in this legislation would become clearer to the judge.  For example, if young people terrorise a neighbourhood by painting graffiti and insulting remarks on walls it would be appropriate to ask them to remove this material.  If young people desecrate a public park by damaging trees or flower beds our typical response should be to ask them to put the damage right.  Therefore, if a person misbehaves they could be asked to do some community work <Col N="1795" /> under the community service order scheme.  They could also be asked, where it is considered appropriate and based on a person's ability to pay, to pay a fine which could go towards making good the damage caused.  They could further be asked to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>There is a need to bring the victim in out of the cold as it were &mdash; they are neglected at present &mdash; and consider appropriate penalties for the courts to hand down.  In this regard &mdash; Deputy Gilmore deals with this aspect in the next amendment &mdash; we should get away from the notion that people should be sent to prison having regard to the fact that our prisons are over-crowded, an enormous amount of money is being spent on them and the return is poor.  We should consider ways of making good the damage caused in a community setting.  The Minister should consider the proposal in this amendment on its merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attracted by what Deputy Gilmore said in support of his amendment.  I note that he deals with the question of compensation in a subsequent amendment.  I would like to make a number of points on this issue. First, it is easy to talk about the issue of victim support but it is much more difficult to do anything substantial about it. It is not as if judges have not done anything for victims over the years; long before provision was made for compensation orders in the Statute Book many judges postponed sentence until such time as the injured party had been compensated.  This has been applied in a variety of cases, including those involving theft, burglary, sexual assault and other assaults.  For many years the Judiciary have tried to avoid imposing a term of imprisonment and extract compensation for needy victims of crime.  It is not as if they have always said that they have no choice; they have used their powers creatively to suspend sentences and extract moneys from offenders.  Anybody who has attended the courts will have seen that usually this was their first instinct in most cases where there was an <Col N="1796" /> obvious and identifiable victim of crime. In deciding on the penalty to be imposed they always looked to see what could be done to make up for the crime committed against the victim.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties, where it was considered desirable that compensation should be paid and was offered by the accused person, was that the judge also had to say to himself that the offender should be punished publicly.  This could not be done under the suspended sentence mechanism; one could not send a person to jail and at the same time compensate the victim.  Frequently, the judge had to make a hard choice, in the absence of the power to order a person to pay compensation in a case involving violence, between an attractive offer made by the accused with a view to avoiding a prison sentence and the interests of the community to ensure that a person could not buy their way out of prison if they maimed another person or destroyed their property.</P>
      <P>This is not a new issue and it deserves some reflection on the part of this House. While this amendment has its merits the Minister would be better advised to introduce a comprehensive statute dealing with the powers of the courts in criminal cases, as has been done in Britain.  While Britain may not be in every respect the ideal model to follow &mdash; they got into terrible trouble recently on the question of sentencing policy when Parliament attempted to interfere and stipulate when sentences should be handed down and what fines should be imposed &mdash; nonetheless the time has come for the Minister's Department to bring before the House a modern statute dealing with sentencing policy which would abolish the difference between penal servitude and imprisonment and set out on a statutory basis prison sentences and remission, compensation orders, community service orders, the probation system and a variety of other matters which this House has never addressed sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many methods of dealing with crime other than by handing down suspended sentences or issuing <Col N="1797" /> community service orders.  I note that in some American jurisdictions people are forced in certain circumstances to publish at their own expense an apology in a newspaper when they behave in a vandalistic way.  Judges in America may say that a person should place an advertisement in a newspaper which should include their photograph apologising to the community.  That is one creative way of bringing home to a person that they will not get away with it and escape the public opprobrium that they deserve for the want of an adequate remedy if they mutilate a phone box.</P>
    <P>What we need is a Bill in which the powers of the court in criminal cases are outlined.  The Minister's Department could put such a Bill together easily because most of the component parts are identifiable and there are precedents internationally.  The problem is that if we include these provisions in respect of the offences that are being created in the Bill people will begin to wonder why it is, if a person behaves in an outrageous manner and breaches the provisions of this Bill that compensation will be payable and it is not payable in respect of equally outrageous offences not covered by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make on the question of victim support &mdash; this is directed at the Minister in particular &mdash; is that while the Minister has made an issue out of this matter it should be stated repeatedly in this House that her Department is not paying victims what they are awarded by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I recently had a case involving a man who was badly assaulted in circumstances that would come under this Act.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal awarded him £10,000 for loss of earnings and the cost of medical treatment. He was a man of modest means with a modest job and he was told, after a long delay of about two and a half years, that he would be given an award, but at the bottom of the letter telling him that he was being awarded his £10,000 was a statement that there were not sufficient funds to pay him immediately, and that <Col N="1798" /> he could wait 30 months at least before he could expect to see the money awarded to him.  I appreciate the Minister's gesture in setting aside a room in the Four Courts for victim support.  However, a person in those circumstances does not need a room in the Four Courts but needs the State to pay the amount awarded him.</P>
    <P>As a society we are completely irrational in the way we compensate people for things that befall them.  If I walk across Kildare Street and am knocked down by an uninsured driver, the State has in place a complex system throught the MIB to compensate me, even though there is no policy of insurance, because it is thought that, in those circumstances, I am a deserving case.  If, on the other hand, a 75 year old woman loses an eye and has a paralysed arm as a result of an assault but cannot show out of pocket expenses because she is entitled to free hospitalisation, she gets nothing.  The criminal injuries compensation scheme does not apply to her, although it will compensate a younger man for being out of work for three or six months and will compensate people who are not entitled to free hospitalisation for the cost of their hospitalisation and medical treatment.  It will also compensate people who have to undergo physiotherapy etc. as a result of a relatively minor assault.  However, a 75 year old woman who loses an eye and has a paralysed arm gets nothing.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about compensating victims of crime perhaps we should, as a Legislature, take another look at the decisions we are making.  Why is it that victims of minor car crashes are handed significant sums of money while the woman in the example I gave is entitled to nothing?</P>
    <P>It is important not to get carried away by the proposal to take victims into account.  A trial should still remain a trial and should not be turned into a kind of Santa Claus operation whereby the judge feels good as a result of compensating all sorts of people rather than conducting a case on the basis of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  Knowing some members of the Judiciary, I know there is a danger <Col N="1799" /> that if they feel they can do people a favour by compensating them they will feel good themselves, provided the person is deserving.  There is a danger that the issue of the guilt of the accused is beyond reasonable doubt may be lost sight of in the rush to compensate a worthy person.</P>
    <P>Let us not cod ourselves on another matter.  The reason there was a Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which paid pain and suffering compensation is that most of the perpetrators of criminal offences are in no position to compensate anybody.  If one orders a young man who is on the dole to pay £200 to somebody for vandalising his car, the cost of getting it from him over a number of weeks would make it not worthwhile.  There is no point in trying to get money from a young man standing outside a labour exchange.  There is no point in the judge or court officials spending time trying to get blood from a stone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>They could be asked to pay it into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even asking such people to pay the money into court is more easily said than done.  If they do not pay, are we to send people to their houses?  Are we to involve civil servants in keeping accounts of what they have paid on foot of orders, producing records on some ledger in the District Court Office to say that he did pay it one week but forgot to pay another week and then listen to excuses about extra expenses because it was Christmas etc?  These things wear down all these schemes.  In compensating people for crimes committed against them, we must remember that the average person who breaks into houses is a drug addict with nothing.  The average person who beats up somebody on Dún Laoghaire pier or anywhere else has no assets to compensate anybody.  To say that we are going to get the person who inflicted the injuries on the 75 year old woman to compensate her may sound great in theory but it will not happen in practice.  If we really want to compensate <Col N="1800" /> victims of crime the only way we can surely do it on a fair basis is out of the public purse.  Is it fair that the person who suffers more damage at the hands of someone who is penniless ends up with less money than the person who suffers less damage at the hands of a person who can compensate him or her?</P>
      <P>I do not like throwing cold water on ideas but if we are serious about compensating victims of crime, looking to the perpetrator is, at the very best, a very inadequate means of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment certainly needs further consideration and I would ask the Minister to have another look at it before it goes to the Seanad. We must be very careful about putting the onus on the victim to provide evidence of the effect a particular crime has had on him or her.  If a person's car is burned out or damaged on the roadway, that could have certain effects on a victim.  He may not be able to travel to work, take his children to school etc. How does one estimate the effects of an assault on a victim?  I am concerned about putting the onus on the victim to provide such evidence.</P>
      <P>Victim support was mentioned.  I was pleased to attend a meeting in Cork last week at which ten members of the community received certificates, having completed courses on victim support.  I was pleased to hear Mr. Derek Nally, former general secretary of the Garda Association, pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, on the manner in which she is dealing with crime.  There is widespread concern in the community at the inconsistency of sentencing.  I am not for automatically sending people to prison every time they commit an offence.  Other alternatives, such as community service orders, are being tried and these alternatives should be further examined.  Uppermost in our minds must be the victim of crime.  Many feel that they are not getting the support they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the morning of 20 July a specific agreement was reached on a figure of £7.84 billion in 1993 prices as Ireland's allocation of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for the years 1993 to 1999 between President Delors acting on behalf of the European Commission and the Tánaiste acting on behalf of the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>I will recall for the House the events which led up to the agreement of 20 July. Following the conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council, the European Commission prepared a draft framework regulation as the key legislative instrument for the implementation of the 1993-99 Structural Fund decisions, and for that reason requiring unanimous agreement of member states for adoption.  That draft regulation was considered by the General Affairs Council on 2 and 3 July.  At that meeting Ireland did not agree to the adoption of the regulation.  The reason for withholding agreement was clearly set down in a statement prepared jointly with the European Commission and in direct consultation with the Belgian Presidency which issued on 9 July.  I quote:</P>
      <P>When the Council established its common position on the six regulations on 2/3 July, the Irish Government made it abundantly clear that its agreement on a final decission would depend on satisfactory assurances as to an equitable outcome on the question of allocation of resources.</P>
      <P>The reservation it entered on the framework regulation has to be seen in this context.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government will not agree, in the Council's second reading, the overall package of the six regulations without such assurances.</P>
      <P>Since last Saturday a number of contacts have taken place both with the Commission and with the Presidency.</P>
      <P>These contacts have been helpful but need to be continued in order to reach a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While maintaining its overall reservation <Col N="1802" /> in connection with the allocation of financial resources, the Irish Government &mdash; having obtained assurances from both Presidency and Commission that the text of the six regulations in no way prejudges this fundamental issue &mdash; does not object to proceeding to the second reading of Parliament on the common position on the six regulations as transmitted to Parliament.</P>
    <P>It reiterates, however, that its final agreement to the formal adoption by the Council of these regulations will be subject to the satisfactory outcome being sought in continuing contacts.</P>
    <P>There was then no doubt on the part of the European Commission, or on the part of other member states, of the Irish Government's determination to obtain assurances on an equitable share of EC Structural Funds and of the European Commission's acceptance that the determination was legitimate and could be met.</P>
    <P>The draft framework regulation was next considered by the General Affairs Council on 19 and 20 July.  In the run up to, and on the margin of, that Council direct contact took place between the President of the Commission and his officials and the Tánaiste and Irish officials.  As a result, a specific agreement was reached on a figure for Ireland's allocation of 9.35 billion ECU at 1992 prices which equals IR£7.84 billion in 1993 prices, of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for 1993 to 1999.  The same form of agreement was reached with a number of other member states and the fact that agreements were being reached by the President was clearly known to, and accepted as a legitimate procedure on the night by the General Affairs Council members and the Belgian Presidency in particular.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's belief that the agreement reached will be honoured, our determination to act, in particular, as normal, through the current Belgian Presidency to have our agreement honoured and our wish to have the full support of the House on a matter of <Col N="1803" /> national importance.  If efforts are being made in Europe to undermine the Irish agreement it is extraordinary that they would find support in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has two separate jobs to do in this very brief debate and it is important to do both of them.  The first is to ensure we get the maximum amount of money for Ireland and that everything said in the debate strengthens the case for the money.  The second and less palatable job we have to do is to come to a judgment as to whether the Ministers who have been representing us have done their job competently. Both jobs must be done without one damaging the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of getting the maximum amount of money for Ireland, the Taoiseach can be sure he has the support of my party.  There is eminent justification for the full, in current day equivalence, £9.2 billion, which the Taoiseach said he was getting before the Maastricht referendum. It is justified by the fact that Ireland will be the only island nation in Europe; on the basis that we have the highest rate of dependency and the maximum number of people who have no jobs depending on those who have jobs.  If a GATT deal goes through Ireland will suffer more than any other European country and the number of job losses will be immense as a recent EC study has shown that peripheral nations <Col N="1804" /> suffer more from economic and monetary union than those near the centre.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case for extra money.  The Taoiseach should have tabled a motion in this House outlining the case he sought to make in this debate so that it could be agreed by the House. He would have been wise to have such a motion agreed here.  Even in the absence of such a motion the Taoiseach should this afternoon, in the company of the Tánaiste, go to Brussels to meet President Delors to discuss this matter before any decisions are taken at the Commission meeting tomorrow.  Only if the Taoiseach does that will he show he has the requisite seriousness in regard to getting this money for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second function the Dáil must perform relating to the competence of Ministers in this matter, two questions remain unanswered.  If the Government enters into agreements of such importance why does it not get those agreements in writing signed by the people who made them?  In even the most minor matter such as the text of a double taxation agreement between Ireland and Malaysia, the exact agreement is written in reams of paper even though in practice the amount of money involved may be minor.  Why, in a matter of huge moment in Edinburgh, did the Taoiseach not get agreement in writing to what he claimed he was getting at that time &mdash; £8 billion over seven years?</P>
    <P>Before the Maastricht Treaty was agreed by the people the Taoiseach said we would get £6 billion over five years. Taking into account that the planned period is now seven years and that the pound has been devalued by 10 per cent, what the Taoiseach was telling the Irish people before the Maastricht referendum was that we would get the equivalent, over seven years, of £9.2 billion.  We are not getting that amount and the Taoiseach's credibility in terms of what he said before the Maastricht Referendum has been devalued as a result.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons Members of the Dáil were so upset this morning is that, unfortunately, the Taoiseach does not have very high credibility in matters of <Col N="1805" /> this nature.  In the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil on 16 December after the Edinburgh Summit, he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, on 6 May last in this House, accused me of making wild promises and of presenting the £6 billion as a bribe from the European fairy godmother.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>My strategy and negotiating tactics have been vindicated.  The agreement now reached ensures &mdash; and I say this with complete confidence &mdash; that Ireland will obtain in excess of £8 billion over seven years.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that statement the Irish pound was devalued.  The Taoiseach was saying that in present money terms we would get £8.8 billion.  He said he had an agreement to that effect but it was not in writing.  Why was that agreement not in writing and who was the agreement with? Why is it that even last week the Taoiseach said we would get £8 billion, and not the £8.8 billion promised?  There is a question as to why the Government seems to think it can say one thing to the electorate at home and say a different thing to the people with whom it is negotiating in Brussels?  Why does the Government delude itself that one will not find out what has been said to the other?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the amount referred to by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement in July of this year, which of course was considerably less in terms of the amount promised than the amount referred to by the Taoiseach after the Edinburgh Summit.  The Tánaiste said that instead of £8.8 billion in current money, we would get £7.8 billion in current money. One billion pounds was lost between the Taoiseach's statement after the Edinburgh Summit and the Tánaiste's statement after the meeting last July.  After the meeting last July, the Tánaiste said &ldquo;there is certainty in relation to the figures&rdquo;. Furthermore he said that he was &ldquo;100 per cent satisfied that the figures would not unravel&rdquo;.  There was a report <Col N="1806" /> this morning on AERTEL that the European Commission is to discuss proposals today which could reduce Ireland's £7.8 billion share of Structural Funds by several hundred million pounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Tánaiste did not get an agreement in writing in regard to what he said was an agreement which would not unravel.  If he was 100 per cent satisfied that the figures would not unravel, then presumably the people with whom he was dealing were also 100 per cent satisfied that they would not unravel.  If both were 100 per cent satisfied, why could they not agree to put the figures in writing?  Why did the Tánaiste fall into the same trap the Taoiseach had fallen into by relying on an oral agreement when he could have had an agreement in writing?  Did the Tánaiste not learn from the problems with which the Taoiseach was faced after the Edinburgh Summit where he had relied on an oral agreement rather than an agreement in writing?  Why did the Tánaiste not insist on getting an agreement in writing?</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the difference we are talking about here is no minor matter of arithmetic; we are talking about real money.  There is a gap between the amount referred to by the Taoiseach before the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; £6 billion over five years, translated to approximately £9.2 billion over seven years, taking into account devaluation&mdash; and the figure referred to this morning by European sources of a mere £7.3 billion. That is a very big difference of more than £2 billion.  I wish to illustrate the enormity of this difference.  The difference between the amount the Taoiseach said we would get before the Maastricht Treaty and the amount European sources in Brussels have said today we will actually get is £570 for every person in this county or £6,600 for every unemployed person.  That is what is at stake.  That is the amount which will have been progressively whittled away since the original statements made by the Taoiseach before Maastricht, his revised statement after the Edinburgh Summit, the further revision by the Tánaiste after the July <Col N="1807" /> meeting and the possible further revision tomorrow after the Commission meeting.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford this progressive revision downwards of our entitlements in this matter.  We have to question the competence of Ministers who could allow this to happen without ensuring that they got an agreement in writing.  It is a cliché to say that an oral agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.  A person in their first year in business after leaving school will tell you to get an agreement in writing if you want to be sure.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste seems to realise that it is common prudence to &ldquo;get it in writing&rdquo; before they come home or say in the media &ldquo;the money is in the bag; I am 100 per cent satisfied about the figures and this deal will not unravel&rdquo;, all statements made either by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste who subsequently had their words contradicted.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question.  I am being as restrained as possible in view of the fact that a meeting is to take place tomorrow.  When the Government supplied this document last Friday week to the European Commission &mdash; I presume that the Minister for Finance went to Brussels with this document &mdash; did it ask whether it was definite and agreed, without any question of being reopened, that we would get £7.8 billion?  Did the Minister for Finance ask if there was any doubt in the mind of Commissioner Millan, who is responsible for the Structural Funds, that we would get the money?  If he did not ask that question, why did he not ask it?  Why did he allow the Taoiseach to come in here and say that he had approximately £8 billion when it would appear from reports from Brussels that some people there were not as &ldquo;100 per cent satisfied&rdquo; as the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs about this matter?  Not everyone had the same understanding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance who went to Brussels previously should have established whether this document was a work of fact or a work of fiction before the document was published and before the necessity of debating it in this House.  It <Col N="1808" /> seems that the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach have been shown throughout this episode to be at best naive in their approach to international relations.  They did not take the elementary steps of prudence which even the most lowly and recently qualified solicitor would advise them to take, namely, if you are getting an agreement get it in writing.  I am sure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in his capacity as a solicitor, would have advised the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, if they were willing to listen to him, that they should get the agreement in writing.  Why did they not get the agreement in writing and why did we debate a plan which contained figures which were not cast in bronze?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is not so much about figures because even if it is £7.3 billion it is still a substantial amount of money.  It is more than the total Marshall aid package used to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.  Rather this debate is about political accountability and credibility and the judgment of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the two most senior members of the Government.  I want to ask the Taoiseach what exactly was agreed at the Edinburgh Summit.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say exactly what was agreed at Edinburgh?  One newspaper headline read &ldquo;Albert lands £8 billion bonanza&rdquo;.  On 13 December the Taoiseach said that this was his &ldquo;single greatest achievement&rdquo;, the biggest single financial package for Ireland. Today the Taoiseach told us that in an agreement with the Commission, the Belgian Presidency and Ireland on 9 July:</P>
      <P>...the Council established its common position on the six regulations on 2/3 July [these were the regulations to put the Edinburgh agreement into effect] the Irish Government made it abundantly clear that its agreement on a final decision would depend on satisfactory assurances as to an equitable outcome on the question of allocation of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> It went on to say:</P>
    <P>[The Irish Government] reiterates, however, that its final agreement to the formal adoption by the Council of these regulations will be subject to the satisfactory outcome being sought in continuing contacts.</P>
    <P>There was no agreement in Edinburgh and the 9 July minute, which we now have from the Taoiseach, firmly indicates that nothing was agreed in Edinburgh and the Tánaiste was dispatched to do a sand bagging job as the possibility of an agreement was slipping.  At 5 a.m. in the corner of the bar on the 14th floor outside the Council of Ministers Room, an agreement was made and we are told there is no minute of that meeting.</P>
    <P>The implied accusation that there has been bad faith on the part of our Community partners is very serious.  If, in the next few days, it turns out to be the case that what the Taoiseach and Tanaiste said is not true, it will be a very serious matter for both of them.  To accuse the President of the Commission &mdash; implied accusations were made here earlier this morning and again in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; is a very serious matter for this country. The President of the Commission has been a good friend to Ireland and I hope the Taoiseach will disassociate himself from the pigeon English remarks of one of his MEP's.  As far as I can see we should be talking about pigeon arithmetic. The remarks of the MEP, Mr. Lane, are a disgrace and will do nothing to help the cause of this country tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>I wish to tell the Taoiseach, and the Government, that when called upon to wear the Irish jersey, as the Taoiseach did this morning, me or my party will not be found lacking.  This is not about what we would like to see in terms of funding, it is about judgment, credibility and accountability.  For the past number of months not only have all the Government Ministers, Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, and many other Ministers of State but every senior civil servant in Government departments have been engaged in drafting a plan on a false <Col N="1810" /> premise and that strikes at the heart of Government, the way we do business and the Government process that is in operation.  Will we withdraw the plan if the figure is not correct?  How will we tailor the plan?  What will be taken out? Was it premature of the Government to publish the plan two weeks ago?  Was the debate last week a false debate?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asks for our support but there is no motion before us that we can support.  I wonder why he has refused to table a motion telling us the exact position.  The Government need not fear, it has a 35 seat majority.  Why should it be concerned about tabling a motion? In my experience minority Governments are concerned about motions because they can be defeated but Governments with the unprecedented majority of this Government should have no fear about tabling a motion.  The reason a motion will not be tabled is because there is no agreement other than nods and winks, a handshake agreement described more graphically by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning.  I find it extraordinary that following the 20 July agreement no minute was drawn up and nothing was sent in writing to the President of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Some time ago in this House members of the Government were highly critical of the Aer Lingus management for losing £1 million per week.  Since December last, when we were told that we had £8 billion, to quote the Taoiseach, &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;&mdash; with devaluation that should be at least £8.4 billion &mdash; we have lost £25 million per week.  What would the Taoiseach feel about that type of management by anybody outside this House?</P>
    <P>At best the Government has suffered from political self delusion and at worst it must be accused of not just misleading this House but misleading this country.  I wish to tell the Taoiseach that our job is to be supportive but, more importantly, in the context of a Government with such a huge majority, we must ensure that the Government is accountable, through this House, to the people who have elected it.  I could not give the kind of support which the Taoiseach is seeking because <Col N="1811" /> it is not support that is being sought on the basis of any concrete facts.  Rather, we are being asked to put our faith and trust in something which I cannot support.</P>
    <P>I heard the President of the Commission on the radio this morning.  I do not like using words such as &ldquo;lies&rdquo; but that is the word he used.  He is a man with an outstanding reputation throughout the Community.  I do not think he would lightly use a word such as &ldquo;lies&rdquo; when the figure of £7.8 billion was put to him.  This Government has not just put itself in a difficult position at home, it has brought the country into enormous political disrepute in Europe.  We have shamed the name of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The matter we are discussing is one of the most important to have come before this House in recent years.  We are dealing not just with sums of money on a balance sheet but with the livelihood of our people and with the hopes of thousands of the unemployed that they might find jobs.</P>
      <P>It is very clear that the Irish people have been seriously misled about the extent of the funding which will be made available to fund the National Development Plan.  We have been the victims of a financial three card trick: the money we thought we had secured, the money we were told had been secured by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, is just not there and every attempt by the Taoiseach in this House to wrap the green flag around himself will not make that money appear.</P>

      <P>The Government has been guilty of either an enormous confidence trick or unprecedented incompetence.  It either deliberately misled the people of this country and the Dáil as to what had been agreed, or it misunderstood what had been agreed.  It is either incompetent or it deliberately misled us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> It is not as if it was not warned about the dangers of the strategy it was adopting. When it was claimed by Deputy Reynolds, following the famous all-night meeting in July, that we had secured £7.8 billion, the Democratic Left spokesperson on European Affairs, Des Geraghty, pointed out that the Government was relying on verbal bilateral assurances from Jacques Delors and that our claim to the full amount had been built on shifting sands.  That clearly now is the case.</P>
    <P>When it was pointed out to the Government that there simply was not sufficient money in the current Euopean Community budget to fund all the promises that had been made, it ridiculed the idea and accused Democratic Left of sour grapes.  Yet the evidence is now clearly before us.</P>
    <P>It will be simply incomprehensible to the majority of people that the final details of a package of such enormous consequence for the future economic development of this country should be based on a wink and a nod and a late night verbal assurance from Jacques Delors in a corridor in Brussels.  It might be possible that this could be acceptable in a Ballinasloe horse fair but it is not acceptable for the running of the business of this House.</P>
    <P>We also pointed out that while Jacques Delors was a powerful man in the European Community there was considerable doubt about his capacity to deliver, that what would be crucial was not the views of Jacques Delors but the attitude of the Commission as a whole.  There is now even a major doubt about the amount which was the subject of that verbal agreement on that part of Monsieur Delors.  Many people, including I am sure the Taoiseach, will have heard Mr. Tommy Gorman this morning, in his interview with Jacques Delors, when Jacques Delors said that the agreement was for IR£7.3 billion.</P>

      <P>Clearly, the Government is now gripped by political panic as its promises lie in tatters.  It is now calling on the Opposition to rally around and support it, which is asking a lot, considering the contemptuous way it treated this House in the course of the negotiations for the funds and in the preparation of the National Development Plan.  The House was totally excluded from the process.  At no stage did the Government come to the House to seek approval of its strategy.  Information was kept to a minimum and no motion was put before the House.  The most offered was a series of fairly meaningless opportunities to make statements. Even today, rather than putting a motion before the House clearly setting out its strategy, the Government has run for the cover of statements.</P>
      <P>Democratic Left accepts no responsibility for the shambles created by this Government.  We will be insisting that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Monsieur Jacques Delors deliver on the promises they made.  The Government should demand a clear, unequivocal statement from the Commission as to our agreed share.  If the EC budget is insufficient to fulfil the promises made then that budget must be increased or cutbacks effected in other areas.  Indeed, to introduce reality to this discussion, I might point out that expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy this year is running ahead of budget projections by as much as 1.5 billion ECUs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to remind the House, even at this late stage, that the £7.8 billion, in itself, did not meet the promises made in the course of the Maastricht <Col N="1815" /> Treaty campaign, of a doubling of Structural Funds.  In fact, properly calculated, it amounts to something of the order of £2 billion to £3 billion less than promised by the Taoiseach in the course of that campaign.</P>
    <P>People have been used as political pawns, especially by the parties in Government, in that the electorate's needs and interests took second place to the desire of Fianna Fáil to remain in power and of the Labour Party to get into power.</P>

Indeed, it reflects no credit on the Opposition Deputies who made it, by innuendo <Col N="1816" /> and inference, in this House and indeed outside it.</P>

Accordingly, I have every confidence that the agreement will be honoured in full.  As a consequence, I have total confidence that the National Development Plan we have submitted will be honoured.  It is astonishing that Opposition Deputies in this House, rather than supporting the full implementation of that plan, have chosen to play politics.</P>

      <P>Early in the morning of 20 July last, following intensive discussion and negotiation between the delegation that I led and some of the most senior officials in Europe, I met President Delors in the company of several of his officials and several of mine.  We agreed that, granted the quality of Ireland's National Development Plan and the projects we would put forward, in the ultimate Ireland would receive 9.35 billion ECU in 1992 prices from the new round of Structural Funds, to cover the period 1993 to 1999.  We understood, as did the Commission, that ultimately the Commission would meet formally to agree indicative figures that would be allocated as targets for each of the countries affected by the next round.  In all likelihood those indicative figures would be expressed in ranges &mdash; or what the Commission call &ldquo;fourchettes&rdquo;&mdash; that is to say, a minimum and a maximum that could be achieved, depending on the quality of the plan put forward and the efficiency of member states in implementing their plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  I attended the first Council of Europe Summit meeting in Vienna on 8-9 October 1993, accompanied by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting embraced two main themes: (1) the role of the Council of Europe in the new Europe &mdash; political and institutional aspects; and (2) action relating to the strengthening of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> The summit adopted the Vienna Declaration and I have had the Declaration laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas with the texts of the two interventions I made at the meeting.  Against the background of a message received from President Boris Yeltsin, the summit also adopted a separate Declaration on Russia; I have also had copies of these documents laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>I availed of the opportunity presented by the presence in Vienna of so many Heads of State and Government to hold bilateral discussions in the wings of the summit meeting with President Havel of the Czech Republic and with the Heads of Government of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Slovenia and Estonia.  My discussions with EC Heads of Government focused particularly on the Special European Council to be held on 29 October.  While this is the subject of separate questions, I would like to mention here that on the basis of my contacts in Vienna, I am confident that the Special European Council is likely to confirm the agreement reached in Lisbon and reiterated in Copenhagen that the enlargement of the Community now being negotiated can take place on the basis of the existing institutional arrangements in the Community.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of regular Council of Europe summits is concerned, there is no doubt that the Vienna Summit provided the opportunity for giving fresh impetus to the Council of Europe in meeting the new challenges facing Europe.  The Vienna Declaration adopted by the summit underlined the Council of Europe's resolve to make full use of the political forum provided by the existing Council of Ministers and Parliamentary Assembly to promote the strengthening of democratic security in Europe.  The question of regular summits can be kept under review in the light of progress in implementing the Declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach <Col N="1824" /> concur with the view of President Mitterrand, who convened this summit, that the Council of Europe could provide the basis for an all European Confederation of States?  If so, will he indicate how that relates to the European Community?  I understand from press reports that in the course of his address to the summit he supported the application by Russia for membership of the Council of Europe.  Will he indicate to the House the basis on which he supports such an application and if it will be predicated on the requirement for democratic elections for a parliament with powers distinct from a Seanad type assembly in Russia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Europe is clearly a vehicle that can be used successfully to admit members from central and eastern Europe.  We are all aware that many of these countries have submitted applications for membership of the European Community and, while they would be given associate status in the early stages, when they progress to developing market economies and upholding democracy and other areas attaching to that they would then become a full member of the European Community.</P>
      <P>I do not see the Council of Europe replacing the European Community but I see opportunities for the Community to enlarge its membership in the future.  As we know there are four applicant countries and many applicants in central and eastern Europe are seeking full membership of the Community.  In the meantime the Council of Europe is a good forum, for those countries which are not part of the Council, to join.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We were able to reach agreement on two issues even with the very large membership.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure given at the conference was 1,500 but we will not argue about that.  Whatever the figure, there is a huge backlog and quite clearly the streamlining of the institutions to tackle it is necessary.  Consequently, the fusion of the court of Human Rights and the Commission is a step in the right direction as it will be able to tackle them. I hope it accepts the view of Ireland in the final arrangement that members should give two individuals in perpetuity and not try to put obstacles in their way every five years or the length of the review period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

Does he consider the proposal of President Boris Yeltsin to have elections to a body which, effectively, would have no parliamentary powers and which would enable him to continue to rule by decree would satisfy the rules of the Council of Europe?</P>

In particular that declaration refers to confidence building measures to increase tolerance.  What specific measures does the Taoiseach have in mind to develop the application of that declaration, particularly in the light of relations between both communities in Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspects of the declaration in relation to minorities were focused primarily on the problems in central and eastern Europe and in bringing forward a framework convention.  That should be speedily drafted specifying the principles which the contracting states commit themselves to to ensure the protection of national minorities.  I referred to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I refer the Deputy to the existence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which is of course a bilateral Treaty which has considerable relevance in this domain as has the Government's recognition that a just <Col N="1827" /> and lasting peace must be based on mutual recognition and protection of the rights and identities of both Unionists and Nationalists.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is our framework in this regard and the other covention framework will be directed primarily at central and eastern European states.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, briefed the Tánaiste and myself on 7 October with regard to the position reached in his discussions with the leader of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of the Government's highest political priority to establish a basis for a just and lasting peace and a permanent cessation of all violence, the Tánaiste and I undertook to evaluate carefully the <Col N="1828" /> position conveyed to us in consultation with our Government colleagues.  With a view to ensuring that this process can make a very important contribution towards building a consensus for peace, the Government is taking full account of it and is deciding how best to continue our efforts in discussions with the British Government for the achievement of the objective of peace on this island.  As I said in Bodenstown on Sunday, the two Governments must work together to reach a common understanding in their own terms on a framework for peace, consistent with their international obligations and their wider responibilities to both communities.</P>
    <P>As the joint statement issued after our meeting with John Hume states, this work on building a peace process requires much patient effort and preparation.  A period of reflection, assessment and discussion is necessary.  The Government believes that at this stage confidentiality is in the best interests of peace and that further elaboration is not yet appropriate. However, as I said on Sunday, in the end, everything that is done must be open and above board, and there can be no secret agreements or understandings with organisations supporting violence. Negotiations on a political settlement can only take place between democratic Governments and parties committed exclusively to constitutional methods.</P>
    <P>As I further stated in my Bodenstown speech, peace is by far the best path to any worthwhile and durable advance, and it is ultimately the responsibility of the two Governments to provide a framework which would make this possible.  As the Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear, the Government seeks to work towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland.  I also said in relation to this on Sunday that we must all recognise that a broad accommodation of different identities, rights and aspirations can only be on the basis of freely given agreement and consent.  We seek peace without seeking to predetermine the future.  The solution to be achieved must be set within the parameters of a definitive renunciation <Col N="1829" /> of violence and recognition of the validity of both traditions.</P>
    <P>The reconvening of the New Ireland Forum does not arise at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the John Hume briefing of the Taoiseach, will he confirm that the revelation in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning in regard to the details of what is proposed by the Hume-Adams process is correct?  In that context, will he indicate to the House whether he believes that is a realistic basis on which peace can be achieved on this island?  Will he not agree that to pursue what is revealed in relation to the Hume-Adams process would require the amendment of Article 1 of the Anglo Irish Agreement which provides that the people of Northern Ireland must agree to any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on speculation.  I regard the comments in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning as speculation, not revelation, and, consequently, I do not propose to speculate on the matter to which the Deputy referred.  Nevertheless, I assure the House, as I did last week and in my speech at Bodenstown, that Article 1 of the Anglo Irish Agreement will remain intact.  It is part of an international agreement to which both Governments are committed.</P>

Will he agree that if there is to be commitment to a final agreement all sections of the community must be involved in the process and not just told they can say yes or no at the end of the process?</P>

I am sure Deputy Bruton, with his vast experience, knows exactly what I mean in that regard.  He and his party were involved in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the secrecy which surrounded that agreement contributed to its successful conclusion.</P>

In relation to the second part of his question, I will avail of the opportunity at the summit in Brussels on 29 October to have a discussion with Prime Minister John Major on the developments and I will convey my views to him.  Representatives of the Unionist parties were invited by the Tánaiste to meet for talks in relation to this matter, both the Tánaiste and I have availed of every possible opportunity, in his context and in mine, to assure members of the Unionist community that peace is on the agenda, but peace without a predetermined future.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to recall the New Ireland Forum.  If the Government believes at some future date that there is a need to recall it, all constitutional parties will be contacted.  In relation to the question of exclusion, nobody is being excluded in regard to this development.  I am present in the House each week to reply to questions and the Tánaiste and I supply the House with what we believe to be appropriate information at present.  Deputy Mitchell is an experienced politician and I am sure he will agree that many things are better left unsaid in the development of a peace process.  It is a very sensitive area and matters can be interpreted incorrectly by some of the parties we are trying to bring into the fold.  Consequently, we believe we are adopting the correct approach.  At the end of the day, everything will be above board.  There will be no secret agreements and, when appropriate, we will release more information.  However, in the meantime we believe we are following the best path to arrive at a consensus for a peace process which will rebound to the credit of all Members of this House.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it would be a breach of confidentiality to give a confidential briefing to the Leaders of the Opposition?  Did the Taoiseach brief Nelson Mandela during his recent discussions with him in relation to the Hume-Adams talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give the detailed briefing that has been suggested to Nelson Mandela.  He asked about the present initiative towards peace and he <Col N="1832" /> made it clear during his press conference that he supported the peace process and paralleled developments here with what happened with his organisation, the ANC, in South Africa.  Apart from that I gave no detailed briefing.  Nelson Mandela made his comments and support quite clear and it was unsolicited despite what some people may think.  I did not commandeer him or capture him in Glasgow and bring him here as some people suggested.  He wanted to come here, he came here and he has great respect for the efforts of Irish people down through the years in relation to apartheid and to the actions of successive Irish Governments. There was no detailed briefing in relation to that.  We will continue to develop matters as we think fit and we will inform the Opposition parties. However, I would refer the Deputy to the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was in gestation for a long time.  The Opposition at that time was not consulted in regard to it and, consequently, the Government of the day was able to do its business and bring the Agreement forward.  I would ask the Deputy to afford us the same support and respect for confidentiality as we afforded the Government then.</P>

In relation to a new phrase I heard the Taoiseach use today, &ldquo;peace without a pre-determined future&rdquo;, will he tell the House what precisely that means?  Is it one of the terms in use in the Hume-Adams briefing or is it used in the context of discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of Britain?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many times I have said that I abhor and denounce violence and everyone connected with it.  I have made it abundantly clear and it is rather facetious of Deputy Bruton to ask me to repeat it.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said repeatedly that there is no place at the table, and there will be no place at it, for people connected with violence until there is cessation of violence.  I have made that position clear and I will not change it.  If Deputies continue to ask the same questions I do not have much option but to repeat myself.  I must say that violence in the North of Ireland is coming from both communities, it is coming from Loyalist paramilitaries and the Provisional IRA. The Loyalist paramilitaries have repeatedly put statements on the public record to the effect that their violence is reactive to other violence.  I would logically suggest to anybody who is interested in developing a consensus for peace and a cessation of violence that they try to bring about an end to violence on one side in the expectation of a response from the other side.  That is the position and I hope I do not have to repeat myself. Everybody is against violence but we must recognise that if we can get a cessation of violence we will have peace in this country and be able to live ordinary lives and in that atmosphere we will be able to plan for the future.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach must be aware that the vast majority of people on this island want peace and reconciliation, a political settlement, as quickly as possible.  Certainly, they want the violence to end.  On a best case scenario will the Taoiseach give an indication as to what the Government's thinking is in regard to what the future steps might be in the coming months which would lead to a cessation of violence and to that political solution?  What are the Govenment's best hopes in that regard?  If the Taoiseach expressed a view on this there would be a rallying of support for that from all sections around the country.</P>

We are continuing our efforts to <Col N="1835" /> build a consensus for peace and to follow a strategy that hopefully at the end of the day will lead to a cessation of violence here.  That is the direction we are taking and the strategy we are pursuing.  In the light of that everybody should understand exactly what we are trying to do. We must make a fine judgment in this regard and we will not endanger the process at this stage by having various comments made in the public arena as to what the position should or should not be because this would force people into positions they may not wish to be in. We believe the way we are handling this process at present is the best way and when the appropriate time comes we will inform Deputies further.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has spoken unambiguously today and previously about his position on peace and that view will be shared by almost every Member.  However, does the Taoiseach not see the difficulty in that the IRA has managed to get to the centre of talks with the SDLP?  Many people see it as a sickening spectacle that the Irish Government should be playing second-hand roles, the British Government a third hand role, our parliamentary Opposition a fourth hand role and the Unionists a fifth hand role in relation to those talks?

I have made it clear that any suggestions we make to the British Government in relation to the pursuit of a strategy to which we are engaged will be made by us, they will be our suggestions.  I totally reject that we are second class citizens here or that those in the House of Commons are third class citizens.  That is not the position.

With regard to the statement made by Gerry Adams &mdash; and it is extraordinary that all sorts of statements are made outside this House but that we cannot have a debate here &mdash; Gerry Adams made two points, one that his requirement and the requirement of the IRA is that there must be a British response on the basis of national self-determination for all the Irish people <Col N="1837" /> and the other is that a cessation of violence cannot be a prerequisite in this process.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, made his position clear, the British Prime Minister has made his position and that of his Government clear, that they will listen to any suggestions or proposals from the Irish Government in trying to find a path to peace in Northern Ireland.  Yesterday in the House of Commons the British Prime Minister made it clear that he felt compelled to listen to what the Taoiseach might say in relation to any suggestions he might have in trying to bring about a cessation of violence.  I have already said that the report of the Hume-Adams talks will not be passed on to the British Government.  It is up to us to decide what proposals to make to the British Government and at the end of the day it is up to the two Governments to consider what progress can be made.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the Law Reform Commission was outlined by me on 28 April last in reply to a similar question tabled by the Deputy and remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the work of the Law Reform Commission, reform of the civil law is undertaken by the Department of Equality and Law Reform and reform of the criminal law is undertaken by the Department of Justice.  If the Deputy will consult the record, he will see that very considerable progress is being achieved in reform of the criminal law.  Since 1989 important legislation has been enacted dealing with incitement to hatred, regulation of videos, receiving of stolen property, <Col N="1839" /> firearms and offensive weapons, abolition of the death penalty, rape and other sexual offences, forensic evidence including DNA testing, criminal damage to property, evidence by spouses and evidence by young children by video link in child abuse cases.</P>
    <P>So far this year, the Minister for Justice has been responsible for the enactment of legislation dealing with telephone tapping, suicide, decriminalisation of homosexuality, prostitution and legislation to provide for appeals against unduly lenient sentences and compensation to victims. There are two criminal law Bills at present before the Oireachtas dealing with public order and alleged miscarriages of justice and the Minister intends to publish three further criminal law Bills during this session dealing with extradition, the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and miscellaneous provisions relating to criminal procedure.</P>
    <P>In line with the Programme for Government, the Minister for Justice will bring forward further proposals dealing with juvenile justice, criminal insanity, fraud and dishonesty, indexation of fines, felonies and misdemeanours, offences against the person, criminal libel and contempt of court.</P>
    <P>Most people will agree that this is a substantial programme of reform and I intend to see that it will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I see no useful purpose in the creation of a further body.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree that in the light of that we must do what is necessary in the fight against crime to update our criminal laws without delay?</P>

I outlined a long list of Bills which are coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas and indicated that we had divided the functions of criminal law reform and civil law reform when we formed the new Government.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform acts in one capacity and the Minister for Justice in another.  This is producing results and the House can be assured that we will continue to bring the criminal law code up to date by introducing Bills as required.</P>

I do not accept that establishing a new body to make recommendations, as the Law Reform Commission does, will improve things. We must decide whether recommendations will be implemented.  It is the responsibility of Government Departments to initite Bills in this area, the duty of the Law Reform Commission is to make recommendations.

Would he accept that the research carried out by the Law Reform Commission is not only useful but essential when Government Departments decide to bring forward legislation? Would he also agree that in fighting crime on our behalf the Garda in many instances have to bring people before the courts under Victorian laws which were passed in the last century?</P>

It is a matter for each Minister to implement the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission. That is not to say that we are satisfied with the present position in regard to crime; we are not and we are going to confront it by co-ordinating our efforts.

      <P>The Belgian Presidency has indicated that the Special European Council in Brussels on 29 October will concentrate on implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on European Union including a commitment to political and monetary union as provided for in the Treaty.  It is intended that this will clear the way for the next phase of the Community's development, with a particular emphasis on encouraging economic growth, maintaining competitivity and increasing employment.  All this of course is fully in accord with Ireland's strategy for the new European Union.  As I said in the House on 6 October, in reply to a separate parliamentary question, Ireland's first EC priority at present is to see measures put in place to boost economic growth and employment.  My key objective at Brussels on October 29 will therefore be to actively support and participate in the development of measures to give effect to the Maastricht Treaty and to help prepare the way for the December European Council, which is to draw up a strategy for economic growth and increased employment.</P>

      <P>In his reply the <Col N="1844" /> Taoiseach indicated that the emphasis will be on encouraging economic growth in keeping with the initiative taken by Jacques Delors.  Does he intend seeking a revision of the criteria to be applied in regard to economic and monetary union given that these criteria are driving the European Community towards an economic recession?  It has no hope of getting out of that recession so long as those rigid and strict criteria continue to be applied.</P>

We have made a strong case to secure the medicines agency for Ireland.  The Minister for Health has been on a tour and I had discussions with the Presidency and other countries at the Council of Europe summit in Vienna.  We will continue to make our case for it.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a definitive answer to that question but if it is on the agenda the Deputy may take it that we will oppose any such suggestion.  I should point out to the Deputy that the <Col N="1846" /> summit conclusions in Lisbon and Copenhagen were very clear on the question of enlargement.  The timing of some countries in the Community in raising this issue is bad.  The confidence of applicant countries could be undermined if some of the larger countries tried to change the rules at a time when negotiations are taking place on the question of enlargement. Any moves to undermine the influence of smaller nations will be resisted by Ireland.  I availed of the opportunity in Vienna to talk to representatives of quite a number of smaller countries to obtain their support which was freely forthcoming.  I cannot say at this stage whether the issue will be on the agenda but the Deputy knows what our position is.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a company (details supplied) with which one of his advisers is associated and which is retained by his Department is also reported to have been retained by ACC to lobby against the proposal in the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993 to 1997 for the creation of a third banking force, including the ACC; his views on whether this role is appropriate for an adviser to his Department; the steps, if any, he intends to take in view of the possible conflict of interest that may arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Con Power was employed as special economic development officer to me, as Taoiseach, from 1 April 1992 to 30 April 1993.</P>
      <P>From 1 May 1993 a consultancy firm, Nemesis Limited, of which Dr. Power is a director, agreed a contract with my Department for the completion of the projects Dr. Power had been undertaking prior to 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Power was never employed in the <Col N="1847" /> role of adviser in my Department as alleged by the Deputy.  I do not believe that &mdash; since Dr. Power was no longer special economic development officer to the Taoiseach &mdash; there was a conflict of interest between the work Nemesis Limited was carrying out for the Department of the Taoiseach and the work it carried out for ACC Limited.</P>
    <P>I draw to the Deputy's attention that, in their work for ACC Limited, Nemesis Limited made clear that its work was intended to reconcile the relevant provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government and of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  One relates to correspondence I received from Nemesis dated 14 October.  I submitted my question on Tuesday, 12 October.  On Thursday morning, 14 October, I received a letter from Dr. Con Power of Nemesis indicating that he was aware of the question I had submitted.  Is it common practice for questions to be touted outside the House before they are answered in this House?  How could this have happened? Is it not a breach of the privilege of this House?</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that Dr. Con Power was employed by his Department as a consultant, even though it may be argued that it was on secondment from an outside agency.  Will he agree it was inappropriate for Dr. Power to be employed in that capacity and at the same time take on a job of seeking to undermine the Programme for Government which was drafted before May of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore any action by anybody in the system to let outsiders know what questions were tabled or to pass information.  I will certainly have that matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also asked whether this role was appropriate for an adviser to my Department.  I clearly stated that this man is not, was not and never was <Col N="1848" /> an adviser to my Department.  I have laid before this House a lengthy statement setting out the conditions of the contract and it is in the Oireachtas Library for anybody who cares to read it.  I set out Dr. Power's functions clearly &mdash; to finish work on the projects in which he was involved at that time.  He was not an adviser and, consequently, I reject the suggestion by Deputy De Rossa that this role was inappropriate for him.  There was a question of reconciliation between the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government. Dr. Power made it quite clear that this was the role he was following.  Indeed I would add that his assignment was for two months, July and August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the matter cannot be brushed aside so readily.  The fact that Dr. Power was in possession of information with regard to my question within a maximum of 48 hours of the question having been put down &mdash; given that I had a letter from him within 48 hours &mdash; seems to indicate that the lines of communication between this company, or this man and the Taoiseach's Department, are extremely close. There must be some expectation of criticism of the role adopted by Dr. Power in regard to this matter, working as a consultant to the Government on the one hand and, on the other, taking on a job of undermining the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any Deputy would try to muddy the waters in regard to a clearly defined role.  What this man was doing is set down clearly, and is available in the Library of the House; he was following up particular projects in which he was engaged after his terms of reference and employment had changed.  If he were an adviser to my Department, the Deputy would be right to complain on the basis that there would be a conflict of interest.  However, he was not an adviser to my Department and there is no way that working on the other project brought him into conflict with what we are talking about.  One could say <Col N="1849" /> that ACC should have chosen somebody else but that is another question to be addressed in a different way.  I have already said that I totally abhor any breach of privilege in regard to putting down questions or interfering with responses to them.  I will have the matter investigated.  If I had known before I came in here today what the Deputy was going to say I would have had it investigated and told the Deputy what I believe might have happened.  I am not in a position to do that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach's attitude to this matter coloured to some degree by the fact that he does not seem over-enthusiastic about a third banking force and might be happy to see a case well argued against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives are clearly set out in the Programme for Government.  The setting up of companies by the IDA or State-sponsored commercial bodies in the international financial services that will offer supporting services is one aspect.  The other is there is a belief that if we put this third banking force together it would have to have an international bank as a partner, one could conceivably say that ACC was making its pitch to have the first international bank in as a partner and proceed from there.  It cannot be condemned for what it was trying to do because it can legitimately claim it is trying to form the basis of the third banking force in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Shannon Estuary project team has been established with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to secure the integrated economic development <Col N="1850" /> of the Shannon Estuary as the focus for the establishment of Ireland as an economically strategic trading bridgehead between Continental Europe and third countries&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The project team includes representatives of the Department of the Marine, the Department of the Environment, the Industrial Development Authority, the University of Limerick, Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Foynes Harbour Trustees and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>Initially the work of the project team focused on marketing the concept of Ireland's strategic centrality.  Subsequently, attention has been devoted to the task of devising a flagship project which would be supported with EC Structural Funds.  This requires agreement on a long term vision and statement of key development priorities for the estuary. To assist in this task the project team made a decision to engage consultants whose brief can be summarised as follows: (1) to define the vision of the estuary/flagship project; (2) to give priority to the items of infrastructure required.</P>
      <P>The project team appointed consultants to carry out this work, agreed their detailed terms of reference and commissioned a report which seeks to bring together elements from existing development plans of the local authorities and development agencies to devise an overall agreed strategic development programme.  The key reason for appointing the consultants was to ensure that the analysis was objective and that an independent organisation would be available to support the case for EC funding for an integrated estuary development programme.</P>
      <P>The project team will produce specific recommendations for decision on the basis of the consultants' report which, I understand, will be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These decisions can then be implemented as part of the statement of integrated development for the Shannon region which, as I stated in opening the debate on the National Development <Col N="1851" /> Plan, will now be produced to show action for each region under the plan.</P>
    <P>The work of the consultants is being sponsored by: Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Foynes Harbour Trustees and Shannon Development.  I understand that the estuary project team is investigating means of securing incremental investment which will maintain the option of fully developing the Tarbert-Ballylongford site for industry should a suitable client be identified.</P>

      <P>The expression &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is used in the National Development Plan in the same sense as in other European Community and national environmental policy contexts.  It signifies a policy and strategy for continued economic and social development which respects the environment as the natural resource base on which continued human activity and further development depend.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the plan has carefully and comprehensively addressed the environmentally related requirements of the Structural Funds Framework Regulation. Chapter 12 contains an appraisal of the environmental situation in Ireland, drawing on the analysis of the Green 2000 Advisory Group, and covering the most relevant priority themes of the EC Fifth <Col N="1865" /> Environment Action Programme &ldquo;Towards Sustainability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Enhanced economic performance through sustainable growth and development is a primary objective of the plan. Chapter 12 also contains an overall evaluation of the impact of planned sectoral activity on the environment, which, in addition, is reflected as appropriate in the various sectoral development chapters. The kind of risks posed by increased economic activity, and the Government action and sectoral approaches which will enable growth to be managed in an environmentally sustainable way, are both identified.  The legal and administrative framework, including the role of environmental authorities in all aspects of the development process, is also fully articulated in the plan, with emphasis on the process of environmental integration at policy level and the strengthened controls which will apply at project level.</P>

      <P>I listened intently to the Minister's reply but I got no specific definition from him in regard to sustainable development, which is exactly what I asked.  There was padding but there was no answer.  Is the Minister aware that we are required under the framework regulations, when drawing up the national plan, to use the definition of sustainable development as set out by the Commission, namely, that development must meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own need? Does the Minister agree that is the definition of sustainable development as used throughout the plan, in other words, that we will not bankrupt the resources of future generations?</P>

      <P>Having accepted the definition, will the Minister say whether the sustainability of the capital investments has been considered or will we end up like some early Third World aid project, where the problem of sustainability was first highlighted, where donors gave their tractors to the villages but could never afford the spare parts or the petrol?  Even assuming the most conservative estimate of 5 per cent per annum of our capital cost on maintenance, operation and staffing, will we be able to afford the ongoing annual running expenses when the capital investment is in place?  What provision is being made to maintain the enormous capital <Col N="1867" /> investment?  It is essential that no money is wasted and that we can as a nation continue to maintain, operate, staff and eventually renew the capital investment in infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed reports have been produced by the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork County Council in relation to the incidents at the Hickson Pharmachem and ADM plants.  These address, in particular, the environmental impacts and the fire and emergency response aspects.</P>
      <P>As regards plant safety, the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs has requested the Health and Safety Authority, as the national body responsible for workplace safety standards, to conduct a review of all major chemical installations and to communicate their findings to the managements of the works involved.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency and county council reports indicate that no significant environmental impacts resulted from the ADM incident.  As regards the environmental impact of the Hickson incident, the overall conclusion is that significant environmental damage was limited to groundwater contamination. Assessment of the fire and emergency response aspect indicates that the local authority reacted in an appropriate manner and satisfactorily discharged its responsibilities at both incidents.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency conclusions and recommendations in relation to the Hickson incident are directed primarily at the environmental regulatory authority, Cork County Council, and the company.  I have urged that there should be full co-operation between these parties in this regard and the company has confirmed its full support for this approach.  The agency will be seeking periodic reports on progress concerning its recommendations from Cork County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council is to review the air and water licences for the Hickson plant as recommended by the agency and, in accordance with section 56 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency has been requested to advise Cork County Council in relation to these reviews.  My Department has also <Col N="1870" /> requested all local authorities to review, and report, on their environmental management and control systems in the light of the lessons to be learned from the Environmental Protection Agency reports on these and other incidents.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council, in its report, has highlighted the need to review some aspects of its major emergency planning arrangements, notably in the area of communicating information to the public.  I understand that this review is in progress.  My Department is also undertaking a general review of the guidelines issued to local authorities to assist them in planning for major emergencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this comprehensive reply.  While I accept that this matter is not strictly his responsibilty, though I am sure he keeps in contact with his Cabinet colleague, when does the Minister expect the report of the Health and Safety Authority to be published?  I accept that this will be the major inquiry into this incident.  Will the Environmental Protection Agency implement the Sevesco Directive in any future cases so as to avoid duplication in the reporting procedures, which appears to exist at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's first question, I could not say off hand when the report of the Health and Safety Authority will be published. Clearly it is important that this report be as comprehensive as possible and that a work programme be formulated on foot of it to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Environmental Protection Agency, improvements in both administrative recruitment and the positions it will be able to adopt are being processed in the context of the Estimates. I look forward to the finalisation of these improvements soon so that the licensing arrangements and the other designated operations can be transferred to the agency at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's silence and invisibility during these major incidents <Col N="1871" /> in the summer were a cause of concern. I should like to hear the Minister's response to the accusation by Cork County Council that the management of the Hickson plant is guilty of serious negligence, that the Environmental Protection Agency has shown the Hickson plant regularly broke the law and that Cork County Council has been in serious breach of the monitoring requirements. What action does the Minister propose to take in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject out of hand the suggestion that I was silent and invisible during these major incidents.  The only time I was absent was when I took a brief ten day holiday, which I expect was considerably less than Deputy Doyle's holiday.  I hope I do not have to apologise to this House for taking ten days holidays as Minister for the Environment.  I am sorry that the Deputy's comments should have reflected so severely on the competence of her colleague from Wexford, the Minister of State at my Department.</P>

The Environmental Protection Agency is located in the Deputy's constituency and I thought <Col N="1872" /> she would have complimented it on its speedy action in this case and on the comprehensive nature of its report.  All reputable commentators have acknowledged the efficient way in which the agency dealt with that problem.  It should be remembered that the agency is still in an embryonic stage of its development and Deputy Doyle, in whose constituency the agency is located, would do well to say a few words of appreciation for the work carried out by an agency.</P>

I am told that these licences will be reviewed by the end of December or early January, at which time a work programme for the <Col N="1873" /> resolution of any outstanding problems will be established.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 27, 43, 53 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the standing policy of Irish Governments since 1978 that, while the Minister for the Environment has the leading and co-ordinating role in matters relating to the environment, other Ministers of the Government remain directly responsible for ensuring that the environmental effects and implications of policies, programmes and projects proper to them are fully considered before decisions are taken.  The importance of this principle of integration has been strongly reaffirmed in the EC Fifth Environmental Action Programme and in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  As I previously stated, I was asked by the Taoiseach, following publication earlier this year of the report of the Green 2000 Advisory Committee, to agree an agenda with other Ministers to carry forward this process of environmental integration.  I hope to report back to Government on this matter within a few months.</P>

    <P>In the meantime, many practical measures or arrangements are continuing which support the greater integration of environmental considerations into other Departments and sectoral areas.  Among these are the existence of a Government environmental action programme which extends to, and provides some co-ordination of, all public sector activities relevant to the environment, the second progress report on this action programme will be published shortly and will form the basis of our report on sustainable development to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development; the establishment <Col N="1875" /> of environment units within the organisation of a number of Government Departments and semi-State bodies; the creation of a new Environmental Protection Agency which will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide advice and support on environmental aspects to other public bodies; the establishment of an environmental policy research centre within the ESRI to examine economic aspects of environment policy; the operation of a number of interdepartmental committees on questions relevant to the environment; the extension of planning control to a wide range of development undertaken by State authorities, including the Office of Public Works and the provisions of the National Development Plan regarding environmental requirements which I have dealt with in replying to separate questions today.</P>
    <P>The integration of environmental considerations into other policies and programmes, while essential, is internationally acknowledged to be a complex and multi-faceted task to which there are no easy solutions.  I believe that efforts to promote integration must be on a continuing and broad basis, and this is the approach which I will seek to pursue.</P>

      <P>The Minister's rather long winded response does not convince me that he is involved in any process with other Ministers to promote the principle of integration of environmental conditions. I previously put it to him that he should establish a task force to ensure integration between Departments on environmental matters.  In the preparation of the National Development Plan &mdash; after today I do not know if it even stands &mdash; the Minister was asked by the Taoiseach to agree measures with other Ministers to advance his agenda.

      <P>There are significant statutory powers for the protection of buildings which are important in terms of our national heritage.  Local authorities can provide through their development plans for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest, and it is also open to them to use their powers under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to ensure that any building does not become or remain derelict.  In addition, the National Monuments Acts establish a detailed legal framework for the protection and preservation of national and historic monuments by the Commisioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to reinforce the existing legal framework for safeguarding the built heritage by enhancing the protection for listed buildings.

    <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this Act applies, a court shall take into account, and may, where necessary, receive evidence or submissions concerning, any effect (whether long term or otherwise) of the offence on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before the lunch break, I suppose it would be difficult to measure the effects, whether they be financial, social or the psychological implications, on the victims of crime.  Between now and the Bill going to the Seanad I would ask the Minister to re-examine this area.  My interpretation of the position as it stood was that, as of now, the courts had discretion <Col N="1940" /> to vary their decisions in relation to crime.  I should have thought that the Judiciary when deciding on sentences to be imposed, whether it be a custodial sentence or a fine, would already have taken into account the provision included in this amendment of Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>What should emerge clearly from discussion of this Bill is that we here are determined to take action, where necessary, in order to correct the imbalance clearly perceived by the public that it would appear to be offenders who come out better than the victims of crime.  I am not for a moment suggesting that Deputy Gilmore is asking that we go down that road.  Nonetheless we must be very clear about the implications of the provisions of this section.  For example, a person's car can be stolen or burned, which will have certain implications on the victim in that he or she may be unable to travel to work, take the children to school and so on.  On the other hand, in the case of somebody attacked in the street, with visible signs of that attack, that victim may well suffer psychological effects that will not necessarily be shown.  In that case who is to decide?  Are we putting the onus on a victim to produce the necessary evidence for the courts to take this decision?  The amendment, as drafted, does not make the position very clear to me.</P>
      <P>The important message that must emanate from this House is that the provisions of this Bill, which have been awaited for a long time to close many loopholes the Garda encounter out on the streets, must be seen to be effective once enacted.  We must also remember that the Garda must interpret the legislation and that we must not place too many complications in their way in their implementation of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer to the issue of victim support referred to earlier this morning. The Association for Victim Support paid tribute last week to the Minister on her overall approach to the matter of crime.  I would appeal to the Minister to recognise the tremendous work they are doing within the community.  They visit people who have been the victims of crime, <Col N="1941" /> engage in tremendous work and are in need of financial support.  Having met them in Cork last week and having attended a function at which certificates were awarded to ten people within a particular community, I heard their national chairman pay tribute to the work the Minister is undertaking.  They said they were looking forward to working with the Minister and to the enactment of legislation that will adequately reflect the needs of the community at large who look to us as legislators and to the Garda to give them the support they deserve and indeed to reverse the imbalance in this area clearly perceived by the community at large.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine the amendment in greater detail before the Bill goes to the Seanad for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to endorse what has been said by Deputies Wallace, Gilmore and Gay Mitchell.  I, too, believe this amendment should be given further consideration.  The Minister may not be entirely happy with its wording.  In addition, difficulties may arise in regard to issues which have already arisen and which have been voiced here today.  For example, some people asked how does one make an offender compensate his or her victim.  There may be difficulties encountered in endeavouring to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not go along entirely with what Deputy McDowell said, that if a person in receipt of social welfare commits an offence his or her victim cannot be compensated because of the difficulty of collecting such compensation.  Surely there can be devised an attachment of earnings facility.  I am not a legal expert and would defer to those who are, but, if there is an attachment of earnings facility in the courts surely that attachment could apply equally to recipients of social welfare?  In addition, Deputy McDowell seemed to have a difficulty about how such compensation might be scaled.  For example, how does one distinguish between a person who may be well off and becomes an offender and another who may be in receipt of social welfare and becomes an offender?  It should be possible to devise <Col N="1942" /> a formula for the judge to distinguish between two such people &mdash; one person who is in a position to pay a substantial amount of compensation and another who is not.</P>
    <P>In general I am very supportive of the idea of compensating victims; I believe victims should be compensated.  As already mentioned, there is a State scheme in existence, but it is difficult to provide funding for every contingency.  I am also aware, as are other Members of the House, of delays that can occur in the granting of an award through the Criminal Injuries Tribunal and its actual payment.  I am open to correction on this, but in the case of the last few inquiries I made I was told there was a time lag of approximately two to two and a half years.  I should like to see that time lag shortened.  I believe we need to tilt the balance more strongly in favour of the victim, to focus more on the victim and the victim's rights rather than those of the offender.  I have always held the view that when a person becomes an offender he or she forfeits a substantial number of rights he or she held prior to the commiting of that offence.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to re-examine that.  While it may not be possible for her today to endorse the formula of words contained in the amendment as tabled, nonetheless it does have merits and should be re-examined before the Bill goes to the Seanad for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very good, informative debate on this amendment. I undertook on Committee Stage to re-examine Deputy Gilmore's amendment, then tabled, in order to ascertain whether there was any possibility of incorporating it or something similar to it, in the Bill when we reached Report Stage.  Unfortunately, that re-examination of the amendment has not yielded a positive response to the amendment now before us, due mainly to the reasons so eloquently outlined by Deputy Gilmore himself.  First of all, in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1993, there is already provision.  Therefore, what is <Col N="1943" /> proposed here, according to the advice available to me, would, in effect, be superfluous.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Gilmore was that in many of the public order offences being created under the provisions of this Bill we are not talking about one, two or three identifiable victims.  Rather, we are talking about a group of residents, or large groups of people.  I will take another look at the amendment between now and the Bill going to the Seanad.  I appreciate the thinking behind the tabling of this amendment, what Deputy Gilmore and others want to have included in order to ensure there is support and back-up for the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>What concerns me about the wording of the amendment, as drafted, is that it says &ldquo;a court shall take into account,&rdquo;.  It does not say that a court may take into account.  Therefore, I would be concerned that in a case where the Garda bring somebody to trial in relation to a crime which would be subjected to the provisions of this Bill, they might then have to locate victims.  The House will recall that one of the difficulties we discussed on Second and Committee Stages was that in the case of many such offences residents in an area are not prepared to come forward because they are afraid of what might happen if they are identified. They want to telephone the Garda, they want to say that a public order offence has been committed, but very often are not prepared and for good reasons &mdash; to come forward and be identified.  I would not like to impose a duty on the courts, who in turn would impose it on the Garda, to find these victims and bring them forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies who have spoken have referred to sentencing policy generally, how it relates to victims and how victims view it.  There is much concern in the public domain in relation to what people consider as lack of uniformity in sentencing. Indeed, Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Gay Mitchell have been vociferous in regard to changes in sentencing policy.  I have said consistently here that <Col N="1944" /> I am awaiting a report from the Law Reform Commission on sentencing policy.  In their interim report they have put forward a number of interesting suggestions, such as the extension of community service orders, attachment of earnings and so on.  Deputies have called for the seizure of assets to the value of the crime committed and compensation. We should not attempt to do any of this in a piecemeal fashion.  I would prefer to have a modern sentencing statute, which is what I intend to have immediately when I get the report from the Law Reform Commission.  That is probably a better way to set about it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the criminal injuries compensation fund, I accept that there is much frustration out there.  The case has been raised here on a number of occasions of somebody who was awarded £10,000 compensation and informed at the end of the letter that they would have to take their place in the queue.  One of the difficulties with that is that the Exchequer cake is not big enough to go around and the Department of Justice receives only a certain amount.  When I speak with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I will be seeking everything required to satisfy the needs of the Department of Justice, in so far as that is possible.  I realise the Minister for Finance has a difficult job to do and that in certain cases he will say that I cannot get everything I am requesting.  I appreciate the support I get from Members of the House to strengthen the case I need to make to the Department of Finance.  The criminal injuries compensation fund, for which a specific sum is allocated by the Department of Finance, has to be shared out.  The fairest way to operate it is by having people on a list or in a queue. It would be very dangerous &mdash; I know nobody here is suggesting it &mdash; were it to be in the hand of any Minister, whoever that Minister might be, to pick out people from the waiting list.  The present system is the best way of operating it.</P>
    <P>I want to facilitate in whatever way I can victims of crime.  All the legislation introduced since last January has been victim orientated.  I feel strongly &mdash; and <Col N="1945" /> I know Deputies feel equally strongly &mdash; that criminal law has reflected support for the criminal and the back-up facilities available, and that is very important, but it has virtually ignored the rights of victims of crime and we have to redress that issue.  I know that all of us present today support the Irish Association for Victim Support.  Deputy Michael McDowell said that not alone should I provide a room for them in the courts but that I should also do far more on a financial basis.  I accept that and I hope to provide for that in my Estimate next year.  As well as providing the financial resources it is also important where the Department of Justice is involved in courthouse refurbishment throughout the country that we should, for the first time ever, put in a physical structure in which victim support organisation can operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who have supported this amendment and who have encouraged the Minister to respond positively to it.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister will look at it again before the Bill is debated in the Seanad. As the Minister is aware, my party is very well represented in the Seanad.  I will be alerting my colleague, Senator Sherlock, to the commitment the Minister has given.  Virtually every speaker has made the point that the victim dimension needs to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Michael McDowell said, it is one thing to say it but it is quite another matter to put into practice.  While I accept that for crimes involving violence and direct offences against the person the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides for a victim impact assessment at the sentencing stage, it does not do so in the case of many of the offences contained in this legislation.  I do not accept that there is a victimless crime.  It may be difficult to identify the victim immediately but there is one somewhere.  For many of the offences contained in this legislation it would be very difficult for a prosecution to be successful without a victim to give evidence that they were offended, intimidated or discommoded in some way by the activity of the accused.  I will withdraw <Col N="1946" /> the amendment in view of the Minister's commitment that it will be examined before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, on conviction of any person of an offence, the court instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way, may, unless it sees reason to the contrary, make (on application or otherwise) an order (in this Act referred to as a `compensation order') requiring him to pay compensation in respect of any personal injury or loss resulting from that offence (or any other offence that is taken into consideration by the court in determining sentence) to any person (in this Act referred to as the `injured party') who has suffered such injury or loss.</P>
      <P>(2)  The compensation payable under a compensation order (including a compensation order made against a parent or guardian of the convicted person and notwithstanding, in such a case, any other statutory limitation as to amount) shall be of such amount (not exceeding, in the case of such an order made by the District Court, such amount as may stand prescribed for the time being by law as the limit of that Court's jurisdiction in tort) as the court considers appropriate, having regard to any evidence and to any representations that are made by or on behalf of the convicted person or the prosecutor, and shall not exceed the amount of the damages that, in the opinion of the court, the injured party concerned would be entitled to recover in a civil action against the convicted person in respect of the injury or loss concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where the commission of the <Col N="1947" /> offence by the convicted person involved the taking of property out of the possession of the injured party and the property has been recovered, any loss occurring to the injured party by reason of the property being damaged while out of his possession shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (1)  as having resulted from the offence, irrespective of how the damage was caused or who caused it.</P>
    <P>(4)  A compensation order may provide for the payment of money as compensation or for the carrying out of works in lieu of payment or for both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think we have had a debate on this amendment because it deals with compensation. However, I did not refer to it when I proposed amendment No. 7.  I am probably the only Member who has not referred to the question of compensation. Therefore, I beg your indulgence, Sir, to say a few words on it.</P>

It is generally accepted that prison, as a sentence and a punishment, should be a recourse of last resort or should be used only in cases of serious crime.  It is a question of trying to make the punishment fit the crime.  I appreciate that Deputy Michael McDowell said that some members of the Judiciary have used their discretion, even before the advent of community service orders and so on, to impose more imaginative sentences than are specifically laid down.  Apart from the system of fines and prisons and, more recently, community service orders, there needs to be a more imaginative approach to sentencing.  In the case of public order offences and those which arise from nuisance, in which a local community is disturbed by the activities of a group of people misbehaving in any way or another, the imposition of custodial sentences or very heavy fines would be tantamount to cracking a nut with a sledge hammer.</P>
    <P>While some members of the Judiciary have used their discretion, it is also true that when such cases go to court, particularly <Col N="1948" /> those involving crimes in low income communities and disadvantaged areas, virtually everybody in the court has little or no understanding of what happened and what is the appropriate remedy.  You could end up with gardaí &mdash; who, though well trained, sometimes lack a degree of empathy for the problems in urban communities &mdash; and legal teams who belong to a different class and who very often do not understand the problems that arise in poorer communities.</P>
    <P>If the victims were asked to suggest an appropriate punishment they would not recommend custodial sentences but something much more practical.  Let us take an example, if a group of boisterous youths congregating in a public place are asked by the gardaí to move but refuse to do so and the gardaí decide to enforce the law, it is going too far to say they must be locked away for two months. They could usefully remove graffitti from local walls.  Another example that came to my notice was where a community service order was made that young people should clear up a plot of waste ground as reparation to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Judges, when sentencing people for offences against the community, could impose a penalty which benefits the community. It is poor compensation to an individual or to a community offended against that the offender is put in prison or fined a sum he cannot pay and eventually ends up in prison.  The black and white approach to offences discourages people from going forward as witnesses and giving evidence in cases of this type. I do not agree that the rich mugger should pay compensation and that the poor mugger should go to prison, as Deputy McDowell argued &mdash; but forms of compensation &mdash; not necessarily of a monetary nature &mdash; can be imposed, which would be much more effective in controlling this type of behaviour.  Given that our prisons are overcrowded and that some prisoners suffer serious health problems, it is nonsense for our sentencing policy to impose a prison sentence on youngsters which places them in an <Col N="1949" /> environment where they learn about crime.  We have the argument of recidivism, the revolving door syndrome. There is no point in sending somebody to prison where he can learn about crime in a criminal culture because the chances are that soon after he gets out he will be back in again.  It would be much better if the sentencing policy fitted the penalty to the offence.  We are dealing in some cases with offences against the individual and where compensation can be matched to the offence as well as offences against the community, where it should be possible to impose penalties such as compensatory community service orders which seeks to compensate the community for some of the damage caused.  That would be fair and acceptable to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I made most of the points I wished to make when we discussed section 7.  However, I have a few comments.  Deputy McDowell asked how we could ensure that judges would effectively adjudicate in favour of the victim for which I argued.  There are a great many ways of doing that.  Some judges are much more imaginative than others. The Minister referred to public concern about inconsistency &mdash; there is concern although there will always be inconsistencies because no two cases are the same.  When someone is found guilty, some judges put the person in the care of the probationary and welfare service for three months before recalling him three months later to see how he is getting on, and then might suspend half the sentence if the person has behaved himself. The offender has this hanging over him constantly and it encourages him to behave properly.  Some judges do this effectively but others do not.  Some judges use the curfew &mdash; a word we seem to be afraid of &mdash; which means the person must be at home at the times decided by the probation and welfare officer.  That allows the probation and welfare officer to vary the times the youngster must be at home, for example, a juvenile may be allowed to go to a disco provided he is home by 11 p.m. but every other night <Col N="1950" /> he must be home by 9 p.m.  That allows a certain latitude.</P>
      <P>Some judges are very good at using their discretion.  It may be possible for a judge to decide that part of the fine will be paid to the victim in compensation for the suffering caused, it may be suggested that the offender puts forward his proposals on compensating the victim and the court may consider suspending the sentence in three months' time.  It is not beyond the imagination of judges to do this.  It is necessary for us as public representatives to put on record our request to the judges to put the victim centre stage.  The Legislature has the role of legislating but the Judiciary has the role of interpreting the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the difficulty of sentencing is that we have made provision down through the years for a fine, imprisonment or both.  We need to take a new approach to sentencing and we also need judicial training.  Judges need to know the range of sentences available to them, the type of sentences other judges are applying and what is most effective.  In order that judges know that, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of sentences. This was commented on in both the Whitaker report of 1985 and the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing. The Legislature and the Judiciary should be informed on the most effective sentences.  If we had statistical information on sentencing, including an analysis of its cost effectiveness we would probably find it not cost effective to send people to prison for all types of offences because as well as the capital cost of £200,000 per cell there is the annual running cost of £30,000.  I think it was either Deputy McDowell or Deputy Gilmore who said that people are often more hardened coming out of prison than when they went in.  There is evidence to suggest that some juveniles pick up the drugs habit in prison.  The effectiveness of sentencing needs to be measured and reported on annually.  I will not bore the House by repeating my proposal for a national bureau of crime statistics &mdash; that is outside this amendment &mdash; but we need to inform the Legislature and the <Col N="1951" /> Judiciary in advance so that we are not only going through the format of enacting legislation but trying to incorporate in legislation sentences which are effective, efficient and economic and not a penalty on the taxpayer.  I would like to see the introduction of judicial training so that judges can see for themselves the range of options open to them.  I support the general thrust of amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a point made by Deputy Mitchell, to consider the effectiveness of a sentence one must examine if it deters an offender from committing further offences.  The establishment of a national bureau for crime statistics was raised many times at the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism at which we endeavoured to find the most effective type of sentencing. We tried to obtain statistics in respect of the level of recidivism in persons who received custodial sentences and served part or all of those sentences.  We discovered that statistical data in that respect was very limited, but from the information we obtained it is obvious that persons who are not hardened criminals and receive custodial sentences almost invariably return to the community as more hardened criminals.  There is a need for proper statistics in that area to enable judges to make a more balanced and informed judgment when imposing sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce legislation in respect of sentencing and I urge her to continue to lobby the Law Reform Commission to submit its final report at the earliest possible date.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed here.  I do not wish to be disrespectful to our courts or judges, but in some cases where minor offences are committed against the person, the community or property, invariably, a custodial sentence is imposed on the offender without any regard to the offender involved, the minor nature of the offence or the greater potential for effectiveness in terms of rehabilitation of <Col N="1952" /> serving a community or compensation order on the offender.  When dealing with young people and, indeed those not so young, what will have the strongest and most immediate impact on their pattern of behaviour is the knowledge that they will have to pay.  I urge the Minister to consider the meritorious elements of amendment No. 8 before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the implication that the Judiciary is drawn from a specific class or lacking experience of the real world.  That is a common misconception among politicians and it amuses me.  I have been fortunate enough to spend a considerable part of my career as a barrister both prosecuting and defending offenders and I have a great deal more experience in the area of crime than many Members who believe that the class of people from which the Judiciary is drawn do not have such experience. Members of the Judiciary know the criminal mind very well.  They know precisely what makes criminals tick and holds them in fear, much better than politicians, and that is obvious from what has been said here.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we have an information base from which the Judiciary can draw information to assist them in imposing sentences.  Sentencing policy requires more of a State input and in that regard I hope the Law Reform Commission publishes its report soon.  We should hold sentencing conferences to impart information to members of the Judiciary who, because of their independence, are isolated in many respects from trends in other parts of the country. The Judiciary should know what is effective in the line of sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A policy which would go a long way down that road would be for every member of the Judiciary who imposes a sentence on an individual to be notified when that person is released.  The Department of Justice would do a worthwhile service by informing a District Court judge that a person whom he or she imposed a six month sentence on was back on the streets after one day in <Col N="1953" /> prison.  The District Court judge might then have some realisation of the effectiveness of the sentences he or she imposes on criminals.  Early releases should be made known to the public, not on an individual basis but, say, once a month they should be informed of the numbers released early and the number released temporarily.  In that way the people could judge who is to blame for the inadequacies in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I am not a spokesperson for the Judiciary, I would probably be the last person they would appoint as their spokesperson.  I regard them as a mixed bag, some are good and some are bad, but the majority are good.  Nevertheless, in regard to sentencing, people tend to believe members of the Judiciary are cut off from reality and do not understand what is taking place in their district, city or county whereas, in fact, the opposite is the case.  Members of the Judiciary are more conscious than most of the inadequacies of some prison sentences.</P>
    <P>It is easy for a judge to devise some clever sentencing strategem but he will not have to implement it.  It is easy for a judge to order a young delinquent to clear up a patch of open space to make redress to the community, but who will supervise the delinquent while carrying out such work?  Do we have a probation service to carry out such supervision? Who will report to the judge on the matter and who will put in place the resources for such a service?  I support imaginative treatment of offenders, but a judge cannot be expected to make decisions in isolation about what should happen, as if he or she disbursed justice from under a palm tree on a desert island and that whatever he orders will be done. Regrettably, delinquents break the rules and if they break the law in statute form they are unlikely to comply with judicial orders in regard to their behaviour unless there is an enforcement mechanism in place.  The resources to ensure compliance with non-custodial sentences do not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A probation service does not exist in sufficient strength to give effect to non-custodial sentences.</P>
      <P>Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore referred to the adequacy or inadequacy of prison sentences as a response to crime.  They are inadequate and expensive, but when a judge decides to send an individual to prison he incurs a cost of £30,000 on the State for every year that person is in prison.  Most of those costs are fixed costs and most of the expenditure on jails would be incurred whether the jails were empty or full or whether individual cells were occupied or vacant. Therefore, it is not true to say that by sending an offender to jail a judge is expending £30,000 of resources annually, or whatever the appropriate figure is for a particular institution.  Life is not like that.</P>
      <P>It is strange how the political pendulum swings.  In the latter part of 1993 &mdash; and to some extent the Minister must claim the credit for this &mdash; we are now in a slightly more mature frame of mind about sentencing than we were six months ago when sentences were being doubled for many crimes, when there was a call for more people to be punished for criminal offences, that the Judiciary were not handing down sufficiently heavy sentences. Happily, people are now beginning to realise that the pendulum has swung the other way and that to sentence a young boy of 16 to 18 years of age to one to three months in prison is a serious step to take and that it should not be taken if it could be avoided.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that it is necessary to set out in statutory form a policy in this regard. Members of the Judiciary in England are in law prohibited from sending a young person to prison unless they certify that no other course is open to them and state the reason that is the case.  A judge is not allowed make a judgment on the basis that he may take a dislike to a young offender before him or her and say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My political correctness is growing.  Judges cannot impose sentences of three to six months on young first time offenders without careful consideration as to whether such a sentence will do any good.  In such cases a report on the offender's background should be presented by, for example, a probation officer.  Such a report should not take the form of five minutes' evidence from a policeman when the accused is convicted or pleads guilty followed by a quick decision by a judge. These are serious decisions.  Going to prison rarely does anybody any good.</P>
      <P>Prison is not simply about reforming or rehabilitating; to some extent it is about punishment.  The recent controversy in the United Kingdom between the Home Secretary and members of the Judiciary shows that some judges are more alive than some politicians to the realities of the situations they are dealing with, and I hope some Members here will take that point on board.  The point that the British Home Secretary got wrong was saying that prisons are an answer to crime in the sense that they prevent it.  Of course, they do not prevent it and in one sense it is arguable that they do not have any serious effect on the level of crime in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, prisons are important from another viewpoint &mdash; the sense of confidence they instill in a community that punishment is available is important.  The problem with a revolving door system of prisons, which appears to be in existence in this jurisdiction, is that most people lose confidence in the judicial system. That is an important point.  It is not how many people are in prison, but that society has an effective capacity to punish.  Most victims do not want what would be described in biblical terms as retribution, but in many cases they want punishment.  Psychologically they feel unhealed as long as the wrongdoer effectively <Col N="1956" /> goes scot free.  Punishment is important.  I know it sounds somewhat Victorian when put in these terms, but punishment is part of the process of healing society and assisting the individual who has been harmed by the wrongdoer to come to terms with his or her injury.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that we are not running Mountjoy Prison to rehabilitate offenders, to ensure that they do not commit further offences or to protect the public from its occupants.  We are running a penal system, as the name suggests, to punish people who have caused harm to others.  A society that loses sight of the punitive nature of some sanctions imposed by the courts is a society which is desperately in danger of falling victim to a huge sense of wrong within that society which will explode in vigilantism, knee cappings, punishment squads and so on.  The State must have regard to that public duty.  I hope that does not sound too reactionary, but it is something I strongly believe in.  We cannot have a system of penal institutions without remembering that the term &ldquo;penal&rdquo; means punishment.</P>

      <P>I do not have the experience, knowledge or wisdom of Deputy McDowell in relation to the courts.  I accept the Deputy's point that he is not the official spokesperson for the Judiciary but he is the closest person to that spokesperson here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are offenders in society with repeated offences and the more time they spend out of circulation the better is the position for society.  That may be a strong statement; but, unfortunately, it is a sad reality that there are offenders in our society that are past redemption.  When such offenders are in prison certain communities enjoy peace and quiet and when those offenders are released all hell breaks loose.  The Deputies present and I know that to be the position.  The Garda may for example, be aware that some local offender is due to be released in December and the community will be at the mercy of that offender during the Christmas period.  That is a sad reflection, but it is a reality.  We must strike a balance. <Col N="1957" /> Deputy McDowell made a good defence of the Judiciary, but we could all quote cases where the law was brought into disrepute not by any Member of this House but by a decision of the Judiciary, and such decisions cause major problems. &ldquo;Inconsistency&rdquo; is the word that is being used repeatedly, although I know that no two cases are the same.</P>
    <P>However, there is a major problem about technicalities.  A serious crime was committed in my city where a person was murdered.  However, because of a technicality the offenders were arrested under the wrong Act and are now walking around Cork city.  People may blame the lack of expertise of the lawyer for this error, but the community must live with such mistakes.  We have too much law and not enough justice.  The public want justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's final comments in relation to anarchy and other matters may be fine, but the finger must be pointed in the right direction.  We all have a role to play in this area.  It is not just the responsibility of the legislators, the Judiciary or the Garda.  We all have a responsibility.  If we do not get the balance right we will all suffer.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that she will introduce legislation in regard to consistency in sentencing.  I accept the Judiciary have a difficult job, but there is no doubt there are glaring cases which result in the public losing confidence in the criminal judicial system.  We read of cases that look straightforward and where one could say that there are external or hidden circumstances of which the public were not aware.  However, that is not good enough.  We must deal with this problem. The points Deputy McDowell made may be true but we must address the whole judicial area.</P>
    <P>I do not support sentencing all offenders to jail; all offenders should be given an opportunity to prove themselves. The Deputy referred to the probation service.  That service is doing an excellent job.  Many offenders who got early release have got back on the right track.  Therefore, we must consider this <Col N="1958" /> matter carefully.  The politicians are blamed for all problems.  If parents do not face up to their responsibilities the politicians are blamed for the problems that arise.  The Garda have to deal with the problems at the end of the day.  I hope the Minister, when she receives the report of the Law Reform Commission, will introduce some consistency in sentencing and that the public will be aware that the legislators are sincere in tackling the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very useful exchange of views both now and when we were discussing amendment No. 7 earlier in relation to sentencing. The debate bears out the point I have been making consistently that there is concern about sentencing policy and about what are perceived as disparities in that area.  I am precluded from making personal comments or comments as Minister on the Judiciary because of their independence, but that does not preclude us from gently nudging them in a particular direction.  I have been very impressed with the attitude of the President of the District Court who has initiated training for newly appointed members of that court.  That is a welcome development, something the President of the District Court did on his own initiative. It is a beacon of hope, and we would like to encourage other members of the Judiciary to do something similar.  I support any initiative in the area of training and education for the Judiciary.  That is the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who said that some judges have used imagination in dealing with criminals.  A well known district justice operating in the north county Dublin area places a curfew at weekends on young offenders.  On each night of the weekend at a specific time during which they would usually be expected to be engaging in other activities, they are required to check into the local Garda Station.  Should they fail to do so they are immediately brought before the district justice.  That district justice has used his imagination and is keeping people out of <Col N="1959" /> jail.  The policy he is following seems to be working.</P>
    <P>In my area another district justice imposes a different type of curfew in that he asks that members of the Garda to call to an offender's home from time to time and unannounced on weekend nights to ascertain if the offender is at home.  If he is not, he is brought later before that district justice.  As Deputy McDowell says, there is a penalty hanging over the offender and he must live up to a responsibility placed on him by the district justice.</P>

      <P>So many people have made contributions that I have not taken note of what everybody said although I have taken note of all the points.  It is not enough to ask the Judiciary to rely on their imagination. We need a new sentencing statute.  The consolidation paper produced by the Law Reform Commission in relation to sentencing policy amounts to over 400 pages. The commission held a seminar to discuss this area and to seek submissions.  It is now in the process of putting the material together and formalising its final report which will be sent to the Attorney General.  I am looking forward to that as the outcome would form the basis of one of the priority Bills to be prepared in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of overcrowding in our prisons more than 3,000 people on whom non-custodial sentences have been imposed, are being supervised by the probation and welfare service. Imposing some type of community work such as that suggested by Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore, whether it is cleaning up a field, removing graffitti or making improvements to a local football pitch, is often more of a punishment for a young offender than going to prison.  Deputy Harney made the point on Committee Stage that it is often a feather in the cap of a young offender in Dublin, in particular, to have spent a month in &ldquo;the <Col N="1960" /> Joy&rdquo;.  A greater punishment would be to ask such people to do some form of community work and it might teach them an important lesson.  Rather than introducing piecemeal remedies for sentencing policy we should deal with this in a comprehensive way by producing a new sentencing statute which I am confident would have the support of all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a lengthy discussion on two amendments dealing with sentencing policy and with enforcement of penalties.  The time spent has been worthwhile because it is not enough for us to say that because we have legislated for a problem, that resolves it. Legislation without addressing implementation is not very effective.</P>
      <P>There has been some discussion on the Judiciary, on the extent to which the public have confidence in the Judiciary and the extent to which the Judiciary are taking steps to effect reform in the way in which they operate the courts and carry out sentencing policy.  While I respect the independence of the Judiciary in dealing with cases, although the Minister may be somewhat circumscribed in this respect, it is appropriate that the House reflect on the growing unease about the Judiciary and growing lack of confidence in them. A survey published in <i>The Irish Independent</i> dealt in a comprehensive way with crime and showed that when it came to asking the public who was to blame for rising crime the response, by a significant margin, was that to the greatest extent, judges were responsible and, to a lesser extent, politicians.  If one can manage to enjoy less public confidence than politicians these days, one has certainly hit rock bottom.  There is a lesson there for the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell took me up on the question of whether judges are drawn from one class and to what extent they may be out of touch with what is going on.  I accept that judges living in the community know what is going on in that community, or at least some of them do. In fairness, that is reflected in some cases, <Col N="1961" /> in sentencing and in initiatives which judges have taken.</P>
    <P>The position is that the members of the Judiciary are drawn from the legal profession, in other words practising lawyers.  In turn, members of the legal profession are, by and large, drawn from those who have the money to study law and to establish a practice or who have family and other connections to establish themselves as practising lawyers.  The two wings of the legal profession seem to be operating the worst kind of closed shop when it comes to gaining access to it and their restictive practices would be widely condemned if they were operated by any other profession.  A small number of lawyers are earning enormous sums of money in fees while others cannot make a living.  Meanwhile members of the public who do not have money may have to wait for up to a year to get an opportunity to see a solicitor under the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity to reform in a fundamental and radical way the legal profession and to address the question of access to the law, the courts and, indeed, the legal profession.  Because judges are drawn from the legal profession they tend to be drawn from a small circle of people in a small country with a small population.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she is considering the question of compensation in the overall review of sentencing policy.  Since she has stated that it is her intention to introduce a Bill dealing with sentencing policy it would be appropriate to withdraw the amendment and defer consideration of this question until that Bill is introduced. To make the Chair's job a little easier, as amendment No. 9 also deals with the question of sentencing policy and we have spent some time discussing the matter I will be happy to withdraw until the Bill dealing with sentencing policy is published.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that she is carrying out a review of sentencing policy which is welcome.  In this regard I would like to make two points about the Judiciary which have not been made to date.  First, one of the qualifications required before a person can be considered for appointment as a member of the Judiciary is experience either as a solicitor or barrister in either the District Court or the High Court.  So far as I am aware a barrister need not have practised in the criminal courts.  Therefore, on appointment new members of the Judiciary should receive some induction training.  I am sure they would welcome an opportunity to undergo such training. There should be some formal structure whereby on appointment they would be briefed by more senior members of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore, and others, mentioned that there is a lack of public confidence in the Judiciary.  It goes almost without saying that there is a lack of public confidence in virtually all State and non-State officials beginning with politicians right through to the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make relates to the workload of members of the Judiciary.  On the question of criminal cases the workload of a judge in a District Court is not structured and they may have to deal with a large number of cases within a specific period.  There is a need, therefore, to issue guidelines.  Perhaps this matter could be dealt with in the new Bill dealing with the powers of the court in criminal cases.  Judges should not be expected to carry a heavy workload on any particular day.  In many instances they are over burdened and cases are not dealt with in a proper fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to establish the principle of indexation in regard to fines.  In many instances the penalty proposed in this <Col N="1964" /> Bill is a fine.  The discussion document published by the Law Reform Commission on sentencing policy recommends strongly that fines should be indexed.  Repeatedly we come across cases where the fine is outdated.  For example, many fines outlined in the existing legislation in this area date back to the last century.  In one instance the fine to be imposed was £2.  I am trying to establish the principle of indexation, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that it may be more appropriate to consider this matter in the Bill dealing with sentencing policy but as the Law Reform Commission has made such a clear recommendation and it would seem to be a straightforward matter to provide for th indexation of fines perhaps the Minister could proceed with this matter in advance of the introduction of wider legislation dealing with sentencing policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 50a is similiar to the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  It proposes that the maximum fines imposed under the provisions of this Bill should be increased automatically each year in line with increases in the consumer price index.  I made the point on Committee Stage that when we pass laws such as this they tend to remain on the Statute Book for a century. We still rely on Acts which are more than 100 years old.  In many cases the fines are absurd when we take the rate of inflation in the intervening period into account.  Some of the fines are as low as £2.  Even though the fines proposed today appear to be substantial, ten years from now they will not be and in 50 years time they will be considered meagre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the question of indexing of fines.  The purpose of putting down this amendment was to draw attention to this and implant in the Minister's mind the idea that penalties can be whittled away over the years, making judges more inclined in future to impose a custodial sentence which, because of the average life span of human beings would have much the same effect in ten years' time <Col N="1965" /> as today.  If the fine had increased annually in line with the consumer price index the judge would be able to impose a substantial fine instead of a custodial sentence. I do not know if it is possible but I imagine it would be necessary to introduce separate legislation to provide for indexation of all fines.  However, my purpose at the moment is to allow for further discussion and underline the need to address the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputies Gilmore and Mitchell.  Regardless of the objective, whether it is to punish, rehabilitate or deter, a fine may be ineffective because it is out of date.  If fines are to continue to play a significant role in sentencing policy the Minister should look seriously at the proposals in these amendments and take them on board to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of indexation.  It is not only in the area of what is generally spoken of as criminal law that fines have become inadequate.  There is a massive number of Statutes, for example, the Pawnbrokers Act, which provide for silly fines of, say, £5 where it would cost more to send out the summons than could ever be recovered in the penalty.  Our criminal law is distorted by the failure to keep fines up to date.  When a judge is confronted with an offender he must, to give any real punishment, resort to imposing a custodial sentence.  If the statutory maximum fine is somewhere between £20 and £50 it makes a mockery of the whole proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister's next amendment relates to the reduction of a proposed fine in the Statute.  We will talk about that when we come to it.  However, in all these matters we must bear in mind that a court hearing costs a lot of money in terms of involving a garda, a judge and sometimes providing legal aid &mdash; although with fines of £100 that is not reasonable.  The time of the court, the lawyers involved, the probation service, the District Court clerk, the judge &mdash; and <Col N="1966" /> the Garda in particular &mdash; in detecting and prosecuting an offence is valuable. The resources involved in a criminal prosecution are substantial.  Therefore, what we have now spread across all sorts of obscure Statutes is a ragbag of outdated financial penalties.  I strongly support the idea of indexing penalties.  I do not know if it would make sense to do it every year rather than every three or five years.  I do not think that would make much difference to the average judge.</P>
    <P>When reform of the criminal law at present in train is completed, it would be desirable that all the criminal Statutes be put together in one document, a criminal code, which has been done in virtually every other common law jurisdiction, so that one does not have to stipulate figures in each offence but need only say that a person convicted on summary conviction shall be liable to three months' imprisonment or a fine or both with, at the end of the Statute, an indication of what a fine means in a particular context.  When we have a rational criminal code, these difficulties will be eliminated.  Again I make the point that indexing fines in the context of this Statute would not make sense if it did not also extend to areas like the Pawnbrokers Act, the Moneylenders Act and a large number of other Statutes where the same problem exists.  When the Minister has time to reflect on what she has achieved &mdash; and on what she proposes achieving &mdash; she should set up a committee which will outline in a report, the prospects for codifying the criminal law, in one document about the size of the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill that this House dealt with the other day.  When that day comes we will have seen a legal revolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore are trying to achieve in their amendments; the general issues raised by both are the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recently issued a report on indexation of fines which looks at the matter in great detail. The report draws attention to the fact that the implementation of any system of <Col N="1967" /> indexation of fines raises constitutional issues which must be addressed, particularly with regard to Article 15.2º of the Constitution.  The Commission recommended the introduction of a particular system of indexation of fines and its recommendations are at present being studied by officials in my Department. I will be bringing forward proposals in response to the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure that Members will appreciate that might take some time in the light of constitutional issues raised and particularly as the Commission recommended that the necessary legislation should contain long schedules specifying individually every offence, which is to be linked.  Although no final decision has been made by the Government on the form which indexation might take, I am certainly in favour of the principle of indexation of fines.</P>
    <P>The amendments put down by Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore would cause problems, and, in fairness to both Deputies, they appreciate that.  The system proposed by the Deputies is not compatible with that proposed by the Law Reform Commission, which referred to the type of system proposed by the Deputies as needlessly and mystifyingly exact.  It would cause considerable practical problems in its operation and lead to uncertainty in regard to the maximum penalty faced by the accused.  It has been suggested to me that it would be a sight to behold the lawyers, the judge of a District Court and so on, armed with their calculators, arguing about the correct level of fines after adjusting for several years of inflation and maybe arguing whether 0.4999 should be rounded up or down. That would not be a particularly appealing sight.</P>
    <P>The need for an annual automatic increase has to be questioned.  If we look at the period May 1992 to May 1993, when the inflation rate was 0.9 per cent, in those circumstances it may not be worth adjusting a fine of £1,000 to £1,009. What would that achieve at the end of <Col N="1968" /> the day?  In addition to my reservations about the system of indexation proposed by the Deputies, there could be a number of technical and drafting flaws in their amendments.  I do not wish to go into great detail on this matter but I will give a few examples of what I mean.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment relates to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is not clear from the amendment if calculations for indexation are to be based on figures starting from 1984 or from the passing of this Bill.  Neither of the amendments provides an adequate definition of the term &ldquo;consumer price index&rdquo; nor do they specify whether the increases in fines are to apply retrospectively or only to offences committed after the fine has been increased.  I appreciate what the Deputies are trying to achieve.  I support the proposal for indexation of fines. There is a Law Reform Commission paper on this matter.  Having regard to the constitutional issues raised and the difficulties they may cause, I assure Deputies that their concern has been taken into account.  The points they have made will be considered in the preparation of future legislation.</P>

I am trying to provide for a system of indexation.  I hope that when a sentencing Bill is brought forward the Minister will establish the principle of indexation.  I am not hung up on the question of whether there should be an annual indexation or whether it should take place every five years or whatever, although at the rate we are getting economic <Col N="1969" /> bad news from this Government one cannot be too sure about the prognosis for inflation and I wonder whether it might be prudent to make provision for an annual indexation of fines.</P>

      <P>I undertook during discussion on Committee Stage that I would reconsider the offence of intoxication in a public place as referred to under section 4 of the Bill. In dealing with this type of behaviour the Garda need ultimately in certain cases to have recourse to the criminal law.  I have not been able to improve on the threshold for this offence which was proposed by the Law Reform Commission, that is, intoxication to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that persons might endanger themselves or other persons in the vicinity.  However, given the relatively less serious nature of the offence, the original maximum penalty of £500 was on the high side and the purpose of this amendment is to reduce it to £100.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 19, after &ldquo;this section&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or under section 5 or 6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I explained on Committee Stage why I was unable to accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 14.  In particular I thought that the point at issue was not the manner in which intoxicating liquor was being consumed but the attendant behaviour to which this gave rise.  I considered the matter further, as I had undertaken to do, and I am bringing forward amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 which allow for the seizure of intoxicating substances where it is suspected that an offence has been or is being committed under section 5, which deals with disorderly behaviour, and section 6, which deals with threatening behaviour, and that the consumption of intoxicating substances is linked to those offences.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment is too wide and there would be difficulties in imposing a total ban on the drinking of alcohol in public places.  However, I think the point is met by allowing for the seizure of intoxicating substances linked to the commission of certain offences, as proposed in amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 in my name.  The advice available to me suggests that to provide a power of seizure not linked in the way I propose with specified offences could give rise to difficulty regarding private property rights guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted this amendment in the exact form used on Committee Stage.  Notwithstanding the Minister's advice about the manner of seizure, the wording &ldquo;that a person is consuming intoxicating substance(s)&rdquo; may give rise to an understanding to which I did not intend it to give rise. Nonetheless, I resubmitted this amendment so that we could again discuss the matter on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 11 deals with this matter in that it extends the provision to sections 5 and 6, relating it to the commission of a particular offence.  I wish to express a reservation in this regard.  Under section 6 I wish to replace the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;.  However, we will deal with that matter when we come to the amendment concerned.  It would be more appropriate to relate this offence to various sections rather than let it stand on its own.  I take the Minister's point about the wording of my amendment and, with the permission of the House, I will withdraw it.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to confirm whether under sections 4, 5 and 6, which relate to disorderly conduct, threatening behaviour and distribution of threatening material and related matters, an intoxicating substance would be seized from a person regardless of whether the person is under or over 18 years.  I understand that at present this provision relates only to persons under 18 years, and the Garda have great difficulty in knowing whether a person is under 18 years.</P>
      <P>This tidying-up amendment goes some way towards meeting the reservations expressed by me on Committee Stage. However, I still have very strong reservations about sections 5 and 6, to which this amendment refers.  I do not think the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; should be included in section 6.  The use of insulting words, engaging in insulting behaviour and the carrying of posters with insulting slogans are not central to the problems of crime or public disorder.  The word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; would be much better in this context.  I agree to this amendment and I will not be moving my amendment.</P>

      <P>I can well accept that there are circumstances in which this type of conduct, if it is prolonged and deliberate for the purpose of a specifically offending and deliberately annoying over a period a person or persons, particularly an elderly person at home, should amount to a criminal offence.  However, the crime, as stated in the section, is not sufficient to amount to an offence and we propose to substitute the words &ldquo;any shouting, singing or boisterous conduct&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;offensive conduct&rdquo;, which are defined in amendment No. 19.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 proposes to delete the words, &ldquo;in circumstances likely to give reasonable cause for annoyance to any other person in any place in the vicinity&rdquo;.  That provision is too wide.  For example, at times I am alleged in the papers to have been annoyed unreasonably. However, the fact that someone annoyed me on occasion should not make criminals of those people.  One would need to do more than that to be a criminal.  We propose the deletion of that wording which is too wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister intends meeting to some small degree the point we are trying to make by inserting the words &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;annoyance&rdquo; in section 5 (1).  While this meets our point to some limited degree, her proposed wording is still too wide.  Because this section is so broadly drafted, it may happen that &mdash; this is more likely to <Col N="1974" /> happen in rural than in urban areas &mdash; a garda will take it upon himself to decide that some slightly immoderate conduct at night amounts to an offence under this section; he will do this subjectively.  No garda should be given the power to do something like that subjectively.  That is the reason for these amendments.  A garda may make this decision for personal or local reasons and the law should be more objective than this rather broad provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister obviously takes our point to some degree, but I ask her to go further and acknowledge that this provision is too broad and accept the three amendments in my name and the names of Deputies Harney, O'Donnell and McDowell.  Apart from subjective actions by a garda, there is also a danger that the conviction of people who engage in this slightly anti-social behaviour will bring the law into disrepute.  Law abiding people have complained about being prosecuted for activities which are not criminal.  Yet criminals who commit very serious offences are let off.  This provision will be used as another example of how people who engage in very serious criminal activity do not seem to be prosecuted or convicted while those who engage in boisterous conduct may be convicted and fined a few hundred pounds. Young people of their nature are liable to engage in boisterous conduct, singing and shouting and as long as they do not deliberately engage in such activity over a long period it should not be a criminal offence.  I suggest to the Minister that the proposals in our amendments represent a more reasonable way of dealing with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about the section.  While the Minister's amendment goes some of the way to meeting my reservations, this provision is still very wide.  I do not know if the amendment moved by Deputy O'Malley would deal with all of my concerns, but it would go a long way towards dealing with some of them.  The Minister should consider accepting the amendments tabled by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> Section 5 (1) refers to shouting, singing or boisterous conduct &ldquo;between the hours of 12 o'clock midnight and 7 o'clock in the morning next following, or (b) at any other time, after having been requested by a member of the Garda Síochána to desist&rdquo;.  It is possible that carol singers at Christmas time may be told by a narky garda &mdash; he would be an exception in the Garda Síochána, which now has a greater involvement in the community &mdash; to move on.  This type of activity should not be covered by a Bill which deals with public order.  Similarly, if the Republic beat Northern Ireland in the soccer match at Windsor Park next month people will probably be singing for weeks.  At various events, for example, All-Ireland finals and Ard Fheiseanna, people manifest their natural exuberance by singing.  It can happen at examination time although not all students get blind drunk during this time. Some of them simply have an occasional drink or two, they congregate and sing.</P>
    <P>We are leaving in the Bill the summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £500, and, therefore, the Minister's amendment goes some way towards reducing this.  However, the amendment moved by Deputy O'Malley goes a little further and I would support it if the Minister could find a way of ensuring that law abiding citizens will not have the right to behave in a civilised manner taken away from them.  It is civilised to sing and natural for children to be boisterous and shout.  We are not only talking about the period between 12 midnight and 7 a.m., we are referring to other times.  These activities should not be criminalised without good cause and the section should be watered down further.</P>

      <P>The issue we are debating here is one of the areas in this Bill that has been singled out for a certain amount of public comment and rightly so. There was a considerable debate on Committee Stage about this section and the desirability of including it in the Bill. We now have two formulae for resolving the problem, or at least amending it, and of the two, the formula proposed by Deputy O'Malley is preferable.  Because there is a danger of the law being called into disrepute, it would be unwise for the Oireachtas to make singing a crime, albeit singing between midnight and 7 a.m.</P>
      <P>We discussed at considerable length the kind of problems this legislation is intended to address, namely, people being disturbed by rowdy behaviour in their neighbourhood.  The formula proposed by Deputy O'Malley addresses this problem.  It is essentially a section where the Garda will be required to exercise a great deal of judgment and where the message given to them in implementing it is that they must use a good deal of judgment and common sense.  We certainly do not want to give a licence or an excuse to a garda to overextend his powers and to use the legislation in a very crude way.</P>
      <P>We must also protect against the type of situation we discussed on Committee Stage where the law is enforced in different ways for different people.  The example given was, say, a group of students during rag week during which the Garda would turn a blind eye, irrespective of the hour, to their frolics. However, if a group of youths of the same age who, because of their circumstances, may never get near university, engaged in precisely the same behaviour, they would have the full force of the law brought against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned previously, this section is one of the hangovers from the Criminal Justice Bill 1967, the only place where this section differs from that Bill is that in 1967 one was expected to be home <Col N="1977" /> by 10 p.m. rather than midnight.  Either way, the formula proposed by Deputy O'Malley is preferable because it deals with the problem without having legislation on the Statute Book that makes boisterous conduct and singing a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>This is an important section of the Bill and while we may refer to the individual going home at night singing a song, the real problem is that there are certain vantage points in communities where youths congregate.  We are not talking about somebody simply passing a house and making noise being confronted by the Garda or arrested.  We are talking about the continuous problem of youths congregating at all hours of the night for no good reason who cause total disruption to local people by singing or playing loud music.  There is a real problem in relation to youths disturbing people late at night and we must address it in the Bill either through the Minister's amendment or through some other amendment.  I am sure most Members of this House received similar complaints in regard to people who spend the day in bed and then congregate late at night and disturb the community.  This is unfair to children who have to get up the next morning for school and to adults who have to go to work.  We now have an opportunity to address this problem in the Bill and we must make it easy for the Garda to clearly interpret its provisions. We do not want them to arrest people in the community who are coming home from a party, a debs' ball or whatever. That is not what we are trying to achieve in the Bill but we must address the continuous problems in certain areas and, in that regard, this is an important section.</P>

      <P>When Deputy O'Malley talked about annoyance and what might cause annoyance, I was tempted to share with the House what used to cause him annoyance when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, I will not go down that road and I can assure the Deputy it was not his then Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this section has been the cause of much public comment, and, indeed, the subject of considerable disagreement during the debate on Committee Stage.  I remain convinced of the need for a provision to deal with the types of disorderly behaviour which, while falling short of threatening behaviour covered in section 6, can nevertheless adversely affect the quality of people's lives.</P>
      <P>In an effort to meet some of the concerns expressed I propose to bring forward amendments which would include the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; before &ldquo;annoyance&rdquo;. However, I am impressed by the Progressive Democrats' amendments to this section and I believe they would meet the types of behaviour which we are trying to target.  I was anxious to hear what the other Opposition Deputies had to say, I do not believe any of them have reservations about it, and in those circumstances I would be prepared to withdraw my amendments Nos. 18 and 20 and accept amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 19.  There is a slight technical problem, however, in that if those amendments were to be accepted in line 39 there would be a comma at the end rather than a full stop.  In those circumstacnes if amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 19 are accepted would it be in order for me to move an amendment on the floor of the House reading &ldquo;in page 4, line 3, to delete the comma and substitute a full stop.&rdquo;?</P>

She has met the point very fairly; she could not have done so more fairly.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear that this section had its genesis in the 1967 Bill on which I cut some of my teeth.  I succeeded Deputy Ó Moráin, dropped the Bill in 1970 and did not proceed with it.  That is why there are these sections still floating around the Department of Justice ready to be popped into any suitable Bill that they can find.  I am very glad to say, to the credit of the present Minister, that the amendments she has now accepted will render this section much more acceptable, workable and useful and will overcome some of the reservations and indeed opposition I myself voiced on the 1967 Bill when that was going the rounds. I hope that what the Minister has just done will perhaps be a portent of things to come, on amendments to come, but I am very grateful to her.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 6, to delete, &ldquo;, abusive or insulting&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and intimidating&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments seek first to delete the words &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo; and then &ldquo;abusive, insulting&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; in sections 6 and 7 of the Bill.  I expressed many reservations on Committee Stage and earlier in the course of the Report Stage about the words obtaining in sections 6 and 7.  It seems to me it is going too far to make it a criminal offence to use insulting words.  For example, section 6 (1) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to use or engage in <Col N="1981" /> any threatening, abusive or insulting words...</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that we have the section read:</P>
    <P>It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to use or engage in any threatening and intimidating words or behaviour...</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to section 7, which relates to the distribution or display in a public place of material which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene, I am very concerned about the inclusion of the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;.  I propose therefore deleting the words &ldquo;abusive, insulting&rdquo; and substituting the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;.  For instance, one could come across somebody in a public place &mdash; say outside an Ard Fhéis, the Dáil, or any event &mdash; carrying a placard which would have written on it insulting words.  For example, those words might contain what they thought of the Government of the day, or the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, or anybody else. I contend people have a certain constitutional right to carry placards of that kind, that it is fundamental to freedom to express a point of view.  It should be possible to do that without becoming a criminal.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I do not think it takes in any way from the intent of the sections to substitute the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo;.  For instance, there are many religious leaflets which might be considered to be offensive or insulting to some, and what may be insulting to some people may be a perfectly correct thing to say in the case of others.  I do not see that the whole issue of insulting words or material arises from any crying need to address our essential crime problems.  It is loose and undesirable that we should allow these sections be passed as drafted.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to consider these amendments between Committee and Report Stages.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment because I really am concerned that allowing the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; to remain in sections 6 and 7 is going too far and <Col N="1982" /> oversteps the mark.  I contend that the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; would fill the bill just as well as meet the general intent of the sections, because in my view anybody who seeks to intimidate, should be considered guilty of an offence.  Whether it be unbecoming behaviour or not, one does have the right in a democracy to insult without becoming a criminal, particularly if that offence involves the carrying of a placard or the distribution of a leaflet which otherwise would not be criminal.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept both of my amendments, Nos. 21 and 26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment.  We had quite a lengthy debate on Committee Stage on both sections 6 and 7.  I have an amendment tabled to section 7 (1).  The two sections are pretty close.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley will recognise their origins in the 1967 Bill.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Gay Mitchell is quite right in identifying the terms &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo; and how they are to be interpreted.  Take the example of an industrial dispute where there is a picket. Somebody is going to work to break the strike and somebody shouts &ldquo;scab&rdquo; at the person going into work.  It is an insulting, abusive term &mdash; probably it is intended to be so &mdash; but should it be a criminal offence?  I do not think it should be. People regularly assemble at the bottom of Molesworth Street and shout terms which are not complimentary to Members of the House generally, to individual Members.  Should those who engage in that behaviour be guilty of a criminal offence?  They may be abusive and insulting, but that hardly renders them criminal. Indeed, I recall in the course of the last two weeks that 70 ambulances drivers engaged in an industrial dispute &mdash; a dispute which, I regret to say, has still not been resolved &mdash; certainly had a number of things to say about the Ministers for Health and Finance because of their failure to resolve that dispute but what was said hardly constituted a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody calls another person a liar, <Col N="1983" /> should that be regarded as a criminal offence?  This morning the President of the EC Commission said that the agreement reached with him was for £7.3 billion and that anybody who said otherwise was a liar.  When the Tánaiste says the agreement was for £7.8 billion, does that make him a liar in the view of the EC Commissioner?  If the EC Commissioner was a citizen of this State and made that statement on the street, rather than in front of Tommy Gorman's microphone in Brussels, would he be guilty of a criminal offence?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment, which seeks to delete the words &ldquo;, abusive or insulting&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and intimidating&rdquo; is good and I urge the Minister to accept it because there is much concern about how the section will be used in practice.  We have to bear in mind &mdash; this is a point I made previously &mdash; that these sections were lifted directly from the 1967 Bill.  Those sections of that Bill were intended to address a certain amount of political unrest that was perceived to be developing.  This was introduced at a time when farmers camped outside the office of the Minister for Agriculture, when students occupied Georgian buildings to prevent their destruction by friends of the Government, when the civil rights movement was beginning in Northern Ireland and when there was much talk about civil rights &mdash; in this part of the State &mdash; housing agitation and so on. An attempt was made in that Bill to use criminal legislation to deal with a situation of political discomfort for the Government.  It would be regrettable if that type of approach were to find its way back into legislation in the 1990s when we are dealing with a fundamentally different problem.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment would address the problem. It would then leave us with a situation where the verbal terms, for which somebody could be prosecuted, would be either threatening or intimidating but would draw the line at those which are abusive or insulting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy Mitchell.  It is a reasonable and sensible amendment.  The words &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo;, for the reasons mentioned by the two previous speakers are too wide and will include circumstances where a criminal offence should not be envisaged.  For example, protests often degenerate into abusive or insulting words.  Those of us who are sometimes the subject of protests should not be so precious about them as to demand that abuse or insults should amount, of themselves, to a criminal offence.  A reasonable case has been made for this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore is right in saying that at the time of publication of the Bill in 1967 there were particular fears about certain things which at that time were regarded as very serious.  They were regarded as very serious by the then presiding permanent Secretary of the Department of Justice at 72-76 St. Stephen's Green who had his own view on many of these matters.  I found it very hard to enthuse about many aspects of the 1967 Bill and I said that in 1968 and 1969.  It got bogged down in this House on Committee Stage and it was still there in 1970 when I became Minister for Justice but I decided not to proceed with it. I think some sections or adaptations of some sections were enacted afterwards but not the Bill in its entirety, or anything remotely like it.  It was a long and detailed Bill.</P>
      <P>The element of intimidation rather than the elements of abuse or insult should underlie the creation of an offence.  Words of abuse or words of insult may be regrettable but they are hardly sufficient to warrant a criminal conviction.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to substitute the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; to go with the word &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; because that would be a reasonable way of meeting the problem which we all seek to control but not to control what might be regarded as anti-social or impolite.  In my view abuse and insults are not sufficient to warrant criminal convictions.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter at length on Committee Stage.  At that time I undertook to look at the wording of both sections 6 and 7. While I appreciate the concerns expressed by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Committee Stage and which he, Deputy Gilmore and Deputy O'Malley have expressed here this evening, my position remains unchanged in that I believe the words &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo; should remain in both sections.  Equally, I do not accept that the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; would add anything to the word &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; already included in the sections.</P>
      <P>On a general point, I cannot accept that people have a right to go around abusing and insulting others.  If a basic right is involved it surely is that one has to be free to go about one's business without being abused or insulted.  In any event the context of this discussion changes substantially if amendments Nos. 23 and 29, in my name, are accepted.  Under those amendments it is only behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned which will come within the scope of the offence. I would hope that by raising the threshold in this way I will have gone some way towards meeting the Deputies' concerns in this matter.  I feel I have arrived at a fair compromise in response to the concerns expressed by Deputy Mitchell, on Committee Stage, and by the three Deputies today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. I cannot let this section pass without putting it to a vote.  The Minister is correct in saying that nobody should have an absolute right to insult another person. It is not right to make it a criminal offence for anybody to be abusive or insulting. Deputy Gilmore gave some very good <Col N="1986" /> examples of where this can arise.  In relation to the distribution or display in public places of material which is insulting including, presumably, billboards, placards, leaflets and so on.  In certain circumstances, citizens of this State and others, including visitors, would have the right to free speech and to express their views.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;abusive and insulting&rdquo; are subjective in their interpretation.  We may be peeved at times and be ready to take insult at the way people put their case.  It may not even be what they say but the aggressive way in which they say it.  For instance, someone may lean forward, a personal mannerism, but you may be inclined to think they are being abusive or insulting.</P>
      <P>We on the Opposition side have gone out of way to make progress today, indeed, let me point out that the Minister has been reasonable in accepting many of the amendments but I do not understand why she is digging in her heels and not accepting these amendments.  It is absurd to retain the words &ldquo;abusive or insulting&rdquo; in sections 6 and 7 and make them a criminal offence.  Never in my 13½ years as a public representative has anybody come along to my clinics, written to me or raised at a public meeting, concern about insulting words but they were certainly concerned about threatening or intimidating language.  The sections as drafted are far too wide.  My amendments are reasonable and fair and I cannot understand why after a cross-section of Members on this side of the House have supported these amendments both on Committee and Report Stages and a number of people outside the House expressed concern about the wording of the section that the Minister cannot accept this perfectly reasonable amendment. I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House on this amendment.  From advice I received I believe that the term &ldquo;a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo; is very loose.  If the words &ldquo;the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo; were substituted the wording of the Bill would be much tighter.  I propose a similar substitution in amendment No. 27.  In amendment No. 28 I propose deleting the words, &ldquo;or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo; as they are unnecessary in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations about insulting or obscene words giving rise to a criminal offence, not only where there is intent to provoke a breach of the peace but whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  That wording is much too loose.  I have had representations from a Deputy in my party who, in turn, received representations from a minister of one of the minority religions here expressing concerns in regard to this section of the Bill.  That person was concerned about this section in that some religious pamphlets or posters which might not conform with the majority view could be interpreted in a way which might give rise to concern.  That view was put to me by a Member of the House following representations made by a Church of <Col N="1990" /> Ireland minister.  That may be an example of an extreme concern, but I would envisage circumstances where political protests or trade union pickets may involve the displaying of words on placards which may be considered insulting or obscene but do not provoke a breach of the peace but whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  I believe the words in section 7 proposed to be deleted in my amendments are too loose and that they should be deleted.</P>
    <P>I raised my reservations about the inclusion of those words in section 7 on Committee Stage.  I do not want to concentrate on the wording of amendment No. 22, those words were proposed by a lawyer, but I would draw the Deputy's attention to my other amendments, particularly amendment No. 28.  We are seeking to pass legislation that will help the Legislature, the Judiciary and the various arms of the law to deal with an increasingly serious crime problem.  I ask the House to consider whether it is reasonable that it should be a criminal offence for an individual to protest outside Leinster House, an Ard-Fheis, a public meeting, a Church function or take part in a trade union picket, a political protest or whatever.  Will the wording of that section assist us in addressing the real problem of crime?  If this legislation is passed a person carrying a placard displaying insulting words will be committing a criminal offence if that person intends to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  I believe the wording of that section is too widely drawn and I do not see how it equips us to deal with the real problems we face.  I do not know where the demand for those words to be included in section 7 came from or why they were included in the Bill.  Section 7 deals with the distribution or display in a public place of material which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene &mdash; abusive or insulting material, be it a pamphlet or a poster with the intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned. I consider the words &ldquo;or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned&rdquo;<Col N="1991" /> should be deleted and I hope Deputies will support my amendments.  I am at a loss to understand how section 7, as worded, is included in the Bill.  If the Minister had accepted the previous amendments in respect of the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;insulting or obscene&rdquo; I would have been satisfied. If a person intimidates with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned that is acceptable, but if a person insults and a breach of the peace is occasioned, that person may not be the person who either intended, provoked or caused that insult to happen and I do not consider that such behaviour should be a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>There is much concern in regard to the wording of section 7.  There is no criminal shaking in his boots because this wording is included and it will not intimidate any criminal.  The people who will be imposed on and whom we are curtailing by including those words in section 7 are the law abiding citizens.  At whose request are those words being included?  I have not been asked to include such words in the legislation and I strongly object to the inclusion of those words in the Criminal Justice Bill.  Those words should be deleted and the words in my earlier amendments should have been accepted. The section, as worded, is too strong and it will not equip us to take on the criminal faternity who pose a great nuisance to law abiding citizens who are not catered for under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the wording of this section reflects existing law and is not a dramatic departure from it.  I do not wish to sound like an old law professor, but at common law the maintenance of the public peace was part of what was considered to be the public good and peace officers are referred to later in the text of the Bill.  In days of monarchy, the monarch and the public had an interest in the maintenance of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be practical in respect of threatening, insulting or abusive words <Col N="1992" /> or behaviour.  Words used with the intent to provoke a breach of the peace are obviously dangerous to public order and should be stopped.  However, there are also circumstances where the person who is engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour will claim that he or she had no intent to provoke a breach of the peace, but objectively anybody observing the situation would say that if such behaviour continues it would lead to a fight.  For example, if neo-Nazis were to picket a synagogue they might say they were trying to deliver some message.  However, in the last analysis if they use threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour outside a synagogue it may well be that they will provoke other people to breach the peace even though they claim they do not intend to do so.  I do not believe there is a right on the part of people who use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in public to do so on the pretext that they have no intention to provoke a breach of the peace if objectively a third party observing the position believes a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  The text in the Bill is more or less reflective of existing law.</P>
    <P>There are occasions when people should be penalised for engaging in threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour in a public place, even though they do not intend to evoke a violent response.  In a free society one must look at both sides of the coin.  It is not just a civil liberty relating to free speech that is involved here.  Threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour are not guaranteed as part of the right to free speech.  One cannot threaten or defame somebody and say one is exercising the right to free speech.  One can insult a person but if the insulting behaviour, whatever one's intention, is likely to evoke a response from others, one is prohibited from engaging in that activity. What might in one circumstance be merely an insult might, in another, be a dangerous activity.</P>
    <P>In the last referendum campaign a group of people who termed themselves pro-choice gathered on the pavement <Col N="1993" /> where a pro-life march was taking place and from all the reports I heard, started a very abusive chanting.  They might have merely wanted to express their point of view but it ended in fisticuffs.  The behaviour in question was at such a pitch and in such circumstances that it led to violence on the streets.  If I participate in a New Consensus group peaceful picket of the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis at the Mansion House, at what stage do I cross the line? If I use threatening, abusive or insulting words to all the Sinn Féin people coming out, in circumstances likely to lead to a breach of the peace, at what stage am I causing a problem for the community? Sorting out who hurled which insult at whom and who was morally to blame is not much help to the community when cars are overturned and violence erupts. The Minister's wording would not be improved if it was reduced to an offence where the intention was to cause a breach of the peace.  The wording has to extend to situations where, whatever the intention, the objective effect is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the civil liberties argument put forward by Deputy Mitchell but there are circumstances in which decent law abiding people can be provoked into doing things by those who will claim afterwards that they had no intention of provoking them to such violence.</P>
    <P>In the past, the community relied on the existing law that one is not merely prohibited from engaging in threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace but from engaging in that kind of behaviour when it carries a major danger of that kind.  I hope Deputy Mitchell does not think it disloyal of me to say that on this issue I tend to side with the Minister, that is, presuming that the Minister does not withdraw her words.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 25 proposes to delete the section because the Bill would be better without it for reasons associated with civil liberties and practicality. This section is seeking to make it an offence to distribute any written <Col N="1994" /> material which may be regarded as threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene or to display any such material, so it would cover pickets, placards, posters and so on.  This section does not address the kind of criminal behaviour it was my understanding this Bill was intended to address, it addresses political or politically motivated behaviour.  Certainly all the examples given by Deputy McDowell were political and I will refer to his arguments later.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago during an All-Ireland hurling match when a group of Galway supporters displayed in Croke Park a banner which read &ldquo;Scaoil amach an Bobailín&rdquo;, the GAA authorities there, many of whom probably did not know what it meant, thought the worst and decided to intervene because it was obscene and made the supporters remove the banner.  As it turned out the Bobailín became very fashionable and ultimately was the name of a television programme. This is the sort of thing that can happen under legislation like this.  Just as some GAA authorities considered that display obscene, some gardaí may decide that something is obscene although it may not be regarded as obscene by somebody else.  The difficulty is that we are proposing to make this a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>We dealt earlier with history and I was very interested to hear Deputy O'Malley's comments because he confirmed what a number of us said during the course of the debate on this Bill, that some of its sections, including this one, came from the 1967 Bill about which he had reservations and which he says he dropped when he became Minister for Justice in 1970.  I was also interested to hear him confirm that one of the considerations which motivated that legislation was the paranoia which then seemed to be rife in the Department of Justice about political activity which was considered to be so threatening as to merit being criminalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the types of placards, pickets, leaflets and so on that would be the subject of this section would be offensive to me, for example, displays by campaigners against abortion&mdash;as happened <Col N="1995" /> outside my home &mdash; of obscene photographs, pictures and written material calling Members of this House murderers, and so on.  One could describe that as abusive, obscene and threatening behaviour. Deputy McDowell referred to a group of Mr. David Irving's friends who assembled outside a synagogue and displayed certain material.  Similarly, that could be considered threatening and abusive behaviour.  Furthermore, it may happen in the course of a picket, for example, the picket that Deputy McDowell and I participated in in the past where material stating that &ldquo;members of Sinn Féin support murder&rdquo; was displayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many would like to make it an offence but we did not walk arm in arm which needless to say is no longer an offence either.  Displaying the type of material I have been referring to could be considered abusive behaviour but the real question is whether the response of the rest of society to the display or distribution of that kind of material should be to criminalise it and what would happen if it was to be criminalised. I take the view that the appropriate response to unacceptable political tactics which go beyond the bounds of normal democratic practice and may be considered threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour should be regarded as political because if one seeks to criminalise it what would happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain, for example, during the miners' strike the then Prime Minister and her Government thought the appropriate thing to do was to send out hordes of policemen on horseback to break up the picket lines.  This led to incredible violence and great bitterness.  In addition, confidence in the police force was undermined <Col N="1996" /> and this led in turn to other problems, including rioting in various cities. Therefore, if one was to attempt to criminalise what is essentially unacceptable political behaviour one would cede the initiative to those who engage in this type of behaviour.  It is one thing to criminalise it in legislation but one would have to consider what would happen when one asks the Garda Síochána to enforce it.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose, for example, that a large demonstration takes place on the question of abortion.  People feel very strongly about this issue.  While I may not agree with some of the opinions held and may feel bad about some of the comments made or written on posters or leaflets about me or any other Member of the House or the public, is the solution to ask the Garda Síochána to seize the material and try to arrest people?  This would probably lead to greater public disorder.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case to which Deputy McDowell referred where we ended up with two different groups who held strong views on the question of abortion and on the issues arising from the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case.  Can one imagine the cocktail we would have if, in addition to the two competing groups of protesters, we included in the equation a team of gardaí to seize the placards, posters and other material?  If the Minister is saying that this will not happen in practice what is the point in introducing legislation which would empower us to do that?</P>
    <P>On the question of enforcement, we would be far better off without this section as it will lead to far more trouble than it will resolve.  Our response to those who use unacceptable methods in the pursuit of their point of view should be political.  If we attempt to use the criminal law we will find ourselves in trouble.  It would be dangerous to insert in legislation which has been designed to deal with instances of public disorder to which we have referred during the course of the debate a section which is designed to address political conflict.  As it happens, in the history of this State &mdash; there have been many occasions on which there has been political trouble &mdash; there have been <Col N="1997" /> no political upheavals or violence which would justify the introduction of measures of this kind.  It is a case of leaving well enough alone.</P>

      <P>What do Deputies Gilmore and Mitchell intend to achieve by leaving out the term &ldquo;with intent to provoke a breach of the peace&rdquo;?  If we were to include the form of words proposed by Deputy Mitchell, &ldquo;the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo;, would a group be able to assemble with impunity with intent to provoke a breach of the peace as commonly understood in judicial and legal circles?  I find it hard to accept that the Deputies could condone such behaviour.  Law abiding citizens are entitled to protection under the law if a group assemble with intent to provoke a breach of the peace.  It does not matter if it is a Member of this House or an ordinary member of the public.  I wonder why the Deputies are insisting that that form of words should be deleted.  I am baffled by the Deputies' proposal in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have examined this matter in great detail since it was discussed on Committee Stage.  While I am not happy with Deputy Mitchell's formula &ldquo;with intent to provoke the commission of a criminal offence&rdquo;, I hope the amendments I am proposing may be regarded as the middle ground.  While we are retaining the concept of &ldquo;breach of the peace&rdquo; with which the courts are familiar the effect of the amendments would be that we would substitute recklessness as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned rather than the concept of whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  In other words, the offence will not be committed because a breach of the peace may be occasioned.  The person committing the offence will either have to intend to provoke a breach of the peace or be reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Gilmore's <Col N="1998" /> amendment, as he said, would be to delete section 7.  I remain convinced of the need for a provision along the lines of section 7.  Naturally, I will be opposing Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  By raising the threshold in the manner I am proposing we will meet many of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage in relation to the section.  In the circumstances few would argue that displaying threatening material with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned should be outside the scope of the criminal law.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Tax on Employment: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Harney on Tuesday, 19 October 1993:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the persistent unemployment crisis with nearly 300,000 people out of work, the annual influx of 25,000 into the labour force and the consequent social blight of crime, vandalism and drug abuse, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reduce the punitive levels of tax on employment and to dismantle the maze of obstacles impeding enterprise, risk-taking and job creation in the Irish economy, in particular by</P>
    <P>&mdash;reform of the income tax and PRSI codes to reduce the gap between the cost of employment and take-home pay;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of competition in areas of State monopoly;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the implementation of the Culliton report; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a national community employment scheme to afford part-time work to the long term unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that Ireland's recent employment performance, while falling short of our needs, compares favourably with that of the EC generally at a time of international slowdown; commends the strategy of the Government for tackling the problem of unemployment; and looks forward to the implementation of the proposals in relation to tax reform and job creation contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the measures to create employment contained in the National Plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of the motion was to eliminate the poverty traps and make our taxation code conducive to employment.  The dramatic events of today have superseded much of this activity.</P>
      <P>The announcement in the media this evening that we may lose between £500 million and £800 million is frightening and intimidating.  What is sad is that both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have distorted the facts.  They must have been chancing their arm on this issue to a certain extent and what is happening now is very unfortunate.  I hope, for the sake of this country, that we can get the EC on side.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I spoke about the services sector and about creating an environment conducive to the creation of jobs.  I spoke about the taxation and social welfare codes and the harassment of small businesses in recent times to such an extent that many of them regard it as unprofitable to stay in business.  The document Deputy Richard Bruton produced contains many good suggestions which the Minister could take on board in order to stimulate jobs in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government <Col N="2000" /> is pumping so much money into training courses when there is a jobs crisis in the clothing and footwear industries. When we had a debate on that subject the public gallery was packed to capacity with people from that industry.  It is ironic that some of those people have since gone out of business.  They were concerned about the punitive rate of VAT on clothing and footwear and their views should have been taken on board.  Although other factors contributed to some of those companies closing down it points up the need to create an environment that is conducive to creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Under the national plan large sums of money are directed towards tourism. Every county council could be a job creation vehicle.  The social employment schemes have been in operation for many years and there is a commitment in the National Development Plan to have 30,000 people on community enterprise development programmes next year. That is laudable.  The county council of which I am a member in 1980 employed 346 outdoor road workers.  They had a sense of pride at that time because they had their own patch of territory and we did not hear the same complaints we hear today.  That number has been reduced to 170 because the road workers accepted the redundancy packages.  I would like to think some stimulus could be given to local authorities.  There is no point in trying to attract tourists unless we can create the right environment for them to have the type of holidays they want.  We all know about the condition of our roads, that hedges are not cut, dykes not filled in and rubbish and debris is scattered all over the place.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if our economic policy has gone wrong when we are pumping so much money into training courses while at the same time every county council could create worthwhile sustainable jobs that would make the environment attractive for tourists. There is much work that could be done in that area.  That suggestion could result <Col N="2001" /> in the creation of up to 10,000 jobs.  Those involved in local authorities are upset at the moment of criticism levelled at them because of what happened over the years.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, spoke on the general measures contained in the Progressive Democrats' motion with regard to finance and taxation and the general economic climate so I will not dwell on those matters.

That party suggested the introduction of a national community employment scheme to afford part-time work to as many people as possible.

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We all realise that opportunities must be created here and now to use and update the skills and talents of those out of work.  The immediate task is to provide active opportunities for people in terms of local initiatives, training and ultimately reintegration into the workforce. That is why the approach for the 1990s requires a clear strategy built around assessing and meeting personal and local community needs.  The community employment development programme <Col N="2002" /> will be the foundation stone of our efforts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane mentioned that much work could be done by local authorities. It is clear that within local authorities there is room for initiatives.  On issues such as this we would have no quarrel with the Opposition.  Much of our amendment embraces points in the Progressive Democrats' motion, particularly those about employment and creating a national community development programme for the country.</P>
      <P>The programme we have outlined takes in matters such as heritage, environment work, infrastructural work, human resources, education, training, personal development and the various ideas that local authorities have come forward with.  The programme has already become a reality operating on a pilot basis in the existing 12 area partnerships and the Government is at present deciding on the placing of the extra area partnerships.  They will provide work and a training element with unemployed people participating on projects organised by and within local communities. We are determined that such projects and programmes will not just be what one would term dead end projects. They will combine a very strong training element.  Initially we want to see a more tailored approach to the whole idea, that is why the area partnerships have been such a success throughout the country. In the past three or four months I visited all but two of the 12 area partnerships and met the people working on those projects.  I admire the mix of characteristics which imbue each individual partnership &mdash; they are all different in the way they approached their task, they are people with diverse opinions, having started out with different agendas.  The idea of bringing people together in that way to discuss the employment needs of a community is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we have been cavalier up to now in regard to matching people who wish to work on a project to the project in <Col N="2003" /> hand.  This system sounds interventionist but there is no other way of proceeding. The key to succeeding rests in matching a person who has a latent or potential skill with a particular project, taking into account training and vocational skills.  I met several area partnerships in which the chairperson comes from the business community or is strongly geared towards business.  These people have opened doors which would not have been opened otherwise.  They lobbied for jobs and match people to available jobs within local industry.</P>

More debates should be conducted in that way whereby people would get information on various matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme has great potential and it is hoped it will be developed countrywide.  The work involved will require high skills of motivation, leading eventually to job placement.  That is <Col N="2004" /> where the industrial element is involved. That sector has the keys to unlock the entry to the workforce.</P>
    <P>The CEDP will link the personal development needs of participants with the community development needs of cities, towns and rural areas in a unique way.  It has become cliché to say that there is infinite work to be done at local level, but it is also recognised in the terms of the motion and by Father Sean Healy and others.  There is work available for those who wish to work and money is also available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to heritage, tourism, environment, arts and community service activities.  The CEDP will set out to marry the skills to the projects available.  There was an artificial cut-off point in the social employment scheme and very often people on such schemes would have gained very valuable skills although the project in hand would not have concluded.  Under this programme we hope to link people to the length of the project that needs to be carried out rather than to an artificial time span which is often useless.  There is much untapped potential at local authority level to further useful community work. I emphasise that practical solidarity between those in work and those out of work is essential if the scale of the problem is to be seriously addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The emphasis on training and development must not stop with CEDP.  Untimately our objective <Col N="2005" /> must be reintegration to the labour market for the maximum number of people.  To do this we must offer appropriate training throughout the programme. There is also proven scope for local enterprise initiatives at community level.  There is a need to harness and support communities.  Sponsors will head the community group, a voluntary group who comes together to carry out worthwhile work in its community.  I recently met many of these people who are experiencing difficulty because of their enormous responsibilities.  The group may decide to carry out a project, heritage, building, restoration, compilation of historical data or any other such matter but in many cases it does not have the skills or the necessary resources to complete the project.  While we have paid great attention to those coming on the course we need to consider the voluntary sponsors, to work out some way of giving them more confidence and ensure greater validity in the task before them.  These people have been doing enormous work which to some extent, we take for granted.</P>
      <P>This approach must positively discriminate in favour of those in the labour market who most need help, especially those longest out of work.  As I said earlier, the selection of further areas must be carefully planned to reflect a mix of urban and rural, targeting recognised black spots and other areas around the country.  I emphasise that the Government has very carefully planned, and is continuing to plan, a programme such as that outlined in the motion.  I am very anxious to have a rounded programme involving a proactive, targeted, directed and employment geared plan, involving up to 30,000 people in the next few years. These people will work at local level because at that level their dynamism can be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the amount of money that has been put towards this project, the work to be done and the number of people who clearly want to work, we <Col N="2006" /> should get a proper mix.  Again I emphasise that we are talking about local development projects which are motivated, inspired and propelled by the local communities.</P>

      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress made in coming to grips with the ills which affected our economy during the early and mid-eighties.  The escalation in the level of the national debt during that period threatened to bankrupt the country. However, the decisive action taken by the minority Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 led to much more sober and prudent management of our finances.  While it still represents a hefty charge on the Exchequer each year, the national debt has been brought under control.  We tend to lose sight of the fact that much credit for this is due to the decision taken by the Government at that time to establish the National Treasury Management Agency.  This has proven to be an inspired decision and it has contributed enormously to controlling the level of our national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debates we tend to lose sight of the fact that a significant number of jobs have <Col N="2007" /> been created on an annual basis over the past five or six years.  However, the great problem has been the loss of jobs in established industries, particularly those in the labour intensive sector &mdash; footwear and textiles.  These industries by their nature are labour intensive.  Unfortunately, due to competition from abroad, many of those industries have suffered significant job losses.  Our majority industry is agriculture. However, rationalisation has led to fewer people being employed in the primary and secondary production sectors of this industry.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the National Development Plan will herald a new era for the development of our economy.  I very much welcome the allocation of more resources for infrastructural development. I think most economists agree that there is significant room for development in the tourism industry and that the very ambitious targets which have been set are achievable.  As somebody who represents a constituency which is very much underdeveloped so far as tourism is concerned, I hope that people will grasp the opportunities now being presented to them to play a fuller and more significant role in the development of the tourism industry. I hope that when the arrangements for the development of our fishery harbours are finalised that places such as Clogher Head will be made a priority, as provided for in the small fishery harbours development programme contained in the last development plan.  Due to inadequate infrastructure, much of the potential of this industry is not being fulfilled.  A significant amount of resources is being provided for the development of this industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, time is very much against me.  Hopefully, we will have an opportunity at a later stage to debate more fully the issue of job creation.  We always tend to engage in macro-type debates and it might be beneficial from time to time to discuss the case histories <Col N="2008" /> of successful business people who have built up their industries from nothing and created significant employment.  This would enable us to identify their formula for success.  At a time of high unemployment it is only correct that we should have a greater appreciation for the work done by these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to congratulate Deputy Mary Harney on her appointment as Leader of the Progressive Democrats.  Both Deputy Harney and I come from west Dublin and there is great pride among the people of that area that one of their daughters, so to speak, has been made the leader of an Irish political party.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Harney said she would not be an ideologue in terms of her leadership of the Progressive Democrats. Yet she spent half an hour trotting out the same old clichés and mantras of discredited Thatcherite policies and &ldquo;Reaganomics&rdquo; which we left behind us in despair four or five years ago.  She also referred to the level of taxation on the lower paid.  It is the aim of the Government to drastically reform the taxation system.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Today I looked at the budget figures for the years 1989-92, when the Progressive Democrats were in Government.  When the Progressive Democrats came into office a person earning £4,500 paid £436 in tax, but by the time that party left office the amount of tax paid by that person was a whopping £523.  Similarly, a person who paid £756 in tax on a salary of £5,500 when the Progressive Democrats came into office was paying £1,081 in tax when they left office.  The impact of the Progressive Democrats, particularly when Deputy Harney was a Minister of State, on the lower paid was absolutely regrettable.  The policy of the Progressive Democrats was to hammer the lower paid harder than they had ever been hammered previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> I think it is fair to say that the Labour Party has been the party which has advocated a fair level of taxation for the lower paid.  It was the Labour Party which established the 20 per cent rate of tax. As a distinguished long term Member of this House, the Ceann Comhairle will remember that it was the Labour Party, as part of the 1973-77 Government, which introduced the 20 per cent rate of tax for the lower paid.  That rate of tax was abolished by a later Government. Before referring to Deputy Harney's leadership of the Progressive Democrats, one should refer to the record of that party in Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred in detail to the difficulties being experienced by the clothing industry.  I fully agree with the points made by her in this regard.  I was a Member of this House for only a matter of days when 150 jobs were lost in one of the biggest employers in my constituency, Gardeur Ireland Limited.  One of the reasons for this is that the Progressive Democrats supported the infamous hard currency policy &mdash; hang on to the Deutsche Mark and your PD hat.  In the process a significant number of jobs were lost.  It was only when the Labour Party entered Government shortly afterwards that this regrettable policy was abandoned.  As the Minister for Finance said last week, one of the criteria by which our currency policy is judged is its impact on employment.  Our current policy is a key factor in the creation of employment.  The manager of Cadbury's factory in my constituency told me that his workforce could be reduced from 2,000 to 1,500 if the currency policy was wrong.  The record of the Progressive Democrats in regard to our currency policy does not bode well for Deputy Harney's future leadership of that party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>That policy was changed within a few days of the new Government taking office.  One of the regrettable aspects of the policies of the 1980s is that under the influence of Thatcherism and the influence of the Progressive Democrats here, we abandoned completely the full employment option. It is fair to say that in some countries where a labour party had some influence it was not abandoned, for example, Sweden, but in countries where this nefarious Progressive Democrats/ Thatcherism type economics was tried it was, unfortunately, abandoned.  We are now facing the prospect of 350,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, for the initiative she has taken with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to set up new enterprises at local level.  Indeed, I come to this House through that movement and it is worth reflecting on the fact that we have to empower people at local level to create jobs if we are to have any success.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Harney for raising the issue of taxation reform so early in this session because it is obviously an issue that must be examined. However, my party's agenda is to have fair taxation for the lower paid and a fair taxation system for all, not like the situation that existed in the 1970s when we ran up a massive deficit because some people paid taxes, that is to say PAYE workers, and some people did not.  That must not be allowed to happen again and we should commend the Minister for Finance and allow him proceed with the development of a fair taxation system.</P>

      <P>I wish her well in her future leadership of the Progressive Democrats.  I would like to concentrate on the specific and pragmatic issues that must be addressed in the coming months. This is an appropriate motion and indeed it shows the direction that the new leader of the Progeessive Democrats is taking with this rather umbrella, catch-all type motion covering the broad issues of employment, social problems, tax reform and so on.  It is an appropriate motion to be discussing in the context of the National Development Plan and in the context of the negotiations on the new Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have served us well to a degree.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was effective in dealing with the problems of public spending and containing the debt that had been increasing at a rather alarming rate.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had directed itself to getting the fundamentals right in order that employment could be created.  However, neither of them was effective in creating employment or dealing with the pool of unemployment which has increased at an alarming rate over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a new programme we must consider a new partnership which must be a comprehensive one between all the interests represented therein.  We must recognise that there are advantages and disadvantages to our economy and to society on the levels of wages and unemployment.  We must recognise also <Col N="2012" /> that all the partners have a role to play in deriving benefits from the partnership and to do that sacrifices must be made. From that point of view we must have an interventionist policy.  In relation to job creation we have set out the targets in the National Development plan and we also have set up an agency to deal with job protection.  Those are crucial areas to sustain the jobs that are already in place and to set targets that we will achieve.</P>
    <P>Our clear focus must be on dealing with the pool of unemployment, the problem of low paid workers in our society and the inability to identify those who evade paying their taxes.  We have introduced the tax amnesty, that must come to an end, and we must introduce measures to ensure that full tax collection takes place.  There is little point discussing tax reform until we collect the tax that is not being paid at present.  We must then come up with a series of strategies to deal with the pool of unemployment. We must look at the proposals put forward by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors; I am unhappy with a number of aspects of those but at least it is a strategy that has been introduced. We must examine the whole services sector and the very high level of taxation, 40 per cent, in that area.  That must be reduced if we are to make progress in that potential area of job creation.</P>
    <P>We must examine also the VTOS and as the Minister of State is present I have to say that I am very unhappy with the proposal in the National Development Plan which indicate that the number of people taking up voluntary training opportunities is remaining the same in every year for the duration of the plan. That is not satisfactory and we must examine it again.  I welcome the debate on this motion and we must address, above all, the question of unemployment.</P>

      <P>At this time the Chair was expecting to call a member of the Technical Group.  I do not observe <Col N="2013" /> any members of that group present and, therefore, I now call Deputy Liz O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to points made by the Minister tonight.  I am delighted that she has adopted such a local approach to job creation and in her speech she dwelt at length on the success, so far, of the area partnerships.</P>
      <P>As a member of Dublin City Council I have been concerned over the past few years that Dublin Corporation, which has the potential to be a major employer by developing jobs in local communities in Dublin, felt itself unable to offer employment due to lack of funding and lack of power.  Due to the cutbacks many of the jobs which involved maintaining the environment, rubbish collection, road maintenance, etc., were first to go at local authority level, whereas some of the more professional and higher paid jobs in the upper echelons of local authority employment remained.  As city councillors, we felt that this had caused a diminution in the environmental services around the city and many of our citizens in Dublin felt that lanes, parkways and open spaces were being neglected due to lack of manpower to provide such services.</P>
      <P>For example, in the Rathmines area which I represent, there are only two people employed to clean the lanes and sweep the roads.  The Minister will agree that simple services such as those affect the quality of people's lives and lead generally to a feeling of despair, a feeling that the local authority is not giving a good service to the citizens of the city.  I would be very heartened if jobs could be created at local level through the area partnerships to enable our amenities and facilities generally to be improved at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the submission which has been made by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  I believe the key to that proposal is that the fair rate for the job would be paid, <Col N="2014" /> that, perhaps, would overcome some of the union difficulties which had been experienced with the SES schemes.  We have to believe that a large number of people who are unemployed genuinely want to work and that is the basis of the scheme and other schemes that have been put forward to the House.  Workfare is a term which sends out wrong signals because it was introduced in the UK on a compulsory basis and I do not believe compulsion is the way forward, at least in the initial stages.  If we present a voluntary workfare system, sufficient people would volunteer to take up jobs.  They would work for their dole and then top up their money at a later stage.  It would give them the dignity of working for their dole and also a reason for getting up in the morning.  Many of the people to whom I have spoken, who form part of the long term unemployed group, have said they would be willing to participate in such a scheme.  I think that, cross-party, there would be the belief that it would go a long way to improving the lot of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The other aspect on which I should like to comment is the taxing of the low paid.  I would dispute some of the figures Deputy Broughan mentioned this evening, although I do not have sufficient facts before me to do so here.</P>

      <P>We did succeed in lowering the rates.  Unfortunately, the imposition of the 1 per cent levy went a long way to undoing any of the good we have achieved within the term of office of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; I have congratulated him in the past on this &mdash; has taken on a new job creation role as part of his ministerial brief.  To constantly throw money at the long term unemployed is just not sufficient. Therefore the Minister's &ldquo;back to work&rdquo; schemes and others he has introduced are to be applauded.  Certainly, they will have the support of my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I might refer at the outset to the amendment to the motion appearing in my name and those of Deputies De Rossa, Gilmore and McManus, although I accept that the Government amendment will be reached first.  My party will be voting against the Government amendment this evening tabled in the name of the Minister for Finance because, ultimately, it reflects the complacency at the heart of this Government in tackling the jobs crisis.</P>
      <P>We will support the priority which the motion in Deputy Harney's name affords the unemployment question, although we would prefer to have the facility in the House to substitute our framework for how precisely that should be done. For that purpose I should like to read the text of our amendment into the record of the House.  Essentially, we concur with the priority Deputy Harney seeks to give this issue.  However, our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to give job creation the absolute priority it merits and to facilitate job creation <Col N="2016" /> in both the public and private sectors through</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of an EC common industrial policy to stimulate job creation in the peripheral regions such as Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;greater emphasis on the protection of jobs in existing enterprises, especially in view of the substantial increase in redundancies this year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;measures to tackle the haemorrhage of capital out of Ireland and to ensure the reinvestment of at least some multinational profits in Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;reform of the tax system to end poverty traps and stimulate employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the implementation of the Culliton report;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a major community jobs programme designed to reallocate a proportion of the social welfare budget to the cost of creating 50,000 full and part-time jobs at the going rate in the public and voluntary sectors; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;an end to job shedding by State companies and an examination of the potential of the public sector for an expansion in productive employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that any fundamental change of policy towards the job crisis is not possible without hurting vested interests.  The share-out of the supposed available resources in the National Development Plan avoided hard choices. The powerful vested interests which hector the Government got their allocations on the basis of lobbying power rather than on the basis of job creation potential.  Now that it has emerged that the Government has been deluding itself and fooling the electorate about the extent of EC funding, it is very probable that it will be the most vulnerable and weakest sectors of our society who will <Col N="2017" /> pay the price for the Government's mismanagement and suffer the impact of the shortfall.</P>
    <P>We believe that if there is to be a serious drive to increase job creation then virtually everybody in our society will have to make major changes and most people will have to make sacrifices. Those who will not have to make sacrifices will be the lower paid, but even they will have to change in the way they work and the way they think about work.</P>
    <P>In essence, our comprehensive employment policy requires changes in European industrial policy, in Irish industrial policy, a massive overhaul of the taxation system, the creation of a basic minimum income and a substantial adoption of new ways of working which are flexible, competitive and which liberate workers from drudgery.</P>
    <P>The creation of a Single Market, where the most competitive firms are also the largest, severely disadvantages peripheral areas like Ireland.  Of all the political parties in this House Democratic Left has argued long and hard that, in the absence of a European-wide industrial policy which encourages large firms to locate their manufacturing plants in the periphery, there will be continued concentration of wealth in the rich heartland of Europe.  Thus, Democratic Left calls for an active, intelligent, interventionist industrial policy which will discourage overinvestment and overcrowding in the centre of Europe and stimulate job creation in the peripheral areas.  The European policy of the Government here is merely to have a begging bowl for more Structural and Cohesion Funds.  We have had several examples recently that in the absence of such a policy at European level this country and Government, not to mention trade unions and workers here, are helpless in the face of the flight of capital and the decision by any major transnational company to pull out stocks in this economy and locate elsewhere. Most recently we saw it very dramatically in the case of the Digital plant, where <Col N="2018" /> there was really nothing that the trade union movement, or indeed the international trade union movement, could do about it &mdash; there was really nothing that the Government could do about it.  We went through the exercise and seemed to be doing what we could in terms of the cosmetics of it, but the facts of the matter are that the decision was irrevocable and that we did not have any clout in the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not understand if the Common Market initially &mdash; the European Community since then &mdash; can have as its cornerstone a common agricultural policy, why it is not possible to begin the process of constructing a common industrial policy to cope with the present extent of our unemployment problem.  In the absence of the substantial transfer of Structural Funds from Europe it would have meant even higher unemployment here, but that is only part of the solution. Again, looking at the terms of the National Development Plan, it would appear that the Government does not view it as part of the solution but rather as its job creation policy &mdash; all of the eggs seem to be put in that basket.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste say that it would strike into the heart of poverty and deprivation in our society, that a number of new programmes are being devised and a very substantial allocation of funding.  I wonder how these will survive the present crisis that has finally hauled the Government back to reality.  A sum of £500 million is a substantial amount and a very big discrepancy.  As somebody remarked this morning, a three and an eight can look alike in the dark but £500 million is three times the rescue cost of Aer Lingus.  I sincerely hope that whatever the shortfall &mdash; I hope it is not more than £1 million &mdash; it will not affect some of the programmes which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, promised.</P>
    <P>I still believe that the key to strong <Col N="2019" /> employment growth in the modern economy is the creation of service jobs as a spin-off from wealth generated in the manufacturing sector.  That is going out of fashion to some extent in the sense that in all modern economies the service sector has become progressively more important and the manufacturing sector less so.  Nonetheless, you cannot have the spin-off of service jobs to imitate the more advanced economies if you do not have a strong manufacturing sector.  Our problem is that we have relied almost exclusively on the multinationals to provide that manufacturing base here.  We have not managed to develop any significant indigenous base in our manufacturing sector.  It is interesting to note that Ireland's growth in manufacturing was second only to Japan during the past decade &mdash; because we come from such a low base &mdash; yet the growth in service employment has been only half the average of rich economies.  This is because the industrial structure created in Ireland in the past 30 years has been based on foreign companies which buy most of the materials and services abroad and which repatriate their substantial profits, largely untaxed, abroad.</P>
    <P>We do not want to compete with Third World countries and labour intensive industries but to develop sectors where we can gain competitive advantage.  We want to see the development of clusters or local industrial districts where such co-operative competition will help Irish firms to succeed in the international marketplace.  Irish industrial policy must move from its preoccupation with physical infrastructure, financial incentives and low costs.  The immense natural and human resource base of Ireland, with our strong scientific base, excellent education system and computer literacy are the basis of our industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Irish State owned enterprises must be developed rather than privatised because they are some of the key companies here. In that regard I take issue with that clause <Col N="2020" /> of the Progressive Democrats' motion. Although the motion is carefully drafted to bring most of us on side in terms of supporting it, I do not think the engine of job expansion in this economy will necessarily come from privatisation of the remaining State enterprises, whose numbers we tend to exaggerate.  The best have already been privatised: Irish Life in the financial sector and the former Irish Sugar Company, Greencore, in the manufacturing sector.  That is also the pattern elsewhere where only the very successful companies are privatised.  For example, an analysis in Britain shows that the outcome has not been more jobs but a tremendous benefit in terms of salaries to senior management who worked in those companies, tremendous gains to those who could afford to buy shares and tremendous job losses for the workers.  I am not necessarily opposed to the point in the Progressive Democrats' motion which refers to competition in this area. I suspect that Telecom is the company referred to and that is a story in its own right, one that will break in this House before long in the context of the extent of the technological revolution in telecommunications. If the unfortunate consumers think the situation is bad they have seen nothing yet.</P>
    <P>The Government, in its very smug and complacent amendment to the Progressive Democrats' motion is putting a lot of eggs in the basket of the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is very difficult to accept an amendment from the Government which says we ought to &ldquo;commend the strategy of the Government for tackling the problem of unemployment&rdquo; when 300,000 people are unemployed.  I look every day for something to commend in terms of reducing the numbers on the dole queue but the situation is getting worse.  It reduces this House to the level of humbug and hypocrisy when the Government does not even take time to do a serious rebuttal of the Progressive <Col N="2021" /> Democrats' motion for debate in the House.  This is no more than going through the motions.  The Government amendment reflects the complacent, cosy approach of the Government parties who boast that there is no longer any tension in Government &mdash; and that seems to be the case but how it is claimed it is a good idea escapes me.  I would have thought that if the Labour Party had anything distinctive to offer there would be tension in Government.  The fact that they have so conveniently slipped into bed with Fianna Fáil and that everything is harmony and light should outrage the unemployed, the over-taxed and those in poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' motion also refers to the urgency of tax reform. It is drafted in such a way it does not say what is intended here but, clearly, there ought to be substantial and major reform of the tax system.  However, I should clarify, in case there is any doubt about it, that I do not necessarily mean cutting the top rate of tax for a minority but a comprehensive shift from the massive array of tax allowances that have existed up to now.  The policy of successive Governments has been to give more incentives, mainly through the tax system, and to create more tax shelters but it has not produced the jobs we were promised.</P>
    <P>The policy has patently failed and it is time to consider the American idea of the alternative minimum tax.  I heard Deputy Richard Bruton recently &mdash; I am not sure whether it was on an Adjournment debate or on a policy document he has published &mdash; referring to the tax regime on the service sector.  Of course, it is a farce to pretend we have a special tax regime for the manufacturing sector who contrive, through various methods, to pay no tax and the service sector, where there is a national 40 per cent rate.  Anybody who knows anything about creative accounting and who can afford expert tax advice does not end up paying 40 per cent tax on profits.  Therefore, it would be <Col N="2022" /> much more effective if we had an alternative minimum rate of tax &mdash; a rate of tax that would be implemented so that the payment of tax could not be avoided as at present by the exploitation of loopholes. I think such an alternative minimum rate of tax is 20 per cent in most states and that seems to be a great deal more effective than the system where we have a notional rate of twice that &mdash; it was a good deal more than twice that until recently &mdash; which in effect, as the figures show for the corporate sector, has never made any major contribution.</P>
    <P>I overheard Deputy O'Donnell argue in favour of the proposal by the Conferences of Major Religious Superiors for the creation of jobs for people currently on the dole.  There is a reference in the Progressive Democrats' motion to &ldquo;the introduction of a national community employment scheme to afford part-time work to the long term unemployed&rdquo;. Unfortunately, I missed Deputy Harney's submission on this point but I think it is out of desperation that this idea has caught hold.  I am not sure what the Progressive Democrats approach to it is but I have reservations for a number of reasons about the Conference of Major Religious Superiors' approach to it.  To expect people to work for their dole seems to be a straightforward workfare proposal &mdash; I am not suggesting that is what is being advanced, but I would like it clarified.  I think an element of additionality has to be provided and if one does not provide for an element of additionality, the concept will not work.</P>
    <P>It makes sense to reallocate a proportion of the huge social welfare budget, which amounts to more than £3 billion, to take a large number off the dole.  Quite clearly it will not work if, for example, as has been the case in the social employment schemes, participants effectively lost their supplemental entitlements such as fuel vouchers, eligibility for a medical card or advantage under the differential rent scheme.  If people lose those additional benefits the concept will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The notion that is being worked on the CEDP is probably good but if people are taken off the dole to do jobs like cleaning up the environment or other socially useful work for the voluntary sector, we have to be prepared to pay an element of additionality.  I think that means paying the rate for the job. The rate for the job in general operative type employment in the local authorities and health boards is basic and by all means we should not pay them any more than they would get on the labour exchange but they should get the rate per hour for the job and they are then free for the remainder of the week to do whatever they might.  In a constituency like mine that does not mean anything but down the country it might mean something as one might find additional work.  One is not going to find additional work in my constituency but nonetheless the provision is there and provided the other benefits such as fuel vouchers, medical cards and so on are preserved I see some merit in this idea.</P>
      <P>It has taken the Government an inordinately long time to come up with the idea.  It is a year ago last September since the all-party Oireachtas Committee came up with this proposal but nothing has happened since then.  The new county enterprise boards although dramatically changed from what was advised under the former Government are still puzzling &mdash; even those of us who are members of these boards are puzzled by the overlap, the bureaucracy and the whole procedure which must be gone through.</P>
      <P>The situation is so grave that it requires the Government, if it is going to come up with something like this, to enable us to get on with it because we are in a crisis. One would never suspect that from the amendment put to us tonight by the Government.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Harney on this motion.  The motion is not very specific and I would not necessarily agree with all its parts as it talks in global terms about tax reform and poverty traps, but the time has come to talk in detail on the specifics.  We need to be quite clear what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Last night I heard Deputy Harney refer to the fact that the Progressive Democrats Party was founded on the principle of tax reform.  That was so and that was my memory &mdash; but tax reform for whom? At that time the thrust seemed to be that if we got the rate of tax down from 56 per cent, those on the high rates of penal tax would create employment for the masses.  I never agreed with that, it was outside my experience of those who create jobs.  As far as I am concerned most entrepreneurs who create employment are motivated by factors other than purely to create profits.  I found that the serious tax traps are at the bottom of the social scale.  Let me be specific: we start taxing people at £69 per week.  What rate of tax does a person earning £73 per week pay?  They are taxed on the marginal rate of 48 per cent because in order to avail of the exemption limit one pays the higher rate of tax.  We must call a spade a spade and say what is needed to reform the tax system.  What is needed is that people should not pay tax until they go above a certain basic income.  This should be a reasonable amount of money and I think it should be set at £100 for a single person and double that amount for a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what structures are needed to create that system because if we continue to use the exemption system that we have used to date we will run into crazy anomalies, for example, the marginal rate of tax being <Col N="2025" /> paid by those just over the basic tax threshold. We have to devise a progressive system which ensures that the point at which people first hit the tax net is raised considerably and, second, when they hit it they do not hit a brick wall as they do at present where the incentive goes out of it.  I am concerned about the overlap of the family income supplement scheme and tax levels for those on the middle to low income group.  In the west the description &ldquo;the low to middle income group&rdquo; refers to much lower income groups than on the east coast.</P>

      <P>People in receipt of family income supplement find that their net pay is lower when they get a wage increase.  If we are going to talk about tax reform we should start at the bottom. We should be specific and refer to the group most affected by tax.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance because in many speeches recently he alluded to that matter as being a top priority.</P>
      <P>If we want tax reform we must stop linking RSI rates to the medical card system &mdash; for example, free school transport which is 2 per cent of RSI &mdash; because such benefits are means tested.  The medical card is then overvalued and people believe they are better off not progressing up the scale to earn more money.  When this Government introduces tax reform I am sure it will direct its attention at that area of tax first because it is the area in most need of reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interface of the tax and social welfare system needs to be examined and there has been much talk about that during the past number of years.  I could <Col N="2026" /> write a book on the anomalies in the social welfare system and their effects on the tax system, but to my knowledge this is the first Government in which a Minister of State has been given specific responsibility for the nitty gritty of the tax system.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about obstacles impeding enterprise, but people should be specific.  People starting up there own businesses are put off by the many layers of bureaucracy.  We should not give the impression that certain forms of bureaucracy, planning and so on, can be disposed of.  For example, Deputy Harney, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, was instrumental in setting up the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, many planning laws are in place.  It is wrong to give the impression to those creating jobs that such agencies could be disposed of. We should be specific when talking about obstacles impeding enterprise.  We should insist that there is easy and efficient access to State agencies and that the bureaucracy of the State works effectively. For example, there should be easy access to planning and environmental laws.  It is wrong to give the impression that many of those agencies and provisions could be disposed of which at the same time proposing the imposition of further restrictions and the setting up of further agencies to monitor the position. That is similar to heading in two directions at the one time.</P>
    <P>There are two problems in allowing competition in respect of State monopolies. Prior to supporting such a measure I would have to be sure that in the breaking of any State monopoly &mdash; for example, Telecom Éireann &mdash; there would be an absolute assurance that the law of the jungle would not apply and that the people in remote rural areas would not end up receiving an inadequate service at an unfair cost because it would not be efficient or cost effective for the big operators to provide them with the service.  Where there is depopulation in <Col N="2027" /> one area and over-population in another, it is the State which picks up the tab by closing schools in one area and opening them in another and by letting the infrastructure run down in one area and replicating it in another.  Therefore, prior to playing around with state monopolies one must consider whether people in general would gain by having an open jungle market in which the strong areas would develop and the weaker ones decline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív's comments about the crazy catapulting of people through the exemption limit system into high marginal tax walls, withdrawals of family income supplement and so on.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I tabled a series of amendments in that regard on Committe Stage of the Finance Bill.  Regrettably, the Minister for Finance saw fit to reject all of them, although my primary concern was precisely, in philosophical and economical terms, what Deputy Ó Cuív has just recommended.</P>
      <P>It is a poor day when one does not learn something and today was a day of considerable learning for me.  I want to refer to the odyssey which began for the Taoiseach at Edinburgh when his Edinburgh dowry proved to be the fatal attraction for the Tánaiste seeking a new partner.  That paved the way for the partnership Government between Labour and Fianna Fáil.  However, it emerges &mdash; the Taoiseach told us this today &mdash; that the dowry was not in the bag when he returned from Edinburgh but that the Labour Party were well in the bag at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach told us today that a specific agreement was reached on £7.84 billion on 20 July last implying, in the famous word of another Taoiseach, that no &ldquo;such&rdquo; specific agreement was reached at Edinburgh.  In regard to the <Col N="2028" /> £7.84 billion, the Tánaiste told us today that &ldquo;we are still 100 per cent on target to achieve it,&rdquo; although signalling clearly some doubt in the matter by going on to state that &ldquo;even as this House debates the issue we are taking the necessary appropriate and measured steps to ensure that that investment is secured in full&rdquo;.  That was a curious form of words. Are we securing in full what we have already tied down in a specific agreement? Was there ever such an agreement, even on 20 July, when the Tánaiste found it necessary to reassure us today that steps were being taken to secure the £7.84 billion in full?  I understand the Tánaiste is travelling to Brussels tonight in pursuance of that matter and, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish him well.</P>

For the first time the Tánaiste revealed to us today a new space within which that numbers game is being played.  He talked of &ldquo;indicative figures&rdquo; to be expressed in &ldquo;ranges&rdquo; or in what he said, the Commission calls <i>fourchettes.</i> That is why I stated that one learns something new very day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard the Tánaiste use that word I asked myself is it animal, vegetable or mineral, or is it solid, liquid or, as I suspect, only gas.  I looked up the second edition of the Collins French-English dictionary, published in 1990, to examine in depth the meaning of the word <i>&ldquo;fourchette&rdquo;.</i> On page 313 the word <i>&ldquo;fourchette&rdquo;</i> is described as a feminine noun, and defined as &ldquo;a fork, as in margins or bands or a fork for eating with&rdquo;. The <i>fourchette</i> is well and truly out of the bag in which the Taoiseach presumed there was £8 billion.  Therefore, we are entitled to conclude that the Government, <Col N="2029" /> at its most senior level, has been speaking to the Irish public and to this House with a <i>fourchette</i> tongue since last July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>We planned to reduce the tax rates to 25 per cent and 44 per cent during the lifetime of the last Government. The standard band during that period &mdash; the band on which the lower paid about whom the Deputy is concerned, would be taxed &mdash; increased by almost 50 per cent, reversing the trend of a decade.  Under the Progressive Democrats the tax wedge was reduced every year.  Under this Government, for the first time in six years, the tax wedge increased.  The Deputy talked about going back to Reaganomics, that is a lot of bunkum.  We are not going back.  The problem is that the Government in its national plan and job targets cannot address the unemployment problem and fatalistically accepts outcomes rather than rail against them, find policies to fight against them and convert growth into more jobs.  Deputy Broughan appeared to indicate that as the figures had gone soft the Labour Party had gone soft on the hard currency policy.  I did not know the Labour Party was soft on the hard currency policy.  The Deputy tonight pinned a gold medal on his chest for having caused a devaluation within weeks of entering Government.  I am glad there are now two policies in Government, the official one and the Labour one, maybe that is the way the <i>fourchette</i> speak will emerge from now on as this Government winds its merry way through its lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in the debate the Minister <Col N="2031" /> for Finance, Deputy Ahern, talked about the tax wedge not being important.  He said it was not a core problem.  I will remind the House of the figures Deputy Harney quoted last might.  She stated that an unemployed worker with a dependent spouse and four children needs to earn at least £14,500 before it is worth taking a job.  That is crazy.  In the labour intensive clothing industry the minimum weekly wage is much lower in Britain than here. Our minimum wage is IR£131 against IR£114 in Britain.  However, the British worker has a higher take home pay than his Irish counterpart.  The tax wedge driven into the heart of economic policy is killing the prospect of turning more growth into more jobs.  That is why we tabled this motion.  It is wrong to imply that growth numbers fall automatically and that nothing can be done to break the vicious cycle.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, also conceded that there is a trade off between pay increases for those in work and the rate of employment growth in the economy.  As the Government contemplates a new round of wage bargaining and income policy, its handling of the pay issue should be the yardstick by which the public should be entitled to judge its credentials on jobs because the trade off is accepted.  Having regard to the example I gave, we know that the real issue is not about gross but take home pay, the pay policy should focus on take home pay which would help to get the tax wedge monkey off the backs of employers.</P>
    <P>Last week in pre-<i>fourchette</i> Ireland a spending plan was devised to draw down European money.  Whatever money comes more growth will follow, that is not challenged by any Deputy in the House. The challenge facing the Government is <Col N="2032" /> how to convert that growth into jobs, that is the key issue.  Last night the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, listed seed capital schemes, BES, special investment accounts and a long list of schemes in the National Development Plan.  The Government is becoming a scheme-driven junkie injecting a new scheme into society every week.  However, the economy does not lack schemes.  The real problem is that the basics are wrong, the tax wedge is wrong, the tax system is anti-jobs and the poverty traps are anti-people.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the free and open support of Fine Gael in regard to this motion in respect of a significant issue that divides this House in policy terms and is a crucial marker for the future.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for a number of comments in regard to which the Progressive Democrats are <i>ad idem.</i> The Deputy asked about our approach to the proposed job scheme for the unemployed. It is caring, understanding and compassionate and we refuse to accept the human set-aside policy.  We believe that the pay for the job should be on a <i>pro rata</i> basis for the hours worked and that should be the medium adopted.  I am sure that if the Labour Party has gone soft on currency and the figures have gone soft in Brussels it might see the light of day and go soft in regard to Fianna Fáil.  We call with confidence on this House to radically attack tax wedges, radically reform taxation in a pro-jobs way to tackle poverty traps and to turn more of the planned growth into jobs. That issue now divides this House and I ask people to stand for jobs on the basis proposed under the motion.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Industrial Dispute at Athlone (Westmeath) Plant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Ward International has been operating successfully in Athlone for about nine years.  It is the subsidiary of an American company and specialises in the manufacture of machines for the making of cardboard boxes.  This company produces between seven and ten high value machines each year and I understand has been trading profitably for at least the past five years.</P>
      <P>This plant has a skilful and dedicated workforce of about 60 employees, drawn from a wide catchment area, many of whom are supporting families, paying mortgages, etc.  Difficulties arose between the workers and the company concerning contracts and agreements about work practices.  Negotiations commenced and the matter was referred for conciliation.</P>
      <P>The conciliation officer heard the case and suggested that the main point of contention &mdash; flexi-time arrangements &mdash; should be resolved between the two parties. He declared that he was available at any time to assist in seeking a resolution to the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lengthy negotiations took place between the two parties with the workers conceding on almost every point.  The workers proposed to return to conciliation and to refer the matter to the Labour Court but the company refused to allow the case to be referred for further conciliation or arbitration.  The workers <Col N="2036" /> were left with no option but to withdraw their labour and they are now in the third week of this industrial action.</P>
    <P>The strike is now at a critical stage with no production at the plant and workers enduring much hardship.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, who is present in the House, discussed the matter with management and workers about three weeks ago but, unfortunately, the strike is continuing.  I call on her to intervene again at this late stage to see if the points of disagreement between the two parties can be resolved amicably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague from County Westmeath for raising this matter and I am glad to have an opportunity to respond.  I share his concern about this firm.  Its workforce is dedicated and it is well known that its management wish to remain in Athlone given that the plant is viable.  As the Deputy said, an impasse has been reached.</P>
      <P>I will not outline the background to the dispute as the Deputy is well aware of the position.  As he said, three weeks ago when strike action was threatened I spoke with management, the unions and the workers and tried, despite the difficulties, to get them to postpone strike action.</P>
      <P>I take the view, which is shared by other Members, that industrial disputes can best be resolved when the parties involved follow the proper procedures in an effort to reach a settlement.  As the Deputy is aware, the matter was referred to the Labour Relations Commission and other agencies but it has not been resolved.  The point was made that the negotiations should be concluded within a reasonable timeframe and that the agreed procedures should be exhausted if an agreement could not be reached at local level.  I suggest that the agreed procedures were not exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that I should <Col N="2037" /> intervene again.  I would encourage both sides to use the machinery that is available. Should either side find it difficult to use that machinery for any reason I would be glad to meet with them separately or together during the next few days or over the weekend to listen to what they have to say and advise them on how best to approach the labour relations machinery available for resolving these difficulties. I have an intense interest in this matter. As well as being the Deputy's constituents, they are my constituents.  They are in my home town.  I am available to consolidate and review the advice I have already offered.  I hope that in the coming weekend we will be able to work through some suggestions and firm up the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment here tonight.  I also wish to thank the Minister for coming in to answer my question.</P>
      <P>The exceptionally wet weather throughout most parts of the country combined with low levels of sunshine and light during the late spring and early summer has created many problems for those people working in all branches of farming.  In my own area of Cavan-Monaghan it has caused serious problems for dairy and livestock producers, expecially as many cattle had to be housed and fed from scarce winter feed and silage was very difficult to make.</P>
      <P>However, tonight I want to speak specfically about the serious problems encountered by potato, vegetable and fruit growers in the eastern part of the country.  According to an independent survey carried out by Teagasc on 160 affected holdings in north Dublin and east Meath, the damage has been very severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rainfall of over 225 per cent above normal in May and over 300 per cent above normal in June, with three inches of rain falling within 24 hours on one <Col N="2038" /> particular day, caused most of the problems. Waterlogging of soil naturally caused the vegetables to rot in the ground.  On one farm there was a total loss of 45 acres of iceberg lettuce, with approximately half a million plants dead; four acres of broccoli, four acres of scallions and one acre of glasshouse lettuce were lost due to the high water table. There are 12 full-time workers and 30 part-time workers employed on that farm alone.</P>
    <P>On another farm, 20 acres of potatoes out of a total of 30 were lost.  A further eight acres sustained an 80 per cent loss and another two acres sustained a 30 per cent loss.  On the same farm one acre of cabbage had a 30 per cent loss and one acre of cauliflower sustained a 50 per cent loss.  A total of 90,000 other plants were lost on the same farm.  On a third farm 32 acres of potatoes were lost, 19 acres sustained 70 per cent loss, 26 acres a 50 per cent loss, 17 acres a 40 per cent loss and eight acres a 20 per cent loss.  Most of this land was rented, so the farmer had to pay for the use of the land regardless of whether or not he made any profit.  His total turnover was £106,000 in 1991, £126,000 in 1992, but it is down this year to approximately £57,000.</P>
    <P>The potato loss in this small area alone comes somewhere in the region of £3.7 million while that for other crops come to around £2 million.  When other counties, such a Wicklow, Wexford, Kildare etc. are taken into account, the total loss would be around £8 million to potato growers and over £2.5 million to vegetable growers.</P>
    <P>This will give the Minister some idea of how serious this problem is for the small number of farmers concerned.  I must point out that many of these farmers are giving employment to people, either on a full-time or part-time basis.  At least 1,000 jobs are at risk.</P>
    <P>These producers have built up this industry at the request of the Government, especially after the establishment <Col N="2039" /> of An Bord Glas, to try to counteract the importation of fruit and vegetables to this country.  They have not only helped to replace many imported products but have also got involved in the export of both fruit and vegetables to Northern Ireland and to the UK.  Many of these producers will be forced out of business if immediate action is not taken to alleviate their problems.</P>
    <P>The restoration of production potential is what these farmers are asking for. Many of them will not be able to finance seed and fertiliser for the new crops because they have not been able to pay for last year's, solely because of the abnormal weather conditions and through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>In the 1985-86 period, when Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture, help was provided to alleviate the problems of the western and northern parts of this country due to severe weather conditions at that time.  More recently the Minister, or at least the Department of Agriculture with the aid of the EC, helped in some way to alleviate the problems of potato producers in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Tonight, we are asking the Minister for immediate action to make sure that these farmers are allowed to remain in production, that they are allowed to gain back some of the hard won markets, not only our own domestic market but also in the places where we had already built up a good name as exporters.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has met with representatives of the groups I mentioned. The pressure is enormous, the needs are great and we are depending on the Minister to come forward with constructive, positive proposals to alleviate this serious problem and allow these intensive and hard working producers not only remain in business but to be given the opportunity to increase employment in this particular field of production.  At a time when there are 300,000 people unemployed we need to take whatever action is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank Deputy Seymour Crawford for raising this issue.  The Department is aware of problems that have arisen and the matter is being examined at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that financial assistance has been provided to mitigate the losses incurred by County Donegal potato growers as a result of the abnormal climatic conditions experienced in that county throughout the latter half of 1992.  This assistance was co-funded from EC Structural Funds and from the national Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should point out that the potato sector is the only significant agricultural sector for which there is no EC common organisation of the market.  There was a serious threat to the survival of seed potato production in the county, which is, of course, of strategic importance to our whole potato sector.</P>
      <P>The Commission has been at pains to point out that there are only limited means available to the Commission to help producers who are faced with such difficulties.  It was never the intention that Community funds be used to compensate for loss of income due to poor weather conditions, which the Commission regard as a normal risk associated with the business of growing crops.  In the case of annual crops the possibility of Community intervention is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available to my Department out of which compensation could be paid for crop losses.  The principal crop affected is potatoes.  My information is that the bad weather has resulted in a general reduction in yields. On the other hand this reduction has been largely compensated for to date by increased prices compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to regaining market share, the losses incurred as a percentage of total production were quite small and I have no doubt that in due course levels of production will at least return to previous <Col N="2041" /> levels.  Having said that, I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping the position under continuous review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch díot as ucht an seans seo a thabhairt dom an cheist phráinneach seo a tharraingt anuas sa Dáil anocht de bharr drochstaid an fhoirgnimh in a bhfuil daltaí ag freastal ar scoil i gCarrandulla i mo dháilcheantar.</P>
      <P>The saga of Corrandulla national school started on 15 July 1979 when the Department of Education suggested that the boys' and girls' schools should be amalgamated and run as one school.  At the time there were six teachers employed between both schools.  A period of time elapsed during which no action was taken.  In 1985 a serious accommodation problem arose in the girls' school and irate parents organised a strike at the school to highlight the deplorable conditions in which their children were being educated.</P>
      <P>In a Seanad debate on the matter in June 1985 the then Minister of State at the Department of Education, Donal Creed, said that the provision of a new school building was the ideal solution to the problem.  At that stage there were eight teachers in the school as there had been a substantial increase in the number of pupils attending the school.  Naturally there was great expectation that, as the Minister suggested in a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a new school building should be provided to overcome the accommodation problems, some action would be taken to fulfil that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1985 there have been visits from architects, engineers, school inspectors, Board of Works officials, Department of Education officials and Ministers of State, all of whom acknowledge the need for a new school, but nothing has happened. The manager of the school, the parents' committee and the teachers have been involved since 1979, and particularly <Col N="2042" /> since 1985, in numerous telephone calls, letter writing and meetings about the matter, but again nothing has happened. On three separate occasions the parents' committee travelled to Dublin where meetings took place with officials from the Department of Education but again nothing was done about the matter.</P>
    <P>Last June I arranged a meeting with the Minister of Education where the parents' committee finally met the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, who assured them that a quantity surveyor would be appointed within one week, by 8 June 1993, and funds would be allocated for the new school in the autumn of this year. When pressed to give a guarantee that money would be allocated in the autumn the Minister pleaded &ldquo;try me&rdquo;, in other words, &ldquo;wait until the autumn and you will see me deliver on my word&rdquo;, it is now almost November, we are saying farewell to the autumn and facing a bleak winter, with another broken promise.</P>
    <P>In a written answer to a parliamentary question which I put down today on this matter I was informed:</P>
    <P>It was not possible to include this project among those to proceed to contract in 1993.  It will be considered for inclusion in the Capital Programme in due course in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>
    <P>The promise in relation to this matter was sincerely made by the Minister and I am very disappointed she is not here tonight to answer this debate.  The Minister said in the same reply that all she has to offer is a further meeting.  However, the meeting is not with herself, as was requested by the school parents' committee, but with the programme manager. She said that officials from her Department would be in contact with the parents' committee to arrange a suitable date.</P>
    <P>There are 260 pupils now attending the school in Corrandulla, in four separate buildings, on three different sites.  The buildings are 120 metres apart along a busy public road.  The four buildings include the girls' old school, built in 1934; <Col N="2043" /> the boys' old school, built in 1946; a prefab classroom provided in 1985 and a mineral bar in a local community hall which was not built today or yesterday.</P>
    <P>After the meeting on 1 June with the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, a certain person was invited towards the end of June to take an appointment as a quantity surveyor and the person accepted. However, that person was not given the relevant documents in relation to this job until 15 September.  It is expected that the quantity surveyor's work will take about six weeks.  There is a real danger now that the promise of funding in 1993 will be broken and that the issue of the Corrandulla school will be put on the long finger.  Tonight I call on the Minister to make a formal commitment to allocate funds in 1993 so that the project can go to tender before the end of November.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would put on record the size of the proposed school, the facilities to be provided and the estimated cost, including the amount of the local contribution which has been paid already.  I would like the Minister to say whether it is true that there are three priority categories of school buildings in the Department and that this school is not even on the first priority list.  If that is true it is disastrous and the parents and management of the school have been hoodwinked.  The saga of the Corrandulla central school has gone on for far too long and I hope that tonight we will be given a commitment to invite tenders as soon as the quantity surveyor completes his work.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that this school serves a very large Gaeltacht area and there is great anger among the parents at the way in which their children are being treated during a vital period of their lives.  The unfulfilled promises made at public meetings are the cause of great dismay among the community in this area.  I hope, despite what we were told by way of written reply, that tonight the Minister will give some hope to the parents, <Col N="2044" /> teachers and children attending this school and will not allow this saga to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity which the Deputy has presented me with to clarify the position in relation to this matter.  As the Deputy is presumably aware, the provision of the new school arises from the agreement in 1990 between the school authorities of Carrabeg girls' and St. Brendan's boys' national schools to amalgamate their two schools.  The accommodation to be provided in the new school will include eight classrooms and ancillary accommodation. The total grant-aid that will be involved for this project, it is estimated, will amount to £300,000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, every school invariably makes the case that its project is deserving of special consideration. Both I and my Department would be more than delighted if, in a world where resources were unlimited, every scheme could proceed at the same time.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, because of the large volume of major building projects on hands and the limitations on resources, it is possible to allow only a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning of the project has been completed, and a quantity surveyor is currently preparing the bill of quantities.  As soon as the bill of quantities has been completed the project will be ready to go to tender.  I and my Department accept that this is a project deserving of the highest priority in the context of projects to be allowed to proceed to construction in 1994.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh as ucht an deis a fháil an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú. Is scoil trí oide i Scoil na hAirde Thiar atá suite ar an gcuid thiar de Charna.  Is ceantar é, aisteach go leor, in a bhfuil an pobal scoile ag méadú seachas ag laghdú. Is maith an scéal é sin agus tá cuid mhaith den bhuíochas ag dul don bhforbairt atá déanta ar thionscal na feilméarachta éisc. Ach má tá an pobal ag méadú níl cóiríocht sásúil scoile ann chor ar bith.  I láthair na huaire tá 70 scoláire idir bhuachaillí agus chailíní ag freastal ar Scoil na hAirde Thiar.  Dhá sheomra ranga atá sa scoil agus sé an tomhais atá ar sheomra ná 18 dtroithe faoi 18 dtroithe.  Tá an tríú rang á mhúineadh i halla beag sa scoil agus siad na tomhais atá ansin ná 18 dtroithe faoi naoi dtroithe. Sin tomhais níos lú ná mar atá sa seomra suite i ghnáth theach cónaithe.</P>
      <P>Tá múinteoirí ag iarraidh múineadh in áit beag bídeach suarach nach bhféadfadh éinne múineadh ann.  Freisin, le duló sheomra amháin go dtí seomra eile, le dul ón seomra sa lár amach go dtí an clós caithfidh tú dul trí ceann de na seomraí ranga.  Anuas ar sin, le dul ón halla, atá in úsáid mar sheomra ranga, go dtí na leithris, caithfidh na scoláirí dul trí dhá seomra ranga.  Anuas air sin ar ndóigh, bíonn ar na múinteoirí feabhais, múinteoirí ceoil agus mar sin de, ranganna a thógáil i gceann de sheomraí ranga na scoláirí.  Freisin, tá trí leithreas sa scoil, ceann amháin do na buachaillí, agus péire do na cailíní.  Is é sin go bhfuil leithreas amháin don 35 bhuachaill agus dhá leithreas idir 35 chailín.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigtear dom go bhfuil tuairiscintí faighte ag an Roinn don tógra seo agus <Col N="2046" /> go ndearnadh tairiscint go gcuirfí dhá sheomra réamh-dhéanta ar fáil.  Níl sé seo sásúil chor ar bith.  Scoil í seo a tógadh sa chéad seo caite, sa 19ú aois.  Caithfidh mé a rá, ar chuairt dom ar an scoil, gurb í seo an scoil ba mheasa dá bhfaca mé riamh, agus an scoil ba lú chóiríocht don uimhir scoláirí ata ann.  Tá sé gar don fharraige in áit fhiáin; níl aon mhaith a bheith ag caint ar sheomraí réamh-dhéanta ansin.  Rinne údaráis na scoile tairiscint go dtí an Roinn tamall ó shin go rabhadar sásta an t-airgead áitiúil, suas agus anuas le £6,000, a chur ar fáil láithreach don Roinn.  Dúirt siad leis an Roinn go mbeidís sásta dul ar aghaidh le tógáil láithreach ar an gcoinníoll go gcaithfí i mbliana an t-airgead a bhíothas sásta a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na seomraí réamh-dhéanta agus go gcuirfí fuíollach an airgid ar fáil i 1994 leis an jab a chríochnú.</P>
    <P>I gcomhthéacs na scoile b'fhacthas domsa go mba tairiscint an-réasúnta é sin.  Tuigtear dom gurb é costas iomlán na scéime seo ná thart ar £40,000.  Le haghaidh scoil den mhéid seo, le haghaidh an uimhir seo daltí, le haghaidh scoil nach bhfuair airgead riamh ón Stát seo ó bunaíodh é, feictear dom gur beag an méid é sin le cur ar fáil do scoil bheag Ghaeltachta a bhfuil cóiríocht chomh míshásúil sin ar fáil ann.</P>
    <P>Mar sin iarraim ar an Aire breathnú go fíor-bháúil ar an gcás seo agus cead a thabhairt láithreach dul ar aghaidh le tógáil an chéid chuid den togra seo ar an tuiscint go gcríochnófar é i 1994.  Ní féidir an rud seo a fhágáil ar an méar fhada agus tá sé in am anois go mbeadh gníomh ar an togra seo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current enrolment at this school is 69 pupils, and the accommodation comprises two permanent classrooms.  Following the appointment of a second assistant teacher at the school by the Department it became necessary to provide <Col N="2047" /> additional accommodation.  Architectural planning was, accordingly, initiated on the provision of a permanent extension to include a classroom and toilet accommodation.  The planning process has now been completed and the estimated cost of the project is £45,000.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, because of the large volume of major building projects on hands and the limitations on resources, it is only possible to allow a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year.  Unfortunately it was not possible to include this project in the national schools' capital programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school authorities have offered to accept a phased grant towards the cost of the proposed extension <Col N="2048" /> in return for its inclusion in the 1993 programme.  While I appreciate the generosity of this offer, I regret that it would not be possible to select projects on the basis of proposals of this type.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the acceptance of such a proposal would set a precedent which could be emulated by other school authorities and would damage the Department's credibility in relation to the Minister's commitment to install an equitable system for the selection of projects for inclusion in the capital programme.  I am aware of the Deputy's commitment to this project and I wish to assure him that the Department will fully consider his proposals when the 1994 priority list is being drawn up.</P>

      <P>Major improvement works are currently in progress on two sections of the N22.  Earthworks and general preliminaries are well underway on the realignment of approximately 6km of roadway between Ballyvourney and the Kerry county boundary.  This scheme will cost an estimated £7.58 million and is expected to be completed in 1995.  Works are also well advanced on the Minish-Curraglass scheme in County Kerry. At present, resurfacing work is being carried out from Curraglass to Garries Bridge and work on the provision of a new bridge over the River Flesk at Killaha is in progress.  The entire project is due for completion by 1995 at an estimated cost of £12 million.</P>
      <P>The carrying out of further major improvement works on the route in the period up to 1999 will be considered in the preparation of the relevant operational programme under the National Development Plan.</P>

        <i>Wexford)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I intend that the national recycling strategy envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government should be completed as early as possible in the new year.  This strategy will address all major issues related to the promotion of recycling in Ireland, including: pricing and market considerations, expanding recycling capacity within Irish industry, organisation of collection systems for recyclables, allocation of responsibilities between different players in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and the formulation of national targets.  An important background to the national strategy will be provided by the draft EC Directive on Packaging Waste which is currently under negotiation.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I published a major consultancy study on recycling in Ireland as an input to the preparation of a national strategy.  I invited industry, local authority, consumer and environmental interests to submit their views on the complex issues raised in the study and I am currently evaluating the responses. To complete the consultation process, I intend to hold a conference next month to consider these responses and other issues in more detail.</P>

      <P>The protection of inland and coastal waterways from pollution is a priority objective of the water and sanitary services programme.  The environmental action programme outlined the Government's commitment to this objective which is reaffirmed in the National Development Plan.  EC support for the programme will be available through the Cohesion and Structural Funds.  I am determined that the benefits of the considerable Exchequer and EC investment available to the programme should be maximised and that as many new treatment facilities as possible should be commissioned over the period of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>No such commitment was given. In urging Dublin Corporation to secure improvements in their housing maintenance and management operations, Minister of State Stagg suggested that privatisation of the service might arise if the necessary improvements did not take place.  It is a matter for the corporation to consider the options for achieving such improvements, and to implement, as quickly as possible, the necessary changes. The Minister of State dealt with the position clearly in his contribution in Seanad Éireann on 2 June, 1993 to a debate on the Government's housing policy.  In the course of that statement, he pointed out that the present situation was unsatisfactory and that local authorities must develop new systems of management and maintenance to provide better value for the substantial expenditure &mdash; some £80 million annually &mdash; on these services.  I fully support that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing legislation enables local authorities to make whatever arrangements they deem appropriate, including the use of outside contractors, for their maintenance operations.  In addition, section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, enables housing authorities to delegate housing management <Col N="1892" /> functions, including the maintenance of dwellings, to designated bodies representing residents of the area.</P>

The community council were advised that no proposal for the provision of such a site had been submitted to my Department.  That is still the position.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The basis for the EC Commissioner's carbon/energy tax proposal is that, together with other measures, it should help to achieve stabilisation of CO2 emissions at overall Community level by the year 2000 relative to 1990.  Community policy also, however, recognises that member states, like Ireland, whose development is imcomplete should not be required to achieve this stabilisation nationally but should be allowed targets and strategies which can accommodate growth.</P>
      <P>Ireland's national climate change strategy, published in June 1993, estimated that the growth in Irish CO2 emissions to the year 2000 will be contained to 20 per cent, or to 11 per cent taking account of increased CO2 absorption arising from our accelerated afforestation programme. These increases do not include provision for the effects of an energy tax. Relevant, but not directly applicable, research carried out by ESRI in 1991 estimated that an energy tax could reduce energy demand by 3-4 per cent with a similar reduction in CO2 emissions. These estimates do not however reflect the precise proposal now evolving at EC level.</P>

Comments sent to the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, following consultation with relevant Government Departments and local authorities, indicated that all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that any discharges to water from the mine do not lead to a disimprovement of the quality of the receiving waters and that a detailed programme of monitoring and sampling would be essential if the project is approved.  Particular emphasis was placed on the need to ensure that water quality in the Owenreagh River, an established salmonoid river forming part of the Foyle system, remains within the parameters of EC Directive 78/659.

      <P>The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for this scheme examined a number of options for the location of the proposed outfall pipe.  Following consideration of the EIS and submissions received from interested parties, I certified in December 1992 that, subject to certain modifications, the proposed development would not have significant adverse effects on the environment.  This statutory determination in effect approved the recommendation of the EIS to site the outfall pipe at Rinnashark Channel.</P>

      <P>Article 138 (3) of the Treaties establishing the European Communities, as amended by the Treaty on European Union &mdash; the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; provides that the European Parliament shall draw up proposals for uniform procedures for elections to the Parliament.

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Parliament has adopted a resolution setting out broad principles for electoral procedure, the immediate priority for the Council in the electoral area is to put arrangements in place for the exercise of the right conferred on EC nationals by Article 8b2 of the Maastricht Treaty to vote and stand as candidates in the member states of residence at the <Col N="1901" /> 1994 and future European elections.  The European Parliament Elections Bill, 1993, which was presented to the Dáil last week, will enable that right to be exercised here.  Ireland's representatives will, of course, participate fully in the consideration of detailed proposals for a uniform electoral procedure at the appropriate time.  It may be taken, however, that such a procedure will not be in place for the European Parliament elections to be held in 1994.</P>

      <P>A series of EC Directives is now being developed to provide for stricter and more specific controls on all vehicle emissions so as to minimise air pollution from this sector.

Further Directives have been adopted, or are in prospect, to cover other categories of vehicles, including large public transport vehicles.

      <P>Pay increases for senior managers in industry are a matter for negotiation and agreement between them, their representatives and their employers in accordance with the voluntary nature of our free collective bargaining system.  A number of surveys provide some information on developments in relation to senior executives' pay.  However these need to be analysed carefully.  Very often such factors as performance related pay, bonuses, merit awards and other elements of remuneration are included on top of basic pay increases.</P>
      <P>Pay moderation is an important component of competitiveness and I should expect that pay increases for senior managers would take this into account as well as respecting the provisions for basic pay increases set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

        <i>Wexford)</i>: Directive 91/542/EEC lays down emission standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulates from certain new vehicles &mdash; mainly trucks and buses.  The first stage of the Directive was to have been implemented in all member states from 1 October, 1993.  However, in order to overcome difficulties of disposing of remaining stocks of non-complying new vehicles by that date, the Commission and member states have recently agreed on transitional arrangements for these vehicles.  As soon as these transitional arrangements have been formally adopted by the Commission, Directive 91/542/EEC will be transposed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The present compulsory vehicle testing scheme for heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances involves checks on emissions of smoke from diesel engines, carbon monoxide and uncombusted hydrocarbons from petrol engines, and noise from both.  The scheme will be extended in 1993-94 to include a biennial test for light goods vehicles over four years old.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 177, 178, 179 180 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested is provided in the following tabular statement based on data available to my Department.  It should be noted with regard to calf slaughterings that these are usualy carried out under disease eradication measures rather than for veal.  It should also be noted that condemnations usually arise on the basis of post mortem inspection or sampling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to condemn part or all of a carcase is taken on the basis of the product not being fit for human consumption. Condemnation of TB reactors because of emaciation is unusual.  The information requested on weights of totally or partially condemned carcases or immature carcases condemned is not available as these are not normally weighed.  The number of cattle slaughtered <Col N="1923" /> which has failed the TB and brucellosis tests is answered as part of Parliamentary Question No. 182.</P>
    <P>Our records show that condemnations due to treatment with illegal substances as a percentage of cattle slaughterings increased from 0.01 per cent in 1989 to <Col N="1924" /> 0.03 per cent in 1992.  The vast majority of condemnations are due to factors outside the control of farmers.  However, producers should always ensure that their production methods do not entail any activity which could give rise to condemnation of their animals as being unfit for human consumption.</P>

      <P>Brucellosis reactors are all female animals whereas TB and BSE reactors would consist of animals of all categories.</P>
      <P>In the case of BSE, it is the policy of my Department to facilitate the voluntary depopulation of the herd in which a case occurs; 2,857 and 3,288 animals were slaughtered respectively in 1990 and 1991 under this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Staff in local <Col N="1925" /> offices are fully engaged in processing applications under the various 1993 headage and premium schemes, I regret that the time required to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy, on an office by office basis would not be justified.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable increase in the number of applications under the various measures introduced by the CAP reform.  Total applications under the 1993 livestock schemes are expected to exceed 600,000.  The comparable figure for 1992 was 420,000.</P>
      <P>Many of the schemes are highly complex both from the farmers point of view and in their administration.  To meet the various additional demands, the administration of the special beef premium Scheme has now been centralised in Portlaoise. In addition arrangements are being made to provide additional resources in a number of local offices. Some other options are also being considered to facilitate speedier payments between now and the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The overall objective is to secure the maximum level of livestock headage and premia payments for farmers in 1993.</P>

      <P>The storage and disposal of all radioactive waste in Ireland is subject to control by licence under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977 (S.I. No. 166 of 1977).  These licensing controls are operated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Radioactive material, in both sealed and unsealed form, is imported for use in industrial, medical and laboratory applications under licence from the Institute.  At present, all imported sealed radioactive sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the Institute prior to the issue of a licence.  In relation to unsealed sources and sealed sources imported before the introduction of regulatory controls, the licensee is obliged to store waste material on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
      <P>Inspections of storage of radioactive substances are carried out by the Institute.  I am satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a manner which does not pose a hazard to people and property.</P>
      <P>The Institute have, however, recommended the establishment of a centralised waste management facility and considers that the availability of such a facility is an essential element of good radiological protection practice.  My Department is keeping the question of the establishment of a centralised waste management facility under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1990, which were introduced in May of that year, have been a success in that they have succeeded in creating a greater awareness of the necessity to restrict and prohibit tobacco consumption in a variety of public areas and facilities including; schools and colleges, theatres and cinemas, restaurants and canteens, kitchens, public offices, public transport and waiting areas.  Enforcement, which is carried out by Environmental Health Officers, has been largely successful.</P>
