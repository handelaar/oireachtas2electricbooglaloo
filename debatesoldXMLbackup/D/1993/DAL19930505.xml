      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: 1.  Nos. 1 and 3 shall be decided without debate and 2. the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 7, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 pm. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 10.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 1 and 3 be decided without debate satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 3 relates to debates on the past activities of the European Community.  This matter has been debated already, so one cannot ask for it to be debated a second time.  Does the Taoiseach consider that we do need a debate on the options for the use of European Structural and Cohesion Funds before decisions are taken?  The Irish people, through this House, are entitled to be consulted on these decisions because it is their money, not that of the Government, that will be spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the repetition because I said yesterday that decisions in the first instance are a matter for Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government see no merit in allowing Members of this House to have an input into this matter? I remember particularly Deputy Quinn when he was in Opposition making much of the need for a timely consultative and debating process before decisions were taken.  Now that he and his colleagues are in Government with Fianna Fáil, is the Toaiseach going to follow the advice offered by Deputy Quinn when in Opposition and allow a debate in this House before decisions are taken to commit the people's money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the question asked by Deputy Bruton is in order as it arises in respect of a note which you submitted to Members pointing out what is in order, that is, matters relating to Bills and other documents referred to on the Order Paper.  Item No. 5 on today's Order Paper deals with Estimates and those Estimates are listed on a number of pages.  It is clear from this year's Budget Statement that the Estimates for many Departments include anticipated Structural Fund expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw your attention, Sir, to the fact that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government that the Structural Funds will be discussed in the National Economic and Social Forum which includes not only politicians but also the social partners.  The Taoiseach appears to be reneging on this commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach willing to give a commitment to a discussion in this House on the use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds before decisions are taken so that opinions about options may be offered by all elected Members?  It is not only members of the Cabinet who were elected to make these decisions; all of us have an opinion to offer which might be useful.  Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that there will be a debate on this matter before decisions are taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a new system for discussing Estimates.  If Deputies Cox and Bruton want to discuss aspects of EC funds that are part of the Estimates, they will have every opportunity to do so during the Estimates debates.  The choices that have to be made in relation to Structural Funds are the responsibility of the Government and we have to stand <Col N="468" /> over them.  Opposition parties have the freedom to ask that we put in everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Order, <Col N="469" /> with which I do not disagree, says that the Bill will finish at 5 p.m.  However, it says that only amendments acceptable to the Minister for Justice will be taken. Will the Taoiseach say whether the Minister for Justice will be here to take the Bill because so far in this Dáil she has not taken a Committee Stage of any Bill? It is a disgrace that we constantly have to deal with the Minister of State, although he is a very able Deputy.  The Minister is very good at making statements outside this House, but she has not yet taken an opportunity to come into this House and deal with Committee Stage of any Bills from her Department.  Will the Minister be here this morning to take this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of peace in Europe I am sure that all of us in this House will be concerned that the decision is taken to day by the remaining party to agree to the Vance/Owen plan in Bosnia. That being the case, the question will arise about Irish participation.  The Government indicated that legislation to allow Ireland to participate in peace enforcement will be considered in the context of Somalia, in reply to Question No. 178 of 4 May.  Will the Taoiseach state whether the Government considered whether Irish troops would take part in peace enforcement in Europe, in Bosnia in particular, in the event that an agreement is reached?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government acknowledged that it has a request to consider this matter in respect of UNSOM, concerning Somalia.  The same issue of principle arises with regard to Bosnia.  In view of the importance of a timely response on this issue for the sake of peace in Europe, is the Government prepared to make an early decision on whether it will promote legislation to enable Irish troops to participate in both those locations for the preservation of peace and the saving of life?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>When we discussed this issue on Thursday last before the House moved on to other matters the Minister had given an indication that he intended to bring in an amendment &mdash; presumably on Report Stage since there is no amendment down in his name for Committee Stage &mdash; to substitute the Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Forces in lieu of a nominated officer of the Defence Forces.  The Fine Gael Party and I had tabled an amendment to that effect.  That would put the person who is responsible for initiating the interception of a telecommunications message in the Defence Forces on the same footing as the Garda Síochána; in other words the head of the Garda Síochána and the head of the Permanent Defence Forces &mdash; other than the President &mdash; in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his willingness to accept this amendment.  As Deputy Gilmore said, this matter has been well aired and I hope we can finish Committee Stage today, perhaps before lunch because the Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill, 1993 will be debated later.  I should like to reiterate what I said on the Order of Business this <Col N="476" /> morning and I do not mean to be unfair to anybody.  I have been a Minister of State and I know the responsibilities of officeholders and particularly of the Minister for Justice.  The Department of Justice is one of the law reform Departments of State but thankfully the civil side of law reform has gone to another Department.  It is quite appalling and unacceptable that we have yet to see the Minister for Justice in this Dáil come into the House and deal with the Committee Stage of a Bill.  It is unfair to the House and it is unfair on the Minister of State, althought he does not need me to defend him.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether there is a delegation order giving him responsibility to take particular Bills through the Houses of the Oireachtas? When will we see the Minister in the House doing the real work on Committee and Report Stages of Bills rather than simply opening the debate, followed by nice glossy PR and statements all over the country?  The Minister's first duty is to this House and to be here to listen to Deputies' contributions and to deal with the tedious Committee Stages of Bills.  I hope this is the last time we have to take a Bill through the House without the presence of the Minister for Justice.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> While I agree with Deputy Harney and what she has said about the absence of the Minister, I am not unduly upset because we have such an able Minister of State who actually proves that all the intelligence is not confined to Government. Most Ministers cannot listen to anything that is said on this side of the House.  I listened to the debate on the Refugee Protection Bill, 1993, last night and having heard some of the comments from the far side of the House I began to wonder whether we were living in two different worlds.  It is good to know the Minister can accept one of our amendments because it is commonsense. I compliment him for having the intelligence and being sufficiently broadminded not to think that everything on this side of the House is wrong.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their kind remarks.  We are discussing amendments Nos. 5 and 5a in the names of Deputies Gilmore, Jim Mitchell, Brown and Harney.  The effect of amendment No. 5 would be to substitute the Chief of Staff for the person not below the rank of colonel who would submit the application for authorisation on the grounds of State security.  The effect of amendment No. 5a would be to restrict the powers of the Defence Forces to apply for authorisations.  As I said on the last day, I am prepared to accept the substance of amendment No. 5.  I cannot accept it as it stands because it requires consequential amendments to section 7 and possibly also to the definitions sections.  I suspect we will use the words &ldquo;Chief of Staff&rdquo; in the actual section and in the definitions section we will have a definition stating that the &ldquo;Chief of Staff&rdquo; means &ldquo;the Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Forces&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 5a, originally submitted by Deputy Gilmore, I have listened carefully to the arguments and some very good points have been made but for the reasons already stated, unfortunately I cannot accept that amendment.  I have taken further advice on this matter since our discussion the last day.  Basically, we are putting the administrative practice into statutory form.  People will be aware that if an administrative system is put on a statutory footing it is made applicable in accordance with statute law.  By its nature an administrative procedure is loose and it allows room for the administrators to manoeuvre.  Our intention is to put it on a legal basis and tighten it up.  We are putting the present administrative system which operates in relation to Army intelligence, where the security of the State is in danger, on a statutory basis &mdash; no more and no less.</P>

      <P>I accept it is an improvement that the applicant for an authorisation in the case of the armed forces will now be the Chief of Staff.  Nevertheless there is a fundamental issue which <Col N="478" /> has not been resolved by this discussion and it relates to the extent to which the armed forces should have a role in policing the civilian population.  My proposed amendment provided for a mechanism whereby if there was a threat to the security of the State involving a member of the Defence Forces, the Defence Forces, through the Chief of Staff, would have the right to apply for an authorisation.  In the case of a civilian, it would be proper that any such application should be routed through the Garda.  It would be very dangerous to have the Defence Forces involved in what is essentially the policing of the civilian population.  We have argued the point considerably at this stage and I think we should now dispose of it.  I would ask you to formally put the question.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the cessation of interceptions.  Where the Commissioner of the Garda or, presumably, the Chief of Staff come to the conclusion that an authorisation is no longer required, that it is no longer necessary to intercept telephone calls or post, etc., they will negative the authorisation. Once an authorisation is given there is a tendency for it to stay in effect unless the Commissioner of the Chief of Staff seeks to have it negatived.  Will the Minister clarify what controls there are?  Is it the case when authorisations are granted they will begin to stockpile?  I am concerned that the Commissioner of the Garda may not go through the authorisations that have been granted and seek to have them set aside.  What assurance can the Minister give that this aspect of the legislation will be monitored so that there will be no stockpiling of authorisations?</P>

      <P>Section 2 provides that an authorisation, once given, will only remain in existence for three months and if the Garda or the security forces want to extend it they must go through the initial procedures again.</P>
      <P>Section 7 relates to an authorisation that is voluntarily given up by the authority which got it in the first place.  In the case of an authorisation which has existed for, say, one month and which is no longer yielding any useful information, the Commissioner and/or the Chief of Staff can voluntarily terminate the authorisation. They do not have to inform the Taoiseach where it is compulsorily terminated by a complaints referee or the presiding judge.  If it is a voluntary termination there is no need to inform the Taoiseach or the Minister for Communications.  If an authorisation has been in existence for a month and has not been voluntarily terminated and it comes to the attention of the authorised judge who is supervising the procedure that it is no longer useful, he can order it to be terminated.</P>

      <Col N="480" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;At the end of the six month period following the enactment of this Act and at the expiration of every subsequent six month period the Minister shall publish or cause to have published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> a report which shall include the following details in respect of the period in question:</P>
      <P>(a)&nbsp; the number of warrants issued for the interception of postal packages; the number of addresses in respect of which such warrants were issued; and the number of postal packets intercepted.</P>
      <P>(b)&nbsp; the number of warrants issued for the interception of telecommunications messages; the number of addresses or mobile units in respect of which such warrants were issued; and the number of telecommunications messages intercepted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides for a review of the operation of the Act by a judge of the High Court.  Of its nature this is an area where confidentiality necessarily forms part of the operation of the legislation.  I entirely accept that the monitoring of persons suspected of criminal or subversive activity must be dealt with in a very confidential and discreet way.  One obviously cannot advertise whose post or telephone calls are being intercepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is necessary that the public should have some information regarding the extent of theuse of the powers provided for in this legislation and that needs to be done in a way that is simpler, more open and more transparent than the periodic reviews provided for in section 8. The mechanism I propose is simple; every six months following the enactment of this legislation, information should appear in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> relating to the <Col N="481" /> number of authorisations that have been issued, the number of interceptions that have been effected and the number of addresses in respect of which warrants have been issued.  That type of information is very necessary, first to provide the public with information regarding the extent to which this legislation is being used and, second, to assure the public that there is no abuse of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are provisions in the Bill regarding the procedure that must be followed in requesting authorisation. We debated here before the concern that some of us on this side of the House have in regard to oral requests for authorisations.  We know that what gave rise to the publication of this Bill related to what appeared to be a very close relationship between senior personnel in the Garda and Government Ministers.  We have to protect against the legislation being abused and it is desirable that the public have information about the extent of the use of the legislation, be able to see, for example, from one six-month period to the next if there is any change.  If one found in a particular six-month period after, say, a change of Government that there was a dramatic rise in the numbers of authorisations and warrants being issued, one might draw the conclusion that there was other than a legitimate enthusiasm on the part of the Minister to crack down on crime.  There is a need to provide basic information to the public about the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The information sought in the amendment is purely numerical and does not compromise or prejudice the confidentiality of matters relating to the identity of those whose telephones are being tapped or whose post is being intercepted. Therefore, it does not compromise the operational effectiveness of the legislation in dealing with crime or subversive activities.  It is purely a provision to provide the public with information and to give them an assurance that the legislation will not be abused at some time in the future by an enthusiastic Minister operating closely with an enthusiastic Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <Col N="482" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment, which is reasonable. When I first read it I thought the question of confidentiality might be breached because I am concerned that the addresses of persons whose telephones are tapped would not be released, for their own sake and because of the security and crime implications.  Deputy Gilmore has got it right.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance made a speech a few days ago about a new Freedom of Information Bill.  I would welcome legislation in regard to freedom of information because I am aware how difficult it is to get basic information from the State, even about people's basic entitlements.  As a Minister of State, I often saw files with the words &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo; written across the top of them which did not contain any information that could not be given to the country at large.  We are paranoid about confidentiality, we inherited that from the British and the sooner we get rid of it the better.  If a Freedom of Information Bill is introduced then the basic information sought in this amendment should not cause a problem.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment does not request the peoples' names, addresses or telephone numbers should be given, it simply requests the necessary data for a review or an analysis of the legislation.  Such data is lacking, the Minister's Department has not published an up-to-date report on the prison service since 1988.  Therefore, people cannot get basic information to compile statistics and do analytical or basic research work to allow them to put forward intelligent suggestions regarding legislation.  The same applies to the probation service.  The last report on the operation of the probation service was also published in 1988.  Therefore, basic information is not forthcoming from Government, particularly from the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the implementation of this legislation, will a Deputy be able to seek the information referred to in the amendment by way of a Dáil question?  The Deputy would probably be told that the information sought is confidential and <Col N="483" /> cannot be given or, as frequently happens, that it would take an inordinate amount of staff time to compile it.  I have been given that answer on many occasions when I petitioned the Minister. The Minister of State referred to the fact that he would need a wheelbarrow to bring documentation to the <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> office so that we could get basic information about the number of petitions to the Minister and the decisions taken regarding them.  It is impossible to get basic information.  We act on behalf of the public; as one of my colleagues stated on a number of occasions, we are contractors to the public.  The public has a right to basic information and, by inserting this amendment in the legislation, such information would have to be published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil,</i> the official publication of the State.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not offensive and if the Minister is unhappy with its wording, I ask him to at least state that he will table a similar amendment on Report Stage.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore would be happy with that.  The amendment strikes a balance between the need to protect sources so that crime and the possible subversion of the State can be investigated and the need to protect the confidentiality of the people whose telephones or postal packages are being intercepted, yet gives citizens the basic information to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When I first read the amendment I had visions of investigative journalists identifying the five people whose telephones had been tapped and all sorts of articles being written in that regard.  However, as we have now put 'phone tapping into the legitimate world of business there is no reason the information sought should not be available in a democracy because the interception of postal packets and 'phone tapping should be done only on a legal basis.  Therefore, everybody should be entitled to know how many times there was a need for this.  The information sought in Deputy Gilmore's amendment should be available.  As the people <Col N="484" /> involved will not be named, there should not be any adverse consequences.  It will probably lead to newspaper headings referring to suspected people but that will only happen because of the desire of journalists to fill space.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points about freedom of information.  As a back-bencher, I frequently experienced the type of frustration about which Deputy Harney spoke in trying to get information from various Departments.  As Deputies will be aware, the information referred to in Deputy Gilmore's amendment is not supplied although the reasons are not clear.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment, the designated judge appointed will have the duty of publishing a report every two years.  That does not mean he cannot publish a report more frequently.  It will be up to the designated judge to decide whether his reports, which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, should contain the statistical information referred to in the amendment.  There may be a valid reason for not supplying the information sought in Deputy Gilmore's amendment in the designated judge's report.  However, as it is our intention to appoint a High Court judge to oversee the operation of this Act, it would be better to let him decide if such information should be included.  He will be dealing with individual cases in a position to get all the necessary papers.  He will have a close-up view of the operation of the Act and the implications of leasing such statistical information.  That is the approach we are adopting at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not addressed the question.  The procedure in section 8 for reviewing the operation of the Act by a judge of the High Court is acceptable.  My understanding of the section is that that review will include a judge of the High Court examining the justification for the interception of information.  That judge will have an opportunity to examine the documentation, to talk to the relevant people <Col N="485" /> and make an observation as to whether there was abuse in a particular area. However, it is not clear that a judge of the High Court will provide the type of information I am seeking.  Even if he did, section 8 (8) gives the Taoiseach an effective veto in relation to the publication of any material contained in the judge's report.  That subsection states that if the Taoiseach considers, after consultation with the designated judge, the publication of any matter in a report under subsection (2) of this section would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State, the Taoiseach may exclude that matter from the copies of the report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Notwithstanding the requirement to consult with the judge concerned, that effectively gives the Taoiseach a veto on the publication of information.  We do not live in an ideal world, the circumstances which give rise to the public concern which led to the introduction of this Bill were based on the fallibility of Ministers and senior Garda personnel.</P>
      <P>We know that there can be abuse.  This legislation gives very extensive powers to the Minister and to the Garda to intervene in what most of us would regard normally as private telephone conversations and private correspondence between people.  We accept that in order to deal with the combating of crime and threats of subversion it is necessary, on occasion, for the State to intervene and obtain information which would be essential in detecting or preventing crime. That is accepted by this House, but what we must ensure is that the powers which are given to the Minister in this legislation will not be abused.  How can we do that? One way this can be done is by the provision in the Bill which allows a review by a High Court judge.  While that is acceptable it still does not make public abuses of the legislation for, let us say, political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred here before to the way in which the Government in a neighbouring State defined the word &ldquo;subversion&rdquo; during an industrial dispute.  During the miners' dispute the Government of the <Col N="486" /> United Kingdom at that time regarded the miners' dispute as an act of subversion. Many of us would regard the miners' dispute as an industrial dispute &mdash; a nasty industrial dispute &mdash; and one which had many knock-on effects and which brought strikers into conflict with the police.  But to regard it as an act of subversion seems to me to be stretching the point somewhat.  Governments and Ministers can often become paranoid about what they regard as subversion. Governments, Taoisigh and Ministers who are concerned, for example, with the pursuit of power or the retention of power for its own sake, can sometimes see threats to the security of their positions as tantamount to a threat to the security of the State.</P>
    <P>For example, if a Minister were to come to the conclusion, as happened here before, that the writings of a journalist amounted to a threat to the security of the State and issued authorisations against large numbers of people who might be engaged in political or trade union activity, the public in that case would need to see that information.  Once we have an early indication of the figures &mdash; I suspect they will be more than the five mentioned by Deputy Browne &mdash; the public will be aware of the size of the problem.  In regard to organised crime, subversion and so on, one would know within, let us say, the first six months the number of authorisations which were required in that period.  Most of us would understand that there would be some variance in that figure from time to time. There might perhaps be some considerable increase in it at certain times when there might be a dramatic rise in crime or concerns about particular forms of organised crime.  If one were to see, for example, large increases in the numbers of authorisations or increases associated with changes of Government, changes of Minister or changes of Garda Commissioner, it might give rise to a certain amount of concern.</P>
    <P>The issue here is a question of information on which the public can reach certain conclusions concerning the operation of this legislation.  It is an additional <Col N="487" /> safeguard for the public; it is information that the public is entitled to have.  The Minister indicated he was not entirely clear as to why this information was not being provided.  I am happy to leave the matter until Report Stage if he wishes to clarify that between now and then. However, I do not see any reason why numerical information of the type I am seeking cannot be made available. Deputy Harney and Deputy Browne have both strongly supported this amendment and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it and perhaps take it on board.</P>
    <P>Those of us in Opposition are required to toil without the assistance of the expertise available to the Minister. Therefore, if there are technical difficulties with the amendment I am happy to take account of that.  However, this amendment would insert a provision in this legislation which would assure myself and the public that the chances of it being abused would be greatly minimised.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of what Deputy Gilmore has said regarding Report Stage, the Minister suggested that the judge might decide to publish the information.  On my reading of the section the judge has no choice in the matter because he reports to the Taoiseach or to the Ministers.  His decision to publish would be very limited. Without being too frivolous, judging by the way the present Taoiseach does not provide information in the Dáil I doubt if he will stick his neck out and publish this information without having the relevant provision in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's response because he said on the one hand he could not think of a reason not to accept the amendment, and he could not think what reason a judge might have for not making available this type of information.  Yet he wants to leave it solely to the discretion of the judge.  The Minister pre-empts the amendment in my name but since he has a majority I am sure he is giving me an <Col N="488" /> indication that he will not be accepting it.  However, as I said on the last occasion, a national paranoia seems to exist where unless you have a judge you do not have a fair and impartial person.  I find this hard to accept.  That is not to say that I will not make a proposal at some future stage which would require the competence of a judge and I do not wish the Minister to hold me on that.  The Minister wants to leave the decision to a judge and I do not think that is acceptable.</P>
      <P>At the very least, the Minister must provide in the legislation the kind of framework that will indicate to the judge what is expected of him in his report.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that if he or she &mdash; I envisage there might be a &ldquo;she&rdquo; involved and I hope there will be &mdash; felt it necessary to inform the public about the number of warrants issued, that would be acceptable.  However, if judges felt for some reason that the public had not the right to this information, they would not make it available.  That is not good enough and it files in the face of all we have heard from this Government regarding openness, accessibility to information and the proposed freedom of information Act.</P>

    <P>What we are requesting here is very basic information.  We want to ensure that the new legislation which we are putting in place will avoid the kind of difficulties that arose in the past which allowed Ministers to abuse their positions, in co-operation with others, and to invade the privacy of journalists.  I hope we never see that situation arising again but in recent times we saw the invasion of privacy not through telephone tapping but through the recording of a telephone conversation and its subsequent presentation to a newspaper.  I do not want to go into that issue because the newspaper in question has apologised.  They had the good grace to take that action. However, we must be careful and we must place on a statutory basis the safeguards that we all wish to see.  I do not wish to have legislation so stringent that we would prevent the investigation of crime.  We give a fair amount of flexibility to the Garda Síochána and those who <Col N="489" /> investigate crime on our behalf.  I do not see why access to basic statistical information, which Deputy Gilmore's amendment seeks, cannot be provided for under this Bill.  There should be a statutory obligation on the Government to produce such information in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> If the Minister could give me a good reason for rejecting this amendment I would probably be inclined to accept it, but I cannot understand how the Minister can think of no reason and yet will not accept the amendment.  If we are to have change in this House, and debates are to be meaningful, when a Minister of State can think of no good reason why an amendment should not be accepted that should be good enough reason to adopt it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has reasonably said that his amendment need not necessarily be accepted as there may be some technical problem in regard to it.  The Minister has a plethora of people in the office of the Minister, the parliamentary draftsperson's office, the Office of the Attorney General and so on available to him and he is in a better position to frame a technical amendment that could overcome any difficulties. The spirit of what Deputy Gilmore is seeking should be addressed by the Minister and an amendment should be introduced on Report Stage to provide for the issuing of basic statistical information.</P>

      <P>If I wanted to be contentious I could say Deputy Harney's assertion that the Government is hung up on the idea that nothing is fair unless a judge is involved and that there cannot be a a fair and impartial person apart from a judge, contradicts much of Deputy McDowell's argument last night in regard to the Refugee Protection Bill, 1993 and, indeed, much of Deputy Shatter's argument also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will be debating that with Deputy Harney in due course. The Deputy stated that I could think of no good reason for rejecting this amendment. <Col N="490" /> No good reason immediately occurs to me but I must take the advice of the experts in this regard.  The Department of Justice is of the view that in certain circumstances the release of such information might be prejudicial to the prevention of crime or to the preservation of the security of the State.  They are the people who have been dealing with legislation every day since the foundation of the State and I have been in this Department only 13 months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore made the point that the Bill provides extensive powers to the Minister for Justice but I argue that is not so.  Those powers exist in an administrative way but this Bill puts them on a statutory footing which, if anything, restricts them.  We are putting them not only on a statutory footing by making the Minister act in accordance with the law but we are providing also two new fundamental safeguards in respect of the complaints referee and the designated judge.  The designated judge has total discretion in respect of what he reports, for example statistical matters, the general operation of the provisions of the Bill, the number of violation of the Act and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore said there is a veto and he recognises the reason for the Taoiseach's veto in relation to what will be contained in the report to be brought before the Dáil.  The veto, contained in section 8 (8), refers specifically to matters that would be prejudicical to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State.  It obliges the Taoiseach to consult with the designated judge before he may exclude any information and obliges the designated judge also to state in his report to the House whether any information has been excluded.  The Taoiseach has the final say in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A High Court judge has experience of the law and is the person designated to review this procedure.  If the Taoiseach of the day were to have a discussion with a High Court judge and hold the view that the release of figures may in some way be prejudicial to the security of the State or the prevention of crime and the <Col N="491" /> High Court judge disagrees with that view, the Taoiseach, the person overseeing the Act and responsible for bringing the report before the House, may insist on excluding such figures.  Deputies would not have to use their imagination to realise that such discussions would give rise to political difficulties for the Taoiseach. That position could not continue indefinitely and the procedure for consultation with the High Court judge is not in place, as it were, for window-dressing; it has a real effect.</P>
    <P>On why this information is not issued, there may not be any difficulty in stating at present so many official warrants exist but having listened to Deputy Gilmore, I am aware of one reason it might be dangerous to reveal this information on an ongoing basis.  It would highlight a pattern in relation to crime.  The initial report might state that there are 20 official authorisations in existence, the next report might state there are 18 or 21 and the average number of authorisations for a period might be 20.  There might be an upsurge in a particular crime and the number could increase to 50 or 60.  In those circumstances, the people being investigated may conclude that their telephones are being tapped.</P>
    <P>We do not need to think up obscure reasons why we should not accept reasonable proposals; I am not in favour of that, but we have to bear the circumstances I have outlined in mind.  Perhaps some middle ground may be found in relation to the proposals in the Bill and those in Deputy Gilmore's amendment by including a provision obliging the judge in his report to include this information unless he has reason not to do so.  That might be a compromise.  I will put that proposal to the Department and ask if there would be any reason to reject it.  As evidence of my good faith, I understand this is the first time such information has been revealed to the House.  From my inquiries there are 40 official interceptions authorised by the security forces at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for volunteering the information <Col N="492" /> regarding the number of authorisations which exist.  The Minister's reply, in a sense, confirms some of the fears I have in relation to the approach to this legislation. He invited us to imagine the exchange which might take place between a Taoiseach and a High Court judge over the publication of aspects of the High Court judge's report.  If we are now in the era of freedom of information and access to information, we need more transparency than being invited to imagine the discussions between the Taoiseach and a High Court judge or to imagine where those discussions might lead ultimately if there was a disagreement between them of the type described by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister intends on Report Stage to introduce some formula to deal with this issue.  I do not think the information I seek necessarily needs to be confined to the High Court judge's report which would only be issued, at best, every two years or so.  This should be made available on a regular basis. What concerns me most about the Minister's reply was his statement that he was not in the position to state any reason why the numbers of authorisations, warrants and so on could not be released from time to time.  He stated that there might be cases relating to the detection of crime or the security of the State where it would be necessary to deny the public access to this information.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that if there is any doubt about giving the information, the security of the State or the battle against crime will be pleaded.  That is the most worrying aspect of his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about very basic information. The Minister has volunteered information on the number of authorisations which currently exist.  He has described an administrative means which already exists within the security forces for the detection of crime.  I do not imagine that the enactment of his legislation will dramatically change the numbers of authorisations granted.  The Garda know the people engaged in organised crime and subversive activities in this State.  In view of the fact that <Col N="493" /> there is very little room for an increase or decrease at the margins, I do not think that this will dramatically change. However, I can envisage circumstances where information will come to hand about an attempt to import arms.  There has been a number of examples in recent years of large importations of arms where Garda operations had to be undertaken in an attempt to recover them.  I envisage that, in attempting to deal with such crime, there might be an increase in the numbers of authorisations issued.</P>
    <P>We should know the number of authorisations in a six month period.  If there was a dramatic increase and that information was known publicly, it would be open to Members of this House to ask the Minister for Justice why this was the case and to give reasons.  I think it is accepted and understood that this has to be done.  Any criminal engaged in crime in a big way who is in any doubt about the possibility of his 'phone being tapped is very unwise, to put it mildly, having regard to the age in which we live and the technology which is available to the security forces.  It is generally known and accepted that this method of attempting to get information is used and can be used more frequently.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that the Minister will come back on Report Stage with some kind of a formula to deal with the aspect I am attempting to progress.  I will have to leave it until then to see whether the formula is adequate to meet the objectives in my amendment.  We need to get away from the practice, every time there is a doubt about the reason for something, of saying that there may be a threat to the security of the State, it is needed to fight crime, etc.  Such phrases can cover a multitude of matters and, of course, by their very nature they are a euphemism for &ldquo;I really do not have an answer.  You cannot ask any further questions about the matter as you will be compromising a Garda operation, prejudicing it, etc.&rdquo;  There needs to be more transparency about the scale and size, etc., of an operation without necessarily impacting on individual operations covered by the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting that the Minister has volunteered information in relation to the current number of authorisations but has refused to accept an amendment on the grounds that the experts, as he called them, advised him to so do, although he could not think of particularly good reasons for accepting the amendment.  I do not mean any offence to the experts but official thinking is that one should not give any information or tell people anything if one can avoid doing so.  We have inculcated a culture in our public servants that they must not release any information, that the Minister must release all the information. However, if the news is bad and someone has to be blamed, unfortunately all too often it is a public servant who cannot defend himself.  Generally speaking, the Minister gives the information and, therefore, he decides whether it is an official secret.  The official thinking is that no information should be released. The Minister is not being very realistic when he says that the experts have told him not to accept the amendment, that he cannot think of good reasons but that they may arise in the future.  That is a justification for not having legislation or safeguards.  In other words, we might need to do particular things in the fight against crime or because the State is being subverted, so why have legislation which would only hinder us?  I do not accept the Minister's argument.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the 40 authorisations as excessive.  However, I should like the Minister to clarify a point as this figure may be taken out of context publicly. I presume the 40 authorisations do not necessarily relate to 40 people, that there could be a number of authorisations in regard to one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore that security of the State or crime can be used as an excuse to do many things.  In fact, the reason for this legislation is that the then Minister used as a justification for abusing his powers &mdash; which lead to a public outcry for this kind of legislation and proper safeguards before telephones could be tapped &mdash; the subversion of the State; he suggested that because individual <Col N="495" /> Deputies in his party were subverting the State the telephones of certain journalists must be tapped.  This was an appalling assertion.  There was absolutely no grounds for suggesting that the State was being subverted.  All kinds of other colourful suggestions were made by the then Minister.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore rightly said, subversion of the State can be used as an excuse for allowing people to do literally anything.  I do not think it is good enough to have such a lax provision.  Having said that, as I said earlier to the Minister, I do not wish the law to be so rigid that we cannot intervene and intercept postal packages and telecommunications messages when the Garda or the Chief of Staff of the Army, as the case may be, believe that by so doing they can gather important information which will help in the fight against crime.  Crime has reached alarming proportions in this country, and I would be the last person to try to tie the hands of the Garda Síochána in their fight against crime.  Subject to proper safeguards and controls, the Garda Síochána need to be given whatever weapons are necessary in its fight against crime, by this I mean whatever legislation is necessary.  Much of our legislation needs to be changed.  I do not wish to digress from the subject we are discussing, but the legislation dealing with public order dates back to, I think, 1824 and is grossly out of date.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister was more forthcoming in his last comments.  When a Minister is forthcoming I do not wish to antagonise him.  The Minister should look at this issue between now and Report Stage and come up with a reasonable amendment.  If there are very good reasons, and the designated person can spell them out, for not giving information in a report then I will be happy with that.</P>
    <P>We should remember that the information will be given subsequent to the event.  Even though this amendment refers to six months, as Deputy Gilmore said, if the Minister of State puts down an amendment which requires the designated person to put the information in <Col N="496" /> his report, which probably will be every two years &mdash; the Bill says not more than two years but, realistically speaking, it will probably be every two years &mdash; then we are probably talking about an event which is long past.  Therefore, I do not think anyone would be necessarily alarmed by the fact that the number of authorisations had increased from 20 to 60.</P>
    <P>If most people knew there were safeguards in place &mdash; which there will be when this Bill is passed &mdash; they would be quite happy if it were felt necessary to have 50, 60, 70 or whatever the number of tappings, perhaps during a period when there has been a dramatic increase in crime.  Then I think most people would support the interception of postal packets or telecommunications messages.</P>

      <P>In the hope of concluding the debate on this amendment I will deal with one or two points raised.  There appears to be a misconception about the two-yearly reporting interval.  Two years is the maximum period in that the section states, at intervals of not more than two years.  Therefore &ldquo;the designated judge&rdquo; could have a yearly report, a six monthly report, a three monthly report, a monthly report or a weekly report &mdash; although that probably would be somewhat impractical &mdash; or even a daily report.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the interception of telecommunications.  The fact is we are putting an obligation on &ldquo;the designated judge&rdquo; to report at not more than two yearly intervals; not alone that, but he has also additional reporting powers with which I will deal when we come to that amendment.  In relation to the other question posed by Deputy Harney in relation to the 40 authorisations, my understanding is that that relates to 40 separate applications.  That is my information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I have been told.  In relation to the argument we heard last evening, that if one has reason for not including safeguards one might as well never have any, the fact is that for the police &mdash; I am not a policeman or a member of military intelligence; I have been in this Department for 13 months &mdash; the investigation of particular types of crime, indeed of all crime, is a highly specialised area, as is military intelligence. Within those specialisations there are additional specialisations; for example, espionage is a particular type of crime, as is larceny, subversion and so on.  The Minister for Justice, who is the political head of the Department, has to take some advice from the experts.  It would be totally unrealistic for me to convert myself into being a member of military intelligence, a member of the Special Branch, of the Fraud Squad, or whatever, and pretend to be an absolute expert in every detail on the types of activities in which they must engage.  I have to rely on the advice of the people who have been entrusted to do that job on behalf of our people on at least some occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney contended that people would not object to an increase in official taps over a period of time if there was an upsurge in crime.  I agree with that; people do take a reasonable attitude to that.  But what I am concerned about is not just what people accept.  While I am, of course, concerned about what the <Col N="498" /> people accept, my concern is not only about that, Deputy Gilmore put his finger on it when, to a certain extent, he argued against his own case in the course of his contribution.  He said that if there had been a dramatic increase in crime over a particular period, and this matter had to be referred to the Dáil every six months, Deputies could come in to the House, ask the Minister for Justice for an explanation and the Minister for Justice could explain the reasons which Deputies would accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be fair enough but it is not merely a question of Deputy Gilmore or of the people being aware of it; one would be alerting the people who are the subject of such taps, thereby undermining the legislation.  That is my difficulty.  I am in favour of greater freedom of information.  I am in favour of people being able to come into this House to ask questions and receive reasonable answers and/or information.  I am against a system through which there would be too many authorisations.  On the other hand, I must bear the other aspect in mind as well.  As second in control on the political side of the Department of Justice, I have to bear that in mind as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my experience of criminal law is somewhat limited I have had a reasonable experience of it.  I know there can be circumstances when there will be an upsurge in a particular type of crime or in subversion, and additional taps are put on.  In such circumstances the information then being publicly made available, that the number had increased, could possibly alert people.  That is what I am concerned about.  That is why, rather than accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment, I should prefer to talk to the departmental experts about it to see if it is necessary to compel &ldquo;the designated judge&rdquo; to include this in his report, if deemed to be absolutely necessary, in the interests of the prevention of crime or when, in the interests of the preservation <Col N="499" /> of the security of the State, it could be excluded in a particular instance.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-up about giving the information.  I have given the information on what the position is at present but a sudden change in a pattern possibly could enable people, who would otherwise be apprehended, to go free.  It could also have very serious implications in relation to subversion in a particular instance, when we would all be very sorry afterwards bearing in mind that if these people had not been alerted to the fact that their telephones were being tapped, this material could not have come in, and people would not have been blown up.  I am not seeking abscure reasons but I must bear this aspect in mind.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to discuss the matter with the parliamentary draftsman to ascertain whether we can reach some type of reasonable compromise to meet my genuine concern while, at the same time, responding to the demands for more information.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a6a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1)  The Committee for the time being existing for the purpose of section 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, shall, when requested by the Minister, select a person (not being a serving judge) for appointment to be a designated person <Col N="500" /> and such person shall be designated by the Government for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person designated under this section (referred to in this Act as &ldquo;the designated person&rdquo;) shall hold office in accordance with the terms of his designation and shall have the duty of keeping the operation of this Act under review, of ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with and of reporting to the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at such intervals (being intervals of not more than two years) as the designated person thinks desirable in relation to the general operation of the Act, and</P>
    <P>(b)  from time to time in relation to any matters relating to the Act which he considers should be so reported.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of his functions under this Act, the designated person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall have power to investigate any case in which an authorisation has been given, and</P>
    <P>(b)  shall have access to and may inspect any official documents relating to an authorisation or the application therefor.</P>
    <P>(4)  The designated person may, if they think it desirable to do so, communicate with the Taoiseach or the Minister on any matter concerning interceptions.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every person who was concerned in, or has information relevant to, the making of the application for, or the giving of, an authorisation, or was otherwise concerned with the operation of any provision of this Act relating to the application or authorisation, shall give the designated person, on request by them, such information as is in their possession relating to the application or authorisation.</P>
    <P>(6)  If the designated person informs <Col N="501" /> the Minister that a particular authorisation that is in force should not have been given or (because of circumstances arising after it had been given) should be cancelled or that the period for which it was in force should not have been extended or further extended, the Minister shall, as soon as may be, inform the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and shall then cancel the authorisation.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Taoiseach shall cause a copy of a report under subsection (2) of this section together with a statement as to whether any matter has been excluded therefrom in pursuance of <i>subsection</i> (8) of this section to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(8) If the Taoiseach considers, after consultation with the designated person, that the publication of any matter in a report under subsection (2) of this section would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State, the Taoiseach may exclude that matter from the copies of the report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(9)  The designated person shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the discharge of their functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>First, I want to thank the Bills Office for their marvellous work in helping me draft this amendment.  Despite the fantastic legal expertise within my party I do not have the volume of expertise available to the Minister.  Therefore, the Bills Office were of invaluable help to me and I should like to record that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, I had tabled an earlier amendment to substitute &ldquo;the designated person&rdquo; for &ldquo;the designated judge&rdquo;.  I did that for a number of reasons.  We in this country need to realise that there are more impartial persons, as I said earlier to the Minister of State, than judges.  The Ombudsman is a case in point.  The Ombudsman's function and the purpose of having an Ombudsman is to vindicate <Col N="502" /> ordinary people's rights.  Therefore, somebody like the Ombudsman might be a suitable person to oversee the implementation of the safeguards in relation to the interception of telecommunications messages, but he is not the only person.  The method we selected for the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions is generally regarded as being a fair and impartial way of appointing that officeholder.  The 1974 Act, which established the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, provides for the establishment of a committee which must meet to agree on a named person to serve as Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>When I was framing the environmental protection legislation, seeking an independent mechanism for the selection of the director general and the board of the agency, I looked at the provisions of the earlier Act.  The committee which eventually was decided on was very much modelled on the provisions of the 1974 Act.  As the Minister of State knows, that Act provides that the Secretary to the Government, the Chief Justice, the chairman of the Bar Council, the president of the Incorporated Law Society and a senior officer from the Attorney General's office should comprise the committee which would meet to select the appropriate person.</P>
    <P>That would be the appropriate committee to meet to select the person to oversee the provisions of this Bill.  For a number of reasons, I do not want to see a serving judge act as the overseer.  For example, as I said to the Minister of State, the judge could be involved in a subsequent trial.  There is nothing in this Bill stipulating that the judge cannot sit at a trial when he has been involved in a hearing and been aware of a telephone tapping incident.  I know the Minister of State said he has an assurance from the Bar Council that anybody nominated by the President of the High Court to oversee the implementation of the safeguards being provided in this Bill would not sit at a trial.  But that is self-regulation in that the Bar Council is not regulated by statute.  It is not good enough that we <Col N="503" /> leave it to the discretion of the individual judge to exclude himself.  We may accept that judges are honourable people and will exclude themselves but say if Mary Harney were to come before the Special Criminal Court and Judge Y decided he would not hear my case, that he would excuse himself from the case, I would know immediately that my telephone had been tapped and that that judge had been involved in overseeing the safeguards in relation to telephone tapping.</P>
    <P>It is a badly thought out proposal to suggest that a serving member of the Judiciary should oversee the implementation of these provisions.  That is the reason my amendment excludes nobody else except a serving member of the Judiciary.  This is for very good reasons. Apart from the fact that I hold it would prejudice the judge himself, even in subsequent trials from which he would not exclude himself, he would become known to subversives as the judge who is overseeing the implementation of the safeguard being provided here, that a particular telephone had been tapped. Earlier the Minister of State said the reason he did not want to provide statistical information was that criminals would then know, if the figure increased from 40 to 60 and there was an increase in a particular type of crime, that their phones were being tapped.  If that is the argument for not providing statistical information it is certainly the argument that should be used for not nominating a serving judge to be the designated judge for the purposes of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We do not have enough judges.  It can take 12 to 24 months in many cases to have a case heard in court.  There are long delays and if justice is not speedy it is often regarded by the public as not being justice.  Having regard to the fact that it is taking so long to complete the beef tribunal many people believe that our system of justice is painstakingly slow, cumbersome, archaic and out-of-date. I have suggested to the Minister for Justice that we need to appoint more judges to expedite civil cases.  In regard <Col N="504" /> to criminal proceedings long delays are encountered in compiling the book of evidence and so on.</P>
    <P>Why should we tie up one member of the Judiciary in overseeing the operation of this legislation?  I do not think it would be appropriate to do so.  On the other hand, an obvious candidate would be the President of the Law Society; solicitors are not given due recognition in our judicial system and they can only be appointed as judges to the District Court and not to any of the higher courts.  This is wrong and the Minister said she will review the position.  What is the reason a retired judge, a retired Ceann Comhairle or a retired President, persons who are held in high esteem and known to be fair and impartial, cannot be nominated?  I do not want the Minister restricted under the legislation to nominating a serving judge.</P>
    <P>My amendment states that the designated person &ldquo;shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the discharge of their functions&rdquo;.  Under the Constitution the Judiciary are independent. If a Minister, following consultation with the President of the High Court, nominates a serving member of the Judiciary for the purposes of this legislation the independence of the Judiciary would be prejudiced.  That is another reason they should not be involved.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister of State referred to a judge in the masculine sense. Thankfully, we have an excellent female member of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Justice Denham, and an excellent member of the High Court, Miss Justice Carroll, but we need many more.  I am keen to ensure that the recommendation in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women that the Interpretation Act be changed is implemented so that sexist language is not used in legislation, such as where the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is used. With the co-operation of the Bills Office the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is not used in my amendment. While the Minister of State may tell me that this is wrong technically the sooner we get rid of sexist language the better because language conjures up <Col N="505" /> images of status and of who is considered appropriate.  I am drawing the attention of the Minister of State, and the House, to the fact that with this amendment we would manage to remove the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; from section 8 and replace it with less sexist and more acceptable language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for unwittingly using sexist language; I did not intend to use such language, the word slipped out.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the involvement of a judge, as the person selected to oversee the operation of the legislation, would necessarily lead to their independence being compromised given that judges have been involved in judicial inquiries since the foundation of the State and nobody has suggested that their independence has been compromised in any way.  As the House is aware, the President of the High Court is presiding over a tribunal which is the subject of much public interest and his independence has not been compromised.</P>
      <P>The original proposal in relation to the 1985 Act was that a member of the Supreme Court should oversee the operation of that legislation.  On that occasion the Chief Justice, whose views were sought, gave a very good reason as to why it would not be appropriate to nominate a member of the Supreme Court.  There are five Supreme Court judges and they can sit as a group of five or as a division of the Supreme Court, namely three judges. The Chief Justice made the point that in an important criminal trial where an appeal is made to the Supreme Court on a point of law it may be deemed necessary in many cases that the five judges be involved.  Inevitably, there would be a possibility that the designated judge, if he was a member of the Supreme Court, might hear an appeal on a point of law brought by somebody whose phone had been tapped.  That is the reason it was decided to nominate a High Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President of the High Court is aware of our difficulties in this regard and has assured us that if a High Court judge is designated the judge concerned will not be involved in criminal trials or <Col N="506" /> appeals.  We have been given this assurance in writing.  Indeed, it would not be in the interests of the prosecution or the State to have it any other way.  Otherwise the person being tried could challenge the decision immediately if he could establish that there was unauthorised interception while his case or any other activities he may have been involved in were being investigated and the judge was in a position to have known about it given that he had access to all of the relevant papers which he can ask for in any particular case.</P>
    <P>It is a Government decision that a judge rather than somebody else will be designated to oversee the operation of the legislation, and I have not been authorised to change that decision today.  The reason it made this decision is that an administrative procedure is being put on a statutory basis.  In general, administrative procedures are reviewed by the courts.  Unfortunately, because of the nature of this procedure, and the necessity for secrecy, if it is to be efficacious and workable there must be some restriction in regard to the right of access to the courts.  To compensate for this we are going to appoint a judge who would normally be in a position to review the administrative procedure in an ordinary court case if there was full access to the courts &mdash; access will be restricted under the legislation &mdash; to review the operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not attaching blame to Deputy Harney who is extremely busy or to anyone else but I only saw this amendment for the first time at 10 o'clock this morning.  I have noted the points made by the Deputy and, in light of the case she made, I will ask the Government who makes the decision, if it will change its decision but I cannot change a Government decision this afternoon.  I had no opportunity to consult widely between the time the amendment first appeared and the time the discussion started but if the Deputy wishes to advance any other reasons in addition to the points she has made that someone other than a High Court judge should be designated I would be prepared to consider those arguments <Col N="507" /> and consult with the appropriate people who have the power to change this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister of State who only saw the amendment for the first time this morning although it was tabled last night.  As the Minister of State is aware, I tabled a similar amendment earlier to substitute the words &ldquo;designated judge&rdquo; with &ldquo;designated person&rdquo; and I informed him that I would table further amendments as the debate on the Bill proceeded.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour this point, as I made it earlier, but a very good reason the Minister should be present is that she would have more authority to accept amendments like this.  This is not in any way to cast a reflection on Deputy O'Dea's capacity; I know the limitations on Ministers of State because I was one. The Minister for Justice has not yet come into this House to take Committee Stage of a Bill and she has shown total and utter disregard for the Members who have put in a great deal of effort in preparing the legislation.  If this was a sexy subject and topical at the moment, as it was ten years ago, I can guarantee it would not be the Minister of State who would be in the House, but the Minister who would be getting all the glory attaching to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has given an assurance that the judge in question will exclude himself or herself from criminal trials.  He has accepted the word of the Bar Council or the President of the High Court as the case may be.  Self-regulation is not good enough.  It is not good enough that we leave it to the discretion, integrity and honour of individuals; the law should provide for it.  The law should provide that no judge who is overseeing the implementation of this legislation can sit in a criminal trial.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that he will bring in an amendment to that effect on Report Stage, I will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to criminal trials, the judge in question can preside at civil trials on the matter.  We cannot assume that somebody whose phone is tapped will not subsequently <Col N="508" /> be involved in a civil trial.  If, for example, a well-known organised gang breaks into your house and shoots somebody &mdash; we had a shooting in Dublin not so long ago &mdash; and a criminal charge cannot be brought against the persons, a civil charge could be brought against them for damages.  Is the judge to exclude himself from the civil trial as well?  The Minister knows that if a particular judge excludes himself from certain trials it will not be long before the criminal gangs whose phones are being tapped will know.  That defeats the purpose.  The Minister said this was a Government regulation.  Everybody wants to see safeguards. We have long delays in hearing cases because of the shortage of judges &mdash; there are other reasons but the shortage is a factor.  I have spoken to many members of the Judiciary in recent times, and they have told me of the need for the appointment of more judges.  Why should we tie up any judge at a time when more judges are needed to ensure speedier trials? There is a host of people who would be acceptable to the House, to the Government and to the community at large who are fair and impartial.  I mentioned some earlier; former secretaries of Government Departments, former ambassadors. There is a number of honourable, fair and impartial individuals who would be quite capable of seeing that the legislation is implemented fairly and producing a report to the Taoiseach that would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We will deal with another Criminal Justice Bill later in the day.  I do not know who will introduce that Bill, whether the Minister will arrive with all the fanfare and deliver the opening speech and leave the Minister of State to take the Committee Stage, which will be short.  It is a very good Bill.  Those of us who are involved hope to finish this debate by 1.30 p.m.  Will the Minister of State do whatever is necessary?  I do not suspect it will require a memorandum to Government. Although its implications are major, it does not require a major change in the legislation to provide that Judge X, the Ombudsman, a former secretary <Col N="509" /> of a Government Department, the President of the Law Society or somebody else should sit.  The membership of this committee comprises of senior people, all of them honourable, and I will be happy with any name they might come up with.  If they are allowed to pick the DPP, who has an extremely important function in this jurisdiction, surely they are capable of picking somebody to oversee this legislation.</P>

I have listened carefully to Deputy Harney.  We will not have the situation where people will be tipped off that a certain judge will exclude himself from certain criminal trials.  If we take that road, the judge overseeing the implementation of this legislation will simply not be hearing any criminal trials.</P>

      <P>No, of civil trials.  In effect what happens in civil trials before the High Court is that in many cases one literally does not know what judge will be hearing one's case.  In one case we were supposed to be before one judge at 10.30 a.m., at 10.25 a.m. we heard it would be Judge B but there was a change and we appeared before Judge C.  In fairness, there is not any possibility of tip offs because a judge has to exclude himself from a civil trial.  The Deputy, however, makes a fair point about writing into the legislation that the judge should be totally excluded from any subsequent trials, civil or criminal, which might in any way be related to a person whose <Col N="510" /> phone happened to be tapped.  I shall certainly discuss this with the draftsman between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney has made a very compelling case for her amendment, but a further aspect will need to be looked at.  We have considered the situation where the judge is precluded from hearing a case where he was reviewing the operation of the Act.  Given the likely intervals between the reviews that are to take place, there may well be circumstances where the court cases arising from the interception of telephone messages will have taken place before the judge is designated to carry out the review.  A judge carrying out the review may be the same judge who had previously heard the case which arose from the interception which subsequently becomes the subject of review.  It is broader than the question of excusing judges from hearing cases where they are conducting a review.</P>
      <P>The case made by Deputy Harney for the appointment of people outside the Judiciary, quite apart from releasing the judges from work which they can do without, is very strong and we should try to identify an eminent person who would be suitable to carry out the review.  There would be too many complications when judges are hearing cases and subsequently reviewing the operation of the legislation which gives rise to the evidence which was produced in those very same cases in the first place.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the question of the appropriateness of the review being carried out by the Judiciary should be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (a), line 19, to delete &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very important.  We have had a good deal of discussion as to how we can make this Bill more efficient, who will be responsible for the review and who will be brought to court as a result of it.  With all due respect, the present wording should not be in any Bill, as it runs wild with the English language. The present wording is that the person designated &ldquo;shall have the duty of keeping the operation of this Act under review, of ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with and of reporting to the Taoiseach &mdash; (a)  at such intervals (being intervals of not more than two years)&rdquo;.  That seems to be an evasion of taking a stand.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out in promoting my amendment, that could mean that reports would be made every month, every six months or, as will probably be the case, every two years.  I do not want to go back over the past and the abuse of this means of getting information, but the fact that there would not be a report for two years would be an encouragement to abuse the system.  I am not saying the system will be abused but I suggest that the report be made within 12 months &mdash; even that period may be too long.  If we provide that the report is made every six months matters will be kept in order.  The wording as it stands is not very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Harney, who has experience of being a Minister, I was taken aback to hear that 40 authorisations were made.  In my innocence I thought seven or eight would be the maximum number, but obviously things are happening of which I am not aware and I am in a state of shock.  If that practice continues an assurance should be given in regard to making available the report by the judge or designated person.  The large number of authorisations <Col N="512" /> is not a reflection on those in authority but on the state of the country. If this measure tackles crime I support it. We should make sure that matters are in order.  We have discussed many important aspects of the Bill.  In this case the period of two years is too long.  I hope the Minister accepts our amendment which proposes that the report be made within 12 months.  That would at least provide for a realistic reporting time, give us a chance to see what is happening and ensure that everything is above board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Browne's amendment.  The Minister corrected me earlier when I referred to the reports being made available only every two years.  Deputy Browne is right in that if the Bill provides that reports be made within two years, they will be made only every two years and, like most reports, will probably end up being late.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised at the number of authorisations which currently exist &mdash; I would not have expected the number to be fewer than 40.  It has been stated here on a number of occasions that there is a serious crime problem.  Citizens' civil rights are denied by the activities of criminals, whether those engaged in big time crime or in local communities.  For example, in the area of drug dealing there are more than 40 drug dealers in Ireland. If I were to tot up the number of criminal related activities in my constituency, about which I receive complaints and the number generally in local communities, the result would be a sizeable figure.  I am not alarmed by the number of authorisations issued.  I do not have any difficulty with the State intercepting telephone calls, phone tapping or intercepting mail to crack down on a serious problem and an invasion of the civil liberties of law abiding citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to ensure that the legislation will not be abused, that it will be used only to deal with cases of crime and not in a recriminative way against individuals either for political purposes or for purposes of recrimination by the police &mdash; there have been cases of abuse in that area also.  For that reason the <Col N="513" /> period within which the operation of the legislation is reviewed and information made available should be more frequent than two years.</P>
    <P>On my earlier amendment about providing information on the number of interceptions so that it may be mentioned by the public, the Minister agreed to consider that matter with a view to requiring that such information be made available. If that is done it will be necessary for the reviews to be carried out more often than on a two yearly basis.  I know it is theoretically possible for reports to be produced more often but in practice that will not happen.  Deputy Browne's amendment which proposes an annual review should be considered.  If provision is made for an annual review it is much more likely to take place.  In practice reports generally are not produced on time and to make provision in legislation that they be made at certain times will not ensure that it is done.  However, there is some possibility of it being done if provision is made for a review on an annual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The person to whom we intend to give the power is a High Court judge and, as Deputies will be aware, members of the High Court are independent in the exercise of their functions. This is an extra function that will be given to one member of the Bench and it is particularly appropriate that he or she is independent and seen to be so in the exercise of this very important function. For that reason the Government decided to provide for a degree of flexibility as to when reports will be produced.  There must be some limitation and we were anxious to ensure that no more than two years would pass between the production of reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the legislation is structured it is envisaged that the main report, which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and about which Deputy Browne is concerned, is not necessarily the only report the High Court judge will produce that will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 8 (2) (b)  states that the High Court judge can <Col N="514" /> report to the Taoiseach from time to time on any matter pertaining to the legislation. That subsidiary report also has to be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 8 (4) provides that the judge can communicate at any time with the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice on any matter concerning interception. That communication would not be in the form of a report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The provision that the High Court judge should make a report within two years represents the outer limit as the High Court judge can report on an annual, six monthly or monthly basis.  If the legislation stated that the only obligation of the High Court judge was to submit a report after two years without provision for periodic reporting, such reports to be laid before both Houses, and if there was no provision to communicate with the Taoiseach or the Minister, the amendment would add to the legislation.  In view of the other reporting powers which the judge has I cannot see that the amendment would add greatly to the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I usually follow the Minister's logic, but this time I do not.  We are talking about the independence of the judge appointed. We are setting down regulations to ensure that independence is not interfered with.  We are deciding on the duties of the judge.  We cannot just allow him into the Phoenix Park to go anywhere he likes.  We want to ensure that he does his job.  The Minister quoted from section 8 (2) (b)  which states:</P>
      <P>..... and of reporting to the Taoiseach .....</P>
      <P>(b)  from time to time in relation to any matters relating to the Act which he considers should be so reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very loose instruction.  The judge might decide that he had not seen anything that should be reported because if he had not carried out investigations to prepare a report, he might not know.  He <Col N="515" /> will hardly sit down every day and look at every authorisation and wonder if it is right.  I presume he will wait for a time to examine a number of authorisations together.  The Minister also referred to the fact that a judge &ldquo;may&rdquo; do something. It means nothing.  It is an option which the judge has if he wishes to use it but there is no obligation.</P>
    <P>The judge will do what he has to do, which is to report within two years.  That is unacceptable.  If we cannot have a report every 12 months, the report is not worth having.  The Taoiseach will have a report within two years and we have an amendment that it should be laid in the Library within three months.  Two years is far too long and I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>We are appointing a High Court judge to oversee the operation of the legislation.  If each one of us was asked his opinion as to what the judge should do, we would probably all offer a different opinion.  We cannot write in detail, step by step, how a High Court judge will operate the Act.  In section 8 (2)  The designated judge will have the duty to keep the operation of the Act under review, to ascertain whether the provisions are being complied with and to report to the Taoiseach under sub-paragraph (b)  from time to time in relation to any matters relating to the Act which he considers should be so reported.  If the judge considers something serious enough to be reported he is obliged to communicate that to the Taoiseach and that report must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The two-year provision is only an outer limit.</P>

What we are talking about here is appointing a complaints referee who will be a Circuit Court judge, a district justice, a barrister or solicitor with qualifications and experience necessary to enable him to be appointed a Circuit Court judge or a district justice.  The Taoiseach appoints a quasi judicial officer.  Acceptance of amendment No. 7a would oblige us to go along the lines of the United States where there are congressional hearings in relation to the appointment of the Judiciary, those who hold quasi judicial positions and ambassadors, etc.</P>

      <P>That is a debate for another day and it is a very interesting point.  Unfortunately, I cannot provide for it under this Bill.  If we were to go down that road it would not be right to have it in relation to one particular quasi judicial officer and not in relation to anybody else.  If we were to introduce that system, even on a gradual basis as suggested in the amendment, we should start at the top.  I am not casting aspersions on the status of the complaints referee but he would not be seen as having the same status as the Chief Justice, a Supreme Court judge or even a High Court judge.  I would not like if a person, low on the list of quasi judicial officers, had to go through the rigour of a hearing of a committee of the Dáil or was appointed on the basis of the new American system whereas every other judge was appointed in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I move amendment No. 7c:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The provisions of this section shall also apply to complaints in relation to the publication or reproduction by any person of unlawfully obtained telecommunications messages and, in such cases, recommendations made under subsection (5) (c) (iii) and (6) (a) (iii) (III), may include recommendations for the payment of compensation by such persons to those persons whose privacy has been so infringed.  Such recommendations shall have the force of law but shall be subject to appeal in the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 (6) (a) provides that the referee shall make a recommendation for the <Col N="519" /> payment to the applicant of such sum by way of compensation as may be specified in the order where he found something was incorrect.  Our amendment is a link up with that provision whereby if the information is published in newspapers or on television there should be a regulation allowing for compensation.  If the referee can make a recommendation regarding compensation to the person who has been wronged then it should follow that if that information appeared in the newspapers or was announced on television a fine should be laid down to compensate the person for damage caused by the publication of wrong information unlawfully obtained.  That makes sense.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's adviser may be shaking his head it is logical when somebody is compensated on one side because of what is done, that publication of that information should also demand compensation. This would act as a deterrent and people would be more careful about what they publish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment goes far beyond what Deputy Browne stated.  In this legislation we are setting down a statutory basis whereby the Minister for Justice can authorise interceptions. Because of the secret nature of the system it is necessary to restrict access to the courts by aggrieved people.  If the Minister for Justice contravenes the legislative requirements we are imposing on her to compensate for the fact that there is restrictive access to the courts, we are setting up the complaints referees who will have the power to investigate any complaint made to him.  If he finds there has been a breach he can quash the authorisation, destroy the material and grant compensation.  If the amendment in the name of Deputy Browne were accepted we would be going beyond that.  The referee will deal with complaints about whether the Minister for Justice is using her powers under this legislation. Amendment No. 7c would mean that if, in the morning, I discovered Deputy Browne had tapped my phone I could <Col N="520" /> complaint to the complaints referee who would have to investigate the matter and order compensation against the person concerned, even if it was not done on an official basis.</P>
      <P>The complaints referee is an officer controlling the official activities of the Minister under this legislation.  Unfortunately, if somebody other than the Minister for Justice taps my phone illegally he can be prosecuted.  I would also have a civil action against him.</P>

      <P>He or she.  There would be no restriction on my access to the courts to bring a civil case for invasion of privacy in such a case.  Because of the nature of the system the restriction relates only to the Minister.  I have absolutely no authority, and I do not think it would be feasible, to extend the power of the complaints referee in relation to non-Ministerial tapping of telephones, such as the tapping of mobile telephones, etc.  There may be a case for saying that if somebody is aggrieved because his telephone had been tapped &mdash; apart from the 1983 Act where the person who taps illegally can be prosecuted &mdash; there should be a mechanism similar to the employment appeals tribunal for people who are unfairly dismissed, whereby the person could have an alternative remedy to going to court.  There should be a tribunal akin to the complaints referee that would be in a position to investigate the matter speedily but it certainly would not fall within the ambit of the complaints referee here who is specifically appointed to investigate complaints about how the Minister operates her powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow Kilkenny</i>): I am not speaking specifically of compensation because one's telephone was tapped but rather the publication of the information. Perhaps the argument is that technically nobody should have the information apart from the Minister.  The Minister's explanation has gone beyond what we are talking about.  We are talking about <Col N="521" /> information which has been obtained illegally being disseminated.  Is there a section in the Bill which can lay down a regulation concerning the abuse of information illegally obtained and published as a result of being leaked?  I am referring specifically to the publication of the information rather than the telephone tapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what Deputy Browne is speaking about but the amendment as drafted refers to the &ldquo;publication or reproduction by any person of unlawfully obtained telecommunications messages....&rdquo; That would include messages which were not only unlawfully obtained by the Minister for Justice or the Garda, under authorisation from the Minister for Justice, but information unlawfully obtained, for example, by switching onto somebody's mobile telephone.  It would apply to everybody in the country.  I know what the Deputy is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that if a newspaper were to publish the information that arose from the Minister's improperly authorising a telephone tap, the person concerned should have the right to claim against that newspaper.  I would not be disposed to accept that point of view because, although there is logic in it, one is dealing with situations where the complaints referee has found that there was a breach of the Act, which specifically states that the Minister, the person who authorised the breach, is liable to pay compensation in the amount that the complaints referee determines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the damages the complaints referee would take into account the fact that newspapers and others might get hold of this improperly obtained information and publish it.  If my telephone is improperly tapped and I receive compensation and subsequently the information is published, I do not think the complaints referee would be disposed to give me any extra compensation.  The compensation is levied against the Minister for Justice, the person who authorised the improper tap, and the complaints referee is the person who decides the level of compensation.  He <Col N="522" /> decides the amount payable by the person who originated the illegality and I do not think he will give more compensation just because somebody publishes the information.  However, if the information was libellous then the complainant would have cause for a separate action against anybody who published that information.  I see no merit in giving the complainant the right to go back to the complaints referee because somebody has decided to publish the information. I would imagine that by the time the complaints referee has concluded his investigation of something that has already happened, publication will already have taken place and the complaints referee will take that into account in assessing the level of compensation.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Compensation of, say, £5,000 would be only a drop in the ocean compared to the damage that could be done to a person as a result of a report in the paper, not libellous perhaps.  The mere fact that my telephone was tapped might result in half the people in the country concluding that there must be something to it, that my telephone would not have been tapped if there had not been something going on. One would get nothing from a newspaper afterwards because one probably could not prove libel.  That damage would be much more serious and could arise because of the original illegal tapping.  I would ask the Minister to see if there is some way to prevent the media from using information obtained in such a way. If a person is lucky enough to be libelled properly he can get good compensation, but a person's character could be severely damaged by a casual report in a newspaper that leaves him with no means of redress.  I will not press this to a vote, but I think it should be included as a protection.  I would ask the Minister to look at this with his advisers to see if something can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind what Deputy Browne has said.  Section 12 of the Bill obliges the Minister to ensure that arrangements exist to keep disclosure <Col N="523" /> of information obtained as a result of tapping a telephone to a minimum. That may meet Deputy Browne's point to some extent.  However, the complaints referee is to assess damages in regard to illegal taps.  Almost invariably by the time the referee investigates and assesses damages, any reporting that is going to be done as a result of those taps will have been done and the complaints referee will take that into account in assessing damages.  It must also be borne in mind that where a newspaper publishes information provided anonymously, the newspaper is innocent because they will not know if a tap is illegal.  A tap can be illegal for a number of reasons, for example, the statutory procedure not being followed, and the media could not be expected to know that.  Therefore the chances of a referee deciding that they should pay compensation for something that was innocently done would be slim. The fact of publication will be taken into account by the referee when assessing damages.  I will, however, bear in mind what the Deputy said.</P>

      <P>If compensation is assessed by a referee, does that preclude an individual whose privacy has been invaded from seeking civil damages against the State?  The points I made earlier about judges in relation to criminal trials and so on equally apply to the person who may be the referee.  Since compensation and the calculation of it is involved, I think there is greater justification for having somebody with legal expertise.  If a judge of the Circuit Court or District Court were to act as referee would he exclude himself from any subsequent trial that might take place in relation to these matters?  Will the same assurances be given?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they should exclude themselves from any subsequent trial because nobody could be independent and objective when they have considered a case from two points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of an individual being precluded from taking an <Col N="524" /> action, the answer is no.  In the 1985 Bill there was a total exclusion on anybody taking civil action.  It was found by the courts in the case of Geraldine Kennedy and Bruce Arnold that one of the unenumerated personal rights in the Constitution was a right to privacy, the right not to have one's private telephone conversations intercepted illegally.  We therefore took out the absolute exclusion because we felt it would be unconstitutional; it would remove a right which the Supreme Court decided exists under the Irish Constitution, although not explicitly.  In practice if a person's telephone is illegally tapped and that person receives compensation and subsequently takes a case, that would be taken into account in the ultimate assessment of damages.  A person is not totally precluded from taking a civil action.  A person whose telephone has been illegally tapped has the right to take a constitutional action regarding invasion of privacy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accepted the time of 12 months, but is it generally the case with official information such as this that it is kept for only three years? For example, following a hearing by the referee, if a person takes a constitutional case for damages, which can take a considerable length of time to go to trial, will three years be sufficient? Is it necessary to have a time limit?  I do not wish to make changes for the sake of making them, but is there a need for a time limit of three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will note what Deputy Harney has said.  My information is that the three year limit was inserted in order that documents would be retained to facilitate any investigation by the designated judge or any subsequent complaint to the complaints referee.  I note that there is no time limit within which a person can have a complaint investigated by the complaints referee.  However, Deputy Harney will be aware that the normal period under the Statute of Limitations for taking a civil action is three years.  I assume, therefore, that while there is no actual time limit for making a complaint to the complaints referee, that if a person went to him six or seven years later they would be told that all official documents had been destroyed and that the matter cannot be investigated.  In effect, they would be precluded from investigating the matter although by law, they would not be precluded from doing so.  The procedure is similar to that which applies to a civil action under the Statute of Limitations.</P>

      <P>In the Kennedy-Arnold case it was three or more years later before they became aware that their telephones had been tapped.  If information is held for only three years there is no way of verifying the matter and a referee could not investigate a case when the three year period has lapsed.  For example, if my telephone is tapped today and I do not discover that for four or five years and then go to the referee, the <Col N="526" /> documentation will have been destroyed. That would hamper the referee in investigating the matter.  I am not saying that he will not be able to verify whether my phone was tapped, but he may need to see transcripts to know if the tapping was valid.  Will the Minister examine this matter before Report Stage?  If he discovers that there is no necessity for the three year time limit, he should delete it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne has asked some good questions today, as always. If a designated judge discovers that a telephone is being illegally tapped he will not communicate with the person involved because his job is not to act as a referee between the public and the State.  His task is to oversee the operation of the Act.  The designated judge will state in his report that X number of telephones were illegally tapped.  He may state the individual cases and the reason he believes those telephones were tapped.  However, complaints should be made to the complaints referee.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Harney stated, if people are suspicious they should make a complaint to the referee.  We are appointing a referee so that people do not have to initiate lengthy court proceedings to find out if their telephones are being tapped.  The existence of the referee's office will be public knowledge and people may write to him if they are concerned about anything.  Even if people are not concerned they can write to the referee and he will inform them if the Act is being breached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable, but difficult to justify, having regard to the Minister's comments on an earlier section.  It seems reasonable that the designated person overseeing the implementation of the Act would not write to inform you that your rights are being infringed.  However, there should be a balance between that and expecting everybody to write to the referee.  I would be concerned that we might have a great deal of vexatious complaints.  I support complaints procedures and the independent investigation of genuine complaints, but very often when we set up a vague procedure such as this we cause a volume of vexatious complaints to be made.  The referee might be snowed <Col N="528" /> under with complaints from all types of semi-criminals.</P>
      <P>I hope, because of the safeguards we are putting in place, that many people will not see a need to write to the referee but will be aware that if a respectable, independent person is overseeing the implementation of the legislation there is little chance of their telephone being tapped or their postal packages being intercepted.  Therefore, it should not be necessary for people to write to the referee to find out if their telephones are being tapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would like to be assured that every criminal does not engage the referee in unnecessary investigations because they have a vexatious complaint. I do not know the answer to this problem. We need a referee and a complaints procedure, but I would draw the Minister's attention to that matter.  As the Minister is aware, many vexatious complaints are made to the Garda Complaints Board at present, which involve an enormous amount of Garda time.  I have not put down an amendment in this regard.  I do not know if it is possible to cover this matter by way of an amendment, as the Ombudsman's office deals with many such complaints.  Complaints to the Ombudsman's office are generally genuine but people involved in crime and who come into contact with the Garda Síochána often feel aggrieved because they have been caught and feel the necessity to make a complaint.  If they could, they would go not only to the highest court in the land but to European courts or elsewhere with their complaints. This is a delaying tactic, an excuse or a way of preventing a trial proceeding.  If a person is the subject of telephone tapping and may be aware of it because he or she is involved in a particular criminal activity, could that person delay a criminal investigation on the basis that a complaint was before the complaints referee?  There would be no confirmation that such a person's telephone was tapped, but could a trial be delayed if one suspected that one's phone was being tapped or that one's privacy was being interferred with when one's <Col N="529" /> case was before the referee?  Would the Minister comment on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>A trial or a Garda investigation could not be delayed because the referee will simply check whether the provisions of the Act have been complied with.  If there is a tap in place he must check whether it is properly authorised. If, for example, the Minister or the Department of Justice have made some technical error in procedure, a person would then be informed that their phone has been illegally tapped and that would certainly interfere with the investigation. Therefore, there is an onus on the Minister for Justice and particularly the nominated officer in the Minister's Department who will make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In relation to vexatious and frivolous complaints, I take the Deputy's point not only in relation to criminals but also cranks who, unfortunately, are not an unknown phenomena here.  In regard to how the complaints referee will operate the legislation, that will be a matter for him.  The Deputy will understand we cannot detail how every person appointed to operate legislation will do this.  I would direct the Deputy's attention to section 9 (4) which states specifically:</P>
      <P>Where an application is made under this section [that is an application to the complaints referee] (other than one appearing to the referee to be frivolous or vexatious)...</P>
      <P>We are writing it into the law that the referee is under no obligation to investigate complaints which appear to him to be frivolous or vexatious.  That is the most we can do.  We depend on the good sense of the referee thereafter.</P>

      <P>When this matter was originally raised during the Seanad debate we consulted the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, An Bord Telecom and An Post to discuss the desirability of those amendments.  At the time there were objections to them within the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  In light of the debate that took place, I instructed my officials to get back to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, An Bord Telecom and An Post to see whether, in light of the new arguments being made in the debate before Easter, they would reconsider the position.  I am still awaiting a response to this.  I have no objection in principle to using the Bill as a vehicle in this way but I must have the authority of the Department directly concerned.  I have no objection to Deputy Harney pressing the amendment at this stage but I have insisted that they do respond to my officials between now and Report Stage.  On Report Stage we will be in a position to say whether we are accepting the amendment and if not, why not.</P>

      <P>This section repeals section 18 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  Section 18, which reproduces section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920, empowers the Minister for Justice by warrant to require the production to him of telegrams sent to or received from places outside the State.  The power under this section is very wide, the only condition being that the Minister should be of the opinion that a production to him of telegrams to or from places outside the State is &ldquo;expedient in the interests of the State&rdquo;.  This power has never been used so far as it is remembered in the Department of Justice.  The Bill is a convenient occasion to abolish it.  After the repeal of section 18 the authorisation of the interception of telegrams will be carried out as provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, provides that the work programme of the commission is derived from two sources: (a) a programme prepared by the commission in consultation with the Attorney General for the approval of the Government which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and (b) particular branches or matters of law which the Attorney General requests the Commission to consider with a view to reform.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General does not have a function under the 1975 Act of giving an annual work programme.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate a note on the commission's work in the years in question.</P>
      <P>In addition the commission during 1992 and 1993 has been engaged in work on a wide range of topics, among them the following: (a) Work on occupiers liability, which is of great practical importance to farmers and the owners of premises, is at an advanced stage and a Consultation Paper will be published shortly.  The commission would then hope to make their final recommendations later this year; (b) family courts; (c) sentencing; (d) contempt of court; (e) conveyancing; (f) intoxication and (g) international law on trusts.</P>

    <P>The work of the Law Reform Commission during the years 1989 to 1991, inclusive, is described in detail in the <Col N="535" /> commission's annual reports for those years which have been laid before the House in accordance with section 6 of the Act, and I would refer the Deputy to those reports.  They describe the work being done by the commission and list the 17 reports and consultation papers which it published during that period.</P>
    <P>The commission's annual report for the year 1992 is in course of preparation. During that year the commission presented to the Attorney General, and published, reports on the following subjects: (1) The United Nations (Vienna) Convention on the International Sale of Goods; (2) A fifth report on land law and conveyancing law and (3) the law of dishonesty.</P>

      <P>All members of the Government are conscious of the desirability of making important policy announcements in the House in the first instance.  Deputies will appreciate that it is the duty of Ministers to make such announcements without delay.  However, if while the Dáil is sitting no suitable opportunities arise and it is thought that the public interest could suffer by a delay, the Minister concerned must decide on the most appropriate manner in making the announcement.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that there are ample opportunities for Members to raise here the subject matter of any ministerial announcements made outside the House. In line with my commitment to open Government a programme for Dáil reform has been put in place which provides for greater questioning of members of the Government to matters of policy.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said in his reply to Deputy O'Keeffe that Ministers may consider it necessary to make announcements in the public interest without delay.  In relation to the announcement made this week by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, it can hardly be said that the Minister found himself taken short in respect of the implementation of the Culliton proposals.  The House was in session and we have been waiting for it during the period of the last Government and this Government.  Yet the Minister and the Government in regard to what they consider the most important area of job creation chose to make the decision for cosmetic and presentation purposes outside of this House.  How does the Taoiseach reconcile that with the answer he has given here already?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 91 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely aware that a dyslexic child if undetected and so uncatered for is in a very disadvantaged position and should be helped within the classroom.  The central concern with dyslexia is that all teachers are aware of the signs and can detect them early.  I am glad to say that primary teachers are trained as a normal <Col N="545" /> part of their teaching training course to identify dyslexia and indeed a variety of other reading problems.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers have a complete module on dyslexia within their training programme.  I believe that primary teachers in general are doing a very good job in detecting the problem early, but if there was to be an awareness week or an awareness day it would surely be best to focus on teachers, particularly those trained before we were all aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not accept the suggestion of increased evidence of thousands of undetected children, but I do accept that greater effort is needed, even if there are tens of children going undetected.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to find that there are already 945 full-time remedial teachers serving our national schools.  Helping the dyslexic child is a central part of their function.  However, I accept that even with 945 remedial teachers there are still gaps.  Therefore, I have announced there will be 80 additional remedial teachers in our schools by September 1993.</P>
    <P>The primary focus in dealing with the problem has to be the teacher, but individual attention from parents for their own child is obviously vital.  The best remedial programmes are partnerships between teachers and parents, and I will expect individual teachers, as part of their normal role, to inform parents of the best possible approach in helping their child.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of examinations, my Department makes special arrangements for dyslexic candidates. They include the following: a candidate who is unable to read, or is very slow at reading, may be allowed the service of a person who will read the questions or a candidate who is unable to write, or is very slow at writing, may be allowed to use a tape recorder, a typewriter or a word processor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that her reply is the same pat response handed by her Department to her predecessors, and that it is a whitewash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware also that the <Col N="546" /> classic example of putting dyslexic children into remedial classes is not only wrong but has proven to be damaging? Is she not aware that in fact these are the forgotten people, that dyslexia is to be found in every single classroom, in every city, town and county nationwide, that we have swept it under the carpet for far too long: that putting a dyslexic child into a remedial or standard class is the equivalent of putting a blind child into a standard classroom and throwing away the Braille books; that these children suffer from emotional problems, trauma and disorientation through being placed in standard classes?  Would she agree that something solid and constructive will have to be done about this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Higgins's accusation that this was a pat reply since I personally drafted it. I might add that I bring to this House 15 years' experience of dealing with children with this problem.  I am absolutely amazed at Deputy Higgins's suggestion that putting a child into a remedial class, or making remedial teaching available to them, actually does them damage.  I might point out for the record that there has been established a special education review committee which has been engaged in examining the needs of children with specific learning disabilities.  I expect their recommendations to be on my desk next month.  That special review committee, armed with all the expertise required, will be making recommendations. Because of my specific interest and experience in the area I will be more than capable of responding to their recommendations, with the help and goodwill of the specific unit within my Department for that purpose.  We shall consider their recommendations together, after which I shall come back to the House and give Members my response thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in refusing to take on board the very sensible suggestion of holding a dyslexia awareness week, as has been done throughout Europe &mdash; I might remind <Col N="547" /> her that 1993 is the European Dyslexic Association Year of Early Recognition &mdash; she is refusing to face the unpalatable facts?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware also that exhaustive research has proven time and again that dyslexic children are most unhappy, lose all confidence in themselves, suffer severe emotional problems, are perceived as failures, are often the group most subjected to bullying by their peers and, last but not least, that there are proven cases of suicide among them? What will the Minister do about scotopic sensitivity syndrome, a particular type of dyslexia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said I will not hold a dyslexia awareness week.  If we were to hold such a dyslexia awareness week it would be sensible that the people who deal with this problem in the main, the teachers who can help these children, would be those who could best be targeted.  As I have said, I await the report of the special education review committee and will certainly take their recommendations on board.  I might suggest to the Deputy that it would be rather short-sighted to launch a campaign on a dyslexia awareness week as we in the Department await the results of a special education review committee.  Indeed, it is particularly significant, in this European Year of Dyslexia, that that special education review committee will report and that I, as Minister, will respond to their recommendations.  For the record it is important to state that thousands of children nationwide have been helped by remedial reading programmes.  They have not been damaged or perceived as failures.  Indeed the Deputy's talking about thousands of undetected cases would cause people more concern than my recognition that if there are only tens of children walking about undetected, they will be the children who will suffer as a result of bullying, who will have a low self-esteem and who are most in need of help.  I assure Members that I will ensure those children receive that help. Next September we shall be allocating <Col N="548" /> extra remedial teachers, which I hope will be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the special equipment needs of this school and these are being responded to on an ongoing basis.  We have already, and continue to, respond to their needs.</P>
      <P>In 1992, my Department allocated £14,000 to St. Mary's to facilitate the replacement of existing equipment in the complex.  Another £14,000 will be provided to the schools this year to enable further updating of equipment to take place.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the board of management, in consultation with the National Rehabilitation Board and the Department's inspectorate, to decide on the precise apportionment of resources within the St. Mary's complex, which includes the Marian School, Rosary School and St. Mary's.  The schools have welcomed the Department's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, while the schools have welcomed her allocation, it constitutes small change in comparison with the actual problem prevailing?  Is the Minister aware that today &mdash; and I have confirmed this with the Marian School authorities &mdash; there are four primary school classes who have no group hearing aids whatsoever?  Does she realise that when the teacher uses a microphone which can be heard simultaneously by the entire class, he or she must move around, approaching individuals who have individual hearing aids, and communicating by shouting to them <Col N="549" /> on a one-to-one basis?  Does the Minister not accept that, in these circumstances, instead of 30-year-old obsolete equipment, what is needed is an immediate injection of cash for the installation of modern, up-to-date equipment in this school complex?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins has informed me that there are four classrooms in which the equipment is in need of repair.  We are assured that the allocation of £14,000 will be sufficient to cover two classrooms.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that this year we shall be improving the equipment in an additional two classrooms.  I would suggest that it is a slight over-exaggeration to suggest that a school for the deaf is operating obsolete equipment.  Deputy Higgins, I am sure, will be pleased to learn that I spent some of my teaching years with the deaf.  To shout at children who are deaf, while it may be the manner in which we communicate in this House, is not good practice in communication skills.  In addition to the amount of money being available to this school I might add that 40 per cent of the money allocated for special education aids is given to hearing-impaired children's schools.  Of course, some hearing-impaired children are catered for in that Cabra complex but there are also St. Joseph's and other schools.  Some £30,000 have been allocated to Cabra, divided between the schools there, and there is a deaf unit in Ennis which is funded.  Another interesting point &mdash; since we have been alerted to the need to ascertain whether we should plan for the forthcoming 30 years in order to ensure that equipment now being installed will not be obsolete then &mdash; is that £40,000 is spent on radio aids, a new procedural departure, which allows certain categories of deaf children to participate within a hearing classroom-type forum, when both children and teacher wear aids.  Furthermore, 40 of those aids have been made available, resulting in a reduction in enrolment in deaf schools, something that is under review.  I might remind Members that, while the equipment certainly is not modern, it needs to <Col N="550" /> be minded and maintained to ensure that the children using it benefit therefrom. For instance, £40,000 was made available to the National Rehabilitation Board who send a person out to schools to maintain the equipment.  I can assure Deputy Higgins that that person actually attends St. Mary's two days every week.</P>

      <P>The fundamental purpose of the change proposed in the apprenticeship system is to move from a time-served to a standard-based approach.  This move has been universally welcomed as a major improvement and enhancement of the standing of the apprenticeship system. When fully developed and implemented <Col N="551" /> the objective is that it will provide apprentices with a formal certificate of achievement, validated by the National Education and Training Certification Board which will be based on standards reached, which will have status and recognition with employers, for employment purposes, and within the education sector, for the purpose of allowing apprentices to progress to higher levels of qualifications.</P>
      <P>It is a period of major change in the apprenticeship system.  It is not in anybody's interest &mdash; the apprentices themselves or the economy &mdash; that the educational underpinning of apprenticeship training should be anything other than the highest quality.  No developed country any longer seriously pursues narrow skill-based training as a policy objective, without the complementary development of a broader educational foundation to prepare people to cope with the ever accelerating rate of skill change, driven by rapid technological change.</P>
      <P>The scheme launched is for a limited number of areas initially, and it is subject to completion of arrangements.  My Department will be reviewing how the scheme works and it is only at that stage that I can offer an informed view as to its success, but I want to assure the Deputy that the objective of everyone is for an improved scheme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is committed to improving the scheme.  This is at variance with reports in recent weeks in which we were cautioned that the proposed new schemes would be debased, educationally, in that narrow skill based training would be pursued. Will the Minister confirm that the row between the Department of Labour and the Department of Education has now been resolved and give a categoric assurance that, in relation to education and training courses, the process of certification will continue to be carried out by the Department of Education and that high standards will be applied in <Col N="552" /> the manner recommended in the Green Paper on Education and in the Culliton report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should put it on the record that there is not a row.  I was concerned about the reports that the training programmes for apprentices would be restrictive and I thank the Deputy for accepting the sincerity of my reply.  The Department of Education has a particular responsibility, first, to ensure that the educational content of the new curricula is satisfactory &mdash; we have seen some but not all the syllabi; to ensure that the assessment and certification procedures are developed; to ensure that off-the-job education of apprentices is delivered effectively and that the best possible use is made of available resources and expertise.  Experts representing the technological colleges, FÁS, employer organisations and the trade unions are designing training curricula and, as soon as they are available, my Department will make arrangements for them to be assessed by the colleges. The colleges or the vocational education committees, which will provide the courses of instruction for apprentices, will then exercise their responsibility under the relevant Act and agree that the courses are suitable.  We all agree there is a need to move forward and I am satisfied that mechanisms are in place to ensure that we will have an input to the draft curricula which will be presented. At present we are developing proposals in relation to the NETCB.  While the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; has slipped out of the vocabulary of some people my Department will have a role to play in the certification process.  At present many of these programmes are certified by bodies outside Ireland.  I cite the City and Guild examinations as an example.  The Government is mature and responsible enough to ensure that the certificates granted by the new board will be recognised internationally.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the fact that the north inner city of Dublin has for decades been educationally severely disadvantaged; if she will give details of the percentage of children there failing to complete second level education; and her views on whether there is an urgent need for a second level community college to meet the special needs of the local children.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has classified the north inner city area as entitled to additional resources on the basis of disadvantage.  The proposal for <Col N="554" /> a new school there has a long history, which dates as far back as the early eighties.</P>
      <P>The planning section of my Department is at this very moment focusing on the Seán McDermott/Summerhill area on the question of the provision of a new school.  It is not clear that the projected numbers of second level students would justify the building of a new school, solely catering for second level pupils.</P>
      <P>I accept that the second level drop out is a real problem in the north inner city and I believe this justifies targeting extra resources in existing schools.  Consequently, 15 additional teaching posts above the norm have been allocated to the post-primary schools in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that numerous reports and studies during the past 20 years have clearly indicated that the north inner city of Dublin is the most disadvantaged area in the State in terms of educational provision and attainment; that the number of children under 15 years of age who leave school is twice the national average; that the level of absenteeism from school is far greater than anywhere else in Dublin and that the participation rate of local children in third-level education is 1 per cent compared with a Dublin average of 15 per cent?  Will the Minister further accept what every educationist in the area accepts, that this presents an appalling picture of educational disadvantage in the area in which the Department of Education is located and indicates that there is a need, particularly at second level, for a special school geared to meeting the needs of local children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is one of the black spots on the educational map.  It is a source of concern that the participation rate in third-level is only 1 per cent but I am sure the Deputy shares my view that it is at second level we lost these children.  There are intervention programmes in place which have been accelerated since this Government took office.  We are intervening at the preschool level; expanding the home-school <Col N="555" /> liaison programme, providing extra remedial teachers and extra capitation grants for children at primary level. There is a wide spread of second level schools in the area ranging, as the Deputy is aware, from Belvedere boys' school, a fee paying school which caters for 771 boys to a very small school with 140 pupils in the North Strand.  The figures are falling and we have to ensure, if we are to invest capital, that we invest in something that will be of benefit to the community. I have examined the parish baptismal records &mdash; I am sure the Deputy would accept that most of the people within the area baptise their children &mdash; which show that the number of children baptised fell from 781 in 1981 to 566 in 1990.  I agree that the participation rate of 1 per cent in third-level education will not increase unless we intervene at second-level.  The pattern in the area is that the numbers go up and the numbers go down, some schools close and other schools were closed.  Let me assure the Deputy that I have given assurances to the Deputies in the constituency that the matter is back on my desk for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the limited resources available.  Given the current constraints on funds for the school building programme, would she agree that it is a scandalous waste of public moneys and resources to spend in the region of £250,000 to £500,000 to relocate Scoil Chaoimhín in the north inner city against the wishes of parents, teachers and pupils, from a perfectly sound school building, when the money is so badly needed for the type of project that I have been calling on the Minister to initiate?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 8, 43, 55, 70, 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputies about the incidence of bullying and indeed the harm that it can do to pupils and to schools.  In a circular from my Department, schools were reminded that the managerial authority of each school is responsible for ensuring that a fair and effective code of behaviour encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures is drawn up and applied in the school.  I would encourage parents and pupils to make the existence of bullying behaviour known to school managements so that incidents can be investigated and the recovery steps taken to deal with the problem and, if necessary to apply sanctions to the culprits.  My Department's records indicate that about 25 cases of bullying were reported to the Department in the past year.</P>
      <P>I have recently established an expert working party to help draw up strategies to assist schools in combating bullying in primary and post-primary schools.  I should explain that the individual members of that working group have been selected for their particular expertise and not as representatives of any particular interest group.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of expelling children from primary school, rule 130 of the Rules for National Schools provides for the possibility of expulsion but stipulates that this should not be done without the prior consent of the school patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>When the draft proposals from the working group become available, by the end of this month, they will be discussed with the relevant interest groups &mdash; teachers, management authorities and parents before they are issued to schools in time for the next school year in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>What were the Minister's <Col N="558" /> reasons for not appointing a teachers' representative to the expert working party, bearing in mind that teachers are the professionals who have day to day contact with young people?  In many cases they are the only professionals who have day to day contact with young people.  They deal with the situation of bullying on the ground and accordingly have first hand experience and expertise in recognising the symptoms and how to deal with them.  It appears extremely short-sighted to hand over this crucially important work to a group who do not have that body of expertise and who know about the problem only in theoretical terms.  Will the Minister reconsider her decision and appoint teachers to the expert working party so that we can achieve the ends which I know she has in mind and which are so badly needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I selected the members of this group quickly in order that we would get a quick response to the problem.  The expert working party comprises a primary school inspector, a second level school inspector, a psychologist, a parent who is involved in highlighting the problem of bullying &mdash; as will be appreciated, bullying can start in school but may happen on the way home and outside the school environment &mdash; a person with a research background and an official from my Department.  I am satisfied that the group will come forward with draft proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I attended the teachers' conferences during Easter week I signalled that I would be asking them to co-operate by responding to the draft proposals.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate there are seven groups, the different unions, the different managerial interests and the different parents' interests.  I wanted to formulate a response quickly to an issue that was increasingly being discussed in the media but when we examined our records in the Department we found that 15 cases were reported at primary school level and only ten at second level.  I do not accept that that is a true reflection of the figures.  I believe we should not wait <Col N="559" /> for the number of complaints to grow but should instead move quickly.  I know from the response I got at the conferences to my invitation to respond to the draft regulations that all the interest groups, which include the teachers' unions, the parents' councils and the managerial board, will respond positively.  This will allow us to draw up recommendations by September.  These will not stop the problem but will help us highlight it so that we can take action to ensure that there is intervention not only for the child who is being bullied but for the child who is bullying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is a bad practice to impose on teachers a code that has been drawn up by an outside body, because teachers have proved themselves to be very innovative in these matters?  I would be very much more optimistic about arriving at a solution to the problem if the Minister reconsidered her position and put a representative of the teaching bodies on the expert working party.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that at the end of the day, irrespective of who drafts what or the recommendations <Col N="560" /> that come before her, she will ultimately have to make the decision to bite the bullet and that in cases where there is persistent bullying, the children will have to be ejected from the school in the common interests of all the children? As things stand, even if the bullying extends beyond the scope of bullying other children and the pupil is bullying the teacher, there is no recourse to expulsion at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see expulsion almost as a declaration that we have failed to put in the necessary support services, not only for the child who is being bullied but for the child who is bullying.  Of course, rule 130 of the Rules for National Schools allows, in certain circumstances, for children to be expelled.  It provides for the exclusion by the principal of a pupil for three days, a further exclusion for ten days by a special decision of the board, but the rule stipulates that a pupil cannot be struck off the roll without the consent of the school patron.  The procedure is that the decision goes from the principal, to the board and then to the patron.  Other arrangements must be made to have such a pupil enrolled in a special school. Deputies will agree that a child facing expulsion probably will not be facilitated in day to day primary or post-primary schools but would have to seek accommodation in a special school where the psychological support services would be much greater.  There is a rule that allows children to be expelled but if recommendations in this regard are taken on board to allow for intervention at an earlier stage children will not reach such a disruptive state.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I ask the Minister seriously to consider including practising teachers in this system.  I spent 30 years teaching and nothing annoyed me more than theoretical teachers.  With due respect to the psychologist in our presence, psychologists are the bane of every teacher because they deal only with theory.  I think the prayer of every teacher each morning is: <Col N="561" />&ldquo;From all psychologists, O Lord deliver us&rdquo;, because psychologists do not deal with practicalities.  Teachers deal with the problems and cannot accept theoretical nonsense.</P>

The term of office of these psychologists expired this year but rather than conclude the service the Department has sanctioned their continuation in the system while their work is being evaluated.  I am satisfied that we will be able to move forward with proposals in this regard.  I share my colleague's concern that services other than those of teachers are needed to deal with problem children.  A proper psychological service in schools would be of benefit and I will bring forward proposals in that regard.</P>

      <P>A number of years ago there was an amount of public disquiet about the complexity of the admission procedures to our universities and technological colleges. In order to minimise the anxiety and cost for students associated with entry to third-level, the Department initiated discussions with the higher education institutions.  These discussions resulted in an improved, simplified and streamlined system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the new system, which has been in place since 1992, improvements include a single application through the CAO/CAS system for all third-level courses in universities and technological colleges, standardisation of the number of subjects reckoned for points purposes and the weighting given to the different grades in the leaving certificate.  This led to a common points system and the circulation of points on the basis of grades obtained at a single sitting of the leaving certificate examination.  These changes were widely welcomed.  The new system combined with the revised grading system in the leaving certificate should reduce the proportion of student places which are allocated by random selection. The result is a simpler, fairer and more efficient process.  While I, of course, appreciate the anxieties associated with the points system, it is fair and transparent <Col N="563" /> relating leaving certificate results to access to third level.  I am not aware of any proposals from the universities to change the present system.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am taken aback by the Minister's reply to this question.  Universities have been dictating the role of education and the system to be applied at second level.  I thought it would be the Minister's role to decide whether this system is suitable.  At present students are almost committing suicide because of the points system, with which most educationalists find serious fault.  I had hoped the Minister would show some concern about this matter.  I would welcome a working group in this very difficult area.  Perhaps a system of interviews could be introduced in conjunction with the points system.  Alternatively, as a well-known national figure in education suggested, the faculties of law, medicine, pharmacy and architecture should be allowed take in a whole range of students who would battle it out for places and at the end of the first year those with talent and flair would be successful.  That would prevent people with the highest number of points from getting places for a profession for which they have no talent.  Perhaps the Minister would review this system which is unsuitable at present.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;given the demographic trends and the problems of accommodation that must be faced in the near future.  As regards the suggestion made by an eminent educationalist that <Col N="564" /> everybody be allowed battle it out for places, that system operated in the sixties when those with the finance who completed second level education battled their way through many programmes before making their final choice.  That system may be open to institutions at the end of this century or the beginning of the next century because I know that Ministers will not be approached to close down buildings due to a lack of new entrants.</P>
      <P>On the question of interviews, there was much public disquiet about interviews and great effort was made to ensure that the selection procedure was simple and transparent.  The only interviews remaining in the system are those for teacher training, the purpose of which is to accept or fail pupils, not to increase the number of points.  There are certain subject matters that require interview such as music, design, hotel and catering management and the arts the students of which have to prepare portfolios.  I am not aware that the public had great confidence in the interview system which operated for colleges.  The suggestion was that students were selected very much on the basis of the schools they attended, the areas in which they grew up and their social status for the profession for which they applied.</P>
      <P>There was also the problem whereby students and their parents had to rush around the country to attend interviews in regional technical colleges in the early days of these colleges.  There was great public disquiet at that stage.  We responded to the expense and concern factor.  I will keep an open mind on it.  I am always prepared to set up a committee, but it is only fair to say that the committee who streamlined this was not set up in my time.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not willing to look at the inequities in the points system, will she look at a specific area where there is clear discrimination against people on low incomes?  A student who qualified for a third level place within the points system and for a higher education grant because of low <Col N="565" /> income might not get that grant because he does not have the leaving certificate honours necessary under the rules.  There is a great inequity there, admittedly in the case of a small number of students, but it has serious consequences for individual students who cannot afford to go to third level even though they have qualified for places.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that we are not questioning the integrity of the leaving certificate as an orthodox examination, or the points system from the point of view of transparency.  Will the Minister agree it is incongruous that one can become a doctor, an optician, a dentist or a vet on the basis of a 20 hour academic examination held in the middle of June, without in some cases any career counselling or discussion with the heads of faculties and that, therefore, aptitude does not seem to come into it?  There should be some element of interview, <Col N="566" /> advice or accessibility to the various features of a profession.  The lack of such facilities seems to account for the relatively high drop-out from many third level colleges after the first year because people have ended up as square pegs in round holes.  The Minister will find that third level colleges are receptive to change.  In a recent article in &ldquo;Education Matters&rdquo; by the Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Tom Mitchell, he alleged that our second level education system is to exam driven.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of driving any of the third level institutions to recreate the matriculation examination.  I am satisfied that the standards required of the leaving certificate will be maintained.  The Deputy is painting a picture which might have been relevant a number of years ago when students went into professions on the basis of the points they were awarded. While we all know the points for last year's leaving certificate examination it is very hard to know what this year's out-turn will be.  We have sanctioned an increased number of career guidance teachers.  Schools hold career nights and invite people involved in the different professions to talk to students.  Things have progressed amazingly since the days when I was at school.  I recently attended an open day organised by the Dublin vocational education committee in the Mansion House where every course available within the remit of the vocational education committee was discussed. The schools facilitate students to attend the various open days that have been held.</P>

When I visit more third level institutions I will take the matter up with the relevant authorities.</P>

Would it not be worth considering an aptitude test for students who wish to attend third level colleges?</P>
      <P>Regional colleges were set up to serve regions but with the introduction of the CA system the students came from all parts of the country.  The courses were to be designed to suit the regions, but that concept seems to have gone out the door with the result that students are coming from Monaghan to Cork and from Cork to Letterkenny.  That is an expensive process. Could we have a module which would rationalise the system?</P>

We have made more guidance counsellors available this year under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  Those teachers will be available to next year's intake.  I hope to see more maturity in the way students fill in forms and that they will apply for courses for which they feel they have an aptitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to regional colleges, among those educated in Dublin there was a feeling that the rest of the country came to Dublin.  The opening of the regional technical colleges was as welcome to those educating children in the greater Dublin area as to those educating them in the regions.  I have not looked specifically at the breakdown in the regional colleges, but I was heartened by a figure which was drawn to my attention <Col N="568" /> last Monday week.  I opened the fantastic Regional Technical College in Tallaght for which £70 million of European funding has been made available.  In that college 650 students are attending courses which began last September and 365 of these are from the local area.  They were selected by means of the points system and chose a course in the technical college nearest them.  I was heartened to see that happening in the Dublin area where there has not been the traditional take-up of third level courses which we find in other countries.  Perhaps the Deputy would like a regional breakdown for attendances at the other regional colleges.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In relation to interviews.  I was not suggesting that they should be the be all and the end all of the selection process.  I am trying to get a balance between academic achievement and aptitude.  Primary teachers will no longer be required to undergo a decent interview, if they look normal they are accepted.  In the past, they were required to undego an examination in singing and an interim in Irish. If people are to become teachers they need to have some flair.  The lack of music could be a serious loss to the nation. In regard to medicine and the famous bedside manner that we talk about, will we end up with doctors who are so academically minded that they will all go on to further studies?  Will there be any GPs left in the country after a certain number of years?  It is not easy to handle this matter properly but we must see whether we can obtain a better balance than we have at present.</P>

      <P>Interviews were very much part of third level selection a number of years ago but no public confidence was expressed in their support. They are not transparent and they are not anonymous.  None of the parents, students and groups interviewed in the course of changing the mechanism and simplifying the administrative procedures asked for additional interviews. The indications to the Department were <Col N="569" /> that the more interviews we could abolish the fairer and more transparent the selection process would be.  I take the Deputy's point concerning the suitability of people to be involved in certain professions. I hope that with the increased number of guidance teachers available and the increased awareness by pupils, we will be able to ensure that if somebody applies for medicine they have a full appreciation of the task they are taking on and the cost to them.</P>

I hope the students selected were suited to the veterinary profession. I also hope that while one cannot have places made available retrospectively for students that this particular student is as good with people as he was with animals.</P>

      <P>In view of the exceptional circumstances which obtain on Inis Meáin, can the Minister give an assurance that the second teacher will be retained at this island school?  There is a distance of some 30 miles from the part of Galway, where the Aran ferry leaves, to Inis Meáin.  The Minister will agree that it would be a retrograde step in this day and age to seek to extract the second teacher from this school.  The requirement to put the teacher's name on the panel may be simply to apply the Department's rules on a nationwide basis.  All Deputies would be sympathetic towards the situation on an offshore island, such as Inis Meáin, where there is a small community.  In view of the effect that <Col N="571" /> would have on the small community population one does not want to do anything that would encourage anybody to leave the island involuntarily, can the Minister give an assurance that the second teacher will be retained?</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic towards the situation but I am not giving any assurance in the House.  I have already said in my reply that representations have been made to the Department on behalf of this school and my response has been to ask one of the Department's inspectors to investigate and report on the matter.  When that report is available I will be in a position to consider whether there are grounds for an exception in this case.  For the Deputy's information, 28 children were enrolled at this school on 30 September 1990 and there are 19 children to be enrolled in the school by 30 September 1993.  The number is based on the numbers for the previous year.  Enrolment at this school has steadily declined during the past ten years.  Special arrangements are made with the Department for extra teachers on island schools.  I do not know whether we will be able in this case in view of the general decline in numbers to retain a teacher but I will await the inspector's report.  We are talking about a temporary teacher who could waive her panel rights.  We have already in the Department a low pupil-teacher ratio to cater for island communities.  If we are to make a particular exception for Inis Meáin so be it, but I would prefer to await the inspector's report for which I have asked, in response to the very many many Deputies who contacted me on behalf of this school.</P>

That is not taking into <Col N="572" /> account any increase which may result from new families returning to live on the island.  Is the Minister aware that while the inspector was on the island he indicated that it was up to the Department of Finance to provide special funds to retain the second teacher?

      <P>The report of the Review Body of the Primary Curriculum examined the whole area of civics and has made recommendations on the matter.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is currently examining these recommendations in consultation with the interested parties. The NCCA will advise me in relation to a revision of this and all other aspects of the curriculum and in that regard I will pay particular attention to the peace studies.</P>
      <P>I consider that, at present, there is sufficient scope and flexibility in the primary and post-primary school curricula under the civics programme to allow the teacher to inculcate in pupils a peace ethic.</P>
      <P>The approach which has generally been taken with topics such as peace studies is to include it either as a cross-curricular theme, as a module within an appropriate subject area or as an integral part of the programme in a relevant subject area or areas.

We do not in any way wish to breach the integrity of history, but nevertheless in <Col N="574" /> the times in which we now live it is crucially important that we include peace studies in our school curricula.  In the light of what the Minister said, has any curriculum development body designed a programme of studies and, if so, how soon can they have a draft programme available for consideration by the Minister? Presumably that will be the time to decide how to fit that programme into an already very much overladen school timetable.  When the programme is drawn up it can be decided whether to put in additional modules, whether it is to be a transdiscipline, transcurricula exercise and what way the peace studies programme will be delivered to the students in the schools.</P>

Geography refers to educating children as a step towards gaining a well rounded education.  It is important that a student approaching final examination should have the opportunity of developing positive attitudes in relation to such matters as the interdependence of people and the need for social co-operation at all levels. There was a reference in regard to economic history to policies for the development of less developed areas.  The curriculum has changed since I studied it.</P>

    <P>In regard to the designing of a programme the NCCA document, Civil, Social and Political Education at Post-primary level, was published in March as a discussion document.  The council sought views by 31 July 1993.  The paper emphasises aspects of mutual respect and understanding at local, national and international levels.  In looking for a response to that by July 1993 we are making progress.  In response to Deputy O'Malley's question, although there was not a specific commitment in the Programme for Government to a particular <Col N="575" /> programme there is certainly a commitment to tackling this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister refers to the fact that there are elements of social interdependence contained in existing courses in schools.  However, it is not enough, if we are to judge by results. Since this question was tabled five murders have been committed in the streets of our towns and cities.  If there was not a great urgency about trying to change attitudes through better and more structured peace studies in schools, it has been brought to our notice in a very forceful way.  We should not delay in putting that kind of teaching in place in our schools.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like, as I am sure would all Members of the House, to extend sympathy to the relations and friends of those who died in such tragic circumstances last week.  Those tragic events serve to remind us of the turmoil and torture to which some people, outwardly leading normal lives, can be subject and of the consequences of their actions for others.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, the Criminal Law (Suicide) (No. 2) Bill, 1993, is to abolish the crime of suicide and thereby remove the stigma of criminality from those who feel that the taking of their own lives is their only solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although no person has been prosecuted in connection with a suicide or an attempted suicide in the recent past, the possibility still exists under the common law system inherited from England that a person could be prosecuted for <Col N="657" /> attempted suicide and receive a sentence of life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Suicide itself is not a statutory offence but it is a felony at common law.  Similarly, attempted suicide is not a statutory offence.  However, under the common law any attempt to commit an indictable offence &mdash; and suicide would be classed as an indictable offence &mdash; is itself an indictable offence.  Because attempted suicide is a common law offence and as there is no statutory provision limiting the penalty which may be imposed, a court may impose whatever fine or term of imprisonment it considers appropriate, up to and including life imprisonment, on a person convicted of attemped suicide.</P>
    <P>There is one statutory provision dealing with attempted suicide but its sole purpose is to provide summary jurisdiction to deal, in certain limited circumstances, with a person who confesses to attempted suicide.  The statutory provision does not affect the substantive law on suicide or attempted suicide when prosecuted on indictment.  The statutory provision I refer to is section 9 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1871, which was amended by section 85 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, suicide is a felony and as such, any person who is an accessory before the fact to a suicide or who counsels, procures or commands a person to commit suicide may be tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if he were a principal felon.  Attempted suicide is a misdemeanor and a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any misdemenour is liable to be tried, indicted and punished as the principal offender.  The provisions governing these matters are set out in the Accessories and Abettors Act, 1861.</P>
    <P>Having given the House a brief outline of the existing law on suicide I must confess that I cannot provide a satisfactory answer to the question as to why suicide was made a criminal offence in the first place.  The common law's approach to suicide reflects the attitude of a more brutal age.  Indeed, the attitude to suicide up to the 19th century could be described <Col N="658" /> as almost vindictive.  One would think that a person who has killed himself would be beyond any sanction of the law. However, this was not the case.  Up to 1870 the property of a person who committed suicide was forfeit to the State and it was only in 1882 that the British Parliament outlawed the practice of interring the remains of a person who had committed suicide in a public highway with a stake driven through the body. Nonsensical though it may seem, it was the practice at one time to hang people who had unsuccessfully attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>The criminal law serves no purpose in dealing with the human tragedy of suicide.  It does not prevent people committing suicide, it does not deter attempts at suicide and there is certainly no justification for treating people with suicidal tendencies as if they were criminals. Suicide is the ultimate cry of despair.  An attempt at suicide may well be a plea for help but it certainly should not be classed as a criminal activity.  What these people need is assistance and they should be given every encouragement to seek it. They should not be afraid to disclose their problems for fear of criminal prosecution. What is needed is compassion, sympathy and sound medical help, not criminal sanctions.  I am sure I will have the support of this House in decriminalising suicide.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Bill itself.  It has long been accepted that suicide should be decriminalised and it was intended to include measures to abolish the felony of suicide in a comprehensive Bill which would reform and update various aspects of the criminal law which derive from the common law.  Unfortunately for reasons which I will not go into now, publication of that Bill has had to be delayed.  When I took office as Minister for Justice earlier this year I decided that there should be no further delay in putting forward the Government's proposal on decriminalising suicide.  I arranged for a separate Bill dealing solely with this issue to be brought forward and this has now been published and is before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is extremely short, only <Col N="659" /> three sections.  The main provision is section 2 (1)  states clearly and concisely that &ldquo;suicide shall cease to be a crime&rdquo;. Abolishing the offence of suicide also automatically abolishes the offence of attempting to commit suicide.  A similar situation arises in the case of the offence committed by a person who is an accessory to suicide or attempted suicide.  The abolition of the offence of suicide means that it will no longer be an offence under the common law to be an accomplice to suicide or attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the existing offence of being an accomplice to suicide gives rise to certain dangers.  The sanctity of human life must be respected and the law cannot condone a person who wilfully encourages or assists the taking of a human life even if the actual act is self-inflicted.  For this reason section 2 (2)  of the Bill makes it an offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide or an attempt at suicide of another person.</P>
    <P>The subsection provides that a person convicted of such an offence shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.  This is less than the existing penalty of life imprisonment but it still marks out the offence as being serious. The reason that a severe penalty is being provided for is to cover situations where a person deliberately procures the suicide of another for his own motives.  For example a dominant personality, rather than committing murder, might induce his intended victim to commit suicide.  A depressed person with suicidal tendancies if caught in a moment of despair would be easy prey for a manipulative person who had anything to gain from his death.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3)  of section 2 in effect provides for a verdict of complicity in suicide as an alternative verdict in cases where a person is charged with murder or manslaughter.  If the facts support it, the jury may return a verdict that the accused aided, abetted, counselled or procured the suicide of another person as an alternative to a verdict of murder or a verdict of manslaughter.  This type <Col N="660" /> of scenario is most likely to arise in the case of a suicide pact where one person survives.  The jury will have to decide on the basis of the evidence whether the accused killed the other person and is therefore guilty of murder or whether the accused was merely an accomplice to the suicide of the other person and therefore guilty of an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Subsection (4)  is a technical provision which means prosecutions can only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Because of the nature of the offence of complicity in suicide it is considered right that there should be some central control on the initiation of prosecutions under the new offence created by subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a straightforward repeal of section 9 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Amendment, Act, 1871, which was amended by section 85 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  The section provides that where a person is charged with and confesses to attempted suicide before a judge of the District Court he may be convicted and imprisoned for any period not exceeding three months unless he does not consent to having his case heard by the District Court or unless the judge is of opinion that the charge is fit to be made the subject of prosecution by indictment rather than to be disposed of summarily.</P>
    <P>This provision will be superfluous when the offence of suicide is abolished. Indeed, if the provision was not to be repealed it might cause confusion as to the abolition of the offence of attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>As its short title suggests the Bill purports to deal only with the criminal law aspects of suicide.  I am well aware that the question of suicide raises a significant number of issues outside the scope of the criminal law.  It is horrifying to think that in 1990 and 1991 there were more than 300 suicides per annum or nearly one suicide per day in Ireland.  This is not an issue about which we can be complacent. The complexity of the problem has been highlighted by a number of studies and reports.  One of the better known studies was undertaken by Dr. Michael Kelleher <Col N="661" /> and Ms. Maura Daly (a consultant psychiatrist) on suicide in Cork and Ireland and was published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 1990.  They highlighted the many factors which in their opinion probably contribute to an individual act of suicide.  These include physical and mental illness, alcoholism, personality structure and social isolation.</P>
    <P>A statement made by the Psychological Society of Ireland in May 1992 also pointed out that suicide is a complex problem with sociological and environmental influences, medical and neurochemical influences and psychological influences.  They remarked that suicide is everybody's business and should be dealt with in the public forum.  The schools, the health boards' community care programme and the media were identified as important mediums of primary intervention in the area.</P>
    <P>The society in their statement called for suicide to be decriminalised and this is now being done.</P>
    <P>I have made the point that suicide raises many issues outside the scope of the criminal law but I do not wish to stray too far from the object of the Bill. However, as well as being responsible for criminal law reform I am also responsible for the operation of the prisons and suicide has important implications in this area.  I would like to touch upon the question of suicides by persons in custody.</P>
    <P>The number is running at between three and five a year.  This has been a matter of concern to me and to my predecessors and I should, for the information of the House say that the strategy for dealing with suicides in prisons is as recommended in the report of the advisory group on prison deaths published in August 1991.  The report has 57 recommendations and so far 50 of them have been or are being implemented.  They include 24 hour medical orderly cover in eight closed institutions which was made possible by the appointment of 43 additional trained staff at a cost of £500,000 a year; an increase in the number of clinical psychologists which will shortly go up from three to six and <Col N="662" /> will include a female psychologist to work in the women's prison; professional counselling of both prisoners and staff after a suicide is discovered; the installation of a cell-call system in all institutions to enable a prisoner in distress to call for help; introduction of a service by the Samaritans in seven places of detention which will shortly be extended to the remaining five places; provision of a dedicated phoneline to the Samaritans for prisoners' use which is now available in three places and which is to be extended to the remaining places as soon as possible; training for staff in suicide awareness; setting up a suicide prevention group in each place of detention to monitor developments in relation to suicide prevention and to take precautionary action on the spot; improvement in GP services; improvement in the arrangements for special observation of prisoners at risk; revision of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947; improvements in committal arrangements; training with resuscitation equipment; provision of in-cell sanitation (a seven year programme).</P>
    <P>The remaining seven recommendations are long-term in nature and will be taken into account as the prison system develops.  They include the provision of a committal assessment centre, a new female prison, a new open centre for women prisoners and a special unit to cater for psychiatrically disturbed violent prisoners.  The advisory group itself recognised the long-term implications of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>While no effort is being spared in pursuing a planned programme of action in suicide prevention, it has to be said, regrettably, that no prevention programme can guarantee complete success. This is a fact which the advisory group acknowledged when they said: &ldquo;if a person is sufficiently determined to commit suicide, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent him doing so&rdquo;.  Constant and unremitting supervision of a prisoner at risk might be successful but again the report cautions that this could be &ldquo;an obstacle to a person recovering from a trauma or crisis that <Col N="663" /> puts him in the risk category in that the supervision itself would be oppressive.&rdquo; The group made the further comment that &ldquo;whereas many people who commit suicide in prison are or have been regarded as at risk, suicides occur among inmates in respect of whom there is no indication whatever that they are at risk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that in the prisons, as in society at large, we are dealing with a highly complex phenomenon for which there are no easy remedies.  In relation to prisons, I hope it is clear that all practicable steps are being taken to anticipate and prevent suicides.  I wish I could confirm that these efforts will be fully effective but, given the complexities involved, I would prefer to confine myself to the hope that prison suicides will be kept to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to stray slightly from the scope of the Bill in addressing the question of suicides in prisons and would like to conclude by saying that I believe this measure will have the support of the House and express the hope that the decriminalisation of suicide, long overdue, might help in some small way to encourage those who might feel unable to seek professional help because of the criminal stigma attached to seeking such help.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment my colleague in the Seanad, Senator Neville, who introduced a Private Members' Bill in 1991 to decriminalise suicide.  Because of our system of Government the then <Col N="664" /> Minister suggested he would introduce a suicide Bill within a month but that did not happen.  In October 1992 Fine Gael introduced its Bill.  Now the Government is introducing a suicide Bill.  If we had a little more common sense much more efficient work would be carried out in this House.  Having a Bill introduced by the Government just for the sake of having it done in that fashion is not helpful to the expedient passing of legislation.  This Bill is basically the same as that introduced by my colleague, Senator Neville.</P>
    <P>We could debate the suicide Bill at length.  It is important that we have at long last grasped the nettle, seen common sense and agreed it is no longer tolerable to regard somebody who commits or attempts to commit suicide as being a criminal.  Those people deserve our sympathy, not our condemnation. Their families deserve our sympathy also. Removing the stigma attached to suicide is the first step to helping those people. We often look back with nostalgia to the good old days.  St. Augustine, who had many skills and talents, spoke out strongly about the evil of suicide.  The Church regarded suicide as a very serious offence.  The good old days were probably not as good as we thought they were.</P>
    <P>France decriminalised suicide in 1898 and Great Britain did this in 1960.  Now that we are a member of the EC it is desirable that we keep pace with legislation in other member states.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the suicide rate has risen steadily here.  The recorded suicide rate in 1990 was 60 compared with 319 in 1991.  The recorded number may not be an accurate figure.  Because of the complexities of the Coroners Act, 1992, deaths by suicide were often not recorded as such.  Rather than dwell on the number of deaths by suicide that were not recorded we should look to the future and consider why there are so many suicides.</P>
    <P>Suicides tend to follow a pattern. When a person commits suicide others may follow that example.  In the future we must investigate what help may be given people suffering from stress.  Today many people suffer from stress.  Unemployment, financial problems and the <Col N="665" /> abuse of alcohol may all contribute to a person's attempting to commit suicide.  It is difficult to understand why somebody takes this action.  We could spend our time discussing the reasons that people commit suicide but we should plan to help people who may be considering this action.</P>
    <P>Counselling should be made available to families who are grieving for a member of their family who has committed suicide.  It is a very traumatic time for them.  It is difficult enough for a family when a member dies from natural causes but when a family member dies by taking his or her life it is an added trauma for the family involved.  Recognised and readily available counselling should be provided for those families and, in particular, for people who attempt suicide.  It is very important that their worries are taken into account and that they receive proper counselling.</P>
    <P>Very often young people panic over simple matters.  It is sad to hear of young people committing suicide in the run up to examination time.  One often thinks that if those people could have been caught in time and discussed their problems, suicide might have been prevented. People often panic.  They may not be able to see the wood for the trees and can see no solution to their problems.  It is important that those who have survived suicide attempts be counselled and reassured that their problems are not as serious as they feared.  I hope such counselling services will be available.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and to the point.  It decriminalises suicide and section 3 provides for that in a brief paragraph.  I welcome also the fact that section 4 will provide against some misguided individual encouraging another person to commit suicide.  Such people may be detained for 14 years for this crime.  We must ensure that the vulnerable are not taken advantage of by anyone for financial or any other gain.  This provision covers the case of a friend suggesting suicide to another friend.  I do not see much point in talking about the background to the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and <Col N="666" /> I hope it will go through the House in 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Change in the law in this area is long overdue.  This law was changed in the United Kingdom in 1961.  Having criticised the Minister this morning in her absence, I wish to compliment her now in bringing forward this legislation.  I consider this a good Bill and I do not intend to put down any amendments to it.  I hope I am not being negligent in that regard. Having sought advice, I am told it is an appropriate Bill to deal with the law in this area.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reality that suicide is on the increase.  Deputy Browne referred to the official statistics which I have before me. They indicate for 1991, the last year for which the Library has official statistics, that 318 people committed suicide, 252 males and 66 females.  Sixty per cent of those who committed suicide were between the ages of 15 and 35.  For the first three quarters of 1992 the number of people who committed suicide is 240 &mdash; an alarming figure.  Unfortunately, many experts in the social field of psychology and psychiatry advise that the figures grossly underestimate the scale of the problem.  It has been suggested that the figure could be closer to 1,000 people than 300.  Personally, I know of three families who have experienced the trauma of suicide in the last two weeks and that is an absolute tragedy.  Together with the Minister I extend sympathy to those families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the media are not present for this debate but I am sure they are watching the monitors.  I would appeal to the media to be more cautious and more respectful of the tragedy that families suffer and the privacy they require when reporting on such cases.  I <Col N="667" /> am not suggesting the media should not inform the public or that they should not do their job but perhaps they could consider, in some cases, not revealing the identity of the people involved and not going into the gruesome details which cause such heartbreak to the family, relatives and friends involved.  I make that appeal having met many of the families of suicide victims in recent times.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, suicide is not a statutory offence.  It is an offence at common law.  Suicide is a felony and attempted suicide is a misdemeanour.  I am not a lawyer but I look forward to the day when there will be an end to the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours. I recall a commitment in the Programme for Government to end that distinction and it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, who is not a lawyer but whom I know to be a practical person, that the closer our law can be to using everyday language the better.  In the course of preparing for Bills in this House in relation to justice, I have had an opportunity to study American legislation.  That legislation is very understandable but the Irish or British legislation is virtually impossible to comprehend.  One would almost require a senior counsel to go through the legislation line by line.  I would ask the Minister to encourage her Department when reforming the criminal law, which is now the only area left to the Department of Justic, civil law having moved to the new Department, to simplify the wording of the law.  That would make it easier for the ordinary citizen and, indeed, for the practitioner.  It would probably save thousands of pounds in legal actions on foot of the jargon in respect of which lawyers use dictionaries and take court cases.  Such language may mean one thing today and something else next year.  If the Minister could deal with this matter she would be providing a great service.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to how suicide was dealt with in the past.  Although it was a criminal offence, obviously, the perpetrator who committed suicide could not be apprehended.  There was a very <Col N="668" /> brutal way of dealing with suicide victims. Their estate was forfeited, they were buried at the crossroads with a stake through their heart and it was not until 1882 that they could obtain religious rites for the burial.  Society at that time had a very brutal way of dealing with the victims of suicide.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this Bill not alone decriminalises suicide but also decriminalises attempted suicide.  I believe a person who attempts suicide is crying out for help.  Like so many areas of our law, some laws in this area are so archaic and inhuman in many respects that they are rightly not enforced.  Laws which are not enforced are laws which are not respected and are unnecessary.  I am delighted that attempted suicide will no longer be regarded as a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Obviously aiding and abetting a person to commit suicide has to be a serious offence.  I ask the Minister to comment on a suggestion made to me.  This suggestion was also made in an article by Peter Charlton in <i>The Irish Criminal Law Series &mdash; Offences Against the Person</i> published by The Round Hall Press during the last 12 to 18 months, in which he stated:</P>
    <P>It is arguable that a person who accidentally kills another in the course of attempted suicide lacks the moral culpability ordinarily associated with murder, and is more appropriately to be convicted of manslaughter by criminal negligence.</P>
    <P>Is that what will happen as a result of this Bill, or will it be manslaughter in a different sense rather than manslaughter through criminal negligence?  This is not referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I presume it will be very difficult to prove that a person aided and abetted another person to commit suicide.  As the person who has committed suicide is dead, obviously one will not have much evidence.  We have read about cases where a person supplied the poison and where one of the people who got into the car lived while the other died.  Those are very graphic situations and I wonder how realistic it is to expect that a person will ever be prosecuted for aiding and abetting <Col N="669" /> someone to commit suicide.  I ask the Minister to tell the House whether anyone in this jurisdiction has ben prosecuted in recent years for aiding and abetting another person to commit suicide. How likely is it that this provision will be enforced?</P>
    <P>Under the Coroners Act, 1962, a coroner cannot return a verdict of suicide as he is prohibited from making anyone civilly or criminally liable consequent on death.  I presume that changing the law in this area will allow a coroner to return a verdict of suicide.  This will probably give a more realistic figure of the number of deaths from suicide than the official figures we have at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that 50 of the 57 recommendations made by the Prison Advisory Group have been implemented.  The last time I read about this issue, I think 33 recommendations had been implemented.  Obviously, the Minister has implemented 17 recommendations in recent times.  I compliment her on this.  It is important that these recommendations are implemented because, as the Prison Advisory Group said, people in prison were 16 times more liable to die than the general population at large.  That is a frightening statistic.  I ask the Minister, if she has any figures at her disposal, to tell me the nature of the offences committed by prisoners who committed suicide.  Were they serving long sentences?  What were they in prison for?  Some research in this area would give us more insight into this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the general issue of suicide.  I am not going to pretend that I am an expert on this issue as I certainly am not.  However, I have spoken with a number of people who work in the general social work-psychology area.  Contrary to the perception many people may have, they have told me that people who commit suicide do not immediately beforehand manifest any signs of depression.  Very often the reverse may be the case.  Immediately before they commit suicide, people who are inclined to be depressed may appear to be very happy go lucky.  This makes it extremely difficult for families and those who may <Col N="670" /> be concerned about their loved ones to seek help.  The family, friends and close associates of a person who commits suicide are devastated by the death.  They feel responsible and guilty and believe that they should have got help for the person.  Yet experts have told me that in many cases the person who commits suicide shows no obvious signs that they are about to do so.  I have also been told that women are more inclined to attempt suicide crying out for help, while men will commit suicide rather than attempt it.  If that is the case, it is very interesting.</P>
    <P>Many people say that people commit suicide because of the pressures caused by unemployment, the breakdown of a relationship, the loss of a loved one and financial difficulties.  I do not accept that this is the case.  All of these factors may accelerate a problem and trigger off the suicide, but I do not think they could be considered to be the entire cause of the suicide.  Most people have to deal with many of these difficulties during their lifetime; many people have to deal with enormous pressures, time and time again.  Obviously, people who commit suicide feel they cannot cope and cannot go on, that death is preferable to living.</P>
    <P>We need to provide a mechanism in our society to help people who feel so down that they think there is no way out of their difficulties.  The Victims Support Group administered on a voluntary basis by Ann Meade &mdash; Derek Nally was one of the founders of this group &mdash; does not get the kind of assistance it deserves. When I raised this issue by way of parliamentary question I was told that it got virtually what it asked for by way of grant aid, an increase of 20 per cent from £15,000 to £18,000.  While this is true, the reason this group asked for so little aid is that it has found it extremely difficult to get any aid whatsoever in the past number of years.  In fact, the group has acknowledged that it has set its sights very low.  I know that the Minister is very supportive of this group and I think in the next week or two she will formally open its counselling room in the Four Courts where the victims of crime can be counselled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> Much more needs to be done in this area.  In a recent case a person telephoned the Victims Support Group approximately half an hour before they committed suicide.  They left a meassage on the answering machine but because the group does not have any paid help &mdash; it cannot afford it &mdash; the call was only received after the weekend.  I do not want to say the time it was received as that would indicate who the person was, which would not be fair.  When I heard about this case yesterday I thought that if someone had been there to receive the call &mdash; I am not saying that someone should be there 24 hours a day &mdash; and more help was given, this group could provide a much more comprehensive service. I ask the Minister to do what she can to give additional resources to the Victims Support Group, an extremely professional body which deals in a very caring and understanding way with the victims of crime.  Crime seems to be a contributory factor to suicide and we should help the victims of crime to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Samaritans provide an outstanding service.  I think they have opened in Newbridge their ninth centre where they have a voluntary staff of approximately 90.  They provide an outstanding service and if it were not for them there would be many more suicide victims.  I am delighted that a phone line to the Samaritans has been provided in three detention centres.  I hope that this phone line will be provided in all detention centres as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am talking about voluntary services. There is much goodwill in our community and much work can be done on a voluntary basis.  While we need not necessarily always have paid work, we need to have more respect and provide more assistance for the voluntary sector.  Much of the work done in the areas of social services and health services and by the Victims Support Group is done by women.  The very good voluntary work done in our society saves the taxpayer enormous amounts of money and takes a burden off the Exchequer.  The more <Col N="672" /> we can do in terms of giving voluntary groups the back-up and financial assistance they require the better.</P>
    <P>In relation to pressure on young people and so on, while recognising that this is not directly the responsibility of the Minister for Justice but is a responsibility of Government and of the Oireachtas generally, many of the cases referred to earlier were of very young people, as young as 15 or 16, many attending school, facing examinations.  I contend the overall pressure within our educational system toward achievement is leading many young people to feel they just cannot cope, to a sense of hopelessness about the position in which they find themselves, with pressure being exerted at home and by society to attend college, to gain X number of points and so on.  I really believe that our educational system is largely responsible &mdash; I am not saying for causing suicides &mdash; for exerting pressure that, thankfully, does not always manifest itself in suicide but places an awful pressure on so many young people at a very early stage and is a huge drain on them as people.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether there is any way through the schools system we can reduce that pressure.  I know that changing the examination structure is a matter for the continuing discussion on the Green Paper and proposed White Paper on education. I wonder whether there is any way through the schools system we could introduce some crisis help for young people being subjected to this awful pressure, perhaps constituting an informal part of the schools curriculum or whatever; perhaps a visit on the part of somebody from the Victims Support Group, I do not know.  But there must be a way of being able through the schools system to help the many young people who feel so pressurised.  Thankfully, this pressure does not always manifest itself in suicide.  Much of it manifests itself in drugs dependency, alcoholism and so on. Certainly, we need to detect such pressure at a very early stage and provide the type of support required.</P>
    <P>While recognising that the Minister said she was dealing only with the criminal <Col N="673" /> or legal aspects of suicide, I should say that in the course of our discussions generally other problems in regard to suicide have been drawn to my attention. It is in relation to the insurance implications for wives spouses in relation to the home, as I understand that the procedure varies from one insurance company to another.  I think some insurance companies will honour a mortgage protection policy in circumstances where the mortgager has been a suicide victim. However, I am informed that there are other cases where that is not the case and that a wife whose husband, the bread winner, committed suicide, could find she does not have the benefit of the proceeds of the mortgage protection policy.  That is not a matter for the criminal law.  The Minister knows that, but it is something we need to be understanding and sympathetic of in our society, particularly in relation to the home.  I am not necessarily advocating that all loans and outstanding debts should be covered or that somebody contemplating suicide would not decide to take out a loan of £500,000 or whatever to ensure their wife/spouse would be looked after.  But, as the retention of the home is essential to the protection and welfare of any family, I should like to think that that would be covered in all cases.  Probably the Minister has more information at her disposal than I have in this respect.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this Bill, as does my party.  Once and for all it will remove the stigma of criminality from suicide, rendering the trauma somewhat easier for the families of suicide victims.  It is an issue not spoken about in our society. Nobody wants to admit that a member of their family has committed suicide and not just because of the criminality element.  In any event I think a stigma will remain, but so far as we as legislators can remove or help to remove that stigma, I believe we have an obligation to do so.  The provisions of this Bill will play their part but we need to do an awful lot more.  Certainly, we need to do very much more by way of research into why it is that so many people in our society, particularly so many young people, <Col N="674" /> commit or attempt to commit suicide, and in the case of attempts sometimes they will be so numerous that eventually the person will commit suicide.  The attempt is somebody crying out for help. I hope that there is no place in our society where such help is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify questions in relation to the interpretation of manslaughter in the Coroners Act, 1962.  I know it is deemed to be death by negligence.  I want to make sure there is no distinction between manslaughter and what is referred to here as manslaughter by criminal negligence; or am I to assume that manslaughter is always as a result of criminal negligence and that I am stating the unnecessary?  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>It is right that this Bill should be passed and that we should not delay it by unnecessarily tabling amendments for the sake of doing so.  What we have here is a very good appropriate Bill to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Members of this House, I welcome this Bill, which is long overdue.  I want to take this opportunity of publicly recognising the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill today.</P>
      <P>The last prosecution for attempted suicide was in 1967.  Proposals going back since then to abolish the offence have remained proposals only.  Today we have a Bill introduced to decriminalise suicide. I am glad to be able to take part in this debate.  The Bill demonstrates an attitudinal change in society, recognising that such laws are not deterrents to someone contemplating suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might well pose the question: why has society decided to date that suicide is a crime?  One explanation may be found perhaps in the religious approach to suicide, which has been to condemn it absolutely, culminating in the denial of a Christian burial to its victims.  This led to the common law regarding suicide as self-murder. The confiscation of goods of suicide victims was abolished by the general abolition of the forfeiture of goods for felony by the Forfeiture Act of 1870. <Col N="675" /> The Internments Act, 1882, also made some attempt to understand the act of suicide.  The only effect of criminalisation of suicide is to compound the distress and pain of bereaved relatives and friends. Surely relatives, in dealing with feelings of doubt, self-blame, rejection and anger, should not have these emotions compounded by an unrealistic, inhumane law?</P>
    <P>The reasons a person may take his own life are complex.  Every suicide is idiosyncratic but not random.  Dr. Schneidman outlines ten commonalities. First, the purpose of those who wish to commit suicide is to seek a solution; second, the goal is the cessation of consciousness; third, the stimulus is intolerable psychological pain; fourth, the stress is frustrated psychological needs; fifth, the emotion is hopelessness, contrary to what some people believe to be depression, a distinction quite rightly drawn by Deputy Harney.  Sixth, the internal attitude of the individual contemplating suicide is ambivalent, the subject seeing the dark world of the self and the brighter world of others; seventh, his or her cognitive state is one of constriction, that is, he or she is unable to generate options for solution of the problems facing him or her except through suicide; eighth, the belief that his or her action will lead to escape from problems is one of the common reasons for committing suicide.  Ninth, Dr. Schneidman contends that suicide is an interpersonal act, contending that there is always communication with other; tenth, that there is a consistency among subjects with regard to their lifelong coping patterns.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note one statistic, that 55 to 70 per cent of suicide victims have clearly stated their interest in so doing and 80 per cent have made direct or indirect statements of their intent.</P>
    <P>Anne O'Donnell of St. John of God's Hospital, Stillorgan, who is a psychologist there, has said that suicide rates are higher in the elderly and is higher in the case of men of all ages.  She contends that the antecedent factors are psychological &mdash; for example, hopelessness, <Col N="676" /> schizophrenia, chronic physical illness, and social reasons such as loneliness can also abound.  She contends that those people most at risk are the bereaved.  It is interesting to note here that men have higher suicide rates in the first years after bereavement.  Those living in isolated areas &mdash; and I do not mean in a geographical sense &mdash; are also most at risk, as are those who suffer from chronic physical illness, those who are depressed and particularly those suffering from alcoholism.  Of course, the one great indicator of those likely to commit suicide are those who have already made previous attempts.</P>
    <P>As a society we must strive for greater awareness of and education on the issue of suicide.  We must now begin to pull back the veil of silence on this issue. According to Michael J. Kelleher, in an article published in the <i>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine</i> in February 1993, &ldquo;suicide is a significant public health problem which has increased in magnitude in Ireland over the past three decades&rdquo;.  He also says that it is a problem that is wider than medicine and that the changes in frequency are likely to reflect social and attitudinal changes rather than changes in illness pattern.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one among a few countries where suicide and attempted suicide remain on the Statute Book as criminal offences.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill abolishes the offence of suicide, which is a felony under common law.  Subsection (2) will make it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another. The purpose of this is to protect persons with suicidal tendencies from others who, for whatever motives, might encourage or assist them to commit suicide.  To assist someone in the act of suicide will remain subject to the criminal law.  A penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment is proposed for aiding and abetting suicide.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of assisted suicide and euthanasia, Dr. Kelleher in the same article said that most of those who take their lives are ambivalent right up to the time of their death.  If those entrusted with the responsibility of preventing such deaths are also ambivalent this attitude <Col N="677" /> could communicate itself to suicidal patients and those appointed to look after them.  Hence, the Bill must give a clear line in this regard.  This is done in section 2 (2) and (3) of the Bill.  Section 3 states that attempted suicide will no longer be an offence and for this reason section 9 of the 1871 Act is being repealed.</P>
    <P>It is my hope, given our knowledge of the difficulties which young people in particular face, that a more enlightened approach will be adopted to the question of suicide.  There is a need for greater understanding of the issue.  Indeed, the statistics which are available do not mirror the true situation accurately.  This can be put down to a number of reasons, including social reasons and the legal position pertaining to suicide and attempted suicide.  If a more humane approach was adopted some of the distress experienced by relatives would be alleviated.  We, as a society must try to understand and press for funding to enable the professionals to continue to provide the much needed counselling and medical care in this area.  As Deputy Harney said, voluntary groups continue to carry out tremendous work in this regard.  This work and the assistance they provide on a daily basis is not always recognised.  We, as public representatives, should avail of the opportunity presented by this debate today to thank them for the tremendous work they continue to do and their commitment.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to another issue which Deputy Harney raised and that is the importance of the psychological services within schools.  The Government has given a commitment in the Programme for Government to provide extra funding in this regard and it must be commended for this.  However, I hope this service will not be confined to the national school system but, as soon as funding is made available, extended to second level schools also.</P>
    <P>Earlier this afternoon I listened to the proceedings at question time on the monitor when I heard some disparaging remarks from the Opposition benches about those who work in the psychological service.  This indicates a lack of <Col N="678" /> understanding and knowledge of the difficulties which young people face and of the tremendous work being done by psychologists, teachers and all others in the education system.</P>

      <P>They are there to tackle the difficult emotional problems which individuals face in the classroom. They are professionals with specific skills and they work in tandem with other professionals, namely, teachers.  They provide assistance to teachers who have been looking for such a psychological service within the system for a long time.  If they did not believe that such a service was necessary they would not be looking for it.</P>
      <P>It is important we realise at all times that young and old face many problems and difficulties.  As Deputy Harney said, if we are to alleviate the problems which young people in particular face, such facilities must be made available at the earliest possible moment.  The Government has given a commitment in the programme for Government to provide facilities in the education system.</P>
      <P>I am only too happy to welcome the Bill, which, as I said at the outset, is long overdue.  I am sure it will receive support from all sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill as it is long past time that we decriminalise suicide.  There is no harm in reminding ourselves that suicide is a felony under the law which we inherited from the British when the State was founded.  It is highly unlikely that suicide would have been criminalised back in 1921 if it has not been a crime on the Statute Book when the State was founded.  Indeed, the Minister outlined just how barbaric the law was in the latter half of the last century.</P>
      <P>By far and away the biggest advantage to be gained in decriminalising suicide is that the stigma will be removed while the burden on the families of those who commit suicide will be eased.  We will also ensure that better statistics are available on the incidence of suicide in our society, because as has been pointed out, we cannot be certain that we have the true figures for the numbers of people who commit suicide.  This has always been a problem.  Indeed, reference has been made to the difficulty that coroners face in the coroner's court.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of suicides not only in this country but throughout Europe must be the source of concern.  It appears that young people, especially men, are more at risk than other groups in society.  This is true right across Europe.  What is the reason people commit suicide?  If the answer was simple we would have the answer and be able to prevent it.  Depression is a major factor. This can take the form of a disease or be brought about as a result of social circumstances.  In this regard, given that it is difficult to understand why this should be the case at the end of the 20th century when living conditions are better than they were 50 to 70 years ago, there is a necessity to carry out much more research to see exactly what part the social environment plays in relation to the incidence of suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that alcohol is a factor in a number of cases, as it is in so many other aspects of Irish life. We need to look at the role of alcohol in terms of its being a precipitating factor <Col N="680" /> in suicide and also the risks of people committing suicide when under the influence.  We need to formulate a national policy on alcohol because there is no doubt that its abuse contributes to many of the problems in our society.  We have to change our attitude to alcohol at an individual and community level and the Government has an important role to play in this regard, first in bringing forward a national policy on alcohol and in ensuring that our young people have every opportunity to learn about alcohol abuse and how to use alcohol properly. They have to be able to make up their own minds so that when they are 18 they can decide for themselves whether they want to use alcohol appropriately.</P>
    <P>In many cases those who commit suicide may have been crying out for help. For example, somebody may take an overdose of tablets to draw attention to their problems but unfortunately they may take more than necessary and as a result may die.  Suicide occurs among the general population as well as among those attending the psychiatric services. This begs the question as to how we improve the services in order to ensure we reduce the incidence of suicide. Would a further improvement of the psychiatric services reduce the number of persons who commit suicide?  We cannot predict who is likely to commit suicide; therefore it is important that we see what can be done to improve the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a dramatic change in the way the psychiatric services are delivered.  I am sure everybody in this House welcomes the change whereby many more people can be treated in the community.  In 1958 there were over 22,000 people in our psychiatric hospitals.  Today there are fewer than 8,000.  That is to be welcomed.  I welcome the development of community psychiatry.  Perhaps the number of suicides may decrease if everybody who requires psychiatric care was locked up but no one would want to see that.  A way we can develop the psychiatric services is by trying to reduce the incidence of suicide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Apart from patients attending the psychiatric services many people in the community, who never attended psychiatric services, commit suicide.  We must consider why they do it and what we could do to help them.  It is recognised that very many of those who have not been attending the psychiatric services attend their general practitioner in the two to three months before their suicide. This begs the question as to how we might improve the service of the general practitioner to ensure that these people might be identified and that there would be early intervention so that the number of suicides would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to learn that they established suicide prevention centres in the United States.  These are drop-in centres where people can walk in, but views are mixed as to whether they have been successful and as to what contribution they have made.  We in Ireland can appreciate the contribution the Samaritans have made to helping people who are under stress.  In Britain they recently brought out a new policy document <i>Mental Health of the Nation</i> in which the stated hope is to reduce the incidence of suicide in the community by 15 per cent and to reduce the incidence among patients in the psychiatric hospitals by 33 per cent.  They hope to do this by developing community psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Harney and de Valera on the need for improved psychological services for young people.  Many young people are not able to cope and whatever support they need should be put in place, not alone to prevent suicide but to promote their general health when they are young and later in life.</P>
    <P>A number of areas need to be looked at.  I suppose some of them are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and others the responsibility of other Ministers.  One area is the sale of drugs. The very common drugs like panadol and asprin have been used by those attempting to commit suicide and by some who have committed suicide.  That brings into focus the question of the control of drugs and the responsibility on the professionals, <Col N="682" /> the medics and the pharmacists, to ensure that people do not have too many drugs and that they are not circulating too freely.</P>
    <P>Another product has been used to commit suicide is gramoxone.  I would like to see the sale of gramoxone banned until such time as there is an antidote to it.  It has been used by many people committing suicide and it causes them a very painful death.  It should be banned until there is some form of treatment to prevent death in that way.</P>
    <P>The sale of firearms is not a problem in this country but it is in other countries, particularly the United States.  It is not necessary to bring in legislation to control firearms.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it is very clear in what it sets out to do, which is to decriminalise suicide.  I welcome also the section in the Bill that will ensure that aiding and abetting anybody commiting suicide remains a serious crime in the laws of this State.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MoosajeeBhamjee" hpid="Dr. Bhamjee Dr. Bhamjee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Bhamjee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this Bill has been brought forward.  Suicide is increasing in our community.  At present the records indicate that the number is 250 suicides per year but I think this is an under statement and recent reports and investigations show it to be of the order of 1,000 per year.  This is a high number and means that about three suicides are committed every day.  This has to be looked at.  The number of attempted suicides is increasing also.  Under the present system, people who attempt suicide could be prosecuted.  I am glad that legislation to deal with this matter has been introduced.  Attempted suicide is a cry for help.  In Glasgow one hospital ward is occupied each weekend by people who attempted suicide.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, there are different methods of committing suicide, the taking of tablets being the most common among females.  The availability of tablets in supermarkets and shops will have to be considered.  Many chemists believe that tablets should be available solely from pharmacies.  In most cases tablets are sold in containers which are easily <Col N="683" /> opened.  If they were contained in sachets from which each one has to be pushed out individually people might be deterred from committing suicide in this way.</P>
      <P>Attempted suicide is part of life in certain areas, in many cases it is a call for help.  Young people see it as a way of getting attention or of blackmailing their parents into allowing them to go to dances or to go out with boyfriends. These people should receive assistance from psychiatrists or psychologists and should not be prosecuted &mdash; I am glad that has not been the practice here.  In France people who attempt suicide are prosecuted.</P>
      <P>About 80 per cent of suicides are caused by depression.  Anti-depressants are used as the principal treatment for depression, with counselling.  I am glad there is an increasing number of psychologists available for counselling.  The Minister for Education is at present considering the provision of psychologist services in schools.  The number of suicides among alcoholics is very high, even years after they have been treated.</P>
      <P>Recently people have taken their lives due to social factors, the main one being marital difficulties because people realise there is no way out.  I am glad divorce legislation is being considered as it will provide an opportunity for people to get out of broken marriages and perhaps they will not feel such a loss of pride when their marriage breaks up.  Another cause of suicide is lack of employment &mdash; recently there was much talk about the two young people in Limerick who committed suicide because they could not find employment.  The medical profession is considering the question of unemployment and other social factors that may cause suicide.  Another cause of suicide is lack of housing, and I am glad Deputy Stagg is trying to solve the housing problem.  There is a link between psychiatry and politics &mdash; perhaps that is why I went forward for election.</P>

      <P>By saying certain things in this House or taking a stand on certain issues, some of which will be dealt with very soon by the new Government, one could be committing political suicide.</P>
      <P>Suicide can be an impulsive act.  People may feel suicidal for a couple of minutes or even for a couple of hours.  Sometimes it helps for these people to talk to the Samaritans who are available 24 hours a day.  I advise people who come to me with problems to ring the Samaritans who are trained to take their calls.  There is a perception that suicide is not common in rural areas.  Suicide was once a phenomenon in towns but it is now on the increase in rural areas.  The reasons for this relate to farming difficulties, emigration and loneliness.  In Ennis the number of calls to the Samaritans has increased since I started training there, from 300 to 4,000 or 5,000 a year.  The Samaritans receive 10,000 to 20,000 calls a year from Galway.  Dublin is the second busiest city in the world in terms of Samaritan calls &mdash; I may not be accurate in my figures but on average one call is received every 30 seconds.  Berlin, which was once a divided city, had one of the highest numbers of suicides in the world &mdash; I do not know the present postion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that under this legislation the Attorney General will consider each case brought for prosecution.  After an emotional event people tend to go to doctors and priests for help and some people may attempt suicide even after receiving advice.  At present a priest is being prosecuted in America for giving advice which resulted in suicide.  It is not <Col N="685" /> acceptable that those who try to help depressed people are prosecuted.  I am glad this matter is dealt with in the Bill because some protection is necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church has progressed in the last few years in its attitude to suicide. There was a time, even in the Muslim religion, when people who committed suicide were not buried in sacred burial grounds, but that practice has changed and these people are now buried with their families.  I welcome the changes in this area.</P>
    <P>Last week there was a political suicide in Sri Lanka.  In Cork Mary Sweeney committed suicide.  It may also be used as a political weapon, sometimes by hunger strikers.  Gandhi also used it fruitfully in India.  I am glad this Bill has been introduced.  There is much more I would like to say but, as other speakers wish to contribute, I will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the Minister's decision to bring forward this Bill which proposes to decriminalise suicide.  It was interesting to listen to people who have dealt in a professional capacity with suicide and its effect on families.  In the last couple of years I have heard of a number of suicides in my county.  Deputy Bhamjee referred to the figures available regarding the number of suicides.  It is generally accepted that there has been a major increase in suicides.  Indeed there were three suicides in my county last week.  If that is an indication of the situation in the rest of the country, there must be at least 2,000 to 3,000 suicides here each year.  This Bill will focus our minds on why people commit suicide.  People commit suicide due to depression, loneliness, alcoholism and financial difficulties. We should reconsider the powers conferred on the Revenue, particularly on the sheriff, as these powers have resulted in a number of suicides. When a measure produced from this House can result in suicide, we must think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with speakers in thanking the voluntary groups for their tremendous <Col N="686" /> work.  Without many resources people have voluntarily given their time to cope with the threat of suicide and with the families of suicide victims.  Often all that is needed for a person in difficulties is a listening ear.  People in difficulties want someone to listen and to share their burden, whether depression, loneliness, marital or other difficulties.  The Samaritans and other groups are providing a great service and we should not take it for granted.  We should assist them to continue with their great work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the necessity to improve the psychiatric services and I agree with him.  In our hospitals we can see people who have attempted suicide.  An attempted suicide is a public cry for help.  We should try to tackle this problem and understand why people are driven to suicide.  We must all have a greater understanding and tolerance for people.</P>
    <P>There has been a big increase in the number of suicides.  It really comes home to one only when friends and associates are involved.  The health boards should play a bigger role in providing back-up counselling for the families of suicide victims.  I have been involved with a couple of such families in the recent past and I have no doubt that it is a traumatic experience for the families.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bhamjee said earlier, the Catholic Church has changed slightly with regard to suicide, as evidenced by the way they bury victims; but there is still a lot of progress to be made towards a better understanding of the problem.</P>
    <P>I attended a function in Naas last week at which I met a number of young people who had made a study of stress among young people.  Their findings showed that everyone undergoes a certain amount of stress.  Stress in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but when stress turns to distress that is where we have the major problem and where action is needed. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to determine the turning point and the consequent results.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which has been welcomed from all sides.  I have listened with interest to <Col N="687" /> contributions and I look forward with interest to hearing some more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill, the fact that it is before the House and the general welcome provided for it here.  It is safe to predict that it will get a safe passage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to decriminalise suicide.  It will help the families and friends of people who have committed suicide to cope with the grief, trauma and, often, the guilt.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about section 2 of the Bill, which I hope the Minister will deal with when replying.  Section 2 makes it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide.  Such a person would be liable to conviction and to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 14 years.  This section might give rise to some difficulties in the future.  Following a suicide, would a spouse, partner or member of the family of the victim be subjected to investigation to establish whether or not he had aided, abetted or procured the suicide?  If a person committed suicide with another person's gun and it was not obvious how the person obtained the gun, would it lead to the investigation of the relative who owned the gun after the suicide?  In the case of a suicide pact where two people agreed to commit suicide together, if one person survived would that person be prosecuted for aiding and abetting the commission of the suicide of the other person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very complex area in relation to medicine, for instance, with regard to people being sustained on life support machines and the decision at some point to remove the person from the life support machine.  Would this Bill affect that situation?  A recent widely publicised case involved a Dr. Cox in the United Kingdom who was charged with murder when he aided and abetted a person to terminate her own life in a case where there was considerable suffering.  That case has given rise to considerable debate regarding ethics in circumstances like that, but it is a debate that has not been <Col N="688" /> entered into in this country.  I would like clarification on the section of the Bill that refers to aiding and abetting the commission of suicide.  Can the Minister clarify whether that section might be used at some stage against a member of the medical profession who might pursue a certain course of action in regard to a patient?  It might be used by a member of the family or, as is now beginning to be the case, some fundamentalist group who are seeking out members of the medical profession whom they suspect of aiding and abetting people to take their own lives.</P>
    <P>This legislation will decriminalise suicide. Other speakers have addressed the question of the causes of suicide and what steps might be taken to try to reduce the incidence of suicide.  Anybody who has experienced the loss of a member of their family or a friend through suicide knows how difficult it is to come to terms with the fact, often in cases where it did not appear that the person concerned was suffering any trauma or personal distress. We have to look at the many varied circumstances which cause the kinds of personal depression which gives rise to suicide and see to what extent they can be minimised.  The first and obvious area we have to look at is unemployment.</P>
    <P>A recent ESRI survey published in 1991 referred to the extent to which unemployment is causing stress among individuals and families.  The authors of the ESRI survey, Dr. Whelan, Professor Hannon and Mr. Creighton, state that unemployed people are five times more likely to suffer high levels of psychological stress than those who are at work. They went on to refer to the many ways in which unemployment impacts on the mental health of people.  Over a period it lowers their self-esteem, causes personal distress, distress within the family and ultimately financial strain, which in turn leads to other pressures being brought to bear on the families concerned.</P>
    <P>In a society where 20 per cent of the labour force are out of work we have to look at unemployment as a social and economic cause of suicide and of the stress and tension which leads to it in the <Col N="689" /> first place.  Allied to that is the whole question of financial stress.  Some years ago the Dublin county coroner referred to what he called the caring banks and contrasted the way in which financial institutions advertise themselves as caring institutions when they are at the point of lending people money but show a different approach to the same people when they want to get the money back. The Dublin county coroner has had considerable experience of the problem of suicide and has spoken publicly on the issue on many occasions.  It is significant that he should have identified the financial institutions and the stress and pressure which they bring to bear on individuals as a possible cause of suicide.</P>
    <P>In her contribution the Minister referred to the problem of suicide by people who are in the care of the State, for example, those in prison.  I found her comments in that regard less than encouraging.  She referred to the recommendations of the advisory group and spoke generally about efforts that would have to be made to implement those recommendations.  She went on to point out that even if the recommendations were implemented there would still be some suicides in prisons.  I accept that point.  I would have thought that on an occasion such as this she would have given the House an indication of the specific measures she plans to take to give effect to those recommendations rather than simply to put them on the record of the House and talk about them in a general way.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the caring organisations, in particular, to the Samaritans.  I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to bodies such as the Samaritans for the work they are doing in saving people from suicide and in helping them to cope with the difficulties of life.  It is fair to say that many suicide attempts are by people who do not approach the Samaritans or anybody else and feel they have nowhere to turn for help.  A greater effort will have to be made to bring to everybody's attention &mdash; particularly the marginalised in society &mdash; the means of access to bodies and <Col N="690" /> people who can provide them with counselling or help at times of distress.  A very simple method might be to include in various pension books, cards and documents issued by the Department of Social Welfare or other Departments three or four emergency telephone numbers of the Garda Síochána, the Samaritans and so on for the assistance of somebody in distress.  Somebody who is alone, lonely and in despair who does not know where to turn for help and does not have the telephone number of the Samaritans, should know where there is access to a helpline.</P>
    <P>The attitude in our society is very important.  In some ways it can be good and in other ways it can be very damaging. I was struck by recent comments by a former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, in which he spoke about the desirability of people being, perhaps, more nosey.  I understand his point but therein lies part of the problem with regard to suicide.  It is clear that many people are driven to suicide &mdash; or at least suffer depression &mdash; because of the pressure they feel is put on them by their peers and society generally. Perhaps that pressure is not there, there may be a far more compassionate approach in society than is often thought.</P>
    <P>A person under stress, say, a business person with a certain reputation who finds himself under financial pressure may feel that his whole world is collapsing, worries about what his peers will think, how it will look in the community and so on, may feel under a lot of pressure. Often the natural inquisitiveness of people inquiring about the welfare of others contributes to stress and pressure. Perhaps that needs to be addressed generally in society.  We should not try to find out why somebody has committed an act perceived as scandalous and hound them all the way to Mexico to account for themselves.  There should be genuine sympathy and support for people in trouble.  A change of attitude is needed so that people under stress do not feel people are watching them and will think less of them because they are in financial or personal difficulty.  Such an approach generally in society might help to reduce <Col N="691" /> some of the causes that give rise to suicide. I welcome this Bill and look forward to it being enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. It is timely for us as legislators to reflect on the increased incidence of suicide.  The number of people resorting to suicide is increasing at an alarming rate.  It is time we reflected on society and how we address the fact that more and more people are resorting to what they see as the only way out for them.</P>
      <P>I would identify a number of problems. We are not as caring a society as we would like to think.  With the development of our society we have become impersonal. We have become akin to the larger cities throughout the world where everybody goes about their own business and nobody takes the time to relate to their peers as they did some years ago.</P>
      <P>Many years ago the rate of suicide was attributed to inter-marriage and other problems along the western seaboard, but in the last few years it has increased alarmingly.  The most unlikely people have committed suicide.  We must, therefore, spend considerable resources on research into this with a view to determining the causes and how we can deal with a problem affecting more an more families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that similar trends exist in other countries.  Let us look at the categories of people involved.  This problem covers the age structure from teenagers to old age.  One only has to look at the kind of pressure put on children at school to succeed, if they are not top of the class they feel that they are second class citizens and failures.  Mine is not a professional opinion but one I have formed from listening to my constituents and looking at society as it develops.  During the run up to examinations or the end of term report such emphasis is placed on success that the fear of failure or of coming anywhere other than first escalates. Our attitude does not lead children to believe that to be second or third, fourth, fifth or even tenth is acceptable, that everybody has a niche in society, a <Col N="692" /> role to play.  Not everybody can become a neurosurgeon or a nuclear physicist. Unfortunately the standards we now lay down for young people are extremely intimidating and a cause of problems leading to suicide.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me by a constituent recently that perhaps there is a dietary element to this problem that we have not identified.  The Department of Health should pay particular attention to examining dietary changes in the past number of years to try to identify whether there is anything in our diet nowadays that contributes to the trend towards suicide which did not exist some years ago.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned anxiety, loneliness and despair.  What must it be like for a person in despair?  I have never known it myself.  Although I am quite sure that all of us have seen times when we were close to it, I do not think we have ever experienced the type of despair which causes people to commit suicide. What brings about a situation where an individual is in despair and the only way they see out is suicide?  It can be financial or social pressures, and the result is a decision on the part of the person concerned that he is unable or incapable of achieving the targets that society sets. The result is that they are in despair.  The person who was previously successful and a pillar of society may find it very difficult to accept what may happen in the event of their missing a step on the ladder they are ascending.  That was brought home to me some years ago by a person who had worked conscientiously in a middle management position all his life and suddenly found himself out of a job.  He had a big mortgage, but found it extremely difficult to go to the local health centre for assistance even though he was entitled to it.  That person told me that he sat week after week in a queue in his local health centre but did not have the courage to meet the community welfare officer.  He recognised that he had a problem and that it was getting worse, but he did not have the courage to climb down, as he saw it.  It was only after lengthy discussion that he recognised it was possible to live again, that there was a life <Col N="693" /> thereafter and that it was possible to climb to the top of the ladder again.</P>
    <P>When a person is unsuccessful or involved in a scandal of some sort society tends to say: &ldquo;Thou last committed a sin and thou shall pay the price&rdquo;.  Nobody should be condemned to the extent that they may never raise their head again. Any of us could be in a similar position. That type of condemnation is not for us to make.  It is not a matter for us as legislators or as a society.  We should be compassionate and recognise that nobody is perfect.  The only perfect person who walked the face of this earth was crucified.  To judge people on the basis of modern trends and standards and say that somebody has fallen from grace and shall never rise again is a sad approach which is incompatible with a compassionate and caring society.  A culture has developed over the past number of years, whereby only the best is acceptable, anything less in regarded as a failure and those who fail are to be condemned. That can apply in schools, the church, politics and elsewhere.  Everybody is entitled to a second chance.</P>
    <P>The prison and institutional suicides, to which other speakers referred, are particularly distressing.  That matter is within the control of the system; we should at least be able to reduce dramatically the incidence of such suicides.</P>
    <P>Another area which must be referred to is that of bureaucracy.  We should consider the individuals at the receiving end of the amorphous mass of bureaucracy that exists not only here but worldwide. I am not being critical of the public service in this regard; bureaucracy has become a way of life.  A person in dire straits waiting for some kind of inspiration or assistance in regard to a problem they see as insuperable may suddenly receive a bureaucratic letter which can be positive or negative.  One can chill the blood or free the heart of an unfortunate victim by the manner in which a message is given.  All of us in public life should be aware of that.  I will never understand why people do not think before sending such letters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I recall some years ago meeting a person who was under a great deal of pressure.  He had just had a family bereavement, was in severe financial difficulties and at the same time received a letter stating that his electricity supply was to be cut off.  That may not seem a huge problem to many of us, but we should put ourselves in that person's position and consider what it must have been like to receive such information at a time when he was most vulnerable.  His electricity was cut off and he subsequently telephoned his local public representative, as is usual in such circumstances. The public representative told him that it was not the end of the world and that the problem could be solved.  In fairness to public servants, generally speaking they are willing to help and respond but in situations of deprivation, where it is known that families are under severe financial pressure, public servants should be a little compassionate. I accept that a matter cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely and we cannot allow people to renege on their commitments, while others are expected to deliver on time.  However, there could be a compassionate and caring approach in such cases which would at least mean that people are not driven over the top. That is important both for us as public representatives and for our institutions.</P>
    <P>There are many pressures on people nowadays, the main one being mortgage repayments.  That is a first priority.  The money must be paid every month whether we like it or not.  The wealthy, the not so wealthy and the poor pay either rent or a mortgage.  Depending on people's standard of living, their mortgage is big, medium or small but in each case it can have an equal impact on the family in such a way as to destabilise them.</P>
    <P>Whenever there is a likelihood of financial difficulty people tend to despair. We should use all the resources available to the Departments of Justice and Health to evaluate the contributory factors in suicides.  We would do this country and society in general a great service if we could identify some of the causes of suicide. <Col N="695" /> I would ask the Minister to convey that message to her colleague and endeavour to do something about it. Over the past number of years my colleagues and I have continually raised this question, particularly the upward trend, in the hope that some information may emerge which will be of benefit to families in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the relatives of those who commit suicide, who are also victims in this regard.  There is nothing as sad as meeting the relatives of a suicide.  It is my hope that the Department of Health would show compassion in dealing with the families of those who have committed suicide in relation to requests for services such as the free telephone service where there may be difficulties in regard to the determination of eligibility.  Some of these cases would be most deserving on compassionate grounds alone.  I would like the Department of Health to remember that the trauma of suicide does not end with the suicide; it remains with the relatives of the suicide victim for many years.  Our society could in some way make recompense to those families for the trauma they have experienced by showing more compassion in the determination of eligibility for certain services. I am not suggesting for a moment that we in society are to blame for this but we must examine the causes for the increased incidence of suicide here.  If we do not address the problem of the increasing numbers of suicide we are failing to help these people.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the caring agencies such as the Samaritans &mdash; I am sure the Minister would regard her Department as a caring agency also &mdash; for being available to those who feel disposed towards committing suicide.  I hope the resources required to allow that agency and other similar agencies to continue their work will be made available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Durkan, I cannot claim to have any expertise or professional know-how <Col N="696" /> on the question of suicide.  Nevertheless, I have 20 years experience of being a public representative and in that time one can learn a great deal by meeting people in one's advice centres and meeting people generally.  People do not come to these advice centres to wish you well. They are usually people with problems, many of them psychiatric problems or nervous disorders.  A high percentage of those who avail of our clinics suffer from some form of emotional or mental trauma or disorder.  I wish to say in passing that my colleague, Deputy Bhamjee, made a compassionate and professional contribution to the debate. This was very useful and perhaps other Members of the House who have a medical background would contribute to the debate also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the Samaritans. I received a telephone call from a member of the Samaritans this morning. Naturally, I thought he was telephoning me concerning this Bill, but in fact he was concerned about the proposals to increase domestic telephone charges in an effort to reduce the cost of overseas calls.  He made the point that much of the time and work of the Samaritans is taken up with talking to people on the telephone, people who are often in despair. Fortunately for Deputy Durkan, he has never experienced such despair; but not everyone would be so lucky.  This member of the Samaritans told me that in the early hours of the night when we are all asleep, they spend long periods of time talking to suicidal people, people suffering from loneliness and those with nervous disorders.  Increasing telephone charges will pose problems and additional costs for the Samaritans.  He asked me to consider that and to do what I could as a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is good that we are facing the problem at last.  The Bill is overdue.  Even though we often give the impression today that we are a smug society, as though we have some corner on Christianity, in reality we sweep our problems under the carpet.  There is much hypocrisy in society today and this Bill is an attempt to confront that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> In recent years I had the unenviable experience of people coming to see me in my office one day and committing suicide the following day.  Two of those people drowned themselves and the other woman took an overdose of tablets.  That is a very sobering thought for anyone involved in public life.  It is a most unpleasant aspect of our work to hear that people who had come for advice had taken their own lives.  One of the cases involved a simple matter.  A man whose wife was working was seeking unemployment assistance.  The marriage has broken down and they had separated.  He had worked most of his life, but found that he was unable to claim unemployment assistance while his wife had a permanent job and a weekly income.  In order to receive any income he had to take out a court order against his wife for maintenance.  He found that distasteful and rather than take that court action he jumped into the River Shannon.  This happened the day after he came to see me with the problem.</P>
    <P>Another case was that a nice woman from a good background whose son had got into difficulty with the Garda.  I tried to convince her that to us in public life it was a trivial matter, but she was upset about her name appearing in the newspapers. It was the first time a member of her family ever appeared in court.  Her son had stolen a small item, but rather than face this unpleasantness and the comments of her neighbours she too committed suicide by throwing herself in the River Shannon.  She was a young married woman and I found that a very sad experience also.  Another woman who had lost her job came to see me at my clinic.  She had an unhappy childhood, having been brought up in an institution.  Rather than facing up to the task of finding another job she took an overdose of tablets which had fatal consequences.  Those are three people known to me who have committed suicide.</P>
    <P>Limerick has the highest suicide rate of any city and county in Ireland.  Deputy Gilmore referred to a recent tragic case where two young men made a suicide pact and followed it through.  That was <Col N="698" /> also a most harrowing experience.  This is a reflection on our society.  It is an indictment of our society that so many people of all age groups take their own lives.  This not only involves poor people because I read that Graham Greene, the famous writer, while a student at college, engaged in the pastime of Russian roulette with a loaded revolver.  I find it difficult to understand how somebody with such intelligence and ability could play such a dangerous game.  All types of people commit suicide and we in society should not be afraid to address this problem. This Bill is attempting to do that.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of people using hunger strike as a means of applying political pressure on Governments.  I believe it is a form of moral blackmail.  Too many people on this island and on our neighbouring island have taken their own lives using this method.  It is not a legitimate political weapon and I regret that so many people have taken this type of action.  I hope we have seen the end of hunger strikes in our society.  To starve oneself to death is a most harrowing way to die.</P>
    <P>Many reasons have been given for people ending their lives in our society. The obvious reasons are depression, alienation, loneliness, drug abuse, alcoholism, physical illness and mental disorders.  Others take a deliberate, well thought-out action to end their lives simply because they feel life has no more to offer them.  There is also the question of economic insecurity.  I have known people to end their lives because they lost their jobs, could not meet their mortgage repayments and could not face up to the social stigma of being unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this attitude exists in relation to people who have lost their jobs.  They are no longer considered as part of the first division but as second class citizens.  In this Bill it is easy to provide for the decriminalisation of suicide, but it is not easy to change social attitudes.  It is not easy to take away the stigma of suicide which has permeated our society for a long time.  It is time we changed our attitude in regard to the loss of life in this way.  It is no longer <Col N="699" /> acceptable that there should be a stigma attached to the family of a suicide victim. I hope there will be a more enlightened, caring and compassionate response to suicide from society in the future.</P>
    <P>Many people have worked hard to bring this Bill before the House today.  It would be invidious of me to mention their names but I will mention the name of one person, Senator Neville.  He is not a member of my party, but he has been a pioneering voice on this issue in the Seanad before it became part and parcel of the mainstream policies of all parties in this House.  I do not pay tribute to Senator Neville's work because he is a colleague and comes from west Limerick.</P>

I give credit where it is due and I wish to put the Senator's name on the record for the good work he did in the Seanad by raising this issue at a time when it was not to the forefront.  I would give two cheers to Senator Neville in that respect.</P>

    <P>The Bill also reflects changing attitudes in our society and, as Deputy Bhamjee stated, changing attitudes in the Roman Catholic Church.  That is desirable. Death is never easy and suicide is traumatic and painful for the victim's family, relatives and friends; but the Bill is an attempt to respond in a practical and humane way to the question of suicide.  It is welcome that the Government took the initiative in this regard.  Governments should not wait for incidents to happen; it is important that a framework be provided in which people can live their lives. It is the role of Government and public representatives to provide people with a framework of compassionate laws, regulations and standards by which they can live their lives.  The Government cannot do everything.  It cannot take away <Col N="700" /> people's rights in this area, but it can enable people to live in a humane society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore highlighted one aspect of the Bill about which I am concerned &mdash; the question of aiding and abetting. That area is not adequately covered. It is open to cranks who look for loopholes in laws and regulations.  Regardless of how well intentioned the proposals in this legislation are, there are people who will distort or attempt to put a different meaning on what is meant by aiding and abetting.  The medical profession may be concerned with this aspect.  Deputy Gilmore has given some examples of what might happen in this area.  I know that such aiding and abetting is not the intention of this Bill, but perhaps this area could be reviewed to ensure that the legislation is tightened to avoid exploitation for mischievious reasons.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister has not given full consideration to the reasons people commit suicide in prison.  People may be unhappy in prisons and reach depths of despair, but it is not good enough to say suicide in prisons is an occupational hazard.  It is important to have a civilised code of conduct, back up services and contacts in the prison system.  Recently I spoke to a class of students in prison about local history.  I would add, to allay the Minister's fears, that I was not trying to influence the prisoners by talking about politics.  Like the Irish saying, mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí, it is important to praise people in society, to give them hope and to help rehabilitate them.  That might sound naive, but I do not intend it to be so.  It is important to tell people who are in prison for some time that when they are released they will have a second chance at life.  They should not be written off, as it were, out of sight, out of mind.  Indeed, that is one of the reasons people commit suicide in prison &mdash; they feel life has nothing more to offer them.  They consider they have disgraced themselves, that there will be a stigma attached to them when they leave prison and that they will have no hope of a second chance of obtaining employment.  This is an area the Minister might consider again.  I welcome <Col N="701" /> the Bill.  It is long overdue, but it is better late than never.  I commend the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  The French decriminalised suicide in the last century, Britain did likewise in 1960 and I welcome the proposals in the Bill to decriminalise it here.</P>
      <P>The number of suicides here has increased significantly in recent years. The number has increased almost sixfold since 1970.  It is vital that suicide should be decriminalised and the reason for its increase should be investigated.  The pressures of modern life are taking their toll on our people of all ages and backgrounds. In my constituency a child of 17 years, having completed part of her exams, threw herself into the river on her way home from school.  The financial institutions of this country are great when it comes to handing out mortgages; but when people lose their jobs, get into difficulty and are unable to make their repayments, those institutions apply pressure.  The sheriff calls to their door and demands money from those people, who sometimes cannot afford to eat. Some of them at times may consider that suicide is only one way out and may take the lives of members of their families as well.  That has happened on a number of occasions.  My wife died approximately five years ago.  I was lucky in that when I felt depressed I could make a telephone call at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning and speak to somebody.  There are many old people who do not have access to telephones.  They live alone and when depressed because a partner may have died, suicide is the easy option for them. They may ask grandchildren to live with them or stay overnight, but such action causes them to lose their social welfare benefits &mdash; for example, free telephone rental, free fuel and so on.  This area must be addressed by the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Samaritans and those who work with people who threaten to commit suicide.  The <Col N="702" /> Government must provide services to help people who are depressed.  We have a serious drug problem here also.  People on drugs may unknowingly take their lives.  We have a serious problem in regard to alcohol abuse here.  Alcoholism may affect every member of a family. When alcoholics have no money for drink, sometimes they may attack members of their families.  When they realise what they have done they may commit suicide, as has happened recently.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill to decriminalise suicide and remove the stigma from the families of the suicide victims.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Members of the House who participated in the debate.  It has been a very worthwhile, informative and friendly debate.  I support Deputy Harney's appeal that this issue should receive sensitive media treatment.  The primary reason is that the parents and friends of the person who has committed suicide are trying desperately to cope with their loss and understand the reasons for it.  In addition, they may be desperately trying to get over a huge guilt complex.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney called for a simplification of the language of the law.  As a non-lawyer, I too would be delighted if this could be achieved.  I think the officials in my Department would also be delighted if this were the case as it would enable us to get more Bills through the office of the parliamentary draftsman and bring them before the House much more frequently than is the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad no Member of the House has raised objections to the provisions in the Bill.  It has long been accepted by the <Col N="703" /> Government that suicide should be decriminalised, and I am glad that no objections have been raised by any quarter, either politically or elsewhere to the provisions in the Bill.  While the Bill will take suicide out of the criminal law area, as everyone acknowledged in the debate suicide will not go away.</P>
    <P>I have already given the House a detailed account of the measures being taken by my Department to tackle the problem of suicide in prisons.  I thank all those Members who referred to this problem in their contributions.  Suicide in prisons, as in society, is a hugely complex problem; suicide is a complex phenomenon and there are no easy remedies, regardless of the provisions made within the prison system and how we react to the various proposals.  As I stated in my opening remarks, 50 of the 57 recommendations made to me by the Prison Advisory Group have been implemented in the prison system and the other seven recommendations will be implemented as soon as possible.  Regardless of what we do, no Minister or prison system can guarantee that there will not be further suicides.  All we can do is to be prepared and ensure that the staff in prisons, whether they are prison officers or those involved in the probation and welfare service and education system within the prisons are prepared and that prisoners who are distressed get all the help they need.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a tragedy that affects all strata of society.  A number of Deputies raised issues which are outside my control, for example, education and health issues.  My colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education, are very conscious of the wider aspects of suicide and the role they and their Departments must play in educating people on this issue and ensuring that information and help is available throughout the health services.</P>
    <P>I think all Deputies agreed that the causes of suicide are complex.  Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, the erosion of traditional values, a lack of <Col N="704" /> employment opportunities and social isolation are only some of the issues referred to by Deputies in their contributions.  All of these factors can, either individually or collectively, contribute to distress.  In response to the problem of suicide, the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed.  A large number of suicides are associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable mental illness. Health boards are involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school playgroups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone. A number of speakers referred to the role the education system in general can play in this area.  I will bring this point to the attention of the Minister for Education who, I know, is aware of and understands these problems.  The Minister and her Department are involved in providing the support necessary from an educational point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred specifically to the underestimation of suicide statistics. This point was also referred to by a number of other speakers.  The Central Statistics Office has co-operated in some detailed studies and has come to the conclusion that the official data probably understates the actual number of suicides by perhaps 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Both Deputy Durkan and Deputy Power will be interested to know that a team of researchers concluded that the suicide rate in County Kildare, based on a clinical assessment of coroners' records over the ten-year period 1978-87, was very close to the Central Statistics Office figure.  Their best estimate of clinical suicide was 68 deaths compared to the CSO statistic of 65 deaths.  Dublin city and county coroners provided the same team of researchers with their estimates of suicide deaths over the five-year period 1977-81.  The official data were less than 20 per cent below those estimates.  The Central Statistics Office has also been cooperating with two doctors researching into suicide in Cork.  A case by case examination <Col N="705" /> of cases returned by five coroners as possible suicides suggests that the official data may have underestimated suicides in the Southern Health Board area by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to a case where a person who, while attempting suicide, accidentally kills another person. I think Deputy Gilmore and another Deputy also raised this point.  Deputy Harney asked if this would be regarded as murder or manslaughter.  It would be regarded as murder under the present law as suicide is regarded as self-murder. However, if suicide is no longer an offence there is a strong possibility that the accidental killing of another person by a person attempting suicide would be manslaughter and not murder.  Of course, in the final analysis it would be a matter for the courts to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to life assurance policies taken out by people who have committed suicide.  As she acknowledged, this matter is outside the scope of this Bill and my function as Minister for Justice.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who has responsibility in this area.  I share Deputy Harney's concerns about the spouses who are left behind in these difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The existing prohibition on returning a verdict of suicide arises because such a finding involves investigation and consideration of the criminal liability of the deceased person for his own death and is, therefore, not allowed under section 30.  This was decided in the 1985 High Court case of the State (McKeown) <i>v.</i> Scully &mdash; 1986, ILRM 133.  An inquest can return a verdict of self-inflicted killing but cannot look into the mental capacity of the person at the time of his death as that would necessarily involve an investigation of criminal liability &mdash; Green <i>v.</i> McLoughlin, the High Court December 1989.  Once the offence of suicide is abolished a finding of suicide does not attribute criminal liability to any person.  Complicity in suicide will be an offence, but provided the inquest does not investigate or consider who aided and abetted the suicide there should be no <Col N="706" /> conflict with section 30.  The High Court in Green <i>v.</i> McLoughlin stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The mere finding by a Jury (at an inquest) that someone has died as a result of murder, infanticide or manslaughter does not fix any person with criminal or civil liability in respect of that particular occurrence, therefore, it is possible for such verdicts to be brought in by a Jury.</P>
    <P>The same reasoning should be applicable to a verdict of suicide once the offence of suicide has been abolished as the verdict itself will not attribute criminal liability to a specific person as an accomplice or attribute civil liability.  In simple terms, this means that once the Bill is passed a coroner can return a verdict of suicide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a number of questions regarding section 2 (2) as it relates to suicide pacts, assisting suicide and life support machines.  These problems were raised by a number of Deputies.  As with all such matters, if the Garda Síochána believes that a crime has been committed it will investigate the matter.  The question of whether a prosecution will ensure is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Reference was made to a suicidal pact.  If one person survives a suicide pact, there will most certainly be a criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>For example, there have been instances where two people enter into a suicide pact whereby one person will shoot the other and then shoot himself. If the person who did the act which caused the death survives, he is guilty of murder.  Certainly I would expect such a person to be investigated.  If the survivor did not cause the death of the other person, nonetheless he may have encouraged the other person to join in the suicide pact on the understanding that both were to die.  If that were the case he would have committed an offence and would be liable, quite rightly in my view, to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The question was raised also of life support machines.  The turning off of a life support machine without lawful authority <Col N="707" /> under our law would be murder. The question of suicide would not arise. Therefore, that issue is not of relevance to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In summary then, if in the course of taking statements for a coroner's inquest, or indeed investigating the circumstances of a death, the Garda form the view that an offence has been committed under the provisions of this Bill, they would be obliged to report the facts to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Again, it would be a matter for him to decide whether or not to institute proceedings.</P>
    <P>I want to talk for a few minutes in relation to victims, in this case the surviving family or friends of the person who committed suicide.  As Deputy Harney acknowledged, I am a great supporter of the Irish Association for Victim Support. In fact, I discovered recently when I attended their annual conference that I was the first Minister for Justice ever to have done so.  For very many years in this country we have talked about the perpetrators of crimes, how we treat them, how we should treat them, look after them and care for them.  Of course, that is right and proper.  But it is time for us to have a criminal justice system here which is victim-orientated.  Certainly that has been my view since I became Minister for Justice.  Indeed, a number of Bills which have been introduced in the House since have proceeded in that direction.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies such as the Samaritans, the IAVS and others need more support, as Deputy Harney called for.  It is important that they receive our support. They do a tremendous amount of invaluable work.  Indeed, last evening in Killarney at the Garda Representative Association Conference I had the opportunity of speaking again with Derek Nally, who was instrumental in setting up the association and who, with Anne Meade and others, has done so much extraordinary work to counsel those who have been the victims of crime.  I should also like to acknowledge the tremendous work done by victims themselves &mdash; and many of them are well known victims &mdash;<Col N="708" /> who give of their time voluntarily to help the Irish Association for Victim Support.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points made.  Many Members talked about examination pressure on young people.  I know all about it.  I have two teenagers myself who at various times in their school careers, like, I am sure, the children of other Members, have been under extreme examination pressure.  We all know how sensitive are such young adults, how difficult it is for them to cope sometimes and how they need our support, care and attention at such times.  I think now of all the students studying for their Junior or Leaving Certificate who need tremendous help and support from their parents, families and friends.  The type of help and support called for by Deputy Harney and others is something of which I know the Minister for Education is keenly aware and anxious to provide in whatever way she can.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank all of the Members who took such an interest in the Bill, which is long overdue.  I should like to reiterate my thanks to all Members of the House and all political parties in assisting me in having all of its Stages passed this evening.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have 25 minutes remaining. For fear of criticism from the media I do not think we should finish ahead of time and leave them to criticise us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether I explained myself clearly when I spoke earlier. There are a number of questions I want to ask the Minister.  Obviously, it is appropriate that if somebody aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, that should be an offence and one <Col N="709" /> can be charged with murder or manslaughter. It is the question of manslaughter that bothers me.  I know murder is where the intention was to kill and therefore obviously it is murder, whereas manslaughter arises as a consequence of driving dangerously, drunken driving or whatever.  I am anxious to ensure in the case, say, of the life support machine or poison left loosely at home, is there any possibility that in such cases somebody could be charged with manslaughter?  I know that some of the literature talks about manslaughter while in the same breath refers to manslaughter by criminal negligence.  Am I to take it that both are the same &mdash; perhaps the Minister's officials would advise us &mdash; or is there a distinction?  That is one question I want to pose to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know there is a safeguard later that prosecution can be taken only by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that one could not have some fundamentalists, as Deputy Gilmore said, or some very extreme people taking a very harsh view, taking prosecutions almost as a hobby and putting families and individuals through terrible trauma.  We witnessed such cases in Great Britain recently.  It is my belief that if and when any family gives approval for a life support machine to be turned off it is done with the object of relieving pain and suffering, of dealing more humanely with a loved one for whom there is no hope and who may have been on a machine for six months, a year or two years.  I should like that clarified. It applies in relation to the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what the Minister has said.  She has been very forthcoming in her comments, particularly those she has made in relation to the press.  I feel very strongly about this, since I know the families of suicide victims, in some cases very well.  I acknowledge that the media have the job of informing the public.  I do not want to restrict that in any way, but there is a balance to be struck that brings with it a certain sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, family law cases are held <i>in camera</i> in this country so that the privacy of individuals can be protected.  I <Col N="710" /> think it was Judge Susan Denham, or perhaps somebody else, who said recently that while it is right to protect the anonymity of individuals, details of such cases should be published because they would be enlightening and serve an educational informative role for the community at large.  I support that view. Equally, I feel strongly that in the case of legislation of that type &mdash; I acknowledge I have no amendments tabled &mdash; might it not have been a good idea that the anonymity of the individual might be protected? If we are to remove through legislation the criminal stigma of suicide, I contend the social stigma will remain if the matter is to be sensationalised and dealt with in an insensitive way in the media.  We have read recently the kind of graphic detail which has and does cause extreme pain and suffering to the family, loved ones and friends of people who died.  I do not want what I am saying to cause headlines &mdash; I would ask the media to respect that &mdash; because that is not my reason for saying it.  But we need to be extremely sensitive here.  We can impart the information and talk about the facts. I know we live in a small country but the anonymity of the Kilkenny incest victim and that of Miss X was protected, but the details of what we are talking about were revealed.  I should love to think the same would apply in the case of suicide; otherwise we will not get away from the stigma.</P>
    <P>We should remember that the real victims of suicide are the people left behind, many of whom feel so guilty.  I respect the views of people like Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Bhamjee, who are doctors whereas I am not.  I do not want to pretend to being some kind of expert, but I did avail of the opportunity last evening to speak to a leading psychologist and I have spoken to social workers in recent days about this legislation. They both said the same thing. They said it would be wrong to assume that somebody will show signs of depression immediately before committing suicide.  Indeed, the psychologist tole me that people who suffer from depression immediately before committing suicide will appear to be in great <Col N="711" /> form and will send out all the wrong signals to family and friends.  Sometimes families and friends will ask themselves: why did I not notice?  Why did I not do this or that?  The psychologist to whom I spoke last evening said that it is counselling of the family of the victim that is so important afterwards, because the families feel so guilty.  That is why the Irish Association for Victim Support have such a crucial role to play in helping such victims.  The Minister responded to the points I raised on the question of insurance and I thank her for doing so. The reason I raised those points was that they are often brought to my attention by people.</P>
    <P>Suicide is a major problem regardless of what the statistics indicate.  In the past few weeks a woman, whose husband had just committed suicide, sought my help in relation to family matters.  I do not want to give too many details but I had to contact the local Garda Síochána in Tallaght on a particular matter.  When I spoke to the superintendent on or about 20 April he informed me that they had dealt with five suicide cases that month. That is an alarming figure.  I know that Tallaght is a big area but I was shocked when I heard that there were five suicides in the early part of April.  I believe therefore that the true figures are much greater than what the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office indicate.  Many suicides go unreported having regard to the fact that a drug overdose can lead to a heart attack leading one to question whether a person died as a result of the overdose or the heart attack.</P>
    <P>If an insane person &mdash; no reference is made to such persons in the Bill &mdash; aids and abets another person to commit suicide what will the position be, given that our laws relating to insanity and to mental health in general are out-of-date?  In relation to a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another will the prosecutions differ, as between manslaughter and murder, and are there different degrees?</P>
    <P>If we are saying that attempted suicide should no longer be a criminal offence it <Col N="712" /> is ironic that if two people set out to commit suicide and one is lucky or, indeed, unlucky enough to survive they will be guilty of a criminal offence.  As I said on Second Stage, I wonder if anyone will ever be prosecuted.  If two people get into a car and decide to kill themselves and one happens to survive because someone manages to rescue them, as the Bill is framed, that person could be prosecuted for aiding and abetting the other person to commit suicide.  It is a bit unfair that that person will suffer because he or she survived.  The Minister may say that it is better that they be prosecuted than die but I would like her to clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Earlier I welcomed this part of the Bill which has been the subject of much discussion since.  It is my view that if someone attempts to commit suicide they need psychological help and advice and should not be prosecuted.  The Minister said the Garda Síochána will investigate each case and report to the Director of Public Prosecutions but we should show some compassion to those who try to commit suicide.  Common sense should prevail. Anyone who tries to kill himself or herself is not in a sound frame of mind and, as I said, there is a need to show some compassion.</P>
      <P>As I failed to do so earlier, I would like to pay tribute to the Samaritans who provide help to such persons.  These voluntary bodies do tremendous work and we would not be able to survive without them.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate that psychologists play an important role in our society. What I had to say earlier in a different debate about school discipline has nothing to do with the service provided by psychologists and Deputy Bhamjee is present to hear my tribute to him and his associates.</P>

      <P>I echo the point made by Deputy Harney that the media tend to glorify suicide.  Studies of elderly people carried out in Brighton show that when suicide is glorified some people feel their <Col N="713" /> name will be in the newspapers and that they will be remembered for life.</P>
      <P>Today we have only been talking about people who aid and abet others but there was a pop song which encouraged people to commit suicide.  Perhaps that matter should be dealt with in legislation.  Furthermore, a book has been published in America which encourages people to commit suicide in a certain way.  Would it be possible to censor or stop such books being published or to prosecute the publishers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of aiding and abetting is the source of many difficulties for all of us.  Section 2 (2) makes it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide or attempted suicide of another person.  Everyone would agree that if it can be proved a criminal offence has been committed the person involved should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>To prove that a person has committed an offence under subsection (2) it will have to be shown that the person has committed suicide or attempted suicide. A person accused of aiding, abetting or counselling must know that the person concerned intended to commit suicide. To aid or abet there must be an intention to aid the person to commit suicide and there must be some kind of mental link between the person who is aiding, abetting or counselling and the person who commits suicide while in the case of procuring there must be casual link between the act of suicide and the accused.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a prosecution should be initiated is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am sure everyone present would be confident that the Director of Public Prosecutions will not initiate a prosecution under section 2 unless he is satisfied that an offence has been committed.</P>
      <P>The figures published by the Central Statistics office are compiled from Garda reports.  I agree with Deputy Harney that the identity of the person who has committed suicide should be protected.  If it is necessary to make any changes these can be considered when we come to debate the coroner's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> A number of Deputies referred to the case in which a life support machine is turned off.  Where a medical doctor explains to the family that a person is clinically dead and the family take a decision, based on the doctor's advice, to turn off the life support machine there will not be a prosecution.  In any event, the coroner has to be informed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the use of poison, this commonly occurs on farms where many poisons are used quite legitimately by farmers in the course of their normal duties.  No father, brother or any member of a family can be held responsible if another member of the family decides to use a poison which is freely available on the farm to take his or her life.  In those circumstances there would be no prosecution.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that last week before the courts there was a case where a father and son, I think in the west, on their return home after being out drinking the son, allegedly, left a cup of poison on the range, stove or table for his father who took the poison.  The son was charged with murder but was acquitted. There is a failsafe guarantee in relation to this Bill, and other laws that have been enacted, whereby after the DPP initiates a prosecution it is a matter for the courts to make the decision.  We are trying to make the procedure as simple as possible so that there are no grey areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been helpful but on the question of songs which encourage suicide we could take this matter to the extreme.  The safeguard is that the DPP will initiate a prosecution. I am horrified that somebody could be prosecuted, even if they could not be found guilty.  It has been said that unemployment leads to suicide but I would hate to think that an employer who leaves someone go could be held liable for aiding and abetting.  Different things can be contributory factors, but it comes down to one's state of mind and while events can add to the pressure, most people can face enormous pressure without contemplating suicide.  Somebody said to me recently that very few people <Col N="715" /> have not thought at some stage &ldquo;would they or would they not&rdquo; commit suicide but I do not think they have considered it seriously.</P>
      <P>The Minister has clarified the matter but she has not referred to the law as it relates to insane persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this Bill which was proposed by our spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Shatter.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing this very important and long overdue Bill before the House. In June this year the International Conference on Human Rights will take place in Vienna.  In preparation for this conference it would be timely and appropriate for us to take an unequivocal stance on human rights in relation to refugees.  If passed, this Bill will ensure <Col N="716" /> that the rights of those claiming political asylum in Ireland are fully and properly protected and that as a State we comply with our obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees.  We have been a signatory to this convention for many years but we have failed to put in place the proper legal structures to guarantee its application. Many Irish people support the thinking behind this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have had contact from constituents working with a family from Sri Lanka who are in very difficult circumstances and living in fear of being repatriated. The local schools signed petitions in support of this family and in a letter to me stated that this family have become part of the local community and that the community supports their application.  I received a letter from another woman stating that no person genuinely seeking help from our country should be turned away in this manner.</P>
      <P>Many people are concerned and disturbed by reports they read on the treatment of refugees in this country.  The crisis in which these people find themselves and emotional trauma they suffer is often increased by their experience here.  This is an appalling slur on our country and the matter should be considered as soon as possible.  Very often people claiming political asylum are treated as if they were common criminals and their rights under the convention are violated.  We have failed to provide the legal protection that is extended to applicants for political asylum in other member states.  This Bill provides for an open, just and accountable asylum policy.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the approach of the Department to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that despite the relatively low number of people involved, in many cases we take a case hardened approach to this matter.  Many of the experiences of people in this country are more reminiscent of the dark ages than a modern country approaching the year 2000.  I understand that Amnesty International are taking up the case of Kurdish <Col N="717" /> people who landed in Shannon last year. Many of the sights witnessed by children who were present on that occasion left them very disturbed.  There is no need for this to happen.  Refugees must be dealt with in a caring manner and given the opportunity to make their case as should be given to any person in this situation.  The provisions in this Bill will ensure that is done.  I refer particularly to legal assistance, interpretation facilities and many other matters outlined in detail in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether training is sufficient for officials dealing with applicants for asylum.  I cast no slur on the individuals involved.  I am sure they work very hard, but are the necessary training opportunities afforded the people involved in this work?  It is sad that much of our approach in this area has been governed by undertones of racism and ambivalence to our international obligations.  It is time to cry halt to this approach.  This Bill will redress a problem which needed to be addressed for some time.  There is reference to this matter in the Programme for Government, although the necessity for legislation in this area is not acknowledged in the programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill meets the requests of many non-governmental organisations working in this area.  The proposal to set up an independent body to whom appeals could be made is a measure which ought to be put in place.  The unsatisfactory manner of dealing with applications has given rise to many court cases primarily because the individuals seeking asylum felt they had not been given a proper opportunity to have their case heard.</P>
    <P>Even where procedures are applied they have been applied inadequately. Amnesty International has said that even though few asylum seekers seek protection in Ireland compared with the number seeking asylum in other EC member states, this does not diminish the need for deficiencies in the asylum procedures to be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>The need for this legislation is widely recognised and I hope it will receive a <Col N="718" /> constructive response from the Government. As my colleague, Deputy Shatter said, this is a constructive measure designed to ensure that those who seek refugee status and claim political asylum are treated with dignity and humanity, and that their rights under international law are fully respected.  This Bill will allow us to hold our heads high in any international forum where the question of the treatment of refugees is debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to set out the Government's policy in the area of refugees and asylum seekers.  It is clear from what was said in this House last night that there is a general misunderstanding in this area and I sincerely hope that my clarifying the situation will contribute to more informed debate on this very important topic.</P>
      <P>This side of the House fully supports the spirit and thrust of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  However, while we support the principle we will be opposing the Bill in this House because it is the Government's policy to ensure that those who are entitled to recognition as refugees are afforded such status in accordance with our obligations under the relevant 1951 United Nations Convention.  Our policy is to be as positive as possible in considering their status here and to assist them in every way to integrate with society, if that is what they want.  Deputy Shatter would have his colleagues believe that there is a monopoly in compassion and understanding for the plight of refugees on his side of the House, which quite simply, is not the case.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government in relation to refugees and asylum seekers and I confirm that I will be taking whatever action may be appropriate to meet those commitments. I am carrying out a detailed review of the existing procedures which, contrary to what the House may have been led to believe from some of yesterday's contributions, are quite specific and extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those procedures have been in existence <Col N="719" /> since 1985 and it is necessary to review them in the light of developments since then.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has already been in touch with me to indicate its willingness to co-operate in regard to any review.  I am very grateful for its offer of expert assistance and am accepting it.</P>
    <P>The procedures are both specific and extensive and it is necessary that each and every one of them be considered to ensure that they meet the needs of today. My approach to this review will be guided by humanitarian considerations and the House can be assured that I will take whatever steps necessary, including legislation, to ensure that this State's obligations with regard to the rights of refugees are adequately provided for to meet today's situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, who has no doubt proposed this Bill with the very best of motives, appears to be very poorly informed of the realities concerning the treatment of refugees in this country. From what he said one could be excused for concluding that there are virtually no procedures governing our international obligations with regard to the processing of applications for refugee status.  At the very least, he would appear to be making the case that if there are procedures, they are so informal as to allow for genuine cases to be refused at airports without any hearing at all, and to be sent back to the country where their lives are in danger.</P>
    <P>If that was a factual representation of the existing situation, then that would rightly be a cause for grave concern.  That is not the case.  As the other side of the House readily acknowledged, during a period when the Deputy's party was in office, the existing formal arrangement for processing applications for political asylum was agreed with the competent agency in this field, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  All applications are processed in accordance with that agreement.  It is worth noting that the view of the Deputy's party at that time was that the small number of <Col N="720" /> applications here each year did not warrant the introduction of legislation.</P>
    <P>One point I emphasise, to which neither Deputy Shatter nor Deputy McDowell gave prominence last night is that each and every application is referred to the UNHCR for its advice as to whether the applicant qualifies for refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees.  The Department of Foreign Afairs is also consulted.  I have never disagreed with the opinion of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees where it has been their view that an applicant is entitled to asylum.  To be fair, I should also underline that no Minister for Justice has ever so disagreed.  UNHCR is the expert in the field and effectively the decision making body in granting or refusing recognition of refugee status in so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is a key element in the whole procedure.  It is sometimes suggested as it was by the previous speaker, that departmental officials are making decisions with regard to applications for asylum.  That is not the case.  Every decision is made by the Minister for Justice who relies heavily on the advice of the UNHCR in order to come to a decision.  At this stage, it is appropriate that I should extend my appreciation to the UNHCR for its invaluable assistance in this area.  I also pay tribute to its outstanding work world-wide on behalf of refugees and people in need.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions with regard to seeking the views of competent bodies.  That is already the reality and it is important that this House and the general public should know this.  The Bill also provides for a right to legal advice and representation and, where necessary, a right of access to an interpreter. All these provisions are already catered for in the existing procedures.</P>
    <P>Every application is examined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention. There is no question, as Deputies Shatter and McDowell have alleged, of applicants being bundled out of the State at airports.  Immigration officers at our sea ports and airports have <Col N="721" /> written guidelines which indicate clearly that a person should not be returned to a country to which he or she is unable or unwilling to go because of fear of persecution, nor should he or she be returned to a country where his or her personal safety might be seriously threatened as a result of the political situation there.  When it appears to an immigration officer that an individual might be an asylum seeker, his or her case is immediately referred to my Department.</P>
    <P>Immigration officers are aware that it is not necessary for an individual to use the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; or &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; to be an asylum seeker.  Whether an individual is an asylum seeker is a matter to be decided in the light of all the circumstances of a particular case.  In case of any doubt, an immigration officer is instructed to refer the matter to my Department.</P>
    <P>The guidelines also provide that an individual is not to be refused entry or removed from the State until he or she has been given an opportunity to present his or her case fully.  Every application is examined in accordance with the 1951 Convention and every applicant is given the necessary assistance, including interpretation facilities, to help in the interview. Every applicant is also informed of the procedures being followed and he or she is given the opportunity to contact the UNHCR or its local representative if he or she so wishes.</P>

      <P>I want to talk about immigration officers and officers of my Department who deal with these matters, because, while nobody may intend it, the impression is sometimes given that their approach in dealing with applications for refugee status is at best offhand and, at worst, callous.  That is an unfounded slur, not only on the professional competence of the personnel involved, who are ordinary people like the Deputies in this House, but also on their humanity.</P>
      <P>Probably what gives rise to most misunderstanding concerning refugees is not the application of procedures, which meet international norms and are scrupulously applied in each and every case, but the fact that most applicants simply do not qualify for refugee status and must have their cases dealt with accordingly.</P>
      <P>Of the 40 or so applications per annum only about two are entitled to refugee status.  It is not my view, or the view of some official in my Department, or the view of an immigration officer that they fail to establish a case for refugee status, it is the view of UNHCR.  It is necessary to refuse the applications of those who in the view of UNHCR are not entitled to such status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, it would undermine the whole concept of refugee status if this country was to depart from international norms by according refugee status to persons who, in the view of the internationally recognised experts in the field, simply do not qualify for that status.  No other country, to my knowledge, behaves in this way.  No other country of which I am aware, deals with illegal immigrants who have failed to secure refugee status any differently from us.  The hard fact of life <Col N="723" /> is that if they are illegal immigrants, they must leave the State and this State, like all others, must take the precautions necessary to ensure that they do so.  It would be a fraud to pretend that any legislation that may be introduced will somehow get around the harsh reality that some people will claim refugee status without any basis for doing so.</P>
    <P>There is one important proposal in Deputy Shatter's Bill which does not figure in the existing procedures and it will be addressed in the current review &mdash; that is, the proposal for a Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  This is an area to which I have given some thought but there are some immediate problems which come to mind.</P>
    <P>For example, as I have said, the UNHCR is effectively the decision-making body and the experts in this area. It is difficult to envisage an appropriate appeals body which would have the same competence and authority and which would be capable, for example, of overturning a decision of the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I am concerned to ensure that whatever procedures are in existence are transparent and the subject of public satisfaction.  It may very well be that there is scope for an appointment &mdash; I have in mind for example, a retired judge or officer of the courts &mdash; who could be in a position to ensure that the procedures are scrupulously adhered to in each case.  After all, the numbers to date are relatively small.  As I say, I will be giving particular attention to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I have gone into some detail on the existing procedures, not to wave a flag on their behalf, but to emphasise that they are there, that they feature a major role for the UNHCR in every application and that the situation is not as uncontrolled as the other side of the House would have us believe.  They are not, of course, sacrosanct and like all procedures they need to be looked at from time to time to see if they are achieving their objective.  As I have said, the Government supports the principle of the Bill and, indeed, the sentiments which have <Col N="724" /> given rise to it.  However, we will not be supporting it, primarily because I will be bringing forward my own proposals but also because Deputy Shatter's Bill is not acceptable in its present form.</P>
    <P>At best, the Bill simply sets out the existing procedures without due regard to a number of developments which will also have to be taken on board.  The Bill takes no account of the obligations which will be placed on us under the Dublin Convention on Asylum.  That convention places certain duties on us and on the other member states to consider which of the Twelve will deal with applications for refugee status in certain situations.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Bill essentially repeats what is in existence already.  For example, it contains no real provisions to deal with the growing problem throughout Europe of fraudulent or bogus applications. What is essential to achieve in any procedures regulating the processing of asylum is that they cater for the genuine refugee.  International migration has changed in many respects in the last decade and one important change is the increasing blurring of distinction between refugees and economic migrants.</P>
    <P>Asylum is essentially a humanitarian approach by the State to provide protection for those who are vulnerable, in fear of persecution and in urgent need of sanctuary.  Immigration, however, is a matter of State sovereignty and it is the State itself which decides, for its own good reasons, if citizens of other States are to be admitted.  Europe has now entered a phase whereby increased numbers of international movements of asylum-seekers with very weak or no genuine claims are threatening the established system.  The development of a Single European Market within the European Community, with no internal border control and joint external borders as one of its aims, combined with the overburdening of the asylum procedures in industrialised countries, and a certain number of abusive or weak claims, will pose new challenges for all European Governments including our own.</P>
    <P>I am illustrating what might be called some negative aspects in order to emphasise <Col N="725" /> that these points too will have to be taken into account in any review of the existing procedures.  It is important that what we do now is right for the existing situation, as well as for any potential future situation.</P>
    <P>In those European countries for which data are available, between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of claimants arrive without documents or with forgeries, placing a severe burden of judgment on the admission authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that <i>carte blanche</i> could be given to any person who arrived in Ireland without any document to establish identity and about whom there might be serious doubts about involvement in illegal activity.  I do not think they should be allowed freedom to stay in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;solely by mentioning asylum.  The case which recently received much publicity would be one which would fall into this category. It would be instructive if I gave some practical details of the problems our European partners have to face, problems which we may have to face in the future and which would have a severe impact on our economic and social well-being.</P>
      <P>The number applying for asylum in Europe rose from 64,000 in 1983 to about 700,000 last year.  Many of those arrived illegally.  Fewer than a fifth have been found to be genuine refugees and in Germany, which alone had about half a million applications last year, the proportion is as low as 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering that we are not talking about all of those who are fleeing their homes for one reason or another and who arrive on our shores. We are talking about a definition of a specific type of person and it is worth spelling it out.  The UN Convention defines a refugee as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular <Col N="726" /> social or political opinion, first of all is outside the country of his nationality and secondly is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;well-founded fear of being persecuted&rdquo; is the important element in that definition.  There may be many reasons that are compelling and understandable, but only one motive has been singled out to denote a refugee.  The expression &ldquo;owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted&rdquo;, by indicating a specific motive automatically makes all other reasons for leaving a country irrelevant to the definition of a refugee.</P>
    <P>That may sound harsh in itself, but it goes back to the very reasons for the existence of the Geneva Convention in the first place.  It is concerned with providing protection for persons who are in real danger to their very lives if returned to their country of origin.  An economic migrant, on the other hand, is a person who for reasons other than those contained in the definition, voluntarily leaves his country in order to take up residence elsewhere.  He may be moved by a desire for adventure, or by reasons of a personal nature, or even by starvation, but if he is moved exclusively by economic reasons, he is an economic migrant and not a refugee to be dealt with in accordance with the UN Convention and the procedures which flow from that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the distinction is, on occasion, blurred and that can only be harmful to the plight of the genuine refugee.  It is, of course, a matter of grave concern that Governments by way of international co-operation ensure that answers are found to the global problems of starvation, natural disasters, economic hardship and so on, but it is also the duty of Governments to uphold the rights of refugees and that is specifically what we are dealing with here tonight.</P>
    <P>The asylum systems in developed states were established in response to a particular situation.  However, in the mid-seventies, immigration restrictions were introduced all over Europe for essentially economic reasons.  Forms of <Col N="727" /> entry, such as family reunification and asylum, became the only options for those who wanted to immigrate.</P>
    <P>The more that asylum is used as an immigration mechanism, the greater the risk of erosion of public support of humanitarian action for genuine refugees. The industrialised nations of Europe have been clearly heading for a crisis over asylum in recent years, primarily as a result of the abuse of the system.  The protraction and over-burdening of asylum procedures causes hardship for the genuine asylum seekers and tends to attract abusive applications. The increase in unfounded claims, and the growing cost of assistance has damaged public opinion in Europe about immigrants and refugees and has created serious problems for the receiving countries and for people in real need of protection.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that we would be heading for similar problems if we do not regulate the operation of our asylum procedures to achieve the essential balance of due concern for the genuine refugee allied to appropriate measures to ensure that the system is not clogged up by bogus applicants.  The experience in Europe has shown that those who would abuse the asylum procedures are those who would seek to migrate to western Europe by way of the asylum system.</P>
    <P>We need to be flexible in our approach in order that the genuine refugee is not overlooked or, worse, mistreated. Asylum systems generally in Europe were established for much smaller numbers of applicants and as a result most countries are attempting to make adjustments to refine their systems with a view to streamlining.  Deputy Shatter's Bill seems to be going in the other direction.</P>
    <P>The question of a policy of detention of asylum seekers was raised last night. It is a point which I wish to address given that there is so much uninformed comment about it.  The simple fact is that there is no such policy and there never has been.  No persons have ever been detained simply as a result of making an application for political asylum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> The position is that Ireland, like every other country, operates a system of aliens controls intended principally to deal with attempts to enter the State unlawfully &mdash; for example, by tendering forged or fraudulent documents.  It is the normal practice to return a person detected doing that to his or her place of origin or, if it is not possible to do that, he or she is detained pending the making of suitable arrangements.  That is the practice in all States.</P>
    <P>To allow persons who had been refused entry for those reasons to simply walk free, as Deputy McDowell appeared to suggest last night, solely on the basis that they had applied for political asylum would be effectively to permit them to disappear underground without coming to attention until years later.  Alternatively, such persons might even avail of the common travel area with Britain to move illegally to that country.  It is worth pointing out at this stage that no persons who have applied for political asylum are currently detained.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it might also be useful to refer to the report of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the harmonisation within the European Communities of asylum laws and policies which was prepared last year by Mr. Parick Cooney, MEP. Mr. Cooney, in his report, noted that the question of the detention of asylum seekers is an emotive and difficult issue.  He pointed out that the difficulty arises from having to decide if detention is necessary to protect the asylum system itself.  His considered conclusion was that detention must be available as an option to counter the possibility of abuse of the system and to protect the genuine refugee.</P>
    <P>I am, a Cheann Comhairle, engaged in a detailed review of the procedures applying to those who claim refugee status which will extend to other areas of immigration control also and, although I do not disagree with the thrust of Deputy Shatter's Bill, I think it would be unwise in the extreme to proceed with legislation until such time as I have completed the review and had the benefit of the expert advice offered to me by UNHCR.  There <Col N="729" /> is a commitment in the Programme for Government to act and I will be honouring that commitment at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Some critical comments were made in this House yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle, concerning my absence, despite the fact that the Deputies concerned knew quite well that I was attending the annual conference of the Garda Representative Association in Killarney in my official capacity as Minister for Justice.  Of course, it is quite possible that Deputy McDowell in particular would prefer that I should ignore the Garda Representative Association annual conference.  As Minister for Justice I feel it is my duty to attend each of the annual conferences of the various representative associations for which I have a responsibility in this House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Cheann Comhairle, I oppose Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate takes place at a time when migration is becoming a major issue in the European context.  The collapse of communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe opens up the possibility of more ethnic tensions, border wars, social turbulence and mass migration of refugees.  It is a sobering thought that current events in the former Yugoslavia may be only a foretaste of further greater upheaval to come.  Migration from Africa has particular significance in relation to Mediterranean countries where immigrants are often employed in jobs that Europeans do not want to take.  There has been a rise in native resentment which has been exploited by right wing extremists and has been the cause of racist clashes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These same groups are setting the agenda and have enjoyed some success in that several European Governments are now enforcing a very strict regime in relation to immigration.  These countries are moving towards a Fortress Europe policy, using the armed forces to prevent illegal migration by land, sea or air.  Such a policy does not really address the larger problem that Europe's overall population is stagnating while those of neighbouring <Col N="730" /> continents are forecast to double or treble by early next century.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland our traditional insularity may well be of little use in the years ahead as our commitment to Europe will be put to the test.  As a country which historically had to cope with emigration, our response to this Bill will be an indication of how we, as Europeans, propose to cope with immigration.  It is not that it is a Bill about immigration, but it does raise a question about how we have, in our own way, built a Fortress Ireland.</P>
    <P>The record of the Department of Justice is not good.  It is one of secrecy, xenophobia and failure.  With due respect to what the Minister said earlier, it was only last year that a High Court judge was trenchant in his criticism of the previous Minister's failure to deal fairly with asylum seekers and comply with the procedures laid down by the 1985 agreement. We would do well to remember that some asylum seekers at least may well be people who have been struggling for democracy and against the forces of terrorism and dictatorship.</P>
    <P>The important point in this Bill is the definition of the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;.  A refugee is a person who:</P>
    <P>(a)  owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  is outside of the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to that country.</P>
    <P>This is a clear statement that what we are debating here is asylum seekers rather than economic refugees.  An asylum seeker is often someone who is fleeing for his life and in desperate search of a safe haven.  In 1951 we signed the Geneva Convention and in 1967 signed the Protocol. In doing so, we were staging publicly <Col N="731" /> that as an independent country we have international responsibilities.  To our shame those responsibilities have not been faced up to.  No Government has brought in the legislation to match those commitments.</P>
    <P>It took until 1985 for an informal agreement to be signed setting up procedures which theoretically guarantee certain rights to asylum seekers, basic rights like the right to legal representation, the right to an interpreter, the right to contact with an NGO and also the right to know, in case of refusal, why an application is being denied.  There was nothing wrong with that agreement.  There was a lot of good in it.  The problem is that it was never put fully into operation and this is certainly not the fault of the immigration officers.  It is simply because of a lack of commitment, a lack of concern on the part of the Department of Justice.  That is why there has been so much lobbying in support of legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter is to be congratulated on having drawn up a comprehensive and realistic Bill.  I have two criticisms of the Bill.  The first is a general one which I would probably levy at most Bills coming through this Dáil.  The wording of the Bill is regrettable in that it reinforces the notion that only men are in the world and that somehow women are not centre stage.  One of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women was that, in the drawing up of legislation, recognition should be given to women as well as to men.  It is worth pointing out in this regard that men and women have found themselves under attack for their religious or political beliefs and have ended up seeking asylum in many countries as a consequence. Indeed, this year Amnesty International recognised and acknowledged that fact when it launched a campaign on International Women's Day on behalf of four women, one of whom lost her life as a consequence of her work as a human rights campaigner, others who had suffered from being threatened, imprisoned and harassed for their political activities and one who was awarded the Nobel <Col N="732" /> Peace Price in 1991.  It is appropriate that this Bill should be amended in order that the language would reflect the reality of women's increasing role in the political sphere and their suffering as refugees of conscience.</P>
    <P>The disintegration we have already witnessed in the former Yugoslavia is an augury of what is ahead of us.  The likelihood both of demographic pressures and political instability in parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East will increase the number of asylum seekers. The new world order is proving to be a place of great disorder and the complacency being shown by this Fianna Fáil and Labour Government in facing the larger international disorder and providing a Bill to deal with the problem is deeply disturbing.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, built up good support from Amnesty International's work for asylum seekers, particularly in the Munster region, while this difficulty had to be coped with in the past number of years.  It is shameful that when an opportunity is presented by a Deputy who has worked hard to produce such a comprehensive and realistic Bill there is such a small minded response from a Government that promised to be open minded.</P>
    <P>I have one other criticism of the Bill, and this again may reflect the fact that Deputy Shatter is a member of the legal profession.  There is a greater emphasis on the judicial process in the legislation than I would advocate if I were in a position to draft such a Bill.  The setting up of a tribunal is an important aspect of the Bill because it provides the right of appeal, but I suspect it would also have the side effect of generating a considerable amount of work for the legal profession.  In my view the right of appeal could be provided through an office of Ombudsman, which would be a simplified method of dealing with the rights of asylum seekers.  When one considers how the free legal aid scheme collapsed under the weight of the demands put on it, I wonder even if the Government saw the light and supported this Bill, whether it would be able to provide the necessary <Col N="733" /> legal framework and representation for refugees.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the Shannon region before the election all TDs were lobbied on this matter and Amnesty International received 100 per cent support. Now that the election is over the Government parties, both Fianna Fáil and Labour, are sitting back and promising that when possible it will take action on the matter.  It is similar to what Alice was told, that she could have jam yesterday, she could have jam tomorrow but she must not expect to have jam today. It would be farcical if it were not so tragic for those people whose rights are being trampled on in their own countries. When they arrive in this country they are sent to jail or deported on the next flight instead of receiving justice.  While it is true that at present no person seeking asylum is in jail here, some people have had sad experiences.  It makes a mockery of the &ldquo;céad míle fáilte&rdquo; sign at Shannon Airport and puts a whole new connotation on the term &ldquo;the Shannon stopover&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government has used the argument that only a small minority of people are affected.  It is precisely because only a small number are affected that we should ensure all the more that their rights are not violated.  At present there are approximately 70 or 80 asylum seekers here, but among that number there may be people who have spent up to one year in jail waiting to be released, not because they have committed a crime but because the mechanisms are not in place to defend their rights.  The reality is that because ordinary committed citizens provided them with support and legal assistance, some of those people have been granted asylum here?  It is a great tribute to those in Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council and the Irish Red Cross that certain refugees have met with some compassion and have been allowed to keep some modicum of dignity. However, in view of the increased likelihood of more asylum seekers coming here in the future, we cannot expect that such organisations will be able, or should be expected, to carry the burden.  At the <Col N="734" /> end of the day this is a political matter requiring a political response.  If we are, as we claim to be, a civilised, independent, democratic country, we should start acting as such.  We should face up to our international responsibilities and this Bill gives us the opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well thought out, realistic and deserves the support of the Government. It already has the support of other partners.  How can Deputies, particularly those in the Labour Party who claim to respect civil rights regardless of class, creed or colour, come into this House and vote down a Bill that will ensure that those who are oppressed or persecuted are given a fair hearing and some justice here?  As a race we are not unfamiliar with persecution; our history should teach us to be generous.  If the Government does not support this Bill it will be flying in the face of the wishes of the majority of Irish people, who wait to provide refuge to those who genuinely need it.</P>
    <P>I know this Bill will be defeated and that is a great shame.  I suspect that, like many other aspects of change that have been promised by this Government, it will slip down the list of priorities.  There is always something else to hit the headlines and become more important than dealing with the rights of a few foreigners. Very often we do not even know their names because they are whisked out of the country so quickly.  A few days ago I visited a family of refugees here and because of the work of the Irish Red Cross and the Irish Refugee Council their material needs have been met.  They have a roof over their heads and a medical card.  They have the basic requirement, but they do not have the language.  It is inspiring to see them communicating with their Irish neighbours with only a handful of words between them.  For those who remain in Ireland that reality is not recognised in this Bill or by the Department. There is an ongoing need for refugees to have their difficulties and problems recognised in a structured way.  It is not that long ago since the fifties when a Yugoslav football team came to Ireland <Col N="735" /> and people were advised not to go to watch them play because of the serious consequences regarding one's salvation. We have moved a long way since those days, but not far enough.  It is important to remember that at the end of the day we are talking about individuals who are often extremely vulnerable, who are in a foreign country and for whom Ireland is not a place of welcome but a place of rejection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I have a particular interest in asylum seekers and refugees because my constituency contains one of the principal points of entry to this country, Shannon Airport.  I have seen some harrowing cases in my constituency. I have seen people subjected to a great deal of stress and mental torture, interred without trial and sent to jail in Limerick.  I have raised this matter in the House on many occasions.  I have been in touch with the aliens section in the Department of Justice and spoken to officers in the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The current legal position here is deficient and Deputy Shatter's Bill makes an honest effort to meet the demands required today.  On numerous occasions I received support from Deputies in the mid-west region in this regard and Deputy Kemmy was particularly vocal regarding particular cases.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government has now decided to oppose this measure.  As Deputy Shatter requested last night it could have accepted the spirit of the Bill, allow it to go through Second Stage and introduce its own amendments on Committee Stage.  However, it chose not to do that.  The most disappointing aspect of the debate this evening is that the Minister seems to be of the opinion that there is nothing wrong and that people were not interned without trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give a recent example of a case concerning an Iraqi, Dr. Laith Tappouni, a medical doctor who, for reasons of conscience, left Iraq.  We are all aware of the noble democrat in command there, Saddam Hussein, who is known to treat <Col N="736" /> people very humanely &mdash; he cuts off their hands and heads &mdash; and deals with the Opposition in a very democratic manner. The doctor arrived in Shannon Airport seeking asylum and was sent to Limerick Prison for two months.  This man had a good command of English, he sent a handwritten letter to me asking for my assistance.  I made representations to the Department on his behalf.  Unfortunately for Dr. Tappouni these events occurred during the general election and the negotiations which followed it.  People took the view that when the new Government was formed this man's case would be dealt with properly and considered in full.  However, Amnesty International had to go to court to seek legal redress in this case.  It is only when the Department of Justice is threatened with legal redress that positive action is taken.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these cases occur as a result of the aliens division being understaffed.  I was assured by the Minister that the aliens division is fully aware of the position.  However, when the aliens division decides to deport people to their own country it very often occurs on a Saturday or a Sunday when it cannot be contacted.  That difficulty constantly arises.  It is unbelievable that a Minister from the west could make the claims she did in the House tonight.  I sympathise with the people in the aliens division because on reading the Official Report, the current Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, put down a question regarding the Department's aliens division on 15 October 1992.  The then Minister for Justice, Mr. Flynn, as part of an extensive reply, stated:</P>
    <P>Arising from that meeting, a number of areas were identified where it was considered that, on the face of it, a detailed examination could lead to improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn was unwilling to concede that anything was wrong in his Department but at least he admitted, following a meeting, that some sections of the aliens division required to be examined. However, the performance of the former <Col N="737" /> Minister, Deputy Burke, left much to be desired because he expected the aliens division to deal with all problems regarding asylum seekers that arose while Ireland held the EC Presidency.  I recall an unfortunate case in Shannon Airport where a Somalian applied for asylum. When I spoke to the Department on his behalf I was told that no officer from the aliens division was available.  Those officers were all required to be in Dublin Castle where European legislation was being discussed and the Minister had requested their presence.  I sympathise with civil servants who have to do their duty according to the Minister.  No Minister for Justice should expect any understaffed group to continue in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that officers in the aliens division in the Department of Justice have not prevailed upon the Minister to accept this Bill because it is in their interest to proceed with it in this manner. I am surprised that the Minister, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, would prevaricate because at the end of his reply the previous Minister, Mr. Flynn &mdash; this is the kernel of the matter, where the Irish are still looking over their shoulders at the British who have been gone since 1922 &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>However, vigilance against illegal immigration, particularly by those who would wish to use Ireland as an easy back-door to other European destinations, will continue to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in this regard do not rest with the Department of Justice, I believe that the heavy hand of the Department of Foreign Affairs is involved as well as people in other countries who insist that we change our attitude to asylum seekers and that Ireland should not give a lead &mdash; as Deputy Shatter is trying to do in this Bill &mdash; by putting the United Nations Convention into law and expressing what was agreed in 1985.  People hold the view that we should not lead, that we should be subservient to the views of the British, Germans or French.  Why will the Minister not admit the influence of the Department <Col N="738" /> of Foreign Affairs?  If that is not the cure, who is influencing the Department of Justice in these matters?</P>
    <P>Many people here cannot understand why people seeking asylum are put in jail.  Immigration officers in the Shannon area do not have a choice in this regard because there is no provision for the reception of people in this position. Immigration officers are expected to work in terrible conditions and it is even worse when they have to deal with families. Recently, there was an application for asylum by a Yugoslavian family, they spent a night in Shannon and were then sent to the Garda barracks where they spent the next night.  I almost expected the adults to be committed to jail and was concerned about the children but, thankfully, a humane approach was adopted.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and her officials to make a realistic appraisal of the current position in regard to the acceptance of asylum seekers here.  As indicated by a previous speaker the Red Cross have been very generous, particularly in Ennis, and have made strenuous efforts to ensure that these people are well cared for, that stress is diminished as much as possible and that there is liaison between the Red Cross and the Department of Justice.  The Red Cross do significant work in that area.</P>
    <P>Greater attention must be paid to proper liaison between the Department of Health and the health boards in regard to the provision of supplementary welfare.  We should not rely totally on the resources available to the Red Cross for fear of exhausting them.  We have an obligation to provide supplementary welfare for applicants, but we have not honoured it.  When the Irish Red Cross had exhausted its funds and asylum seekers saught refuge here, they were hurriedly deported.  I am not sure if people were deported to their countries of origin and subsequently lost their lives. I am not aware of any such incident. Fears have been expressed that people who were deported to their countries of origin were persecuted on their return. <Col N="739" /> In the case of the eminent doctor I referred to earlier, Dr. Tappouni, he had the advantage of speaking English.  There were also refugees from Sri Lanka and Somalia for whom translators were not available when they arrived at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I visited a man in Limerick jail who had suffered persecution and whose family had been shot in the civil war in Somalia.  He had escaped and wished to travel to the promised land, the United States or Canada.  He did not want to come to this country; he wanted to get work.  He was an asylum seeker in transit, but he was imprisoned here for two or three months.  I made appropriate noises in the Dáil and the Ministers assured me there would be no internment without trial.  But that applicant was interned without trial.  Eventually, Mr. Bob Eager, a solicitor for Amnesty International, elicited the applicant's true story through an interpreter employed by the University in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I had been in contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in London and he conveyed to me the details that had been despatched from Dublin.  I am sure those immigration officers took this information in good faith.  People fleeing from tyrannical regimes view people in power, who ask questions &mdash; for example, policemen and immigration officers &mdash; with fear and they will not give truthful answers.  It is important to have an independent person who will reassure applicants that the truth will be conveyed to the United Nations High Commissioner.</P>
    <P>That is why Deputy Shatter introduced this Bill.  The Government had plenty of time to introduce its own Bill.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, promised to introduce legislation in this regard some time ago, but it did not come to pass.  Our party had been examining this matter for a period and it was time for Deputy Shatter to introduce this Bill.  I consider it is being introduced six years too late.  I sought its introduction in 1986, when my party were in Government, and in 1987 and later years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> As a humanitarian gesture we should have a proper reception area in Shannon Airport to cater for refugees from Eastern Europe and other countries who may be fleeing civil war and may wish to travel to the United States or Canada.  We should have a tribunal and our dealings with refugees should be transparent and above board.  I received many letters from Amnesty International in Galway and I am sure, having listened to the Minister's contribution tonight they will be amused.  I hope they will send the same number of letters to the Minister as they sent me protesting in regard to her attitude on this matter.  I hope they took note of what she said this evening when she denied there was any particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated some acceptance of the tribunal proposed in the Bill. I would have proposed a simpler court over which a local district justice could have presided together with officers from the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Law Reform and Justice. I proposed that a group of three independents be made available in Shannon Airport; but Deputy Shatter, having considered this proposal, felt that the Department of Justice would not accept any group who did not have some legal basis.  We did not propose the tribunal for any reason of pomp, we could have had an ombudsman but we wished to put an appeal system in place that would have a legal basis and that would be accepted by the Government side.</P>
    <P>The problem of refugees will not be dealt with easily owing to the position in Europe, particularly the civil war in Yugoslavia.  There was a curious change in national policy after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Prior to that time asylum seekers at Shannon Airport had no difficulty in travelling on to the United States or Canada.  At that time the Canadians welcomed Iron Curtain citizens with open arms.  Shannon Airport is only a transit area and there were no major difficulties.  But following the upheavals in Eastern Europe there was an immediate change in attitude on the other side of the Atlantic.  There was also a change <Col N="741" /> in attitude here.  That arose because we became very friendly with the authorities in Poland.  I recall a number of Polish refugees who sought asylum here, having fled Poland because they were conscientious objectors and did not wish to be inducted into the army under compulsory conscription.  They had a particular difficulty because they were Jehovah Witnesses and they thought that the authorities here would not be sympathetic to their case.  I took up their case, even though they do not participate in elections, as Deputy Ryan is aware. However, although I pursued their case, they were eventually sent back to Poland. Those people had relatives in Canada and had spent all their means on that flight.  The Red Cross in Ennis, Tony McEnery, his wife and family and the people in Dublin, looked after them very well.  In spite of the High Court case &mdash; Amnesty pleaded their case &mdash; the Government insisted on sending these people back to their own country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the Minister's interpretation of the Bill.  She said that the UN Convention defines a refugee as a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, etc.  I could never understand how Jehovah Witnesses, who were conscientious objectors, were not deemed to have a well-founded fear of persecution. One or two of these people who are living in Poland still write to me.  They are always praising the hospitality of Clare people.  Deputy McDowell would know all about that.  The people of Clare are very hospitable and the Government's attitude to asylum seekers goes against what we believe.</P>
    <P>With one or two exceptions, Fianna Fáil has never looked sympathetically at legislation introduced by the Fine Gael Party or any measure introduced by another party.  This has been its tradition for the 60 years it has been in power.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has been given the opportunity to make those same points in the debate on this Bill. Both the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, referred when they were on this side of the House to the need for justice and equity.  On one occasion Deputy Spring brought the then Minister into the House to explain why the wives and children of medical students were not allowed into this country by the aliens section of the Department.  He was called to order by the Ceann Comhairle for his disorderly conduct when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, did not answer his question.  The Minister for Justice has done the same to us tonight.  On 15 October 1992, my birthday, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, put down a question seeking information on the aliens section of the Department.  I sympathise with the people working in this section who have been kicked around in regard to this issue and have had to follow political decisions <Col N="743" /> made by the former Minister for Justice, Commissioner Flynn.  It did not matter that the people in the aliens section of the Department had to work 24 hours a day.  As long as Commissioner Flynn was all right everything else was supposed to be all right.  Even if there were only two people in the section, they had to put up with this.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Labour Party can vote against this Bill; it does not fit in with its ethos and all the things it said during the years.  The Labour Party in my constituency never supported Fianna Fáil.  The Fine Gael Party never supported Fianna Fáil for a number of reasons, the primary reason being that it never took on board anything proposed by us.  In some cases it came along afterwards and made the same proposals. When Deputy Killeen became chairman of Clare County Council he set up the Shannon Status Committee.  When I proposed the setting-up of this committee a few months earlier, Deputy Killeen voted agains the motion.  I suppose that is politics &mdash; if someone comes up with a good idea, take it.  The Labour Party always had a conscience, and I believe it still has a conscience.  I hope that party will show it is indepedent of the withering hand of Fianna Fáil.  Once Fianna Fáil gets a hold on the Labour Party, they will be sucked in with Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that Deputy Carey did not mention the issue being debated in the past three or four minutes in his attempt to persuade the Labour Party to leave its partnership arrangement.  I will address some of these points in the latter part of my speech.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday week I met a young African woman at a social function.  She was about 25 years of age and had been in this country for just over a week.  Before she left Africa she had been involved in a Catholic organisation which is engaged in educational activities in general and literacy programmes in particular &mdash; the sort of activities which would be regarded as normal and everyday in Western Europe.  Unfortunately, such activities are regarded as subversive in her country in that they provide people with the wherewithal to challenge an undemocratic and patriarchal society.</P>
      <P>As a result of her work, this woman had been threatened by the security forces in her country and she felt that she had no option but to leave.  Incidentally, she worked closely with overseas workers and Irish priests.  It was on their advice that she came to Ireland.  I am not at liberty to mention this woman's name, nor can I mention the country from which she comes.  Having spoken to her for approximately 15 minutes I was left in no doubt that she was genuinely terrified that her presence in this country would become known, that her family would be hurt or killed and that she might have done the wrong thing by coming to Ireland in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not tell this woman, with hand on heart, that she had any reasonable chance of getting asylum in this country. Recent experience would suggest that the contrary is the case.  We pride ourselves on being a compassionate and progressive country.  We have recently accepted refugees from Bosnia.  Previously we accepted refugees from Vietnam and elsewhere but it has to be said we have not been slow in clapping ourselves on the backs for having done so. On a more positive note, I am quite sure the Irish people, as a whole, were very pleased to do what little we could in <Col N="745" /> alleviating the plight of these unfortunate people.  In that context it is all the more surprising that we persist in dealing with individual applications for asylum in a fashion that is little short of shameful.</P>
    <P>Many applictions for asylum are made in airport arrival lounges by people who simply refuse to re-board planes.  More often than not, such people are detained at an airport until some official of the Department of Justice decides their fate. Normally, such decisions are taken sooner rather than later.  In almost every case in recent experience the individual in question was dispatched with considerable haste.</P>
    <P>Occasionally an application for asylum is made by somebody who will have entered this country illegally.  In such instances, reasons for refusal are rarely given and the decision taken rarely justified by the Department.  Even when a deportation order is made, the matter is by no means at an end.  The unfortunate individual is put in custody, sometimes for many months, while arrangements are being made for the deportation to be carried out.  In a recent case one individual was released by the courts because the Department had been unable to make arrangements for the deportation because of the ban on direct international flights to Libya.</P>
    <P>These people have committed no offence in this country.  I find it appalling that we can treat them in this way.  It is worth asking just why we can do so. There has been a long-established principle that even the simplest of administrative procedures must observe the rules of natural justice.  A case was brought to our courts recently by the parents of a child who was expelled from school, who claimed that proper administrative procedures were not followed in taking that decision.  Another case has been taken by a person expelled from a golf club.  The rules of the Jockey Club have been challenged in our courts for the same reason.  In all of these cases, and many others, the courts have insisted that the rules of natural justice be applied.  Why then do not the rules of natural justice apply in cases of applications <Col N="746" /> for asylum when the very life of the individual concerned may be at stake?</P>
    <P>Of course, the answer is that these people are not citizens of this State and, therefore, do not warrant constitutional protection, nor are they citizens of the European Community.  In most cases they are people from the Third World who are not white.  It has been suggested that these people are merely attempting to enter Ireland or Europe by the back door, that in essence they are immigrants. It is worth taking a few minutes to consider just how we treat would-be immigrants from Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I was approached by an Indian doctor who had been working in the neuro-surgical section of Beaumont Hospital for most of last year.  He was offered a contract in that hospital, and another contract in a Cork hospital, again in the neuro-surgical section.  He applied to the Department of Labour for a permit to remain and work in this country.  The Department of Labour granted him a work permit.  He was told then that, in accordance with normal practice, he was required to make an application to an Irish Embassy abroad for a residency visa here.  He left and applied to the Irish Embassy in London. He was refused, given no reason for the refusal, but invited to apply again.  He applied again and was refused again, without being given any reason for the refusal.  He returned to this country, approached me and some of my colleagues, including Deputy Bhamjee.  We appealed the case to the Minister for Justice; the Minister refused.  I was told by an official of the Department of Justice that it was not policy to explain why such applications have been refused.  I protested but was given no satisfactory explanation.  Apparently we do not feel we are in any way accountable to these people.</P>
    <P>However, I have to confess that I have my suspicions in that case.  The wife of that doctor is pregnant and will give birth some time in the next few months.  Any child born in this country is an Irish citizen. It would be difficult, perhaps <Col N="747" /> impossible, legally to expel the child's parents at any future time.  Therefore, it is possible we would be giving this family an indefinite right to remain here.  Quite frankly, I do not see that that would be any great disaster.  Our health services might well benefit from the presence of that individual, as they have from many others who have contributed to our health service over previous decades.  I do not see that the fabric of Irish society would suffer greatly by allowing this family to settle here.  Apparently the Department of Justice feels otherwise. Perhaps there was another reason; I do not know.  They did not advance any reason.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we are enforcing British immigration rules in this country.  I find that entirely unacceptable.  I do not see that our Department of Justice should carry a brief for the British Home Office. Britain has a multi-racial society.  If they want to restrict entry, that is entirely a matter for them.  We should have no hand, act or part in doing their dirty work for them.  Unfortunately, I fear it goes even further than that.  I am open to correction on this and hope I am proven wrong &mdash; but I understand that at a Council of Justice Ministers last autumn, the previous Government objected to a proposal which would have rendered it easier for the families of refugees in EC countries to join their relatives within the European Community.  I should be interested to have confirmation from the Minister on that point.  I believe the measure proposed was reasonable and humane and would have had no effect on this country.  Therefore, the suspicion arises again that we are doing other people's dirty work for them.</P>
    <P>Ireland should immediately join the Schengen group of countries in eliminating the need for passports within the European Community.  All of us claim to be committed to the free movement of people within the Community, yet we continue to insist that passports be presented at frontier posts.  I appreciate there are some genuine reasons in connection with security.  Equally it is clear <Col N="748" /> that one of the more disreputable reasons is our continued willingness to enforce the immigration legislation of our former colonial masters.  I am entirely opposed to this and believe we should cease that practice forthwith.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn for a few moments to the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter which I believe has a number of defects. I contend the procedures to be followed should be set out in greater detail in the Bill &mdash; perhaps it is my lawyer's training &mdash; but I do believe that these should be matters for judicial decision rather than decision by an Ombudsman or tribunal which does not have a judicial presence. I believe also we must tackle the question of any rights that might be attached to the families of people who might successfully apply for asylum.  Having said all of that, the Bill is positive in its thrust and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Programme for Government included the following commitment on this matter.</P>
    <P>Our policy towards the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee the rights of hearings, appeals, access to legal advice and access to the courts.</P>
    <P>That commitment in the Programme for Government was included at the behest of my party.  I want to re-state that commitment on behalf of the Labour Party. This is a matter of considerable urgency which should not be postponed any longer.  If the Minister is willing to give the House an undertaking to return immediately with an alternative Bill I shall be happy to accept such undertaking. However, to be quite frank, I believe there is much in this Bill deserving of consideration.  I would ask the Minister to give some thought to the possibility of passing it to Committee Stage for further consideration.  At that stage obviously it would be possible for amendments to be tabled which might deal with some of the objections raised by the Department.  Alternatively, the Minister might ask that the matter be <Col N="749" /> adjourned pending production of her own Bill.</P>
    <P>All of us are agreed, and certainly we in the Labour Party are in no doubt, that this is a matter of urgency affecting basic human rights.  I believe all parties in the House support the broad intent of the Bill.  All that remains to be decided is the exact procedure we should adopt.  I would ask the Minister for Justice to be flexible in that regard.</P>

      <P>I understand the humanitarian concerns which prompted the introduction of this Private Members' Bill by Deputy Shatter.  I find myself disposed sympathetically to those principles and, along with Deputy Derek McDowell, would welcome a Bill introduced by the Minister herself, which I expect will be the case.</P>
      <P>I have a number of concerns about this Bill, principally that one of its effects might be the undermining of the protection afforded genuine refugees under the terms of the United Nations Convention on Refugees.  My worry is based to a substantial extent on the experience of those countries that have dealt with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, when I understand that of the order of 90 per cent of the cases referred were found to be bogus.</P>
      <P>It is important that we in this House define the term &ldquo;refugee'.  We would need to draw a distinction between the case of a person fleeing a regime which threatened his life and that of his family and another who may seek to begin a new living or economic opportunity in a western country.  It would be delightful were we in a position to welcome all comers under all headings.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  There are very substantial costs involved in looking after the needs of genuine refugees.  We have been found wanting in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposers of this Bill will be aware also of the extent of the financial obligations these provisions would place on the State.  In the short term, we should seek to ensure that the relatively scarce resources available are put to use in catering <Col N="750" /> for the needs of those who are in specific need of protection.  Deputy Carey outlined some of the experiences we have had in County Clare arising from our proximity to Shannon Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, for coming into the House to reply.  In Ballinasloe we rightly regard the Minister of State as our neighbour in Athlone, she has taken a great interest not alone in this problem but in the others which the town has faced in recent months and years.  I also thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, for his efforts in this regard.  I am aware that he met his counterpart in the Spanish Government, Mr. Noval.  Further, I wish to thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who was also in contact with his counterpart in the Spanish Government.  Indeed, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs summed up the position well in relation to the Dubarry shoe factory when he said that the matter in regard to the factory Agreda in Spain, where there is a strike, was bound up in a tangle of legal, financial and political difficulties.</P>
      <P>The situation at the Dubarry factory in Ballinasloe where 350 jobs are in jeopardy is very serious.  In addition, the jobs of those working in ancillary industries, including those who work from home where they stitch this product, are also under threat.  This evening SIPTU officials and the personnel officer at the Dubarry factory are meeting workers at the Spanish plant at Agreda.  I hope there will be a successful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned the legal, financial and <Col N="751" /> political problems in Spain.  One of the difficulties is that two regional governments in Spain are dealing with this matter.  The parent company is located in one region while a subsidiary is located in another.  These two regional governments are controlled by the nationalist and conservative parties whereas the socialist party comprises the central government.  To complicate the matter further the Spanish general election is due to be held on 6 June.  There is a tendency, therefore, to let the matter rest but this is not good enough.  We have to use every means at our disposal to get the Spanish Government to intervene.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the factors to which I referred, the ability of the Spanish Government to intervene directly may be limited but the Minister of State should have the question of compensation for workers on strike in the factory in Agreda resolved as quickly as possible.  This is the kernel of the issue.  The factory in Agreda works on a subcontract basis for the Dubarry plant and it is essential that the moulds are released for the factory in Ballinasloe where they are used in the manufacture of the very popular boating shoe.</P>
    <P>There has been much speculation in the media as to whether the workers will be put on short-time.  Indeed, the question of whether half the workforce will be paid off has been raised.  Such a prospect should not be considered at present, to allow the IDA and SIPTU to find a solution. In this regard I thank the regional manager of the IDA, Mr. Tom Hyland, for the work he has done.  I am aware that the management of Dubarry and SIPTU are working hard to resolve the matter and I wish them well.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there have been many job losses in Ballinasloe in recent months.  As the Minister of State is aware, Top Quarries closed while there were redundancies at the AT Cross factory. Therefore, it would be a serious matter if there were further job loses in Ballinasloe as a result of the problems in the Dubarry factory.  I hope the Minister of State can give us some grounds for hope in her reply this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter tonight in which my colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, and indeed many other Deputies have an interest.  I share the concern expressed by the Deputy tonight and I assure him that the Government is very concerned about the continuing threat to jobs at the Dubarry factory in Ballinasloe arising from the problems experienced by the company with its Spanish supplier.</P>
      <P>As the background to the case has been dealt with in detail by Deputy Kitt, in the newspapers and in radio programme I will not waste the time of the House by going over the same ground.  The Deputy asked about progress and the up-to-date position.  In particular he raised the question of redundancy payments for the Spanish workers which is the crux of the matter.</P>
      <P>I should point out that since the problem arose, Government Ministers and Departments, the IDA and SIPTU have all been working very closely in support of the company to seek a resolution of the problem.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been very active in this case and the embassy in Madrid has been working very closely with the Dubarry representative in Spain and with visiting SIPTU officials in dealing with the Spanish workers, management and the examiners appointed by the Spanish courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of weeks ago the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, asked the ambassador in Madrid to personally intervene on his behalf in an effort to bring this complicated issue to a speedy conclusion.  In addition, the Spanish ambassador to Ireland was contacted in similar terms.  When it became apparent that this would not lead to a solution the Minister, Deputy Quinn, personally contacted his opposite number in Spain and further underlined the critical nature of the situation and the likely impact on jobs at the Dubarry factory if the problem was not solved urgently.  He informed his opposite <Col N="753" /> number that vital European &mdash; indeed worldwide &mdash; orders were now at risk, given that Dubarry's products are internationally renowned.  In response, the Spanish Minister said that he would take all possible steps to find a solution to the problem within the framework of the collective autonomy that operates in Spain in the region concerned.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who is currently in Spain, discussed the matter with his opposite number and has underlined to the Spanish Government the vital necessity to do all in its power to resolve the matter urgently.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, like the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, received a positive response.  It should also be borne in mind that the Spanish factory concerned is in liquidation and in the hands of the courts. Allied to the redundancy issue, it is a complicated matter.  Every effort has been made to solve this ongoing problem. The State agencies, in particular the IDA, are also assisting the firm in its current difficulties.</P>
    <P>Our main aim is to maintain employment at the Dubarry factory which is one of the best run factories I have ever seen. There is an excellent relationship between the management and unions.  It is a model firm.  It is quite tragic this malaise has complicated the issue.  All the State agencies are working very closely and we are working closely at the highest level in Government, at administrative level and at union level.  Indeed, the SIPTU official has been out in Spain for a number of weeks meeting his opposite number in Spain.  This is a very complex political, with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;, problem to resolve particularly in view of the circumstances obtaining in both firms.</P>
    <P>Dubarry has made every effort to maintain its full workforce and has continued to do that in spite of very great difficulties.  It is seeking ways every hour of the day to continue to keep every person in employment.  It enjoys a very high reputation internationally.</P>
    <P>I have given the most up-to-date position. Every effort is being made to ensure <Col N="754" /> that the workers in Dubarry, Ballinasloe, can have every confidence in their future and in retaining their jobs.  However, let me emphasise that it is a very difficult and complex situation and we are faced with a very human problem in the firms in Ballinasloe and in Spain.  We will have to work ceaselessly to resolve it.  I understand a delegation of workers went to Spain with that objective in mind.</P>
    <P>As the firm is literally down the road from my home I speak with a certain local knowledge.  I know what is happening from speaking to people.  There is a huge measure of good-will behind the factory to have the matter resolved and bring it to a reasonable conclusion.  I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter and I will continue to keep the Deputies informed of developments.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, is not present as I wanted to direct some of my comments to him.  This is not to take away from the expertise of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke.  The loss of 150 jobs at one of the key industries in Swords, County Dublin, will have a devastating effect on the families concerned and on the economy generally in Swords and the surrounding towns of north County Dublin. Amdahl set up a small factory in Ireland with 30 workers in 1978 but by 1992 when they moved to Swords the labour force was 638.  Last October Amdahl sought 60 voluntary redundancies and it was assumed this was a necessary step to reflect the world difficulties being suffered by mainframe computer suppliers. The sudden announcement last week by Amdahl Corporation of the need of a worldwide reduction of 1,200 from the workforce took the Amdahl workers by surprise.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, visited the Amdahl Corporation in northern California on 16 March accompanied by the IDA representative for the US west coast and the the secretary of his Department, <Col N="755" /> Mr. Bonnar.  Was the Minister warned of impending job losses at that time?  If so, what case did he make to save these jobs? It strikes me that the same effort and pressure was not put into preventing the loss of jobs in this instance as was put into fighting for the retention of jobs in Digital, Galway, albeit unsuccessfully.</P>
      <P>The IDA has given grants of approximately £9 million to Amdahl and Amdahl has made huge investments in the company through training and service in the general area.  The jobs of the excellently skilled staff are threatened by the announcement of 150 redundancies.  Will the Minister confirm that every effort is being made to replace these lost jobs in my constituency as a matter of urgency? Allied to this devastating news is the widespread concern already being expressed in thousands of households in north County Dublin concerning the future of the jobs in Aer Lingus.  In many families if a member loses his or her job in one company there is also the possibility that another member of the family will lose his or her job in the other company.  I am appealing to the Minister to replace these jobs as quickly as possible and to use the excellent skills of the workers which will become available when these redundancies come about.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the input of Amdahl in its plant in Swords which has benefited its employees and the wider community.  Amdahl has been extremely generous in its support for many community projects, including a scholarship scheme which it is running currently for students from the local secondary schools who can apply for university grants and if successful they are funded all through university by Amdahl.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give me an assurance that this is the end of the redundancies to be sought by Amdahl and that the remaining 400 jobs are secure and will not be lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, as a person who is not from the Dublin area, to recognise that the loss of this number of jobs is as devastating to Swords and its surroundings as it would be to some of the <Col N="756" /> smaller towns throughout Ireland where huge efforts are made to replace lost industries.  I would not like anybody in the Department to assume that because Dublin is the capital and people may find jobs in neighbouring areas there is not a need for the urgent replacement of these jobs and a new factory for Swords.</P>

      <P>I will now answer in my usual straightforward way.  Amdahl now finds itself in a situation that to ensure its continued survival it must reduce production capacity with resultant consequences on staff numbers.  Amdahl is in the process of cutting 1,200 jobs from its 8,700 workforce worldwide.  As the plant in Swords is Amdahl's one and only manufacturing operation outside of the United States it is inevitable that Swords would have to bear some of the cutbacks.  However, it is important to stress that Swords will continue to be Amdahl's one and only manufacturing location outside of the US and that it will continue to supply Europe, the Far East and the Pacific Basin &mdash; areas where rapid market expansion is anticipated,.  The fact that Amdahl is also considering other activities for Swords is also encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the above it is clear that we have <Col N="757" /> been keeping the situation in Amdahl under close review both on the basis of ministerial contact and on-going suggestions as to enhancement of the activities at Swords.</P>
    <P>The electronics industry is currently maturing and consolidating after an explosive growth phase.  This is particularly demonstrated on the hardware side of the industry where Amdahl, as a mainframe manufacturer, is increasingly becoming subjected to price pressures and decreasing margins.  Due to rapid technological advances the electronics industry is characterised by high and increasing capital intensity matched by shortening product life cycles.  That is the background position and I will now deal with what is happening.</P>
    <P>To this end, all segments of the electronics industry are kept under constant review and future assessments as to potential and risk are made regularly both by my Department and IDA in conjunction with outside analysts.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of how we have sought to respond to this rapidly developing industry, it is worth noting that as the market has moved towards PCs and their associated networking equipment, these companies have been targeted by the IDA.  Many representatives of these companies are located in Ireland where they are performing above expectation both by way of job creation and overall performance.</P>
    <P>The plant in Swords continues to be a strong participant in Amdahl's plans for the future, a future which will be built on Amdahl's proven resourcefulness in developing new products in a highly competitive sector.  It is sad that people are being let go at this stage.  My hope is that they will part on amicable terms. I understand that Amdahl is offering a voluntary separation package backed up by severance package.  In so doing Amdahl is also offering a vocational education grant to those employees wishing to pursue further education in their chosen career or, indeed, in different fields.  I am telling the Deputy this because of her open espousal of its links with people in second level schools.  This <Col N="758" /> represents an innovative approach in that not only are the immediate concerns of its employees catered for but also Amdahl is contributing towards their future.  That is as I would have expected from Amdahl management who sought every possible means to avoid letting go some of their workforce, but unfortunately they had to let people go.  The fact remains that Swords is Amdahl's only manufacturing base outside the US and that, we all hope, guarantees its future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether the Department is as keen to promote and create jobs in Dublin as in other towns throughout Ireland.  As the capital city we see it as a place that easily facilitates jobs.  I agree that there is usually great hubbub and brouhaha when jobs are lost. Swords is a town with its own community, infrastructure, schools and facilities, similar to any town in the rest of the country, and the Deputy's point is valid. The Department and the IDA always bear that point in mind.  I will ask the Department officials to maintain contact with Deputy Owen in regard to progress on this matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yesterday, the board of the ESB decided that they would close the peat burning generation station in Allenwood.  Some 72 employees will lose their jobs and up to 130 persons employed by Board na Móna will also, according to union sources, be put out of work.  The loss of 200 jobs is a serious blow to a small community.  The ESB has informed the Minister for Transport, Communications and Energy of its intent, and it is now up to the Minister to accept or rescind their <Col N="759" /> decision.  Is the Minister going to close down Allenwood?  If so, will he guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies in either the ESB or Board na Móna?</P>
      <P>This decision by the ESB on the same day as the Government adopted some of the Culliton proposals reminds us all that there is now a major question mark over the peat burning stations in the midlands. The Moriarty Task Force in their report on the Culliton report stated:</P>
      <P>The price at which the ESB is required to take milled peat from Board na Móna is a tax on electricity users for the subsidisation of Bord na Móna. There is no commercial or security justification from an energy or industrial policy point of view.  The argument in favour is based on social and regional economic development consideration.</P>
      <P>The cost of peat for electricity generation is very high compared to the cost of coal, gas or oil.  It is twice the cost of gas or oil.  Also the nature of peat as a fuel makes the operating costs of generating electricity by peat very much higher than the cost of generation by coal or gas.  The total imposition is equivalent to a surcharge of 4 per cent on electricity bills.  The Department of Energy, it is understood, has been looking at the possibility of investment in modern peat power stations as a way to reduce the cost of peat generated power.  If new investment does not in fact reduce costs it would be most ill-advised and should not proceed.  There is a need for a detailed evaluation of the whole issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also understood that the Department of Energy is pressing Board na Móna to reduce the price charged to the ESB for milled peat to achieve economies in the generating process where milled peat is involved.  The excess cost of peat-fuelled generation (approximately £30 million more than the cost of the same output generated <Col N="760" /> by oil as already indicated) must be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Task Force recommended that plans to implement greatly reduced prices for milled peat to the ESB so as to bring that fuel more into line with the price of other energy sources should be completed by end June, 1993.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to these recommendations of the minority report is fudged and unclear.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position either tonight or when this House discusses the Estimates for his Department in the next couple of weeks.  What other power stations does the Minister intend closing, and what section of Bord na Móna's operations will be closed as a consequence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of this power station, together with the effects down the line on Bord na Móna and the continuing effects of the closure of the Lullymore briquette factory, will be absolutely devastating to the whole of the north-west Kildare area.  As Deputy Noonan has pointed out, there is a history to this question.  I remind the Minister that the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government contains a commitment to support the construction of a 120 mega-watt power station in the midlands &ldquo;if it is feasible&rdquo;.  As Deputy Noonan has pointed out, the most recent document published by the Government titled, <i>Employment through Enterprise,</i> is much less forthcoming.  The ESB has made no contribution whatever to attempts to develop alternative employment opportunities in the north-west Kildare area. We need a clear and unequivocal statement of the Government's position in this matter.  Is the Government going to abandon north-west Kildare?</P>

      <P>It is sad that we are gathered this evening to discuss this issue, particularly at a time when so much emphasis is placed on job creation, retention of existing jobs and inducements and enticements to investors to invest in jobs.

It is a part of the country that has been the subject matter of repeated manifestations of interest and intent on the part of both Government parties.</P>
      <P>I did not come in here to berate the Minister of State, who is a very decent and conscientious man who will, I have no doubt, carry the message back to the Minister.  The person who should be here tonight is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I hope he will use his prerogative to rescind the decision and direct the ESB to continue operating at Allenwood, thereby living up to the trust placed in him and his colleagues, the two Ministers in Kildare, by the people of the area.  In short, perhaps he will do what his colleague, Deputy Ger Connolly, claimed he did, by keeping the station open for many years after it was considered impossible to do so.</P>

The ESB report will be very carefully considered by our Department, taking into account the economic and technical issues that arise, before a final decision is taken on the recommendations of the ESB.</P>
      <P>When the Allenwood power station was commissioned in 1952, it had a design life of 25 years.  The station has now been in operation for 41 years and has exceeded its design life by some 16 years. The Allenwood station was originally scheduled for closure in 1984-1985, but closure was postponed to allow for continued operation to the end of the decade.  A further final extension for a three-year period was decided in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> In view of the age of the station, the ESB decided some time ago that it would be prudent to carry out a detailed examination of the plant to assess the capability for future operations.  The station was closed down in June 1992, to allow this major technical and safety evaluation to take place.  Shortly, after its closure last year, I visited the plant, along with the relevant officials.  External consultants were retained by the ESB to advise on the technical condition of the plant.  The Department's chief technical adviser is now examining the consultants' assessment as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The report now submitted to my Department by the ESB is based on the technical evaluation and the assessment of the costs associated with the refurbishment and operation of the plant.  In this context, it has now to be borne in mind, that the efficiency of the station is low at 22 per cent and the cost of producing power is high at 9p per unit.  This compares unfavourably with the newer peat stations such as Lanesboro, where the equivalent cost is 4p per unit and the gas fired station at Poolbeg, where the cost is 2.1p per unit.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Brian Cowen, and I with our specialist officials, will give this matter extremely detailed consideration, before a full and final decision is taken.  We do not have any intention at any time to abandon north-west Kildare or any part of this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for remaining in the House after a long day to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising the problems arising from the incineration of waste material at the Regional Hospital in Cork.  Similar problems surround other Cork hospitals <Col N="763" /> and hospitals throughout the country.  I assume that a common solution will have to be found for all.  It is specifically the matter as it relates to the Cork Regional Hospital that I am raising this evening.</P>
    <P>This hospital burns 400 tons of waste per annum.  Specific emission data is lacking and there is no monitoring system in place capable of assessing the extent of hazardous emissions.  Arising from persistent complaints from residents in the area and from local politicians, Cork Corporation commissioned Eolas to carry out a study of this matter and report to Cork Corporation.  This report is scheduled to be with Cork Corporation by Friday next.  When that report is available we will have more precise information. However, the problem remains to be solved.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, the hazards of hospital wastes have been viewed in terms of the dangers posed to the staff and patients by their proximity to various drugs, chemicals and infectious waste.  These potential hazards remain, but in addition it is now recognised that the gases emitting from hospital incinerators can pose extremely serious hazards to the downwind environment, thereby creating serious problems for residents in adjacent housing estates.</P>
    <P>The members of the hospital board have admitted that they have a problem with their incinerator, which they argue was not built to take the volume of waste now being burnt, and they have made numerous applications to the Department of Health for funds to enable them to remedy the matter.</P>
    <P>The residents in the adjoining area have been very concerned for a number of years about the black belching dioxins and the noxious smells coming from the chimney stack and about the fine black particles on cars, lawns, furniture and windows.  Blackening of newly painted houses and outside walls has roused grave suspicions among the residents as to the nature of the material emitting from the chimney stack.  Many people are also concerned that the large number of asthma cases and respiratory problems among <Col N="764" /> adults and children could be related to the incinerator as a source of pollution.</P>
    <P>I understand that hospital wastes are highly variable in content and that 85 per cent of the total hospital waste treatment can be categorised as general refuse which is non-hazardous.  It is the remainder that gives cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The presence of halogenated materials in hospital refuse can generate toxic air contaminants during incomplete combustion. In general terms, hospital wastes usually contain about 20 per cent plastics, with levels as high as 30 per cent being reported in some cases.  By comparison municipal solid wastes usually contains between 3 per cent and 7 per cent plastics. Polyvinyl chloride and other halogenated polymers make up a significant fraction of plastics in hospital wastes.  These include disposal instruments such as syringes, plasticised paperware, plastic cutlery, plastic containers, packaging, bedpans, urine bags, respiratory devices, dialysis equipment and a range of similar material.</P>
    <P>There are also serious problems with the incineration of metals.  Incineration cannot fully destroy metals.  It can only redistribute them.  The same quality of metal fed into the incinerator will be released in emission and on the filter. Many of the heavy metals are known to be detrimental to human health even at extremely low concentrations.  Without going into any further technical details it is quite evident that the emissions from the chimney stack are highly toxic.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to put in place a double strategy, the first being an interim measure, a campaign to cause hospitals to implement some kind of programme to arrest this problem.  They should implement a strategy of waste prevention at source.  That ought to be done immediately because hospitals should promote health inside and outside and should not spread ill health.  At the end of the day there is a need for a national waste management policy.  I want the Minister to work towards that and to take steps that would require new hospitals and new extensions to existing hospitals <Col N="765" /> to put in place systems that would avoid the hazards of the existing incinerators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity, on behalf of my Government colleagues, Ministers Howlin and O'Dea, to respond to the question raised by Deputy Quill in relation to the disposal of hospital waste at Cork Regional and other hospitals.  We are aware of the problems associated with the incineration of hospital waste at Cork and elsewhere and we fully accept the need for a waste management policy in relation to clinical waste.</P>
      <P>Attitudes to the generation and treatment of waste have been changing in recent years.  People are now more conscious of waste and its effects on the environment.  While the direct detrimental effects of poor waste practices on communities and workers involved in handling waste have long been known, the environmental and indirect health, effects have only been recognised fairly recently.  The problem of waste is now seen not just as one of local significance, but as one that impacts on the global environment as well.</P>
      <P>While this awakening of consciousness has resulted in improvements in some practices, it is likely that the next decade will see significant changes resulting from demands for a more considered approach to waste generation and its consequences. The changes will impact on all consumers, domestic, institutional and industrial, and will be particularly significant for producers of &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; wastes.  In the health services field, providers of acute care will be affected by more stringent requirements, for the handling and treatment of clinical or health care waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent waste legislation, mainly EC led, has been reflecting environmental and health and safety concerns and is forcing producers to review, if not to change, their current practices.  As far as the health services are concerned, a number of regulatory changes have been introduced, or are pending, which are already having a significant impact.  The two most notable changes to date are the <Col N="766" /> introduction of the Air Pollution Act of 1987 and the pending classification of clinical waste as hazardous under EC Council Directive 91/68.  A further significant impact is likely when the EC Directive on the Incineration of Hazardous Waste is introduced.</P>
    <P>The technical requirements of the EC Directive on the incineration of hazardous waste, in its present draft form, impose very high standards on the incineration of classified substances.</P>
    <P>With the impending classification of clinical waste as hazardous, this means the clinical waste may only be incinerated in the most sophisticated and expensive modern plants.  Such incinerators would be viable only as large units and the cost per tonne of waste treated could be as much as 10 times greater than current costs.  The classification of clinical waste as hazardous will have a further significant impact in that the waste arising will have to be stored, handled, transported, accounted for and disposed of under permit from the local authorities. Strict requirements are laid down for each of these operations.</P>
    <P>The problems imposed on health care authorities in complying with new standards on waste are considerable, with a lot of potential for confusion.  Meeting the many demands emanating from environmental and health and safety legislation will involve changes in work practices as well as substantial investment in new or upgraded plant.  Working to an agreed policy offers the best chance of an orderly and consistent approach to change, as well as ensuring a high degree of continued compliance with the new standards.  The implementation of a health service-wide policy should ensure that the best and most appropriate means practicable for handling and treatment are applied to the waste generated. Accordingly, arrangements have been made in the Department of Health to prepare a health services waste policy. A first draft of this document has been prepared and an internal group has been set up to finalise it.</P>
    <P>The twin primary aims of the policy are to minimise the impact of waste on <Col N="767" /> the environment and to bring about better conditions for those handling waste.</P>
    <P>The secondary aims of the policy are: to ensure that the most appropriate treatment and disposal methods are applied to all waste operations; to ensure that there is the maximum of co-operation and integration of services between the different health providers, in order to minimise costs and made optimum use of available resources; to ensure that consistent standards are applied across the services; to assist in the smooth implementation of new regulations and EC Directives; to indicate the best strategy for dealing with waste and specifically clinical waste; and to offer guidance for the drawing up of waste management plans.  In formulating this policy, account will be taken of the good practice and <Col N="768" /> principles currently being proposed or employed for waste in both Europe and in the United States.  As these are very much in a state of flux, the policy must be viewed as subject to future alteration, in the light of experience gained and changing knowledge and attitudes.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I thank the Deputy for raising this important question and I can assure the House that every effort is being made by the Department of Health to implement a hospital waste management policy that will overcome the difficulties associated with the current incineration arrangements at Cork Regional and other hospitals and comply fully with the demanding requirements of modern environmental standards.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.14 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 May 1993.</P>

      <P>The College of Technology Kevin Street is part of the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).  The funding of the college is a matter for the institute and a budget is allocated by my Department for the institute as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A budget in respect of the Dublin Institute of Technology has been approved in respect of 1993.  My Department has had recent discussions with the Dublin Institute of Technology regarding this budget.  The institute has indicated that it will have expenditure needs in excess of the budget provision.  My Department is examining the position within the parameters of the overall financial situation.  I would not accept that <Col N="576" /> there is gross underfunding and the institute has not put such a case to my Department.</P>
    <P>The question of the staffing of the Dublin Institute of Technology is also a matter for the institute subject to the agreed budgets and overall staffing levels.  The adequacy of the level of academic staffing in an Institute of Higher Education such as the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot be properly assessed on the basis of a simple teacher student ratio.  However an analysis of returns by the Dublin Institute of Technology to my Department with regard to teaching hours employed per annum per student in Kevin Street would not suggest that there is ground for concern.</P>
    <P>A report on the staffing structure of the Dublin Institute of Technology was recently commissioned from the IPA. This report recommends a significant strengthening of the administrative structure of the institute.  This report is currently being examined by the Dublin Institute of Technology and by my Department and it is hoped that additional administrative staff may be agreed in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, specifies in detail the various groupings which shall have representation in the Governing Body of each College and sets out the respective roles of the Minister and the relevant Vocational Education Committees in the appointment, recommendation and nomination of the representatives of the various groups mentioned in the Act.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware:</P>
      <P>&mdash;six ordinary members are nominated directly by the relevant Vocational Education Committees and recommended to the Minister for appointment.</P>
      <P>&mdash;five representatives are nominated by organisations (representative of industry, commerce, agriculture, the professions and other interests as appropriate to the activities of the College) which the vocational education committee consider require representation under 6 (4) (g) of the Act and these nominations are recommended to the Minister by the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
      <P>&mdash;one person is nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and recommended to the Minister by the Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>&mdash;in the first Governing Body, the Minister may appoint five ordinary members and these appointments have been three staff and two students in accordance with the spirit of Section 6 (4) (c), 6 (4) (d), and 6 (4) (e), of the Act.</P>
      <P>The appointments to Sligo Regional Technical College have been made in accordance with these procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> My Department has taken all possible steps, within the provisions of the Act, to ensure that appointments to the Governing Bodies fully comply with the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset the respective roles of the Minister and the vocational education committee's are clearly defined in the legislation.  The relevant Vocational Education Committees have the responsibility under the Act to ensure that they carry out the functions assigned to them in accordance with the spirit of the legislation, particularly in relation to the selection of the various organisations under section 6 (4) (g).</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be reviewing with my Department the overall position, in light of the experience gained to date, prior to making appointments to the new Governing Bodies of the Colleges at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I have to say, however, that one area which I am unhappy with is the level of representation of women on Governing Bodies generally.</P>
    <P>The legislation contains the very welcome provision that the Minister in making appointments shall have regard to the extent to which each gender is represented.  I am aware that my predecessor sought very hard to ensure an appropriate gender balance in the process of making appointments.  However I am not happy with the level of representation of women and this is a matter which I will be pursuing vigorously, in the context of the provisions in the Act, prior to making appointments to the new Governing Bodies at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat my written reply to a question from the Deputy on this issue on 23 March last.</P>
      <P>The preparation and approval of departmental estimates, including the provision for my Department's school capital programme, is a process which is initiated in mid-year and which continues until the publication of the Estimates for Public Services and the budget.  During the course of this process, spending plans are subjected to examination at various levels, up to and including Government, and to amendment and adjustment for a wide variety of reasons, including objective merits of proposals, perceived relative priorities, evolving needs, the overall financial position and budget strategies. Spending plans prepared in anticipation of the allocation eventually approved and confirmed must of necessity be, and be understood to be, provisional and subject to review and adjustment when the final allocation has been approved.</P>
      <P>I have already detailed in reply to Question No. 164 of 10 March 1993 the major projects scheduled to commence in 1993 within the 1993 allocation.  These projects were selected following a review which was carried out once the allocation for 1993 had been made at the end of February.  This review took account of the allocation available, the projects demanding inclusion in the programme within that allocation and the respective priority accorded to these projects.  The projects approved were those which had been proposed for inclusion for some time, subject to some adjustments due to changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 18, 29, 51, 76, 145 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>I have not received reports which would indicate an increase in levels of non-attendance or truancy among school pupils.  However, I regard the problem of truancy as a very serious one not only because of the educational disadvantage it results in for the child but also because it can be an important indicator of personal, familial or other social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the prepartory work for new <Col N="581" /> legislation in education a Departmental Working Group is currently reviewing the operation of the School Attendance Acts and will be making recommendations for the up-dating of the legislative provision in this area having consulted with the relevant interest groups.</P>
    <P>Available statistics indicate that poor school attendance is particularly prevalent in disadvantaged areas.  The Deputy will be aware that in order to help schools in such areas respond more effectively to the needs of their pupils I will be approving the appointment of an additional 80 teachers primary for schools serving disadvantaged areas for the 1993-94 school-year.  This will allow me bring an extra 50 schools into the disadvantaged scheme for the first time. Furthermore a number of schools already in the scheme which experience particularly severe problems including high levels of truancy will be allocated an additional teacher.</P>
    <P>School attendance is primarily the responsibility of pupils' parents or guardians.  If parents in the home can be assisted to participate in an active way in the educational process with their children it may be possible to minimise the disadvantages with which children have to cope within the school system and which can result in truancy.  The purpose of the home/school/community liaison scheme is to increase the mutual understanding of home and school and to help parents contribute to their children's education.  Currently the scheme is operating in 105 primary and post-primary schools designated as disadvantaged, using 61 teachers who have been assigned as home/school co-ordinators. In the next school year I will be extending the scheme to cover substantially more disadvantaged schools. The Government is committed to the development of a nationwide home/school liaison service.</P>

      <P>My reply to Question No. 164 of 10 March 1993 outlined the major projects to be funded in the 1993 budget allocation and scheduled to commence in 1993.  The Abbey Vocational School was not included in that list.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible to include financial provision for the extension in the Abbey School in the 1993 second-level programme because of other demands deemed to be a higher priority which had to take precedence.  It will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep records in the precise form required by the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Teachers and pupils need to be provided with a reasonable working and learning environment in good quality accommodation, taking account of issues such as the demands of a modern curriculum, the changing nature of teaching and learning resources and the need to adapt styles of pupil learning.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a perception that prefabricated buildings are not the ideal solution to accommodation needs.  This perception more often reflects experience of old and substandard prefabs than of the new modern equivalent.  However, prefabricated classrooms have played an essential role over the years in meeting the demand for additional places, often at short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that, despite the investment <Col N="583" /> over the years, much of which was needed to cater for increasing numbers, the condition of some schools could be improved.  Much of this accommodation is prefabricated accommodation which has reached or is nearing the end of its useful life.  My objective is to replace such accommodation with permanent accommodation where future requirements justify this.  The Programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing substandard school buildings.</P>
    <P>and the increases in this year's capital allocation must be seen as an initial step in fulfilling this commitment.</P>
    <P>However, there will still be a role for prefabricated buildings to meet urgent additional or short term needs.</P>

      <P>I indicated that I was prepared to examine proposals for such a scheme.</P>
      <P>I have directed that the issue of early retirement for teachers be fully examined by my Department.  Among the aspects of the issue to be considered are the costs of an early retirement scheme, its effects on job creation and how it would be dealt with under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement on pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>The teacher unions have been pressing for some years for the introduction of an early retirement scheme.

      <P>Negotiations on the issue of early retirement for teachers will have to take place within the forum of the teachers conciliation council.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 35, 42, 86 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the need for a comprehensive inservice education programme in the education sector having regard in particular to the age profile of the teaching force, the development of new syllabuses and structures, special provision for the disadvantaged and the increasing responsibilities of school management teams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> is committed to the provision of a comprehensive in-career training programme for second-level teachers.  The financial provision for inservice education was increased significantly under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Through the machinery of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, my Department is in constant consultation with the representative associations of school managers and teachers with a view to catering for what these bodies perceive <Col N="586" /> as their needs in the area of inservice. My Department is in contact also with Subject Associations and other interested agencies in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a general consensus that inservice education should be provided on a local or regional basis which can more appropriately respond to perceived local needs.  It is proposed also to utilise more fully the available local agencies such as Teacher Centres and the education departments of the universities.</P>
    <P>The programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to a devolution of education structures. This will involve the development of democratic intermediate structures for the management of first and second level education.  This proposal will be developed further in the White Paper on Education.  I envisaged that inservice education would be a suitable function for these authorities.</P>

    <P>The present Higher Education Grant and ESF Maintenance Grant schemes are confined to students in the third level sector.  I have no plans at this stage to extend grants towards maintenance costs <Col N="588" /> to students attending PLC courses.  To do so would involve full year costs of the order of £9 million at current levels of PLC provision.  In view of the fact that the large bulk of these courses are locally delivered, thus minimising costs to students, the enlargement of the number of PLC places would possibly represent a better use of any available resources, for the benefit of a larger number of students.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 59 and 90 together.  Information is not available on the number of schools damaged by vandalism or the cost of repairing such damage.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary, secondary and vocational schools the cost of repairing damage from vandalism is borne by the schools' insurance and my Department is usually not provided with details.  Community and comprehensive schools do not have commercial insurance and the repairs are funded by the Department. However, there are no specific figures available in respect of those schools for the costs arising directly from vandalism.</P>
      <P>Security of school buildings is a matter for the school authorities in the first instance.  As far as the Department is concerned, steps taken to combat vandalism include the installation of intruder alarms, provision of security lighting and perimeter fencing where the particular circumstances warrant such measures.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's concern actually relates to the level of support for Down's Syndrome children being provided by the visiting teacher service.</P>
      <P>The role of this service is to provide specialist back-up support to ordinary class teachers in addressing the needs of certain categories of children with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> While the service in question was originally focused solely on children with visual or hearing impairment, in 1992 an additional eight visiting teachers were added to the service as part of a development aimed at embracing other categories.</P>
    <P>The first such additional group to be addressed was Down's Syndrome children, where the initial focus was on those children specifically identified by the Down's Syndrome Association and for whom the association had previously been providing a service out of its own resources.</P>
    <P>Two of the additional visiting teacher posts referred to were allocated to the Dublin area to supplement the existing service in that area and to focus particularly on the needs of Down's Syndrome children in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that Down's Syndrome children newly entering primary schools in the Dublin area are being denied a service.</P>
    <P>All valid requests for a visiting teacher service for such children will be responded to as speedily and as effectively as possible, subject only to such limitations as may from time to time arise in relation to the case loads of the visiting teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>The general question of support services for children with special educational needs in ordinary schools is currently the subject of review by an expert committee established under my Department.  I want to avail of the advice of this committee, which is due to report fairly shortly, before making any further decisions about the support services which might be provided in ordinary schools.</P>

      <P>The third level student support schemes are currently under review as part of the process of preparing the 1993 schemes.  All relevant matters are being examined in this review.</P>
      <P>I am committed &mdash; within the constraints of Exchequer resources &mdash; to the elimination of inequities and anomalies from the schemes.</P>
      <P>In that regard I have set up an Expert Advisory Group on third level student support specifically</P>
      <P>(a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and</P>
      <P>(b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Group comprises:&mdash;<i>Chairperson:</i> Dr. Dónal de Buitleír, Head, Group Taxation, Allied Irish Banks, <i>Members:</i> Dr. Pat Clancy, Lecturer in Social Science, University College Dublin; Professor Damien Hannon, Economic and Social Research Institute; Sr. Teresa McCormack, <Col N="600" /> Director, Educational Office, Conference of Major Religious Superior; Mr. Seán Moriarty, Assistant Secretary, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; Professor Frances Ruane, Trinity College Dublin and Director, Foundation for Fiscal Studies; <i>Secretary:</i> Ms Michelle Shannon, Higher Executive Officer, Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In preparing its report the group is working closely with and drawing on the expertise of Department officials and has invited submissions from all interested parties.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the group took place on 28 April 1993 and meetings will take place fortnightly thereafter.  The group is due to report in July and I will publish this report.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The procedures for selecting schools for inclusion in the scheme are based on a range of socio-economic criteria agreed by a working party comprised of representative of my Department, the INTO and schools management.</P>
      <P>The factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the views of my Department's Inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present under this scheme, a total of 208 primary schools have the services of 225 additional ex-quota teaching posts. <Col N="601" /> The schools in question also receive supplementary capitation grants at the rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
    <P>As I have recently announced to the House, I am allocating an additional 80 ex-quota teaching posts to the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September 1993.  As part of this arrangement, an additional 50 schools will be newly included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>All national schools were recently circularised and invited to apply for inclusion in this allocation.  On the basis of information submitted, schools will be assessed and prioritised in order of need.</P>
    <P>The application submitted by the school mentioned by the Deputy will be given full consideration in this context.</P>
    <P>I should mention that this particular school has been included in the home/school/community liaison scheme operated by my Department and as such shares the services of a home/school/ community liaison co-ordinator with three other schools in the area.</P>
    <P>Following consideration in my Department of the particular needs of this school, supplementary capitation funding was also allocated to it in the current school year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are not excluded from receipt of national lottery funds this year.  The Department of the Environment has four lottery funded programmes which will receive £5.204 million and which will be channelled through local authorities.  It is true that local authorities have not received funding for a fresh &ldquo;Amenity Projects and Recreational Facilities&rdquo; scheme in either 1992 or 1993 (such funding as has been provided has been in respect of outstanding grant commitments).  Any other questions on these amenity grants would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, however I would make the general point that there are, inevitably, more demands on lottery resources each year than there are funds available and it is a matter for Government to decide on the allocation of scarce resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the distribution of funds in 1992 it should be explained that while the National Lottery Company generated a surplus of some £82 million in 1992 that the carryover of unspent funds from previous years, plus interest earned by the National Lottery Fund, enabled the Government to provide a total of £100.149 million for lottery funded programmes. Details of 1992 expenditure are set out in the volume &ldquo;Revised Estimates for Public Services&rdquo; copies of which are available in the Library. <Col N="610" /> Appendix I of the volume shows the national lottery funded expenditure programmes.  Information on individual grant recipients should be sought directly from the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present method of allocating lottery funds accords with the best principles of public accountability. Lottery funding is allocated to the various Departments by the Government as part of the annual Estimates process. It is subsequently voted on by the Dáil in the usual way and is later accounted for in the annual Appropriation Accounts. Once lottery funding has been allocated to the individual Departments, responsibility for the distribution of the funds rests with the spending Ministers concerned. Ministers decide upon the criteria for any lottery-funded grants schemes which they administer and may be questioned in this House on all these matters.  In the circumstances the Government previously decided that there would be no advantage to changing these arrangements.</P>

      <P>In 1991, Temple Bar was selected as a flagship project to mark Dublin's year as European City of Culture.  The special incentives available in Temple Bar were given on a once off basis to foster the renewal of what is recognised as a unique <Col N="611" /> and historic and cultural area.  There is no question of extending these incentives to other areas of the country.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that 126 acres of land in Cork are already designated for urban renewal.  Part of Shandon Street and Pope's Quay are included in the designated area and are eligible for the full range of urban renewal incentives available in the designated areas in general.</P>

      <P>This year's Social Welfare Act provides that students in full-time education will no longer be eligible to receive Unemployment Assistance except in circumstances and subject to such conditions and for such periods as may be prescribed in Regulations.  I propose to make Regulations which will exempt categories such as mature students and students participating in educational schemes for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>As I have already announced in the House, a new summer jobs scheme for students will be introduced this summer. The new scheme will cater for full-time students who cannot get summer jobs and who are no longer eligible to receive unemployment assistance during their summer holidays by virtue of this year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>New Regulations will provide for students living at home who cannot get work under the new summer jobs scheme and whose family is dependent on a social welfare payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public advertisements will shortly give further details of the scheme and invite applications from sponsors and students wishing to participate. <Col N="612" /> Essentially, the new scheme will operate for ten weeks during the period 1 July to 30 September 1993 and will allow students who would formerly have been eligible for unemployment assistance of at least £15 per week to earn up to £400 over the ten week period of the scheme. Voluntary organisations, community groups and public sector bodies with suitable work will be able to participate as sponsors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation 3904/92 provided 30 MECU (approximately IR£24 million) to assist zones and individuals affected by the completion of the Single Market. Allocations to each member state were based on the total EC estimate of 63,000 jobs being affected.  Ireland's indicative allocation is 520,000 ECUs (approximately £418,000) based on a projected figure of 1,116 jobs affected.  Eighty-five per cent of the fund will be allocated initially in respect of projects submitted by 31 March 1992.  The Commission will then allocate the remaining 15 per cent of the fund together with any unused funds where member states have not <Col N="614" /> availed of their 85 per cent allocation. Ireland's indicative allocation is 520,000 ECUs (approximately £418,000) and 85 per cent of this allocation will be allocated in the first instance to applications approved by the Commission.  The availability of funding in excess of our allocation will depend on the take-up of allocations by the other member states.</P>
    <P>The projects submitted to the Commission mainly involve re-training by firms of existing staff whose work disappeared with the advent of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of Regulation 3904/92 stipulates that the Commission shall adopt a decision on the applications for assistance, in principle no later than three months after their submission.  As the deadline for submission of applications was 31 March 1993 decisions on applications will be made before 30 June 1993.</P>
    <P>Applications submitted covered 183 staff affected by the Single Market.  There are no further projects in preparation.</P>
    <P>Assistance is provided under this Regulation to promote the conversion and/or restructuring of the weakened but viable enterprises and may concern:</P>
    <P>&mdash;management of the conversion or restructuring of the enterprises, in particular by market studies and research;</P>
    <P>&mdash;technology transfer, including the collection and dissemination of information, and innovations within the enterprises;</P>
    <P>&mdash;assistance in the creation or maintenance of long term employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;vocational training for employees of the enterprises and any measures to facilitate such training.</P>

      <P>Under EC Regulation No. 2079/92 member states may institute a Community aid scheme for early retirement from farming partly financed by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals I have made to the EC Commission in relation to the introduction of such a scheme in Ireland provide for: a pension scheme open to farmers between 55 and 66 years of age <Col N="623" /> who retire from farming and transfer their farms by gift, lease or sale to farmers who expand their own holdings, a rate of pension comprising a basic annaul payment of £3,515 plus an annual allowance of £219 per hectare subject to an overall maximum annual pension of £8,771 and payment of the pension for a maximum of ten years but in any event not beyond the retired farmer's 70th birthday.</P>
    <P>My proposals envisage a scheme which would apply to farmers who have practised farming for at least ten years immediately prior to giving up farming and who are farming an area of not less than five hectares of agricultural land. Farmers taking over the released land would have to meet certain age requirements and otherwise be suitably qualified. They would be required to expand their total farm areas by 10 per cent and by at least five hectares.  Transfer of land to persons or bodies for non-agricultural, forestry or ecological reserve creation would be permissible in certain limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that farming transferees would have up to two years to meet the necessary enlargement and educational-skills requirements.  This along with the fact that leasing of land is permissible should greatly alleviate difficulties in meeting the enlargement laid down by the EC.</P>
    <P>I am asking the EC Commission to show some flexibility in the case of farmers who retired from farming since July of last year and am hopeful that the EC Commission will be able to accept that such farmers, provided they meet the various criteria, will be eligible to apply for pensions under the scheme when it is ultimately agreed by the EC.  The scheme would also provide for pension payments to farm workers who lose their employment as a result of a farmer's early retirement.</P>
    <P>While I hope that the EC Commission will be able to go along with my proposals for the early retirement scheme, some of the provisions may have to be changed in the context of the normal consultative process between my Department and the <Col N="624" /> Commission.  I expect that the scheme will be in operation by late summer.</P>

      <P>Details of our exports to Russia are not available for the years 1987 to 1992.  Details are available for exports to the former Soviet Union and these are attached in tabular form.  The vast majority of exports would have been to Russia.</P>
      <P>In 1987, our exports to the USSR were £21.2 million while the provisional figure for exports to the former USSR &mdash; excluding the Baltic States &mdash; for 1992 is £112.8 million.  The year 1992 has seen a significant increase in food exports mainly as a result of the European Community's humanitarian aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1993, our marketing development strategy will be largely dictated by the realities of market conditions which are <Col N="626" /> of course, closely linked to the political situation.  The continuing economic crisis, coupled with the acute shortage of hard currency, militates against any short term revival in export opportunites.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála is researching &ldquo;niche&rdquo; oppprtunities for tradeable goods and will attempt to identify business prospects relevant to Ireland's supply capability with emerging Russian organisations who have hard currency availability.</P>
    <P>However, outside of the food sector, the main growth area for exports is in services.  Multi-lateral technical assistance programmes provide particular opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, in the medium to long term, there is significant potential in Russia for the sale of Irish goods and services.  I will be leading a trade mission to Moscow in the autumn in the order to further develop the potential of the market.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to a number of similar parliamentary questions on 27 April 1993 in which I affirmed my support for EC assistance for mobile assets.  I also outlined in detail the substantial amount of work and representations which I and other Government Ministers had undertaken in support of our application for assistance.</P>
      <P>I informed the House that the EC Commission had twice rejected our application. Despite these rejections, I indicated that I had recently discussed the matter with the EC Commissioners responsible for Transport, Competition and Regional Policy and that I had also written to the latter two Commissioners on the subject and was awaiting their response.</P>
      <P>I have since received a reply from the Regional Policy Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Millan, which indicates that there is no prospect of any change in the Commission's previously stated position.  The Commissioner has also confirmed in his letter that it is not true that the Commission has agreed to provide EC funding to a private operator in Greece for a service from Igoumenitsa to Trieste.</P>
      <P>The Government has mounted a sustained compaign at all levels to convince the European Commission of the need to take practical measures to offset the unique disadvantages caused by our island status and peripheral location.  Our case has been carefully formulated and, on the basis of the best professional advice, we are satisfied it is fully justified. We will accordingly continue to press for EC support in order to develop our external trade and tourism.  This approach is wholly consistent with the rationale which led to the Community's decision to establish the Cohesion Fund.</P>

      <P>The scheduling of out-patient appointments is a clinical decision for the consultant concerned.  Priority is given to urgent cases.

      <Col N="629" /> In relation to orthopaedic services in Cork, the Deputy will be interested to learn that approval was given to the Southern Health Board last year to provide for new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher. A project team has been established and the planning process is under way.  I am confident that this development will improve services for orthopaedic patients in Cork.</P>
    <P>With regard to waiting lists generally, the Deputy may know that one of the health priorities of this Government is to tackle long waiting times.</P>
    <P>In this context, £20 million will be provided in 1993 for a major action programme to reduce waiting lists where there are long waiting times for admission to hospital.  Reducing the waiting times for admission will have a positive effect on out-patient waiting lists.  My Department is at present in discussion with health agencies in this regard.  I will shortly be announcing my decisions in relation to the allocation of the £20 million.</P>

      <P>The potential health hazards of asbestos received wide publicity from the late seventies.  Since then, my Department has been prepared to respond favourably to applications from school managements for capital grants towards the cost of replacement.

      <P>Due to necessary end-of-year processing, which has to be completed before the first pay-issue of the 1993-94 <Col N="642" /> income tax year, the payroll files were closed from 2-8 April 1993.  The Deparment's offices were closed for the Easter break from 9-13 April, inclusive.  Of a total of approximately 1,000 claims received by 7 April, 708 were paid on Friday, 16 April, while the remainder were paid on Friday, 23 April, 1993.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, my Department has no alternative options available for earlier payment of the teachers concerned. It is expected, however, that a new computerised payroll system which was recently introduced for permanent and temporary teachers, will be implemented for substitute teachers in the coming months.  Under this system, the closing of files for end-of-year processing will not be necessary, so problems of this nature should not again arise.</P>

Together with my officials I am carefully examining these submissions. I do not intend to make statements on individual submissions but may make comments, as part of the consultation process, on particular issues should I feel that it would be suitable and appropriate.</P>
      <P>My objective, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, is to publish a White Paper by the end of 1993 and the White Paper will be the Government's response to the submissions.</P>

      <P>There are 252 remedial posts and 25 remedial-guidance posts allocated to post-primary schools on an ex-quota basis at present.</P>
      <P>My Department did not sanction any new ex-quota remedial posts in the years in question.  I am not in a position to say whether new appointments were made to existing posts in that period.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for allocating additional ex-quota remedial posts for the 1993-94 school year.  The Deputy is aware that many new posts have been created in the post-primary sector as a result of the implementation of the provision of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and it is open to the authorities of the schools concerned to appoint remedial teachers within quota if they so wish.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the day to day running costs of primary and secondary schools are funded by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources.  It is open to school authorities and parents to raise additional income for schools to supplement the State grants for the provision of equipment and for general running costs.  Contributions of this nature should be voluntary on the part of parents and there can be no question of a levy being imposed by the schools.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant for primary schools is not intended to meet the operating costs in full.  A local contribution equivalent to 25 per cent of the capitation grant must be lodged annually to each school bank account.  This contribution must be provided by the parish or other analogus community or body, and there should be no levy on parents of pupils attending the school.  In order to improve the level of support to primary schools I secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grants.  This will enable me to increase the standard rate of grant from £28 to £33 per pupils with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for certain other categories of school, and to initiate further measures to assist those who are most disadvantaged.  This is the largest single increase in the level of this grant.</P>
      <P>A study of recurrent costs, excluding teachers' pay, for first and second-level schools, is under way to identify a cost per pupil at primary and post-primary level.  The future financing of such schools will be reviewed in the light of the study's findings and available resources.</P>

      <P>As far as existing Community education programmes are concerned it is the policy of the Department of Education to facilitate the participation of the primary education sector in these programmes where the terms of the Council decision adopting the programme so allows.  It will maintain that policy in relation to any new programmes that may be developed under Article 126 of the draft Maastricht Treaty as soon as it is ratified.</P>

Proposals for developments in the education sector will form an integral part of that plan.  It would be premature for me to discuss specific proposals for interventions in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government identifies priorities in the field of education to be addressed during the period of the programme.  These key areas are matters of educational policy and are not contingent on the strategies to be adopted in the National Development Plan to ensure the long-term impact of the structural funds in the development of infrastructural and support services.</P>
