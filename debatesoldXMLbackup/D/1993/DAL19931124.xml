    <Title>Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993: Report and Final Stages (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 50b:</P>
    <P>In page 13, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;24. &mdash;In the case of Local Authority flat complexes where the evidence of tenants on the criminal or unruly behaviour of other tenants cannot be obtained due to intimidation or fear, the Court may take into account the word of a Garda, not below the rank of superintendent, that the tenant is behaving in a criminal or unruly manner, as evidence in any application <Col N="289" /> by a Local Authority for a court order to evict, or otherwise penalise, a local authority tenant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy G. Mitchell).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be Members who think it is wrong to differentiate between local authority and other flat complexes.  In the normal course of events I would agree with that argument.  Certainly I do not seek to discriminate merely for the purpose of discrimination, I seek to discriminate the legal provisions in a manner which would render them effective in dealing with a very real and serious problem, particularly in our capital city.  If one takes Dublin as an example &mdash; with which I am most familiar, although I am sure the problem obtains in most urban areas where local authority flat complexes are located &mdash; there are approximately 16,000 Dublin Corporation flats.  Of those approximately 1,000 are occupied by senior citizens.  By and large, the remainder are comprised of flat complexes of three or four storeys, most of them situated between the canals and in close proximity to each other.  Some of these flat complexes, built just before or after the Second World War are comprised of large numbers of flats, 300 or 400 being quite common.  If even one family behaves in an anti-social manner the whole flat complex is in chaos.  In my constituency, in Rathland Road, Dublin Corporation eventually had to knock down a perfectly sound flat complex, in a high demand local authority housing area, because two or three people terrorised all the good people who lived there, in the end most people simply wanted to get out.  That is not always the solution to the problem.  Unfortunately, very often the solution is that the residents, to some extent, take the law into their own hands, march collectively on disruptive tenants to gain peace for themselves and their children.  The problem is caused not merely by disruptive tenants but by tenants who openly sell drugs, bringing down a whole area; in parts of the country this would be equivalent to a <Col N="290" /> very large village in which 300 or 400 flats are located, bringing down the overall flat complex.</P>
      <P>In my constituency in the inner city there is a flat complex free of drug pushers because the residents, unable to gain assistance from State agencies, simply marched on these people, warning them to give up their drug pushing or leave. Eventually they put them out.  One or two people in that flat complex &mdash; othewise comprised of perfectly normal, decent, God-fearing people &mdash; were selling drugs to people who travelled from as far away as Dún Laoghaire by taxi to purchase them.  This meant that the old folk and the children of those tenants had to walk in and out through this flat complex, passing these people buying and selling drugs, injecting on stairways, throwing up and behaving in all sorts of undesirable ways, then leaving their needles lying around which could be picked up by young, vulnerable children.</P>
      <P>When the tenants complain to Dublin Corporation about this problem, incidentally often supported by the Garda, the Corporation warn the people involved but nothing happens and they continue their undesirable activities. Eventually Dublin Corporation, after a long process of serving notices while the complex deteriorates, with decent families wanting to get out and others offered accommodation there not accepting it, take the undesirable person to court. Then one comes up against a judge &mdash; I will not name him but I have one in mind &mdash; who seeks four independent witnesses to testify that they know what is going on in this flats complex.  Of course, tenants cannot give evidence because, if they do, they will be intimidated, beaten up, perhaps knee-capped, or even worse, their children will not be safe travelling to school or to the shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious problem.  I spoke to an official of Dublin Corporation the other day who asked me when the Legislature will do something about this problem. I told him I had an amendment tabled to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993.  I acknowledge that my amendment may not solve the problem <Col N="291" /> but certainly we need a remedy along these lines.  Informally I understand that the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin Metropolitan area, Mr. Curran, a very accessible, alert and positive-minded man, is endeavouring to deal with this problem by offering the courts Garda evidence, pointing out that the Garda were aware of previous complaints on the part of the said tenants.  However, he does not know whether that testimony will be accepted as evidence in court. This problem cannot be solved by the Garda or local authority; it is one for the courts who must be told that the evidence they seek is unrealistic in the circumstances and that they must do something because people are taking the law into their own hands.  A recent television programme illustrated the manner in which kangaroo courts are operated, people are marched before a committee and told that although they had been warned about their activities they had not ceased to engage in them and that they must leave the area.</P>
    <P>In the past I condemned people who were outside the law, but if the law does not provide protection for these people what are they to do?  Are they to allow their children to develop AIDS from picking up dirty needles?  Must they allow their senior citizens to be intimidated by people making large amounts of money pushing drugs, totally ignoring the law? In the same circumstances what would the Minister, I or anybody else do?  Of course, we would meet the residents and try to do something about the problem. I do not welcome this unhealthy development but, in all the circumstances, I cannot condemn it.  I do not want to see anybody take the law into their own hands.  I will not support violence in any shape or form but we need to provide a form of evidence which can be used, which in all the circumstances is reasonable, and can be accepted by the courts. A Garda superintendent is in an ideal position, being a responsible person, who will have the relevant information readily available, who will not be appearing in court on his behalf simply giving evidence <Col N="292" /> and the local authority will also be represented. They will have a record of having served notice on them and so on.  Somehow we must get around the business of the courts seeking four independent witnesses while all the time Dublin's inner city goes to rack and ruin because these drug pushers and other undesirables carry on to their heart's content.</P>
    <P>I must say this before concluding &mdash; which I acknowledge is something of a side swipe at some members of the Judiciary &mdash; I have a very high regard for the Judiciary who have a very difficult job to do, but they live in an unrealistic environment.  For example, very few of them live in or adjacent to these flat complexes about which I speak and would have have had no occasion to visit them.  Indeed not very many Members of this House live in or adjacent to those flat complexes but at least, as their public representatives, we have occasion to visit them regularly, to meet their tenants and discuss their problems.  Those of us who are also members of local authorities see the total frustration of Dublin Corporation housing officials who are not just laughed out of court but often abused because they merely seek to do their civic duty in defending the 99 per cent of decent, law abiding, God-fearing, tenants.</P>
    <P>It is only the other tiny percentage of people we need to be concerned about.  I have to accept that this amendment may not be the way to deal with it but an amendment of this kind needs to be incorporated to give the courts the power, where the due process has been gone through by the local authority with the support of the Garda superintendent, to get these people out legally before the whole things gets out of hand completely; and what better place for it than a Public Order Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to support what Deputy Mitchell has said.  The number of incidents that come to your notice, in your capacity as a public representative in urban constituencies, of disruptive behaviour, anti-social behaviour <Col N="293" /> at the lower end of the spectrum and extreme criminality at the upper end of the spectrum, which has the effect of destroying neighbourhoods for local authority tenants, is very significant.  The absence of any effective remedy is noteworthy. It requires that the Legislature looks at the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell correctly points out that very few people in a local authority estate or in a set of flats will come forward and individually point the finger at gangland bosses, drug pushers and men of violence living in their street.  On the other hand the Judiciary are faced with a situation that if they are asked to evict a tenant they can only do that on evidence. Obviously, I can offer no view on whether one, two, three or four are necessary.  I would take the view that evidence does not need to be corroborated by a number of people.  It is up to an individual judge to decide whether evidence is reliable.  If due to intimidation no evidence is available, a community has to suffer criminality in its midst and all the things about which Deputy Mitchell spoke so passionately and eloquently. Nothing can be done about it.</P>
      <P>If a house was being used for pushing drugs in a middle class neighbourhood something would be done about it.  The neighbours would either take civil action to stop it or in some way or another use their influence with the police to stop it; and it would stop.  Unfortunately, when you are at the lower end of the social pecking order in our society, there seem to be fewer remedies available, even though there is more need for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Mitchell has said is substantially correct and it cannot be gainsaid. I believe his proposed solution is along the right lines.  In evictions from local authority estates there should be a mechanism whereby some form of certificate or whatever or evidence from a superintendent in the area should be admissible without direct evidence on a hearsay basis to prove the substance of a complaint against an individual tenant.  It should not be the case that individual people should have to be brought before the court to point the finger at the drug <Col N="294" /> pusher or the gangland boss in their midst.  It should be possible to produce secondary evidence, albeit hearsay, by somebody whose integrity is beyond question, such as a local policeman of senior rank, to make that evidence admissible and to allow the court to rely on that evidence without seeking further evidence from ordinary Joe Soaps in order to remedy the problem.</P>
    <P>Although, as Deputy Mitchell said, this may not be the legislative venue for dealing with this issue, the Minister may rest assured that in terms of public peace and public order there is nothing as damaging to public order as the failure to remedy this particular problem by proper legal means.  There is nothing as corrosive of trust in the police, the courts and the Judiciary as the state of affairs which exists both in Deputy Mitchell's constituency and in my own constituency. Ordinary people find that the only remedy they have is to intimidate criminals out of their own estates by marches, by meetings and by taking the law into their own hands.  Like Deputy Mitchell, I absolutely condemn any form of vigilante activity of that kind.  As Deputy Mitchell points out, if the law does not provide a remedy, then when people's patience is finally exhausted, they will supply their own remedy.</P>
    <P>If people have a right to live in circumstances where drugs are not pushed in their midst and where they do not have violence and all the things Deputy Mitchell spoke so graphically about happening on their doorstep; and if they have a constitutional right, which I believe they have, to live away from those circumstances or to have the people causing those circumstances removed from their midst, there should be a means to give effect to it.  There is nothing as likely to provoke breaches of the peace, serious assaults, damage to property and, indeed, killings &mdash; as we have seen &mdash; than the absence of a proper remedy. The most significant contributory factor to a lot of violence in inner city Dublin is that ordinary decent law abiding people have no institutions and no mechanisms for protecting their rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> I fully endorse every single word spoken by Deputy Mitchell here.  I share his reservation that perhaps there is another way of doing it.  This Bill will not establish public order unless it is accompanied by some other mechanism to deal with the problems pointed out by Deputy Mitchell.  There will be more killings, assaults, knee-cappings and vigilante groups in our inner city unless we provide local authorities with a method of clearing up their own estates.  Vigilante justice is completely wrong and is completely reprehensible.  It is not justice. Nonetheless, in many circumstances it is the last available remedy to a community whom society is failing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take note of what Deputy Mitchell has said.  I realise the Minister comes from a constituency which has a large urban centre.  One has to be on the ground in Dublin listening to complaints to be aware of reality.  At the bonfire recently in my constituency there was a killing and there may well be an increase in this type of activity.  There are many other places in the south and north inner city of Dublin where all the neighbours know what is going on and effectively, can do nothing about it.  I would ask the Minister to do her best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell for drawing attention to this whole problem by way of this amendment which was tabled after the &ldquo;Tuesday File&rdquo; programme.  Like Deputy Mitchell and many Members of the House, I also watched that programme. Having seen it I arranged immediately for preliminary discussions to take place between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of the Environment. Both Deputy McDowell and Deputy Mitchell accept that the Department of the Environment has primary responsibility in regard to housing regulations and all that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment has primary responsibility because it deals with local authorities in urban and <Col N="296" /> rural areas.  I would be most familiar with the court practices in relation to evictions proceedings.  As both Deputies will be aware, such proceedings are civil rather than criminal in nature.  While the type of bad behaviour of tenants referred to by Deputy Gay Mitchell would generallay be in contravention of standards laid down in regulations under the housing acts and the terms of individual tenancy agreements, difficulties can arise in practice, in making available sufficient evidence to convince a court to evict tenants on these grounds.  It is understandable that the courts may feel obliged under the housing regulations and under the terms of individual tenancy agreements to hear evidence from other tenants that the behaviour of the particular tenant, whose eviction is sought, is unacceptable and has affected them but, equally, there are bound to be substantial difficulties in persuading other tenants to come forward with such evidence.  Clearly this problem needs to be addressed quickly.</P>
    <P>Whereas there is a large sprawling urban centre with quite a number of local authority houses and flat complexes in my constituency, I agree the problems with tenants' behaviour in this area would not be as great as those in Dublin. However, in Dublin I live at very close quarters to local authority flat complexes where there are a great many difficulties of the type referred to in &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo;. I am aware, from contacts with my immediate neighbours, of what they have to put up with even though I may be there only five days a week.  This problem must be addressed quickly.  Given that what is primarily at issue is the evidential requirements of civil law, I am not convinced that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is the best legislative vehicle to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are technical difficulties with the amendment &mdash; on which I do not wish to dwell &mdash; for example, there is a need to refer in some more legislatively precise way to the nature of the proceedings taken by the local authority and the powers under which those arise.  It might be possible to <Col N="297" /> improve the situation by way of amendment to the housing regulations, but other approaches would have to be considered also.  In the time available since the amendment was tabled, which was after the screening of the &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo; programme, it has not proved possible in discussions between officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment to reach any definite conclusion as to the best way to proceed.  I fully accept that the issue raised by Deputy Mitchell and supported by Deputy Michael McDowell needs urgent attention and that we cannot allow a situation such as that portrayed on the television programme where people decide to take the law into their own hands.  I accept that feelings in those areas are very strong and that people only take the law into their own hands when they feel there is no other way of sorting out the difficulties in their areas.  I do not condone vigilante groups and the type of simulated court room justice they dispense but I can understand the frustrations that drove ordinary decent people to it.</P>
    <P>Consultations are continuing between officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment and action will be taken quickly to deal with the problems outlined in this amendment by Deputies Mitchell and McDowell.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to pass on Deputy Mitchell's thanks to Assistant Commissioner Curran for his work in the Dublin metropolitan area.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, he has been working very closely recently with officials of Dublin Corporation to try to provide information on criminal behaviour and activity, particularly in relation to drugs, that would be of benefit to the corporation in the operation of its housing policy.  I think the message from the television programme is that tenants want a situation where the corporation may evict tenants involved in criminal behaviour, particularly in drug dealing or supplying drugs. Assistant Commissioner Curran is working with corporation officials in helping them to get the type of information local tenants are asking for when devising the <Col N="298" /> housing policy so that people involved in crime, relating to drugs or other activities, would not be allocated corporation housing in specific areas.  This is the way we have to approach the problem.  I appreciate the extent of the existing problem but I hope that Deputy Mitchell will accept that it is a civil rather than a criminal matter and that we need to come up with a solution in conjunction with the Department of the Environment.  I am not putting the issue on the long finger. In advance of the amendment being tabled my officials had commenced discussions with officials from the Department of the Environment and I have spoken to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, who also appreciates the urgency of addressing this problem.  I am very hopeful that between us we will shortly come up with the formula that will provide the solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, she will bring forward proposals to deal with this grave problem.  I did not see the &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo; programme but I know exactly what is happening on the ground and I understand that it illustrates the problem in the area I have in mind.</P>

    <P>It may well be a civil matter for Dublin Corporation to evict a tenant from a local authority flat, I am speaking specifically of flat complexes rather than houses, because people are living very near one another &mdash; and in parts of the inner city flat complexes are sited adjacent to each other &mdash; but if a tenant is evicted from one complex and moves to an adjoining one, the problem remains.  Whereas I realise that the eviction from a corporation flat of drug pushing or criminal local authority tenant is a civil matter, it is a matter of public order when God-fearing, law abiding neighbouring tenants who would not otherwise dream of being in a vigilante group are driven to marching on the offending tenants. That does not happen over-night but after a prolonged procedure.  I have great sympathy for the gardaí in this situation <Col N="299" /> but if they and the local authority are not able to deal effectively with these criminals who recklessly disregard the rights of others, particularly children and old people, the most vulnerable members of the community, the people will take the law into their own hands.  This is already happening.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is merely a civil matter, it is a matter of public order. What is at the heart of my amendment is that if this issue is not addressed we will end up with kangaroo courts passing judgment and the people will then be equipped to turf these criminals out when judgment has been passed.  Nobody wants that but should it happen the rule of law will have broken down.  Will the Minister amend this Bill in the Seanad on foot of the response from her colleague? It is a matter of public order, a matter of grave concern which affects many people in parts of the capital city and in other areas of the country.  This problem is encouraging law abiding citizens to look outside of the law for a solution.  I hope the Minister will consider this in the Seanad if it is not possible to include it today.  If it is not possible to do so in the Seanad I hope that before Christmas we will have amending legislation to deal with what is an extremely urgent matter.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's response I will not press this to a vote.  I am pleased that across the House there is an understanding of the objective I set out to achieve in this amendment.  I hope it will be achieved through some other vehicle in the near future.</P>

      <P>An amendment on Committee Stage in the name of Deputy Harney sought to delete the power of arrest without warrant in relation to disorderly behaviour.  I considered the matter fully, as I undertook to do on Committee Stage, and in the light of the relatively minor nature of the offence and the fact that under the section there would remain a power of arrest where a person refused to desist from disorderly behaviour when directed by a Garda under section 8, I brought forward an amendment which will delete the powers of arrest in relation to section 5 offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerly thank the Deputies present, and those who participated in the debate.  Probably more debating time in this House has been given to this Bill than has been given to any other in the recent history of the Department of Justice. That was appropriate because while people were calling for such a measure for a long time they wanted to ensure that it would not infringe on legitimate civil rights.  During the course of the Committee and Report Stages debate we have ironed out many of the difficulties and concerns and have addressed them by way of amendment or deletion of certain aspects of the Bill.  The Bill is stronger and better as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In thanking Members it would be remiss of me not to refer to the fact that at the outset of the debate on the Bill Deputy Mary Harney was the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on Justice. I congratulate Deputy Harney on her elevation to leadership of that party and wish her well in her task.  I congratulate and welcome Deputy O'Donnell as the new spokesperson for Justice without denigrating the tremendous role played by Deputy Michael McDowell when Deputies Harney and O'Donnell were not available.  I sincerely thank all Deputies, particularly the main Opposition <Col N="303" /> spokespersons including Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore, for their support and co-operation during the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another I could not address a number of issues raised on Report Stage and I have undertaken to look at them between now and the Seanad debate.  I will do that and if it is possible to amend the Bill further to strengthen it in the Seanad I am prepared to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The next Bill which the Minister might bring before the House should be entitled, The Sexual Discrimination Criminal Public Order Bill or something like that.  I found two faults with this Bill, it was too hard on law abiding citizens and not hard enough on the criminal.  I am still critical of the Bill which has weaknesses on both fronts. However, we have a much better Bill now than what was first brought before the House.  That is the role of the Legislature. We have examined the Bill, amended it, deleted some sections and added others.  The Minister has shown mature judgment in accepting many of the amendments, because a great deal of public concern exists in regard to public order.  Nevertheless, I am concerned that the use of insulting words or the displaying of offensive playcards will be a criminal offence and I tried to have the word &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; substituted.  Some sections of the Bill are unnecessary for normal law-abiding citizens.  I hope the Minister will take on board, in particular, the weakness in respect of public order in flat complexes which I outlined today and amend the Bill in the Seanad in that regard.</P>
      <P>As the Bill has been much improved, a number of amendments have been accepted and we have had a constructive debate on it, it would be futile to put the matter to a vote at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her kind remarks about the internal <Col N="304" /> arrangements in my party.  I am glad the ladies have made up their minds that I may be relieved of the function of night watchman on criminal matters.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a necessary measure because our laws had become outdated. The Dublin Police Act is no longer a proper means of preserving public order because, first, it is restricted to the Dublin area and, second, it is a Victorian statute. It is desirable that all our laws in relation to riots and public disorder should be codified and become modern workable law; and I hope this Bill fits that description.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters I would ask the Minister not to forget, in particular, the issue of public places and the marginal variation in that regard which she indicated she would consider before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would ask her also to consider the matter raised by Deputy O'Malley regarding people found in possession of criminal information and equipment designed for the purpose of committing serious offences.  It is unacceptable that the possession of preparatory documents or equipment for the purposes of committing a crime should continue to be a non-criminal offence.  It is unacceptable that the Garda will have no powers when they discover people in possession of balaclavas, false moustaches, plans of other people's houses, details of other people's movements and so on, even thought it may be well known that such people are planning a criminal offence. Such offences should not go unpunished. If the godfathers of crime are ever to be caught it is more likely they would be caught in possession of such information and equipment than taking the risk of being caught red-handed in commissioning the crimes they organise.  I recently say a programme on a cross-channel television station&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not talk about the Ard Fhéis, but I spoke to Deputy Lenihan about it when we were abroad <Col N="305" /> and public order issues did arise on that occasion, as far as I am aware.  I watched an interesting programme on a cross-channel station about the use of cameras for surveillance in public places.  That means of detecting crime is quickly gathering pace in Great Britain.  I am not sure who provides the funding for such equipment, but they are being installed in public places in many counties in England to discourage violence.  I accept that involves a great deal of expenditure, but I can think of nothing more likely to bring peace to our streets than for people to be aware that their unlawful actions, whether it is drug dealing, running away having committed a robbery or a mugging, can be recorded, occasionally under surveillance, and that the Garda could be directed to the place in question immediately.</P>
      <P>Some people might claim that the instalment of spy cameras in public places would be an intrusion on their civil liberties.  I do not see the logic in that, because if we had infinite resources a garda could be placed on every street corner recording mentally in his or her notebook the movements in the street in question.  In this technological age it makes no sense to require gardaí on the beat to be the only means of responding to criminal activity.  Such cameras were useful in the sad case of the Jamie Bulger trial, which is taking place in Great Britain at present.  If private institutions such as banks, building societies and shopping centres can use such equipment, the time has come for the public to move into the late 20th century in terms of its response to crime.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit and open-mindedness of the Minister in accepting amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that, as a backbencher on the Government side, I should make a brief comment at the conclusion of this Bill.  We have been waiting a long time for this legislation and Deputies from all sides conveyed that view unequivocally during the course of the debate.  I congratulate <Col N="306" /> the Minister on the introduction of this legislation, especially for the manner in which she brought it forward.  As is evident from the debate, the opinions of Members, including those on the Government side, differ in regard to various aspects of the Bill.  The Minister should be commended for her mature approach in seeking consensus on the legislation.  From the outset she pointed out that she wanted to adopt a consensus approach to tackling the problems of public disorder, and we all know the extent of those problems.  A milestone has been achieved in the passing of this legislation in that there has been a considerable degree of consensus in regard to it.  While Members from all sides had an input in that, the initial approach of the Minister and the marker she put down for us all enhanced that.</P>
      <P>The legislation will have a major impact in tackling problems of public disorder, particularly in urban areas.  While there are still some minor reservations on the part of Opposition spokespersons, in general the feeling is that what we have achieved here is important, will be effective and will enable our decent, ordinary law-abiding citizens to have peace and quiet and public order on our streets with no disturbance in their homes during the day or at night.  Again, I congratulate the Minister for her approach to all Stages of the Bill.</P>

    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, who took the Bill on Committee Stage, that a number of Deputies expressed <Col N="307" /> concern that authorised officers may be adequately qualified to perform the functions that they may be required to perform and that in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to specify qualifications or experience because in selecting the person or persons one would have to take into account the function to be performed.

      <P>As the Minister said, concern was expressed on Committee Stage at the fact that even though extensive powers were being given to authorised officers, it was not specified in the legislation what qualifications these officers should have.  It is only reasonable that we give some indication that an authorised officer should be properly qualified.  For this reason the Minister's amendment is reasonable in the sense that he is indicating clearly that the person selected by him will be suitably qualified to perform the task he or she will be asked to perform. I have therefore no objection to the suggestion that we amend the legislation to insert the words &ldquo;and who, in the opinion of the Minister, are suitably qualified&rdquo;.  This will strengthen the legislation and overcome the fears expressed on Committee Stage.  I presume that this legislation will remain in place for many years to come and that Minister will <Col N="308" /> come and go.  It is important therefore that we indicate clearly in legislation that an authorised officer who will be given extensive powers should be suitably qualified.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 29 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" />&ldquo;(4)(a)  The owner of a vessel in distress shall, subject to paragraph (b), be liable to pay to the Minister the expenses, including the expenses of hire or use of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft, of or incidental to any action taken by an authorised officer for the purposes of saving the vessel or the cargo or apparel of the vessel in pursuance of this Act and those expenses shall, without prejudice to any other remedy, be recoverable in the same manner as salvage is recoverable.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where the Minister considers it appropriate in exceptional circumstances, the Minister may waive the whole or any part of the liability of the owner of a vessel concerned to pay expenses to which paragraph (a) relates.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I have considered the representations made on the question of whether we should charge for rescue services.  While I am satisfied that in many instances charges could be justified, it would not be appropriate in some instances.  Arising from the consultations between myself and the Minister of State, I propose in this amendment to remove the reference to shipwrecked persons.  Accordingly, there will be no charge for rescuing people from a vessel in distress.  Again, this meets the views expressed on Committee Stage.  I consider, however, that there should be a charge when costs are incurred in saving a vessel, its cargo or apparel.  I further propose that in exceptional circumstances &mdash; for example, where personal hardship would be caused if a charge was to be imposed &mdash; such a charge may be waived.  This is reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I never understood the meaning of the word &ldquo;apparel&rdquo; in section 7 (4) (b).  I went to the trouble of finding out from my knowledgeable officials, who tell me that it includes items such as winches, ropes, anchors and other such equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has tabled this amendment to meet the suggestions made on Committee <Col N="310" /> Stage.  It is only reasonable that a person who has to be rescued at sea should not have to pay a charge.  It would be a sad day if they were asked to do so. However, it is reasonable to impose a charge where a vessel is involved.  While I appreciate that this is a difficult matter, given that we are dealing with ships under different flags from different parts of the world, we should consider the requirements imposed on the owner of a vehicle to have third party motor insurance.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in this legislation in regard to paying salvors and recovering expenses, but there is an assumption that the owners of vessels have the resources to pay the potential costs.  With the co-operation of the European Union, and other international organisations, it should be possible for us to insist that a certain minimum liability cover be carried by each vessel plying our seas, given the horrific liabilities that could be faced in the event of an accident.  Vessels plying the seas with no cover for liability often have minimum salvage value in the event of a serious accident and I do not see why we should not have a guarantee that all potential liability is insured as part and parcel of the authorisation to use the seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his views and I will certainly have them examined.  It seems appropriate that the laws of the sea should insist that minimum liability insurance cover be carried by vessels at sea.  I understand it may be necessary to have some form of liability insurance but I do not have the details to hand.  I will communicate to the Deputy any information I glean in regard to the matter.  I do not have a magic wand, but if the circumstances are as outlined by the Deputy I will take some action which, even if only begun during my Ministry, could be concluded by my successor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett and other Deputies referred to the removal of the reference to shipwrecked persons.  They said it should be enshrined in the Bill, and that is what has been done.  In the circumstances I recommend that the amendment be accepted as proposed.</P>

      <P>Because it is less confrontational, the new committee system facilitates the introduction of more amendments than the previous system.  That is one of its advantages.

      <P>This is a very sensible amendment.  Deputy Kavanagh raised this matter.  Also, I was aware that the RNLI was concerned that their special position was not recognised in this legislation. In view of the excellent voluntary work it does.  I am delighted to have the opportunity of singling it out for special mention and to recognise its unique position and the marvellous work it does. Recognising it in this legislation is one way of expressing our deep appreciation of it special role not alone here but in other parts of the world.  It is with great pleasure that we accept this amendment and pay a special tribute to the RNLI.</P>

      <P>I move amenmdent No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where any damage is sustained by any person or any cargo or articles of a vessel the owner or occupier of the land to which this section applies shall not be held liable for any such damage.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage to highlight an ongoing problem for occupiers and owners of land because of their responsibilities relating to people crossing their land.  Special provision is made in this legislation relating to persons crossing land in certain circumstances. This is acceptable.  It is highly desirable that there should be the power to pass over adjoining lands when helping vessels in distress, but it is unreasonable that the owners of such lands should be liable in the event of such persons being injured while passing over the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time the laws in respect of occupiers of lands were changed.  My party published a Private Members' Bill covering the wider issue and, unfortunately, the Bill was voted down on the basis that Government legislation would be introduced.  That Bill was published on 27 April last, seven months ago, and we have not heard anything since.  An acceptance of the spirit of my amendment would at least be a beginning by the Government to recognise that it is unreasonable to expect farmers and owners of land to carry liability in respect of injuries suffered by persons crossing <Col N="313" /> their lands for the purpose of helping vessels in distress.  If that spirit was extended to other areas of our law I am sure the tourist industry could be helped, particularly in the case of people passing over land &mdash; for example, members of gun clubs, hunters, anglers and so on. The Minister in his professional capacity as barrister would have encountered this problem on many occasions.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that persons passing over land &mdash; in many cases without the authority of the owner &mdash; could sue the owner or the occupier of such land in respect of injuries suffered when the landowner or occupier might not be responsible.  In this legislation the Minister has begun the process of accepting that it is unreasonable to expect the landowner or occupier to carry a liability in respect of people who may cross their lands to assist vessels in distress.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister had some difficulty with the wording of my amendment. I read the amendment he tabled in lieu of my amendment and I do not object to the proposed changes which were made to ensure that liability will lie with any owner or occupier who maliciously damages property or cargo rescued from a vessel in distress.  I consider that is reasonable.  I would hope such a position would not arise, but all eventualities must be covered when introducing new legislation. I thank the Minister for accepting the spirit of my amendment.  I hope his colleagues in Government will follow his example and introduce new legislation to deal with this ongoing problem for occupiers and owners of land in respect of liability for persons passing over their land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned about the points raised by Deputy Barrett. Rural people are concerned about their liability in respect of people passing over lands &mdash; farmland, landowners' property of local authority lands.  Legislation is urgently needed to address this problem.  Insurance companies have pressed landowners to increase their public liability cover, which is very expensive.  The Minister has given some <Col N="314" /> guarantee in this regard in respect of damage caused in the case of salvaging vessels on the shoreline.  Legislation in other areas should be introduced to cover owners or occupiers' liability in the near future.  During the debate on the Private Members Bill on owners and occupiers' liability introduced by Fine Gael, I pointed out that visitors to my part of the country were stopped from entering an archaeological site.  This matter must be addressed urgently.  Legislation has been promised in this regard and I hope it will be introduced shortly.</P>
      <P>There is a deep fear among landowners that they may be held responsible for any damage caused in salvage operations.  It would be difficult to track down the owners of vessels registered in South America and other distant places.  The Minister is aware that there are wrecks off the south coastline.  The owners of a vessel have not been traced in respect of an incident that took place 15 to 20 years ago.  I would be concerned that the landowners be covered in salvage operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Barrett for tabling his amendment.  Effectively, his amendment proposes changing not only the law but an attitude to a problem which continues to confound both legislators and landowners.  This might be called the principle of the thin edge of the wedge.  Landowners are entitled to certainty as far as the legitimate crossing of their land is concerned. As a walker in the Sneem area of Kerry I never encountered any difficulty getting permission to walk the hills and hillocks in that beautiful part of the country.  The landowners are generous in allowing people who have no entitlement, leave or licence to walk over their lands.  Access to their lands is gained through their goodwill and there has never been any difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett is right in saying that the law should cover this area, and I am sure it will be addressed by the Government and the Minister responsible in due course.  There should be certainty in the law in respect of the landowner.  It is traditional here that people can walk the <Col N="315" /> length and breadth of their land without let or hindrance.  I understand people's concern in respect of their liability in regard to others crossing their land. Deputy Barrett's amendment has begun a process which will give hope to landowners, but it relates only to this Merchant Shipping Bill.  Hopefully, it will be the start of a process which will not stop until the whole problem is solved.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Bill in this regard is only part of the solution.  I accept the spirit and the intention of Deputy Barrett's amendment, with the exception that the amendment I tabled includes the word &ldquo;malicious&rdquo;.  Our courageous colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, promised to consider the question of the liability of owners or occupiers of lands used during a rescue operation.  The proposed amendment exempts such persons from liability for personal injuries and for damage to vessels or cargo except where the owner or occupier or other agents are responsible for malicious injuries or damage.  That is the only <i>caveat</i> to the amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett.  I am not taking in any way from the credit due to Deputy Barrett for proposing his amendment, but my amendment adds that rider. Deputy Barrett has said he will accept the spirit and intention of my amendment.  It is unlikely that owners of land will engage in any type of malicious interference with anything or anybody in the pursuit of the intention enshrined in this section. Nevertheless, there is a vague possibility that it may arise and those words are included in the amendment to cut off that possibility.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputies Barrett and Clohessy for the views they have expressed.  To give credit where it is due, this will be known as the Barrett amendment.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on finalising this Bill which deals with all aspects of salvage and wreck and updates legislation in this regard.  At the outset I wish to be associated with the remarks of goodwill to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  I wish him a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will consider a matter I raised on Committee Stage, that is, what happened following the collision of the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> in Dublin Bay on 21 November 1992.  As I stated on Committee Stage, corrosive organic acid, labelled as furniture on the ship's manifest, was washed up on Dollymount Strand and other parts of Dublin Bay.  It has been stated that an antiquated manual listing system is used by Irish freight companies.  Perhaps this work should be done by computer.  It has also been stated that up to 40 per cent of cargo could be mislisted.  This matter arises under section 11 of the Bill.  I understand that proposals are continually under consideration by the European Union Council and Commission to prevent mislisting, which can be dangerous to the citizens of this country.  In his ongoing review of maritime matters perhaps the Minister <Col N="317" /> will give serious consideration to that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendments tabled on Committee Stage and for coming back on Report Stage with suitable wordings to improve the legislation.  This is probably not the most exciting legislation that ever passed through this House but it is important, particularly for those involved in disasters at sea, and I hope it will improve matters in that regard.  It will also help to clear our coastlines of wrecks which have caused damage to the environment over a number of years.  It places liability on owners of vessels to remove wrecks or pay for the cost of their removal.  All those provisions are to be welcomed.  I know that only certain areas are affected by wrecks but they cause great annoyance.  I hope that the provisions of this legislation will be used effectively to get rid of wrecks lying off our coastlines.  The legislation will also help to deal with the ongoing problems on our seas.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey said the last day, we are dealing with possible new disasters in the context of the type of cargo and goods being carried on board ships.  The laws of the sea are much too lax and legislation needs to be updated to deal with possible disasters.  I am aware that as a small country we cannot change the world but we can use our influence as members of the European Union in any forum in which we participate to improve the position on our seas, increase safety and help protect the environment.  Legislation such as this provides an opportunity to have a reasonable debate on what is happening on our seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, I have one concern in this area and that relates to the increasing numbers travelling on board our ferries, which are a necessary part of our whole transport network. Considering the large number of vehicles and roll-on roll-off lorries carried on board our ferries, legislation should be consistently updated to ensure maximum safety and impose new measures to render that mode of transport safer.  It is <Col N="318" /> only when a disaster occurs that people panic and inquiries are set up.  At present very large vessels carry goods, vehicles and passengers and while this legislation is not the proper measure with which to deal with this matter, the Minister should urgently consider existing legislation with a view to improving and updating it so that we can anticipate possible dangers and prevent disasters.  I ask the Minister to consider such legislation and, if necessary, to come back to the House with new legislation to deal with ongoing advances in terms of the carriage of goods, vehicles and persons on our seas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Haughey's point regarding the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i> He spoke about dangerous goods and I am glad to be able to tell him that an EC Directive on carriage of dangerous or polluting goods which addresses the problem of inaccuracy of ships' manifests will shortly come into effect.  Deputy Haughey was quite right to raise the matter because it is an important point. It is well taken and I would like to think that the problem will be corrected in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned ferry safety.  Much was made of that point during Second Stage and in the select committee.  Regulations for operation and construction of ferries are regularly reviewed and updated under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I wish to inform the House that an organisation has been set up to look after the interests of ferry users.  The officials in my Department are aware of the necessity to ensure at all times that ferries travelling from Ireland to Britain or France are safe.  Ferries were involved in accidents in the past and I hope any future accidents will be kept to a minimum.  I would not like it to go out from this House &mdash; I know that Deputy Barrett will agree with me &mdash; that in some ways ferries can be a danger to people travelling on the high seas.  This is far from the truth.  I accept that any ferry disaster is one too many, but ferries are one of the safest means of travel.  It is <Col N="319" /> only fair to make that point having regard to the number of people who depend on ferries for their livelihoods.  Generally speaking, ferries are a safe means of transport but there are exceptions to the rule and my Department and I keep a very close eye on their operation.  As I said, regulations governing the operation and construction of ferries are constantly reviewed and updated to take account of modern technology which is advancing at a very quick pace.  I will take on board Deputy Barrett's point; it is a matter about which I am aware.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make an important contribution to the procedures for dealing with maritime casualties.  It proposes an orderly system for handling the three main phases of a casualty at sea &mdash; vessels in distress, salvage operations and, where necessary, the removal or rendering harmless of ensuing wrecks.  The Bill will strengthen the role of the Irish Marine Emergency Service and the Marine Survey Office which have been greatly upgraded in recent years.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that this is not the type of Bill about which one becomes overemotional or which will make the headlines but it is a fundamentally important Bill in the sense that it will update much of the existing law in this area and bring it into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Commercial salvage operations are often high risk affairs which need careful regulation if the right balance is to be struck between the interests of the State, ship owners, salvors and the environment. The Bill, by giving effect to the international convention on salvage, will strike the balance we all seek to achieve. In particular, important new provisions which will require the interests of coastal communities and the environment to be taken into account during salvage operations represent a new departure in Irish maritime law.  It was pointed out during the debate that the present situation in regard to the disposal of wrecks is unsatisfactory. The Bill will place responsibility on owners for the removal or rendering harmless of wrecks and will give public authorities a new role in <Col N="320" /> ensuring that the owners of wrecks live up to their responsibilities.  Wrecks of historical interest are also dealt with in the Bill and the Director of the National Museum will have the right of first refusal to any unclaimed wreck around our coast.  This improvement will be in the national interest and will secure our heritage in the context of the wrecks which will be taken into the charge of the Director of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies showed a particular interest in the section which will enable the Minister to make regulations governing the burial of human remains at sea.  As I said on Second Stage, burial at sea is not usual but nevertheless it happens.  Therefore, it is important that such burials be regulated on health and safety grounds.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  A number of important amendments have been incorporated in the Bill as a result of the helpful suggestions put forward by Deputy Barrett, Deputy Clohessy, Deputy Kavanagh and other.  Land owners whose lands might be used during a rescue operation have been given a statutory assurance &mdash; this relates to the spirit of Deputy Barrett's amendment &mdash; that they will not incur liability for personal injuries or damage during a rescue operation.  This is as it should be.  As Deputy Barrett pointed out, this addresses the important topical question of land owners' rights.  This may be the beginning of a process which will protect the legitimate rights of land owners, rights which they are entitled to have protected.</P>
    <P>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which undertakes sterling work on a voluntary basis, sought to be exempt from the provision requiring ships to render assistance to vessels in distress. This exemption has been incorporated in the Bill.  I am grateful to Deputies for their kind remarks about the Royal National Lifeboat Institution which does such magnificent work.  I am confident that that organisation's long tradition of saving lives will continue and that its excellent working relationship with the <Col N="321" /> rescue services of the Department of the Marine and the lifeboat crews will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I should not like to overlook the marvellous search and rescue work done by the Air Corps and Naval Service.  These organisations provide an exceptional service.  The Department of the Marine and the Department of Defence are very much inter-linked with these organisations and I would be failing in my duty if I did not express my deep gratitude to the members of these organisations for the courage displayed by them in rescuing people at sea in the most appalling circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  I assure the House that the provisions of the Bill will be enforced to the fullest extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to join other Deputies in expressing my good wishes to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  He is a very pleasant person &mdash; probably one of the most pleasant Members of the House &mdash; and I wish him good health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1993 is to provide a special scheme of social insurance for share fishermen.  This is an area of particular interest to many Deputies and I am pleased to bring forward legislation which will address the special difficulties faced by share fishermen.  In keeping with our approach of using gender neutral language whenever possible, share fishermen are referred to in the Bill as people engaged in share fishing.  The Bill also provides for regulatory powers under which specified employers and contractors may be required to keep a register <Col N="322" /> of employees and subcontractors engaged by them.</P>
    <P>In the past, share fishermen were regarded as employees for social insurance purposes and as such were insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  Their insurability status changed however following certain court decisions.  Arising from a case brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Collector-General in 1986, known as the McLoughlin case, the High Court held that the skipper of a particular fishing vessel and his crew should not be regarded as employer and employees for PAYE purposes.  While this decision did not directly affect the insurability status of share fishermen, it did necessitate an amendment to the regulations regarding the collection of PRSI contributions from share fishermen. They were no longer covered by the PAYE system.  The new social welfare provisions introduced in 1988 deemed the owner, bailee or lessee, as appropriate, to be the &ldquo;employer&rdquo; of the &ldquo;crew&rdquo; for PRSI purposes.  It was in this way that the Minister for Social Welfare at the time tried to keep the people engaged in share fishing within the system so that they would be eligible for the benefits which they obviously needed.</P>
    <P>The social welfare provisions were subsequently challenged in 1992 in the Griffiths case.  Arising from this, the High Court found the regulations to be <i>ultra vires</i> and held that a person could only be deemed to be an employer where an employer/employee relationship existed. As a consequence of this decision, share fishermen could no longer be regarded as employees for social insurance purposes in the absence of a contract of service. They then became insured as self-employed people and as such are covered for widow's and orphan's and old age contributory pensions.  They no longer have cover for unemployment or illness.</P>
    <P>Following on the decision of the High Court, I met with representatives of the Irish Fisherman's Organisation, IFO, and the Killybegs Fisherman's Organisation, KFO, to discuss their concerns regarding the absence of cover for short <Col N="323" /> term benefits.  Share fishermen are in a unique position in so far as social insurance is concerned.  Prior to the court decision in 1992, they were always insured as employees and thereby entitled to the full range of social insurance payments.  Through no fault of their own, and without any changes in the way in which their work is organised, they ceased to be so insured.  The harsh nature of Irish weather conditions for fishing and local tie up arrangements and quotas leave share fishermen open to enforced periods of unemployment at certain times of the year.  The difficult conditions under which they work also expose them to increased risks of illness. In this Bill, I am proposing to provide share fishermen with this vital cover.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill provides for the new scheme.  People whose principal means of livelhood is derived from share fishing will have the option of paying additional special contributions if they have income of at least £2,500 per year.  Share fishermen who opt into the new scheme will pay special contributions.  These contributions will amount to 5 per cent of their income in the previous income tax year.  Contributions will be payable up to the PRSI earnings ceiling currently set at £20,000 per year.  A minimum annual contribution of £250 will apply.  For these contributions, share fishermen will get disability benefit for up to 12 months in any continuous period of illness and unemployment benefit for up to 13 weeks in any one year.</P>
    <P>The new optional contributions will be payable from the income tax year commencing 6 April 1994.  Those who opt into the new scheme will become entitled to benefit form January 1996.  The contributions payable will be collected directly by my Department.</P>
    <P>This special scheme of social insurance for share fishermen is an important development in the provision of comprehensive social insurance cover.  There are about 2,000 people engaged in share fishing.  The new scheme will allow them opt for social insurance protection for <Col N="324" /> themselves and their families during periods of illness and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for regulatory powers under which specified employers and contractors may be required to keep, at a specified place, a register of all employees and subcontractors engaged by them.  These records will be available for inspection by social welfare inspectors. This measure will strengthen further my Department's hand in combating fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>The question of fraud and abuse in social welfare has been the subject of recent media attention.  I want to emphasise that the vast majority of social welfare recipients are genuinely entitled to the payments which they receive.  I would like to take this opportunity to outline for Deputies the wide variety of measures aimed at combating fraud and abuse currently being pursued by my Department.</P>
    <P>We allocate significant resources each year to the social welfare area, £3.7 billion in the current year.  These resources must be managed effectively in the taxpayers' interest.  I have taken, and will continue to take, a serious view of people who defraud or abuse the system, whether they are claiming payments to which they are not entitled or whether they fail to pay PRSI contributions which they are required to pay.  The measures which I have introduced over the past nember of years, and particularly since 1991, are very effective.</P>
    <P>The detection of fraud and abuse is an integral part of the work of my Department. All officers involved in the processing and payment of social welfare entitlements have a function which involves the prevention and detection of abuse of the schemes and the elimination of fraud.  Some 13 per cent of the staff of the Department or 530 officers are now involved specifically on combating fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming.  This staff investment is more than justified.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1991 approximately 2,500 to 3,000 employer inspections were carried out each year.  Since 1991, 40,000 such investigations, representing about one third of all employers, have been undertaken. Overall, the increased inspection <Col N="325" /> activity has a positive effect and will be continued with planned inspections of at least 10,000 employers taking place each year in future.</P>
    <P>These inspections comprise a mixture of comprehensive inspections of employer records and visits where the employers are made aware of their responsibilities with regard to the social welfare and tax laws.  In addition, inspectors also ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming a social welfare payment.  This global approach to investigations is proving to be very effective.  The best place to detect working and claiming is at the work place and this is borne out by the experience of my officials working on the ground.</P>
    <P>The regulatory powers provided for in section 11 will be used initially to require employers in the construction industry to keep records of employees and people engaged by them under a contract for service, contractors, sub-contractors and their staff.  The records in question will have to be kept in the site office and be available for inspection by social welfare inspectors.  The need to target the construction industry is evidenced by the results achieved so far by the special anti-fraud unit which I set up last year.  So far, this unit has inspected more than 550 building sites in the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare areas and its activities have already saved the taxpayer around £2.5 million.  The unit identified 600 people drawing social welfare payments illegally as well as detecting irregularities in PRSI payments.  Those found illegally drawing payments are now facing the prospect of prosecution in the courts and those convicted can expect to receive severe penalties including jail sentences.  In two recent cases, jail sentences of two years and ten months respectively were imposed.  Two new squads in Dublin and one in Cork have now been set up as a result of the success of this initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department is also pursuing employers in the construction and other industries to ensure that proper employment records are being kept for all employees and that proper notification is being made of new employees and sub-contractors. <Col N="326" /> In many cases people who defraud the system are being helped, sometimes unknowingly, by employers who fail to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply renders employers liable to prosecution and to repay any social welfare payment drawn illegally by their employees.  For example, in a recent case an employee who was in receipt of unemployment assistance was discovered working on a site in North County Dublin.  The employer failed to notify my Department that the person had taken up employment with him and as a result, has been surcharged with the amount of unemployment assistance illegally claimed by the employee, some £200 per week.</P>
    <P>The regulatory powers I am providing in section 11 of the Bill will complement the existing provisions under which employers and other people in the construction, forestry, security, road haulage and certain other industries are required to notify my Department of new employees and subcontractors engaged by them.  This year alone almost 13,500 such notifications have been made to my Department.</P>
    <P>These measures have been widely welcomed by legitimate employers anxious to ensure fair competition within industries so that unscrupulous employers will not be able to undercut their competitors and cheat the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Other special units have been operating in my Department with great success. These include the special investigation unit which works with the Revenue Commissioners.  External control units operate to ensure that those receiving payments from the Department are legitimate recipients.</P>
    <P>The various control activities undertaken by my Department have saved the taxpayer some £84 million in 1992.  This year it is likely to be of the order of £100 million.  The total saved since these control initiatives began in 1991 will be well over £200 million by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of social insurance, Deputies will be aware of the recent public debate about the level of employers' PRSI contributions and their <Col N="327" /> possible negative impact on jobs in labour-intensive manufacturing industry. I met representatives of the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation recently who argued that lowering the rate of contribution would help firms trying to maintain and increase their employment levels.  This is an issue I plan to address in the immediate future in the context of the report of a working group under the chairmanship of my Department.</P>
    <P>Irish employers already pay rates of PRSI contribution which are low by international standards.  A further problem for some sectors is lower wages and labour costs in the United Kingdom, our nearest competitor.  The rate of employers' PRSI in the UK is related to wages.  Wages under £140 a week attract an employer contribution of 6.6 per cent or lower.  In Ireland the standard rate of employer PRSI is 12.20 per cent of earnings.  While there is no upper ceiling in the United Kingdom system, unlike here where PRSI stops at £21,300, the lower rate of PRSI available gives United Kingdom competitors a significant advantage in the cost of their production. Any restructuring of rates which reduces the income of the Social Insurance Fund will have to be assessed in the light of the need to maintain the value of benefits paid out of the fund.  If a restructuring of employers' PRSI can make a useful contribution in the fight against unemployment, I will move quickly and positively to introduce whatever changes are needed.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have extended to April 1994 the closing date for recruitment of new employees under the employers' PRSI exemption scheme I introduced earlier this year.  This scheme has been made more flexible in order to encourage a greater up-take and, unlike previous schemes, operates for a two year rather than a one year period.  To date almost 3,400 employees have been approved under this scheme and a further 400 applications are being processed at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to make known to the House that I will be introducing a technical amendment to the Pensions Act during the Committee Stage of the Bill. <Col N="328" /> The purpose of the amendment is to confirm that the selection of trustees requires a majority of members of the scheme who actually vote rather than a majority of the members of the scheme.  There has been some confusion about this issue.  To make it absolutely clear, I should say that I shall be introducing an amendment demonstrating clearly that the majority relates to a majority of the members present and voting.  There are other conditions governing the numbers of members who should be present.</P>
    <P>The regulations I made in July last to enable members of pension schemes to elect their own trustees become effective on 1 January next.  The regulations provide that members of the country's 31,000 occupational pension schemes will be able to choose their trustees to represent them.  There are almost 500,000 members of occupational pension schemes.  I provided a substantial lead-in time for this development to give employers, trustees, pension schemes and trade unions ample time to prepare and train people to become member trustees.  I made the regulations early purposely so that everybody involved would have time to consider the implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The importance of having member trustees cannot be understated when one considers that there are up to one million people, including dependants and pensioners, who have a direct interest in the wellbeing of pension schemes.  The investment of moneys here at home to create jobs in excess of £10 billion &mdash; it has risen considerably in the past year, I believe, towards £12 billion &mdash; began from my discussions with the chairman of the Pension Funds' Association. The House will realise that it is quite feasible; in fact, as Members may have noticed, they have come forward themselves with proposals to invest of the order of £15 million initially and to consider further investment in indigenous projects and efforts in order to contribute <Col N="329" /> specifically to the creation and maintenance of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no problem at all in doing so.  The House will realise readily that there are different degrees of risks within pension funds, especially in circumstances in which younger people contribute, when there is a long period within which to recover.  We are in a very strong position in that we have a high proportion of young people contributing to our pension funds.  In any event, the wisdom of the pension funds managers has been applied to this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under the regulations it will be mandatory for all schemes with 50 members or more, and directly-invested schemes with 12 members or more, to have member trustees if at least 15 per cent of the members, or the members' trade union, request the appointment of member trustees. The selection of member trustees provides further safeguards for members of pension schemes whose assets are worth, I believe some £13 billion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will be introducing amendments to entitle volunteer development workers to the full rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit on their return to Ireland.  I know this is an amendment which Members <Col N="330" /> will welcome.  This provision will apply in the case of development workers who would otherwise qualify for reduced rate benefits.  Under existing arrangements a person must have earnings of not less than £70 per week in the governing contribution year to qualify for the full rate of payment.  Reduced rates of benefit related to the level of earnings are payable to people whose income is below £70 per week.</P>
    <P>Volunteer development workers receive credited contributions while working overseas which enable them to qualify for unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  They only qualify for the minimum rate of payment because of their modest earnings in the relevant year.</P>
    <P>There is already a range of special provisions under which volunteer development workers who are paid at &ldquo;local&rdquo; rates of pay in the developing countries receive preferential treatment under our social welfare code.  For example, over the years we have introduced various measures to be of assistance to them on returning here.  They are exempt from liability for social insurance contributions while abroad and are awarded credited contributions for a period of absence up to five years; they are exempt from the employment condition for entitlement to maternity benefit; and can qualify for treatment benefits with a minimum number of contributions.</P>
    <P>According to APSO, the Agency for Personal Services Overseas, there are some 400 Irish volunteers abroad at present.  These workers do tremendous work in developing countries and as we have unfortunately seen in recent times, often at great personal risk.</P>
    <P>The present improvements in the rates of unemployment benefit and disability is further evidence of the Government's commitment, in our Programme for a Partnership Government, to safeguard the social welfare rights of volunteer development workers.</P>
    <P>Last week, I made the commencement order to bring the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, into force.  This is a major achievement which ensures that <Col N="331" /> legal provisions which benefit such a large proportion of the population are readily accessible.  During Committee Stage of the Consolidation Bill, I undertook to publish a guide to the provisions contained in the Bill.  This guide has now been published and has also been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am delighted with the very positive reaction it has received.  Social welfare law should be readily understood and this guide describes the provisions of the Consolidation Act in a simple and straightforward way.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the new Consolidation Act, my Department commenced work on consolidating the various regulations made under the Act. Deputies may recall that I undertook during the passage of the Consolidation Bill to bring forward during the current session a consolidated regulation covering all of the social assistance schemes administered by my Department.  I am pleased to be able to advise the House that this new regulation will be made within the next few days.</P>
    <P>In conclusion this is the third Social Welfare Bill which I have introduced this year.  It provides vital cover in the event of illness or unemployment for share fishermen and provides a remedy for the special problems for the fishing community which arose from a High Court decision last year; tough new regulatory powers to tackle abuse of PRSI and social welfare in certain sectors including the building and construction industry; enhanced entitlement to disability and unemployment benefits for volunteer development workers on their return from abroad, and consolidates the rights of members of the country's 31,000 occupational pension schemes in relation to selecting trustees to represent their views.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a further major development in the provision of social welfare services.  It safeguards particularly vulnerable groups of workers and ensures their access to social protection.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I classify the Bill as a Trojan horse for many measures not included in the original Bill published last week. Members did not have an opportunity to consider the full implications of the provisions of the Bill due to insufficient time.  My party will be allowing the Bill through on Second Stage but we will subject it to close scrutiny and table amendments on Committee Stage.  We also await the Minister's amendments to which he referred earlier.</P>
      <P>This issue has been raising its head for many years.  I read speeches by my colleague, Deputy Doyle going back to 1990 when she was a member of the Seanad.  This is a grey area.  The uncertainty in which share fishermen found themselves arose from the McLoughlin judgment in 1986 and a subsequent judgment in 1992.  The judgment in 1986 resulted in uncertainty for share fishermen in that they found it difficult to establish their entitlements and to meet the scrutiny of the means test for unemployment assistance.  By the time they had satisfied the officials concerned they were back at sea.  It took eight, ten and sometimes 12 weeks to complete the scrutiny of their application.  Because of the nature of their work they were back at sea and working again before their claims were adjudicated upon.</P>
      <P>There is enormous distrust between share fishermen and social welfare inspectors despite the fact that these fishermen wanted to regularise their position over many years.  Due to the uncertainty they could not get medical cards or take out mortgages.  This had an enormous social effect on the people concerned as well as their families.  Down through the years Deputy Doyle has pleaded with the Minister to take the necessary steps to eliminate the confusion. They are not self-employed in the same sense as shopkeepers and small business people because they have no control over their employment.  They are employed at the whim of skippers and the weather; in other words they do not have control over their own destiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill introduces a new insurance contribution class to ensure that if they <Col N="333" /> pay at the rate specified in the Bill they will be covered for 13 weeks on shore through bad weather.  In times of sickness they will be covered for up to 12 months.  Therefore, this Bill will bring some order to a chaotic situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the first step in the right direction.  I am glad the pressure from this side of the House to regularise the situation is now being brought to fruition. It has taken a long time to bring this Bill before the House and, as I indicated, my party will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Share fishermen have been ineligible for social welfare benefit or assistance of any kind because of the uncertainty of their position.  At times they are deprived of supplementary welfare allowances from health boards.  Along the coast of Wexford, west Cork and Donegal there are dozens of hungry families going without the essentials of life.  That is the reality.  There are families trying to keep their children at school, they do not have medical cards and are finding it almost impossible to look after the needs of their families, some of whom are again facing a very bleak Christmas.  Up to now their view was that the Government had abandoned them.</P>
    <P>The court decision in the case of the Minister for Social Welfare <i>v.</i> John Griffiths was delivered on 14 February 1992.  In this case a dispute arose when Mr. Griffith was the owner of a fishing vessel called <i>Sovereign Dawn.</i> A man called Eugene Pepper fished with the accused from some time after Christmas 1989 until June 1990.  I will not delay the House with the details of the case but the court judgment had major implications for fishermen.  Many fishermen found themselves in very difficult situations. They had hoped that the Government, and in particular the Ministers for the Marine, Finance and Social Welfare, would work towards regularising their situation.  That has not happened yet.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be given a qualified welcome. It was produced and presented to the House at short notice.  However, there is a high degree of confusion as to whether share fishermen are compulsorily <Col N="334" /> insurable as employees for social welfare proposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced new measures to combat social welfare fraud. On this issue, the Minister must ensure that sensitivity is shown to the thousands of people in receipt of social welfare payments, to those who are unemployed, ill or incapacitated through no fault of their own.  We have reached the dangerous point where all of these unfortunate people are being tarred with the same brush.  They feel they are being made the scapegoat for the failure of economic and fiscal policies.</P>
    <P>I have read Mr. Maurice Doyle's recent remarks, but I can see he is attempting to focus national attention on vital issues, and one of the issues highlighted was the question of social welfare fraud.  However, there is now a perception that everybody dependent on social welfare is under suspicion.  Let me put on record that 50 per cent of the rise in unemployment in recent years has been as a direct result of domestic policies and only 30 per cent of that figure has arisen because of external factors.  Some of the recent comments have come from a quarter that has cost this country hundreds of millions of pounds because of the decisions that were made during the devaluation fiasco.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to introduce controls in the area of social welfare. A recent report indicates that up to 8 per cent of GNP is being produced by the black economy.  I cannot say whether that is true, neither can the Minister nor the Minister of State, but we must come to grips with fraud.  In certain areas highly organised operators and employers conspire to defraud the system; but there is a difference between that and the man or woman who is trying to support a spouse and family on just over £100 per week who may go down the road to do a job for a few hours for which he or she gets an extra few shillings.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to condemn the individual on social welfare who tries to earn a bit of extra money for Christmas.  Some of those who are commenting on social welfare are totally out of touch with the <Col N="335" /> reality in our cities and towns.  Children are going to school hungry and but for the commitment and generosity of teachers in primary schools they would be studying day in, day out on an empty stomach.  My most horrific experience as a public representative was three years ago when a young man and his three year old daughter came to one of my clinics just before Christmas to plead for financial help.  Two days later he had taken his own life because of the pressures of not having money to provide for his children at Christmas.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of life at present.  I have to restrain myself when I hear some people, over the whiff of cigars and champagne, commenting on issues that they really do not understand.  I am not referring in particular to Mr. Doyle's comments, because I believe he has a broader agenda; but I suggest that people be sensitive when commenting on those who have no control over their destiny and are dependent on the State.</P>
    <P>We will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage but we await with interest some of the additional issues which were not covered in the Bill but which the Minister has raised here this morning.  I will delay further comment until I see the details of the additional provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which provides for the introduction of an optional social insurance scheme for those engaged in share fishing.  People whose principal source of livelihood is derived from share fishing will have the option of paying additional special contributions which will provide insurance for disability and unemployment benefits. This Bill also includes a provision <Col N="336" /> on the keeping of records by employers and contractors.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have always argued that the system of social insurance should be as comprehensive as possible.  My party believes no group should be left outside the system.  We hold the view that the system of social insurance is an expression of social solidarity and citizenship in which the risks and costs should be spread as widely as possible in the community.  Positive aspects of the social insurance system should be stressed.  Social insurance contributions create a sense of entitlement to benefits and also generate public support for these benefits.  This is a very important principle.  Furthermore, there is a strong link between the number of contributions made and entitlement to benefits. The number of contributions paid and the period over which they are paid should relate to one's entitlement to benefit. Where finances permit we should provide the maximum level of benefit to those who pay social welfare contributions. That would make contributions to social welfare more acceptable.  There would also be less antagonism to the payment of social insurance contributions, which are very necessary to finance the various schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative to the concept of social insurance is to do away with all social welfare benefits as an entitlement and to means test all payments.  That would be a retrograde step and a return to the days of the Poor Law support. However, I believe we should examine the possibility of allowing those in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefit to continue to pay social insurance contributions while in receipt of benefit. Under all types of insurance the beneficiary must continue to pay the premium. I do not understand why there should be any difference for those in receipt of disability, unemployment and unemployment benefits and contributory old age pension under the social insurance scheme.  The system is funded on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; approach.  If everyone was expected to pay contributions <Col N="337" /> even through times of unemployment or sickness it would do away with the credited contributions network which confuses so many people and it would remove the fear of many people as to what will happen to them when their credited contributions have exhausted. People fear means-testing when they do not understand it.  My suggestion would remove the fear of the means-testing.  My party has always acknowledged that we should give the best protection we can afford to those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>At present a staggering £3,000 million is needed to fund social welfare benefits. The taxpayer cannot be asked to pay continuously increasing contributions. We must try to broaden the base so that more people will make contributions, otherwise as benefits are exhausted people will end up drawing means-tested payments from the State without having to make any worthwhile contribution.</P>
    <P>I am worried about contribution conditions having been altered to reduce the level of benefit payable.  There has been a reduction in the length of time for which one can receive certain benefits, giving rise to charges about the dirty dozen social welfare cutbacks.  While I do not agree with the comments made about the dirty dozen, tinkering with the contribution traditions and reducing benefits makes it less wothwhile for people to contribute with the result that they try to dodge these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have also been alterations to the maternity benefit scheme and the same entitlements as before are not available under the treatment benefit scheme.  We should pay the maximum benefits where we can afford to, in order to keep the principle of social insurance alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 13 different classifications of social insurance contributions have not been <Col N="338" /> addressed in this Bill.  The fact that there are 13 different classifications contributes to a cumbersome, time consuming crazy system.  One would want to be an expert to disentangle the various contribution rates and conditions attached to them. These classifications could be reduced to three, thus simplifying the system.  Contribution conditions have been established to preserve a fair balance between the contributor and the beneficiary but the contribution records should be sufficient to establish eligibility for benefit and there should be a difference between short term and long term payments.  If the unemployed and the sick had to make contributions to continue in benefit in the same way that they pay health insurance, these benefits could be extended because there is very little difference between the standard rate of benefit and the standard rate of assistance.</P>
    <P>I would welcome that approach because it enhances the position of those who are long term unemployed and those dependent on social welfare assistance schemes although it has a negative effect on the contributors.  If everybody who is unemployed was given the opportunity to pay back some small contribution all these differences would disappear.</P>
    <P>Share fishermen now constitute part of the self employed category and make up 18 to 20 per cent of the labour force.  I cannot understand why such self employed people are being given the opportunity to opt into a new scheme subject to such conditions as may be specified in the regulations and why they are not covered by the provisions for the self employed people.  My understanding is that share fisherman could claim the supplementary welfare allowance if they could not go to sea or if the fishing catch was not profitable and that even if they could go to sea for a limited number of hours they could fall into the category of part-time employees.  They should not be denied benefits.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill with some reservations. Further provision should be made in regard to widows contributory pensions, old age contributory pensions, maternity benefit and deserted wives' <Col N="339" /> benefit &mdash; I will refer to those on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to the conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit.  In relation to share fishermen the definition as to what constitutes work is open to abuse.  I am not happy with section 8 (c).</P>
    <P>Section 46 of the Principal Act refers to the duration of eligibility for unemployment benefit and under this Act benefit can be paid for up to 156 days.  I regret that the Minister is amending that section in regard to share fishermen and reducing entitlement to benefit to 78 days, half of what was intended for other workers in section 46.  We should give the widest range of benefits to encourage the maximum number of people to participate in the social insurance fund.  This is not the way to do it and I will refer to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part 3 refers to the maintenance of proper records and I wholeheartedly support that amendment to the Principal Act.  Accurate records should be kept of all persons employed whether the employment relates to a service contract or not and these records should be available for inspection by departmental officials.  Such records will help in controlling fraud.  I recognise that in any system opportunites exist for fraud and that measures are necessary to control this especially where public funds are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is great concern at the extent of perceived or real fraud in the social welfare system and prosecutions are few and far between.  The staff in the investigation units is not adequate to police the large number of people currently in receipt of social welfare payments.  I would support any measures to improve the situation and, where possible, eliminate fraud.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the provisions of the Bill and will be looking closely at some of them on Committee Stage.</P>

We have improved the throughput of legislation through committees, but we now need to improve the throughput of the printing of legislation so that Deputies have sufficient time to consider legislation before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In general I welcome the Bill, although I am somewhat concerned that the Minister proposes to introduce amendments on Committee Stage relating to other areas of the social welfare code.  I do not know what my attitude will be to those amendments, although the Minister stated he is introducing them to improve the rights of pensioners receiving occupational pensions and the rights of development workers.  I have no doubt that it is the Minister's intention, but it is somewhat unusual that he should introduce such matters on the Committee Stage of a Bill which is not specifically designated to cover such matters.  That is an example of my earlier point in regard to having adequate time to consider amendments.  In general legislation that is rushed through the House does not measure up to what is required in the long term.</P>

As he stated, share fishermen and women do not have a job in the normal sense and the relationship between skippers of boats and members of the crew has been contentious for some time, and not merely because of the court cases that took place since 1986.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is regularising the matter and ensuring that such crew members are covered for disability and unemployment benefit.

A charter of rights has been drawn up for artists and the question of cover for unemployment and disability is one of the matters dealt with in that charter.

Will the Minister indicate if he is considering <Col N="342" /> introducing an amendment to cover such people particularly artists?</P>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback by the Minister's statement that cover will not apply until 1996.  That is a long time to wait for cover.  The Minister indicated that there are only 2,000 people involved and I assume a number of those have some PRSI cover.  Does he intend to take account of contributions already paid when assessing people's eligibility for cover, or is the 1996 deadline absolute, regardless of previous contribution records?</P>
      <P>The Minister is also dealing with the question of social welfare fraud and I would not defend anybody who defrauds the system.  People who take money out of the system in that way deprive others of income they badly need.  However, the concentration of officials of the Department and others, such as the Governor of the Central Bank, on those who fraudulently receive social welfare benefits to the exclusion of those who assist them in receiving such benefits is mistaken.  I am sure the Minister could give us more details in that regard, but the fact the Department discovered that 600 people on 550 building sites in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow were claiming social welfare benefit indicates that a significant number of employers facilitate such breaches of the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate what action is being taken against the employers concerned? He indicated that action was being taken against the 600 employees found in breach of the social welfare code.  How many employers were involved?  The Minister referred to 550 building sites, but builders may own more than one site and, therefore, there may not be as many employers involved.  Will the Minister inform the House also if any of the builders were engaged in public contracts?  Given the large number of sites, some public contracts must have been involved.  Is the Minister taking any steps to tighten up the allocation of contracts to companies found in breach of the social welfare code in that way?  It is impossible to stamp out people operating <Col N="343" /> in that black area if employers co-operate with them.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister is introducing a new form of register and initiating it specifically in relation to building contractors.  Nevertheless, I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate the steps being taken to pursue the employers who faciliated those 600 people found drawing social welfare benefit in breach of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that as a result of the detection of the 600 people concerned £2.5 million has been saved by the taxpayer.  I ask him to go into this matter in more detail.  Does this represent a potential saving in the sense that having discovered that these people were defrauding the system it was brought to an end and that as a result an estimated £2.5 million has been saved?  Is it the case that £2.5 million has been collected from the 600 people concerned or has any of the money defrauded in this way been recovered?  Furthermore have any of the employers been surcharged?  It is important to know how this sum of £2.5 million has been saved.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this question is that the Minister and I have been at loggerheads over a period of time on the question of the savings which he claims are being made in detecting fraud, abuse and unwarranted claims.  Specifically, during the summer the Minister indicated that he expected £200 million to be taken in under the amnesty which was due to end either at the end of September or October.  In any event the Minister indicated emphatically that £200 million would be saved as a result.  In his speech today he indicated that this sum represents the savings made since 1991, not July of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents the savings made since the latter half of 1991, in 1992 and 1993, not since the summer when the social welfare amnesty was announced.  I disputed the fact that it <Col N="344" /> would be possible to claw back £200 million under that amnesty.  It is my recollection that under the earlier social welfare amnesty approximately £800,000 was clawed back from social welfare recipients while only six employers were caught or volunteered information that they were abusing the system.  Therefore, on this evidence it did not appear possible to claim that £200 million would be raised within such a short time.  It is important to know from where this £2.5 million comes so that the newspapers tomorrow can have real headlines about this saving, whether we have it, it is something we hope to have or simply a figment of the imagination.</P>
      <P>It is easy for those in receipt of substantial incomes to say it is deplorable that people work in the black economy. There is no doubt that this is wrong and we have to try to reduce it as much as possible but the sad fact is that, despite the Minister's claims that significant improvements have been made for those on social welfare, all social welfare payments are below the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare four or five years ago.  For a single person they recommended a sum of £65 at current values and suggested that with this sum one could hope to keep body and soul together but not have a high standard of living.  Having regard to the fact that social welfare payments are so low, particularly for those who were earning a relatively good wage, there is an inbuilt incentive for those who have a mortgage and schoolgoing children to earn extra money on top of their social welfare payments, if the opportunity arises.  As I said, they would not have such an opportunity were it not for the fact that some unscrupulous employers choose to make it available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question of whether basic criteria should be applied in regard to the wages an employer may pay.  It seems that a strong case could be made in favour of a minimum wage, in certain areas employers should be obliged to pay wages which do not fall below a certain level.  This should be a key element in any attack on poverty traps.  The Minister <Col N="345" /> should, therefore, consider the possibility of introducing a minimum wage as a means of overcoming these traps.  In many instances, given the wages offered by some employers and the losses that would be incurred when one takes into account differential rent, medical card and so on &mdash; it is not that people do not want to work &mdash; it is impossible for them to take a job because they and their families would be worse off.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.  As a Deputy who represents a marine constituency, I am aware of the difficulties we have had to deal with and the implications of the two court cases, one in 1986 and the other in 1992.  This Bill will be of help to those who have reached an impasse.

That still remains the position.  The date will be confirmed simultaneously in Dublin and London closer to the time of the meeting.</P>

The fact that these arms were being sent to the Loyalist paramilitaries is, if nothing else, an indication of the even more dangerous situation developing there.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave the standard reply in regard to the date for the meeting. Does he not accept that there is confusion in the public mind and that he should clear it up?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see the person involved in the leaking of the document traced and fired.  The last question I want to put to the Taoiseach arises from the speech by the Unionist Leader, Mr. Jim Molyneaux, in the House of Commons yesterday when he spoke about the anxiety of the people he represents and the need to stabilise a dangerously volatile situation in Northern Ireland.  Can the Taoiseach, by word or deed, indicate how he might reasure the Unionists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I congratulate the British Security Forces on intercepting such a large and deadly consignment of arms which clearly would have been used to kill and maim innocent people.  It is a sign of the full co-operation that exists between the security forces in both jurisdictions in intercepting arms wherever they come from and whatever community they are consigned to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the date for the Summit between the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major and myself, it is not unusual for a date not to be mentioned; it is the practice. Let there be no confusion.  I expect this Summit to take place as early as possible in December, but I recognise that at that time diaries are under some pressure.  The British budget will be dealt with during the next week and will not be finalised until the subsequent Monday at which, probably, a vote will be taken. Then the European Summit looms.  I assure the House that there is nothing sinister about the fact that a date has not been mentioned.  Undoubtedly we will <Col N="348" /> reach agreement on a date and on an agenda.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statement by Mr. Jim Molyneaux in the House of Commons, the Government's proposals and the peace initiative are grounded on two important principles, agreement and consent. Consequently I cannot accept that there should be any fear or suspicion of the initiative for peace.  Last Thursday about two million people from every walk of life stood in silence at 1 o'clock in support of a peace initiative.  That must be a powerful mandate for all political leaders and it is incumbent on all political leaders to reflect on that widespread support and respond to it.  Unionist fears in this regard are groundless because the peace proposals of the Irish Government have been signalled as not predetermining the future, not prejudicing the outcome of any future talks.  It is what we have said it is, a movement for peace. Who can be afraid of peace?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubts about the Taoiseach's good intentions. Would he not agree that the biggest enemy of peace is fear and misunderstanding of the intentions of others and that therefore his meeting with Mr. John Major to make decisions should be preceded by face-to-face discussions between his Government and the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland and between the parties representing the two communities in Northern Ireland so that people do not have to rely on media reports, leaked or otherwise, to discern other people's true intentions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Invitations have been extended to Unionist politicians in the North and, so far, they have not responded to them.  The Tánaiste and I, either of us or together, would prefer to sit down across the table from Unionist leaders and respond to any fears or suspicions they may have about hidden agendas, etc.  We have not been given that opportunity.  In the absence of that, I and the Tánaiste have taken every possible step to convey the information we have available to people we meet from <Col N="349" /> different walks of life.  In recent weeks I have had meetings with community leaders, with churchmen and Church leaders in relation to this peace initiative.  I will continue to have such meetings.  I have availed of every avenue of communication that has been opened up.  The Irish Government has made every effort to convince the people in the North that their fears are unfounded, that the peace initiative is what it says it is.  We are asking for peace, that people stop killing people.  I cannot understand how anybody could be against that when there are no conditions attached to it.  I appeal to anybody who can help in the communication of that message to do so.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy O'Keeffe has said, the leaking of such a document was not help and has done nothing but stoke up fears and suspicions.  That document has nothing to do with the peace initiative. It is a working document that was being prepared by officials with a view to a future talks process which is separate from what we are trying to do now, that is, stop the killing of people and let the talks process take its course.</P>

      <P>As a political leader in this House who has met members of the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance in recent times, I can assure the Taoiseach that there is as willingness on the part of those three parties to come together.  Unfortunately, there appears to be a gap which they are unable to bridge by face-to-face discussions.  I hope the Taoiseach will persist in his efforts to have face-to-face discussions with the Unionists because I think both sides will find they have more in common than they realise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it is dangerous to set conditions for achieving peace?  That has been done already and that is why the Unionist community are so frightened. Will the Taoiseach accept that violence is not some virus; if the paramilitaries wish they can stop the violence and give us peace and the choice is theirs?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the leaking of the document which raised fears in Northern Ireland was not done by established civil servants who have served this country loyally for many years and over whom a cloud now hangs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea &mdash; I wish I had &mdash; who leaked the document.  The investigation into the leaking of that document is continuing and I do not intend to comment on it except to say that it raised sicions and fears.  That is what we are earing from Unionist politicians during the past four to five days.  There was a different mood within that community up to recent days.  The leaking of that document has contributed to the uncertainty and the fears that exist within that community.  I wish to take this opportunity to say to them that their fears are groundless in relation to the peace initiative.  We are not asking them to make any commitments in regard to the future.  We are setting out a proposal for the stopping of killing in the North of Ireland which is universally supported throughout these islands.  The leaking of that document has, unfortunately, that undesired effect and anyone who can help assuage the fears in that regard should do so.  I know the House is united on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until such time as the Unionists decide to talk to us I must rely on community leadership and so on to get the message through.  I do not believe that to fall back on the talks process, as some suggest, would alone constitute an adequate response to the yearning for peace that exists in both parts of this island and throughout Britain.  I believe that the mood for peace exists.  The crying out for peace exists and we should all fall in in full support behind it and not try to raise <Col N="351" /> unnecessary fears in a community that has nothing to fear from the peace initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was unnecessary to urge Members of this House to support peace. It is on the record that all Members support peace.  It is difficult to understand the distinction the Taoiseach makes between a peace process and a talks process and how one cannot have any effect on the other.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Summit will proceed in December or at some future date once both Governments have reached a position where they can make decisions in regard to political progress in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never said that one would not have an effect on the other.  I have always said &mdash; I believe this to be true &mdash; that if we had a permanent cessation of violence it would vastly improve and in fact transform the environment in which peace talks and political talks aimed at a political settlement could take place.  That has always been my strongly held view.  The difference is that two processes are being pursued at present.  One is an initiative to get a cessation of violence &mdash; to get the paramilitaries on both sides to stop killing people.  The other process, which is a much longer drawn out one, is being carried through by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Mr. Ancram, Mr. Chilcot and others.  Having bilateral meetings with the various political leaders, the Anglo-Irish Conference and the talks that continue behind the scencs seek to achieve a level of consensus within the parties that will enable them to come back to the table to talk about a long term political settlement, distinctly separate from trying to get an immediate cessation of violence by the paramilitaries on both sides.  That is what I have said time and again.  The British Prime Minister has made that call on a number of occasions. We want the men of violence to turn their backs on violence and to turn back to the conference table.  We have said that as <Col N="352" /> soon as there is a permanent cessation of violence there will be a seat at the conference table for everybody to make their input and debate what the future of Ireland should be, what future there is for every community, accepting the diversity of culture, tradition and political views. That is the only way forward and that is the way we wish to see it proceed.</P>

When there was some doubt as to an invitation issued earlier by the Tánaiste, the Tánaiste repeated that invitation.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind as to where we stand in relation to meetings which may be held at any time and in any place on a peace initiative.  The longer-term talks process is a separate operation and we will make any gestures that are required in that regard.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and other Members who paid tribute to the intelligence services in Britain, Poland and, in all probability, in Northern Ireland.  I shudder to think what use could have been made of the two tonnes of explosives, not necessarily in Northern Ireland, but elsewhere on the island.  Do the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste appreciate the damage that was caused by the irresponsible and deliberate revelation of that document?  Can we have an assurance that if the person who leaked the document is caught that his or her head will roll?  I draw the Taoiseach's attention to what is happening not only in Northern Ireland but in Britain.  The phrase, play the Orange card, has not yet been used but some people are coming dangerously <Col N="353" /> close to it and also to the concept of &ldquo;an acceptable level of violence&rdquo;.  I remind the Taoiseach, and ask him to remind the British Prime Minister, how much damage those two concepts have caused in the past.  No matter what is happening this is a time for steadiness on the part of the Government and the Government acting as a unit.  While there are dangers in all ways forward, the greatest risk is delaying.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Currie's last sentiment, the last thing I said to the British Prime Minister is that I believe time is not on our side.  The more time deliberations take the greater the risk of different obstacles being put in our way such as that which happened in the past few days and could happen any day.  Regarding the question of steadiness and unanimity, I assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is totally <i>ad idem</i> in its approach to try to stop the killing in Northern Ireland.  We rely on community leaders to join with us in trying to remove any suspicions or fears that may exist in people's minds in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to assure everybody that the Irish Government, in putting forward our proposals &mdash; and they are our proposals &mdash; for a cessation of violence, takes into consideration the fears and suspicions that may be there.  We also make sure that at all times we accept our obligations under international agreements.  For the benefit of Unionists, what that means is that there has to be consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to any change in the status of Northern Ireland. I do not know what fears and suspicions exist other than in relation to that matter. I have given an assurance in this regard on a number of occasions, as has the British Prime Minister.  Fears are groundless. We should proceed with our proposals and finalise them as soon as possible.</P>

Does the Taoiseach believe that in the talks process no party should have a veto and that the talks should continue with or without participation of all parties?  Orange cards and vetoes should not be played at this stage.</P>

Are they for the response of the British Government or of the IRA or Loyalist paramilitaries? Will the Taoiseach indicate what are these proposals other than a requirement that the IRA or Sinn Féin will not be involved in talks unless they call a ceasefire, or is that the only condition involved?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that appeals for peace have been going on for 25 years and that the fear being engendered relates to the secrecy surrounding the conditions that may apply to peace?  The arms cache found by the British security forces gives good cause for fear.  It is not a question of people being afraid of peace but rather that the price paid for peace may result in a much deeper and wider conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial economic and social progress has been achieved under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The achievements over the period 1987-90 under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have been sustained under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, despite the unfavourable economic environment. Our economy has continued to grow with GDP growth averaging about 3.5 per cent per annum, which is well in excess of the growth rates in the EC or OECD. Employment has held up while there have been net job losses in both the EC and OECD.  Our inflation rate &mdash; averaging just over 3 per cent per annum in 1991 and 1992 and forecast at just over 1.5 per cent in 1993 &mdash; is one of the lowest in the EC.  We have a substantial balance of payments surplus &mdash; £673 million in the first quarter of this year, an increase of £255 million over the same period in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take-home pay for those in employment has continued to increase in real terms &mdash; approximately 1.6 per cent per <Col N="359" /> annum since 1987, that is, 1.6 per cent per annum over and above inflation, compared to 1.2 per cent per annum between 1980-87 &mdash; as a result of pay increases, reductions in income tax and lower inflation.  Further real increases in payments have been provided to those dependent on the social welfare system. At the same time, there have been important reforms in the areas of health, education, housing, justice, equality and the treatment of people with disabilities aimed, in particular, at achieving greater social equity.</P>
    <P>The long and deep recession in the economies of our trading partners has had a serious and significant negative impact on unemployment.  Job creation in 1991 and 1992 was reasonably close to the annual target of 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing and international services set under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> This, however, was offset by job losses as a result of the international recession, continuing outflows from the agricultural sector and a loss, though small, in our competitiveness between 1990 and 1992.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government has taken &mdash; and will continue to take &mdash; particular measures to tackle the unacceptable unemployment situation. Measures already taken include: the establishment of area-based partnerships on a pilot basis; the establishment of county enterprise partnership boards to promote and assist integrated local devleopment, in particular by means of enterprise creation and development leading to increased employment; a two year exemption of employers from PRSI payments for additional employees taken on; the easing of eligibility criteria to increase take-up under the job training scheme; the payroll levy on employers to fund apprenticeship training; the provision of extra places for FAS employment programmes; an additional 5,000 places on the social employment scheme &mdash; community employment development programme; an improved business expansion scheme; an extension of the <Col N="360" /> urban renewal incentives and adjustment of stamp duty to assist the building industry; an expansion of the vocational training opportunities scheme &mdash; 1,000 places in 1992 and a further 900 in September 1993; the introduction of a back to work allowance and the students' summer jobs scheme; additional third level places for some 5,200 students; and provision for a local development programme in the National Development Plan recently submitted to the EC for structural funding.</P>
    <P>The Government placed primary importance on jobs and employment in the National Development Plan.  The implementation of the plan will provide the basis for drawing together, in a coherent way, action to achieve the improvement in employment performance I believe we can all agree on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not recall one of the key aspirations in the introduction to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which stated that the programme would give us the capacity to transform Irish society in this decade so that we could increase significantly our prosperity and distribute that prosperity more equitably and fairly?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the programme has been a monumental failure in terms of meeting these key objectives?  There has been a failure to do anything significant about unemployment &mdash; we have the highest unemployment rate in the EC &mdash; a failure to do anything about poverty, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors recently estimated that poverty now affects 1,100,000 people, and a failure to put in place any economic strategy to give hope to what is supposedly the best educated workforce in the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has made a speech instead of asking questions and I totally reject what he said. We would like more progress to have been made in the creation of employment but in a small, open economy like Ireland <Col N="361" /> one cannot ignore events in the countries with which we trade and the trends in world trade.  Given that we export 70 per cent of what we produce and the number of people employed in producing goods which are exported, we cannot ignore what is happening in our export markets. Nevertheless we have just come through the worst world recession since the 1930s with less damage caused to our economy than that caused to the economies of many of our stronger EC partners.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Higgins that over the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> many reforms and improvements were introduced in the areas of health, education, housing, justice, equality and the treatment of people with disabilities, all of which were aimed at achieving greater social equity.  The Programme for Government follows from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in terms of introducing the improvements we want to see throughout society.  The Government's aim is to transform society and it intends to pursue this aim while in office.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that Ireland's general economic performance over a number of years has been impressive. However, will the Taoiseach accept the argument put forward last week by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, that the growth figures for Ireland are seriously misleading and that when we look at those figures we tend to evaluate how well we are doing in a way which misleads and misinforms us in policy terms?  Will the Taoiseach also accept the contention by the Governor of the Central Bank that the employment returns in Ireland are extremely poor and that at least half the growth in unemployment during the past several years has been due not to demographic factors or the international recession but to the failure of policy in the management of the economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any suggestion that the international environment has not played a major part in the number of jobs created in Ireland over the past number of years.  We must accept that the international environment has a part to play in job creation in Ireland.  I agree that the growth rates achieved between 1987-92 &mdash; an average of 4.5-5 per cent &mdash; do not reflect a corresponding increase in employment creation.  This is due to our failure to take up the linkages in the economy.  Over the years companies in which the State has made large investments have imported too many services and raw materials.</P>
      <P>We have not been successful in making the proper linkages between investment, growth and job creation.  This area needs much more attention.  If one looks at other European countries and Japan one will see that they are trying to answer the same question as to why they are not getting the proper return in terms of employment from the growth initiatives we have undertaken.  It is clear that demographic trends and the new technology which has replaced people are contributory factors to this lack of job creation.  Another factor is that there are not enough markets to which we can export our goods and services.  Therefore, it is not one single factor; it is a combination of factors.</P>

      <P>Where was the Taoiseach during the past four or five years when all these linkages failed to be developed and Ireland stood alone as the country with the highest growth rate and the worst employment creation performance? In regard to the Government's responsibility in this area, how does the Taoiseach account for the doubling of the current budget deficit to date when it was promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the current budget deficit would be balanced? I would like him to account also for the fact that despite the fact that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> promised a 25 per cent tax rate, we now have a 27 per cent rate in addition to a 1 per cent levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="363" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to examine the record of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to tax, to take one item, he will find that under the first <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we promised approximately £255 million in tax reductions when in fact it was nearer to £800 million.  In regard to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> if we fell short of achieving a 25 per cent rate we at least achieved a 27 per cent rate which, in the economic conditions that were prevailing, was not a bad effort on our part.  It is very easy for a Member in Opposition to say that the Government did not meet its target but the Deputy must also take into account the conditions in which we were operating.</P>
      <P>We are trying to create the environment for better linkage to take place within the Irish economy.  Deputy Bruton's brother would be the first to admit, and I am sure the Deputy would, that it is the individual decisions and actions of people in the economy that will help us capitalise on the opportunities that exist and that the Government can only do so much.  It is up to individuals, semi-State bodies and others out there to avail of the opportunities for better linkage within the Irish economy.  The Government has not failed in this regard but others have failed to take up the opportunities.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he is mistaken in seeking to make comparisons with any country, least of all Japan, he choses to mention, when rebutting the phenomenon introduced by the Governor of the Central Bank of growth with unemployment? There is no country, and certainly no country within the OECD, where the badness of the correlation between growth and jobs is as pronounced as it is in Ireland.  If the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was the great success the Taoiseach claimed, why does he not want another <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?  Why is <Col N="364" /> he and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications holding back the Minister for Finance from concluding another agreement if the last one was all it was cracked up to be?</P>

In relation to this question would the Taoiseach agree that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; did not bring about either a national recovery or economic and social progress and that the main reason is that all the vested interests were around the negotiating table except one, the unemployed?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that in any future plans of this kind he will cease to call them plans for national recovery or programmes for economic and social progress until such time as the unemployed are put centre stage and are involved in the whole process in a meaningful way?</P>

In fact, I would always regard Members of this House as being representative of the unemployed also because it is our job to represent everybody. Consequently, the Government and Members of this House have an input in relation to the cause of the unemployed. However I would not regard the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> that produced an additional 70,000 jobs, as a failure when one takes into account the number of people that left the public service, nor would I regard as a failure a programme that brought renewed growth into the Irish economy over a three year period, lowered inflation, generated higher investment and achieved a very strong balance of payments surplus.  The only one unsolved problem remaining is unemployment, all the other economic indicators are a reflection of the success of both programmes.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not confirm also that it is a fact that the central review committee, supposed to be the key monitoring mechanism of such programmes, is comprised essentially of vested interest groups such as farmers, employers, unions and civil servants, that <Col N="371" /> it is the primary interest of each group to protect its own flank, so that at the end of the day nobody is undertaking a global analysis of the effectiveness of the particular programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House well knows, the 1 per cent levy was introduced in an endeavour to defray some of the costs of increased unemployment.  Certainly, it did not reduce the standard of living of the people out there, as Deputy Higgins and others would suggest.  I have already indicated to the House that there has been a real increase in the standard of living of everybody out there of approximately 1.6 per cent over and above the rate of inflation.  Therefore, the contention being advanced in relation to that is not correct.  That is the first thing.</P>
      <P>Second, it was never said it was being introduced for one year and would be eliminated in the next budget.  It was said to be temporary, short term.  Indeed, I might remind the House that budgetary policy is a matter for the Government annually at budget time.  What we have said in regard to the talks <i>vis-à-vis</i> a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is that preconditions are not acceptable, that we will be as reasonable, pragmatic and constructive as everybody else in relation to the formulation of a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> if others will adopt the same attitude, which has not been the case to date.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, unlike the British parliamentary system on which ours is modelled, we have not the equivalent of a Lord Chancellor to answer for the courts here?  Therefore, the administration of our courts has fallen badly behind. Would he agree that, worse than that, the Attorney General does not have to be a Member of Parliament and that therefore his Office is not accountable to Parliament and that, as a hive-off from his Office, the director of Public Prosecutions, in turn, is not accountable to Parliament?  Would he agree with me that it is wholly undesirable that any officer of the State should be so independent as to be unaccountable for his actions, because there will always be circumstances in which accountability should prevail?  Would the Taoiseach say whether he would re-examine this matter?</P>

      <P>The Prosecution of Offences Act provided that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be independent in the performance of his functions in order to guard against undue or inappropriate pressures being brought to bear in particular cases.  I do not see that independence would be maintained under a system where his decisions were subject to review or justification.  It would also seem difficult to justify treating cases, where the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided to bring a prosecution, differently from cases in respect of which he had decided not to do so. Therefore, if we believe in the independence of the Office &mdash; the primary objective in establishing that Office under the Act to which I referred &mdash; interference with that independence would mean that we would fare worse than is the case at present.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware of general public concern in circumstances of the kind to which I have referred, or indeed circumstances in which multiple deaths take place on our roads, when people can be killed on their way home from a disco in the middle of the night, when somebody can drive away from the scene of an accident without any prosecution taking place and no explanation given?  In such circumstances would the Taoiseach not agree that some formula should be devised of accountability to Parliament, whether it be by way of audience for the Attorney General in the Seanad, or in whatever other way is appropriate, but that nobody should be so independent that they are not accountable to Parliament?  It is outrageous that an action involving the theft of £750,000 worth of tobacco or the loss of life should fail because the book of evidence is not ready.

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent media reports that, during recent negotiations on the Programme for Economic and Social Progress between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Government agreed that they would withdraw the remainder of the dirty dozen cuts; if this is true, the cuts that are being withdrawn; and the reason for the situation that still exists whereby a man, his wife, and two children have been told that they will only receive £72.30 graduated disability benefit when, in fact, if he was in receipt of unemployment assistance, he would receive £130.30 and the only satisfaction that he has got is that he has been told that he can apply for supplementry welfare allowance and that he may receive it.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the question of rescinding the so-called dirty dozen cuts of last year has been raised by the social partners in the context of negotiations leading to a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> type national agreement.  My position in relation to those measures is quite clear. I have spoken at length in this House in the recent past on the measures themselves and the initiatives I have taken to modify them so as to minimise their impact on certain categories of people.  I am committed to an ongoing review of the remaining measures and further adjustments considered necessary will be looked at in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability benefit is payable to those people who fulfil certain statutory conditions <Col N="377" /> and who are unable to work due to illness.  Those who have contributed to the social insurance fund or whose contributions are deficient may apply for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The graduated payments of disability benefit were introduced as a consequence of the extension of social insurance coverage in 1991 to all workers, including part-time workers earning £25 a week or more.  It would not be equitable to make full-rate payments of unemployment and disability benefit to persons with earnings as low as £25 a week.  The payments made are scaled in such a way that they protect the person in times of sickness or unemployment at a rate that offers a similar or better standard of income.  The introduction of graduated payments arose from the extension of coverage to people not previously covered.</P>
    <P>It appears from the particulars furnished by the Deputy that the individual in question would have had average weekly earnings of less than £35.  This would entitle him to a graduated personal rate payment of £25.  In addition to this he would also be entitled to a further £21.70 in respect of his spouse and £25.60 for his two children, making a total weekly payment of £72.30.</P>
    <P>Where a person has insufficient contributions or earnings to quality for a full social insurance payment, they may qualify for an assistance payment at a higher rate by way of unemployment assistance, if fit to work, or supplementary welfare allowance, both of which are payable subject to a means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister comment on the statement by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, that the ghost of the dirty dozen should be buried?  In other words, she was asking us to forget the promise she made prior to the general election last year.  Can the Minister now confirm his commitment to eliminating the remaining nasty nine which affect mostly women?  Last night I took the trouble to read out the nine cuts in the <Col N="378" /> House.  Can the Minister state his position in relation to each of the nine cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting into the debate which will continue tonight.  The Minister of State was trying to get the Deputy to realise that there are much wider issues involved, that they should be taken in a more general context and, indeed, that many of the measures had been reviewed.  The measures introduced in 1992 were reviewed in the context of the 1993 budget and a number of initiatives has been taken to alleviate particular difficulties identified in the course of the review.  The measures still in force will continue to be reviewed in the light of their impact on social welfare customers and any further necessary changes will be made.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has talked about numbers. I do not want to delay the House, because we are short on time at this stage, but I should say that a number of the measures have been changed and improvements have been made in disability benefit, treatment benefits for various categories, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, supplementary welfare allowance and in a variety of other measures.  This was done very specifically and certainly we will look at the other measures on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his statement just now, is the Minister accepting that the dirty dozen have not been reversed?  Is he now accepting that the statement made by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; radio programme on a Sunday some months ago was completely inaccurate?  She said last night that the ghost has to be buried because these promises are now haunting her.  In relation specifically to the case mentioned would the Minister agree that <Col N="379" /> there is a high level of confusion and insensitivity in a system where a person classified as ill by his Department is advised to go to a crowded community welfare office to beg for a supplementary welfare allowance?  Will he now look at the anomalies and the injustices of that system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy has not given me the details of the system, we can deal with the case to which he referred.  The Deputy's comments suggest that the person has less than £35 per week and therefore while sick is getting £72.30 per week.  In terms of a just and equitable treatment for part-time workers that is a fair arrangement.  We will look at the operation of that scheme further.  This new system was introduced to extend benefit to part-time workers and applies right across the board.  The Minister of State is right in saying that the bulk of these measures has been adjusted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 45 together.  The social <Col N="380" /> welfare system is designed to support families.  We have many schemes to help families and during my time as Minister for Social Welfare I have made many improvements which have greatly improved the situation of families.  Over successive budgets we have increased substantially the level of child dependant allowances.  For example, a family on long term unemployment assistance with three children got an increase in payment of more than 44 per cent in nominal terms, or over 20 per cent in real terms, between 1987 and 1993.  This represents a very substantial improvement in the financial situation of these vulnerable families.</P>
      <P>I have also increased the help available to families where the parent is working, through a series of improvements in the family income supplement scheme.  In 1992 there were 7,735 families with 26,764 children benefiting under this scheme.  This year the income limits for the scheme were increased by £20 at an extra cost of almost £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is paid to all families with children, regardless of income or labour force status.  This year the Government provided a special increase in child benefit from £15.80 to £20 in the case of the lower rate &mdash; at an extra annual cost of almost £50 million.</P>
      <P>Other measures taken this year to improve the situation of families include improvements in the maternity benefit scheme and the introduction of a new grant of £200 payable on the birth of twins.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep the system under review and to improve the situation of families in the social welfare system as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that cutting an elderly person's secondary benefits such as free electricity units and the telephone rental allowance is unjust, especially in cases where a companion is living in the house for security reasons because of the incidence of widespread attacks in the area?  Will he further agree that it is an anti-family measure that young people are forced to leave the <Col N="381" /> family home to qualify for unemployment assistance?</P>
      <P>Will he accept that elderly people are forced into long term institutional care at an average cost to the State of £150 per week because the carer's allowance is inadequate?  Will the Minister address the anti-family elements of the social welfare code?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, it is a matter for consideration in the budget each year.</P>
      <P>We have discussed the carer's allowance at length.  It is a means tested scheme which is proving very beneficial. It has been improved substantially this year and respite care is also being provided. Recently the Government provided £0.5 million for respite care and the sum is being doubled to £1 million which will enable further projects to get underway throughout the country.  We would like to make further progress in this very important area and we certainly regard it as a priority.</P>
      <P>To do away with the provisions of benefit and privilege would cost approximately £25 million.  To give a short answer, it will certainly be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on recent reports that he intends to submit proposals to Government to introduce a two-tiered PRSI system for employers, with a lower rate of 6.6 per cent for certain industries; the way in which he proposes to select industries which will benefit from such lower rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister responsible for the pay related social insurance system, I am determined that no avenue should remain unexplored in our national effort to generate new jobs and preserve existing employment.  The case has been made that reducing the rate of employers' contributions would provide a boost to firms which are struggling to increase or <Col N="383" /> retain their business and employment, particularly in sectors such as clothing which are vulnerable to lower cost competition from abroad and where payroll represents a major part of the firm's total costs.  I recently met representatives of the Irish Clothing and Manufacturers' Federation who argued strongly along these lines.</P>
      <P>I confirm that I am examining the possibility of restructuring the system of employers' PRSI contributions with a view to easing the burden on such sectors. I shall shortly be receiving the report of the interdepartmental committee established to examine the employment impact of employers' PRSI on low paid labour-intensive industries which has been looking at options in this area.</P>
      <P>The option mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; a two tiered system targeted on certain industries &mdash; is one of a number of options I will be considering.  However, cost and administrative considerations have to be taken into account.  My proposals will take account of the need to safeguard the Social Insurance Fund on which workers depend for their benefit and pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward proposals to address this issue in time for the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is looking positively at the proposals made by the Irish Clothing and Manufacturers' Federation.  Given that 454 jobs have been lost in the sector this year, it is particularly vulnerable and some intervention is needed.  The high labour costs and the loss of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK, in particular, is causing difficulties.  The case has been made that reducing the rate of employers' PRSI contributions is vital to redressing uncompetitiveness and I am glad the Minister is dealing with this.  However, if the system operating in the UK was put in place here, would the Minister take account of the higher marginal cost of wages so that the lower rate of PRSI would apply on wages up to £9,000 per annum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="384" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our rates of PRSI are among the lowest in Europe, but compared to Britain we have special difficulties. The comparison is twofold: first, our wages are higher while in Britain there is a sliding scale of PRSI but no ceiling on employers' contributions.  The percentage take is on the total income whereas our ceiling is reached on incomes of £21,300.  We must make provisions in the context of all those elements while maintaining the position of the social welfare fund.  I am concerned that we are able to provide the benefits for the workers as their benefits and pensions must be preserved.  I do not want to see such benefits means tested.  My main concern is to ensure that the benefits are preserved, most workers agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Members from all parties agree that the social insurance fund must be protected for all the workers who avail of it.  However, Irish clothing manufacturers are in crisis.  If clothing factories continue to close down at the current rate we will not only lose the revenue from employers' and employees' PRSI contributions but from tax revenue. Does the Minister agree that intervention is worth while?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to engage in a general debate but there are other relevant issues.  Some segments of the industry do not have problems because of marketing and other competitive reasons.  The solution is not quite as simple as the Minister addressing the question of PRSI contributions, although in particular areas it is part of the solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12, 14 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I introduced the third level allowance scheme on a pilot basis in July 1990.  The scheme allows older long term unemployed people, who can obtain a place at third level, the opportunity to pursue their studies while retaining entitlement to their unemployment payments.  I extended the scheme to lone parents this year.  At the end of the 1992-93 academic year some 350 unemployed people were participating in the scheme.  This year I have approval for 500 places on the scheme and these will be fully taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants must be aged 23 years or over, and in receipt of a payment from my Department for at least 12 months. In addition to retaining their full social welfare entitlements, participants may qualify for a grant under the higher education grants scheme administered by the Department of Education.  Under the terms of this scheme, a mature candidate <Col N="386" /> must be at least 23 years of age to participate.</P>
    <P>In fixing the age limit for this scheme a balance must be struck between the need to facilitate long term unemployed people who are in a position to avail of third level education without on the other hand offering any inducement to younger people to postpone taking up an opportunity of entry to third level which they might otherwise have taken.  On balance I consider that an age limit of 23 is reasonable in the circumstances of this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a figure of 500 unemployed young people being facilitated at a time when we have 300,000 people out of work is very small and that many talented ambitious unemployed young people are prevented from participating in this scheme because of the age barrier?  Having taken into consideration what the Minister says about an age balance, 21 would create a proper balance.  Will the Minister give the cost of reducing the age to 21 and consider reducing it because of the demand for the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the Minister for Education.  As Minister for Social Welfare I introduced this scheme to help long term unemployed people to get back into education on a second chance basis.  I must keep away from the first chance education because that comes under the ambit of the Minister for Education.  In that context the age of 21 for second level and 23 for third level was introduced and the 23 age limit for third level coincides with the grant stage for mature students. We must keep up with the demand and the Government has increased the numbers for the VTOS each year.  I am permitted to exceed the limit to some extent, if necessary.  We are still able to keep up with demand for third level places and if we exceed 500 there will not be any complaints from the Government.  The scheme was to be reviewed after three years, which will end this year.  We will have an opportunity to review the whole scheme and its operation.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents an area in which fishing is the prime industry the impact of these two judgments has gone very deep.  I am delighted that the Minister has done his utmost to redress the situation that has arisen.  I will outline some of the matters I would like to be teased out at a later stage.  I recognise that the Minister, a former Minister for the Marine, is aware of how difficult it is to be a fisherman. There are problems with quotas, an ageing fleet, reduced white fish stock and an increase in the amount of money needed to keep up repayments on boats. Due to the currency crisis last year many people in the fishing industry discovered that their debts have increased by £10,000, £20,000 and even £100,000.</P>
      <P>Fishing is a hazardous occupation and the Minister recognised that in acknowledging the need for disability benefit.  There is a fallacy in the House that Killybegs is full of millionaires, there are few in Killybegs and the people about whom I am speaking are certainly not millionaires.  Share fishermen earn between £6,000 and £8,000 per year.  The Fianna Fáil Party has looked after those people very well and I am glad the Minister has done his utmost to deal with the lack of benefits which has arisen from the Costelloe case.  The judgment in that case says: &ldquo;the proper inference of law to be drawn from them is that a partnership relationship rather than an employer/employee one existed between the defendant and the other members of the crew in this case&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; has other connotations apart from those we are dealing with now in a legislative manner.  Will the Minister clarify the position in regard to the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; in respect of <Col N="466" /> skippers and their crew?  Will a fisherman have a claim on a boat when the skipper is selling it?  We must address the legalities of the matter.  Contracts between skippers and fishermen will have to be exemplary in regard to partnerships.  We are talking here about a partnership in an activity and that is very precarious.  If a person is a partner and an employer-employee relationship does not exist, who will do the hiring and firing?  That problem has had to be addressed on many occasions.  For example, on returning from say, two weeks at sea some fishermen tend to go to the pub and stay for most of the night.  Such fishermen frequently go to sea again early the next morning under the influence of drink and are a danger to the crew.  At present the skipper decides whether such people are entitled to travel with the crew, but in the case of a partnership, will skippers have that authority?  Can they hire and fire people?  This matter will have serious implications for the safety of fishermen.</P>
    <P>At present share fishermen are not entitled to benefits.  They are classified as self employed and pay a social insurance stamp.  They are classified as share fishermen, they are not a limited company and have paid their stamps in good faith to the Department who accepted their money.  What will happen to those people following the enactment of this legislation given that section 4 states the contributions payable will not come into effect until 6 April 1994 and people will not be entitled to payment until 1996? Those people have paid A1 stamps to date, what will happen to their contributions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people ceased payment in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people are still paying those contributions.  There is an anomaly between a limited company and a sole trader.  People operating limited companies will feel aggrieved that the employer-employee relationship still exists, that they must pay their employees' contributions and are competing with sole traders who will not have <Col N="467" /> to pay them.  A self-employed person will pay 7.75 per cent, the controversial 1 per cent income levy plus an extra 5 per cent levy which will enable him or her to benefit from unemployment and disability benefits, but that money will not be paid by skippers.  It will be taken out of a person's wages.  I accept that a person may get that money back when he or she claims benefit, but it constitutes an added cost for share fishermen who will not receive 5 per cent extra to pay for the contributions.  Will the Minister address that matter?</P>
      <P>Section 8 refers to entitlement to benefit for 13 weeks in a calendar year.  The IFO had consultations with the Minister and officials of his Department and used that as a market.  It is not feasible.  This year alone boats have been tied up for 26 weeks.  In a few years' time a person will be entitled to only 13 weeks' unemployment benefit and for the other 13 weeks he or she will not be entitled to unemployment assistance and will not want to apply for social assistance.  Pride will take over, people will do without although they will be in need.  Will the Minister consider increasing that 13 week period?  If a person is entitled to unemployment benefit they should receive it and the same rules should apply to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that a person is entitled to one year's disability benefit.  What will happen if a person is out of work for medical reasons for more than one year? From my reading of the Bill, a person would have to have another set of paid up contributions to be entitled to disability benefit during that period.  That is not feasible if a person is out of work due to illness.  If a person is sick, he or she is unable to work and make the contributions. In general, the fishing industry is made up of young people because older people are not able to cope with high seas.  Accidents occur on fishing boats more frequently than in many other industries.  One can be maimed for life in a fishing accident or be out of work for two or three years as a result of an accident at sea.  Under present legislation a <Col N="468" /> person out of work due to illness is entitled to disability benefit followed by entitlement to an invalidity pension if off sick on a permanent basis.  What will happen following the enactment of this legislation?  Will they have to revert to social assistance or disabled person's maintenance allowance?  Are we giving the health boards a role for which the Department of Social Welfare should have responsibility?  That matter could be teased out on Committee Stage because I have reservations about imposing a yearly limit on entitlement to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 13 week limit, many people are employed as share fishermen for two or three months of a year and then get a job in a fish factory paying A1 stamps.  What will happen to people who will have paid self-employed or optional contributions and A1 stamps?  Will the Department credit such people for periods during which they are not entitled to full unemployment benefit?  The imposition of the 13 week limit means that many people will cease to be share fishermen because they rely on their stamps during non-fishing seasons and when the weather is unsuitable for fishing.  It is unacceptable that people who earn approximately £6,000 to £8,000 per annum will lose out.  It is the traditional share fishermen about whom we need to be concerned.  The owners of the huge tankers which bring in catches worth £25 million or £26 million can well afford to look after their employees.  I accept the Minister is aware of the predicament of share fishermen, but he should make more provision for them in this legislation. In a few years' time they will have to go on social assistance because they will not be entitled to unemployment assistance and that will have major implications for health boards.</P>
    <P>Frequently when legislation is introduced in this House, a number of years elapse before people are entitled to the full benefits it introduces.  The position is different in this case in that many of the people involved are already entitled to benefits as they pay A1 stamps.  They are happy that they now have an option. <Col N="469" /> However, I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of allowing these people to buy contributions and backdate them to 1992 and to enter the system from 1994, because what are they to do in the period up to 1996?  Given his ingenuity, the Minister should be able to devise a scheme to allow these people benefit from 1994.  We are relying on him to do so, given the problems which have been caused during the past few months and that people feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like the Minister to address.  A limited company had a duty, as an employer, to its employees.  Will the Minister confirm that this is the position?  I do not want us to find ourselves in a situation where a limited company will be unable to pay contributions for its employees and will say to them that it is going to forget about its duty to them that it will pay the S1 stamp &mdash; in other words, that they will be regarded as self-employed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this will not happen.  Although 90 per cent of owners and skippers want to look after their employees, 10 per cent do not.  I do not want them to get away with it.  When the judgment was handed down in the case taken by the Revenue Commissioners many owners and skippers were let off the hook.  They have offloaded their responsibility to look after their employees.  A skipper on a boat is a responsible position and they have a duty to look after their employees.  For some it is easy to offload this responsibility. However, others would have liked to continue paying the A1 stamp.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised for not taking action to address the matter, but I know well that that is not the case; he introduced an excellent scheme following the 1992 case.  It is a pity that we were not in a position to continue that scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  However, I have reservations about the figure of 13 weeks and the payment of disability benefit for 52 weeks.  I certainly do not want to see limited companies leaving their employees in a position where they would be regarded as self-employed.  Before <Col N="470" /> Committee Stage I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to speak to the KFO again to tease out some of the finer points.  This is the only opportunity we will have to deal with these people.</P>
    <P>In regard to other aspects of the Bill, I am glad the Minister has taken it upon himself to ensure that employers, particularly those in the building trade, will be put under pressure to keep records of the people they employ.  This will be of help to those who have to face unfair competition.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister had to say in his speech in relation to PRSI, given the views expressed by the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation.  There is a need for action and I am sure the Minister will do something in the budget to address the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have a good debate on Committee Stage.  I still have a number of reservations, but the Minister and his officials want to do their utmost for those people who are not earning as much in the fishing industry as they should.  This industry can develop provided it receives support, not only from the Department of the Marine and the European Union but also from the Department of Social Welfare.  Unfortunately, share fishermen derive some of their income from social welfare.  This has been the position in recent years.  They have been unable to earn more than £10,000 a year and therefore have to rely on payments from the Department of Social Welfare.  I hope that the Minister will be able to alleviate their fears and ensure that there will be flexibility when it comes to deciding on eligibility in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I first became aware of the major difficulties facing share fishermen under the social welfare code almost four years ago.  It was the storms of December 1989 &mdash; fishermen in Kilmore Quay were particularly affected &mdash; which underlined the chaos under the social welfare system as it applied to fishermen.  Those December storms left dozens of share fishermen and skippers without work for many weeks.  Indeed, only a few of these managed with great difficulty to establish <Col N="471" /> their entitlements to unemployment assistance.  None was entitled to receive unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment in the McLoughlin case in 1986, in which it was determined that share fishermen were self-employed from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, the assumption was that since they were self-employed for tax purposes they were also self-employed for social welfare purposes,. No one would have believed that the State would treat the one person differently under two codes, but that is what transpired.  It was not until 1992, when the Department of Social Welfare took a case against Griffiths, that it was determined that share fishermen were self-employed for the purposes of social welfare.  I am not sure why the Department of Social Welfare was so obstinate. I would have thought that the judgment in the McLoughlin case would have been sufficient for all Government Departments, because people cannot be treated differently under different codes.  In any event it trundled on until 1992 when, as I said, it was determined that share fishermen could not be treated as employers any longer, that they were partners, co-adventurers.</P>
      <P>This decision does not rest lightly on the shoulders of many share fishermen. Notwithstanding the judgment handed down, they still do not accept that they are self-employed in the true sense of the word as it applies to shopkeepers, farmers or any other individual who runs his own business.  As Deputy Coughlan and others have said, they have no control over when they work, who hires or fires them, or even the wages or salary they receive.  Their only asset is their labour which they can sell to the skipper or boat owner, who need not be the same person.  How then can we accept and treat them as if they were self-employed?</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record the views of the Kilmore Quay share fishermen's action group.  They have expressed their views extremely well and it is clear that they are both frustrated and angry.  I quote from their submission:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> We the share fishermen have always seen ourselves as employees of the fishing industry and we feel that decisions made by the courts, which may have been swayed by a distortion of facts regarding our employment, were very discriminatory indeed against a most vulnerable section of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The loss of Class A benefits in many cases caused severe hardship for those concerned.  Proper information concerning their employment status was not forthcoming, and many people found themselves in a state of &ldquo;LIMBO&rdquo; regarding their position.</P>
    <P>Many official documents regarding their employment were not forthcoming and in many cases have not yet reached the hands of those concerned, because of indifference on the part of their employers.  In short the transition period as regards PRSI for share fishermen took place behind the backs of those concerned.  In many cases share fishermen were not aware of their disputed status until years after contributions had ceased to be paid on their behalf by the deceiving tactics of some employers.  This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Many share fishermen in Kilmore Quay were unaware of their change of status under the various codes until the tragedies of December 1989 when they could no longer go to work.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>We the action group for share fishermen would like to state categorically here and now the IFO do not represent us, or our interests, within the industry. On the contrary they misrepresent us on many issues, without any mandate whatsoever from the share fishermen involved.</P>
    <P>We the action group for share fishermen would not see the Department of Social Welfare as a &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; between the IFO and share fishermen, but on the contrary would treat this as an opportunity to create a cordial relationship between the Department and ourselves, which would give us access to discuss matters which affect <Col N="473" /> share fishermen within your Department.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from a letter to the Minister, so &ldquo;Department&rdquo; refers to the Department of Social Welfare.  I can only speak for the share fishermen in County Wexford. They do not feel that the IFO represents their interests, but that it represents the case of skippers.  They feel the need of a representative organisation for ordinary fishermen.  It is over to them on that; and if they want help or assistance I am sure we will all be available. Let me continue with the letter:</P>
    <P>The pivotal point of the argument concerning the status of share fishermen as regards PRSI seems to hinge on the Ruling of the High Court as defined by Justice Blayney in the Griffiths case 1992 when he decreed (that because of the nature of remuneration granted to share fishermen, their status as employees was in doubt, and in fact they were partners in the fishing venture, and would be classed as such for insurance purposes).</P>
    <P>We the share fishermen would seriously question this ruling in light of the fact that distortion regarding that aspect of our employment, and many more aspects of our employment, may have swayed Judge Blayney in his decision as regards the employment status of share fisherman.</P>
    <P>We the action group would not see the pivotal point of the argument regarding the status of the share fishermen as how we receive remuneration, but rather on the issue of who determines the availability of work, who determines the amount of remuneration received for work, in short who determines when they shall work, how they shall work, and how much they will be allowed to earn.</P>
    <P>The following points I hope would go a long way in establishing that fact:</P>
    <P>The share fisherman does not receive a share of the profits as such, but a payment which is solely determined by the boat owner without any input on the part of the share fisherman, which the owner sees fit as just <Col N="474" /> reward for services requested by him during the course of that venture.  This is far removed from a partnership.</P>
    <P>Without receipts regarding total earnings and also total expenditure incurred during the transaction, the share fisherman must assume that the payment he receives from the owner concerned must be a wage for services rendered, and should be seen to be just that.</P>
    <P> (2)  The share fisherman has no input whatsoever into determining what course the venture undertaken by the boat shall take, e.g., the boat owner shall determine without any interference on the part of the share fisherman.</P>
    <P> (a)  When the boat shall leave to commence the venture.</P>
    <P>(b)  What time the share fisherman must report for duty.</P>
    <P>(c)  How short, or how long, a time the venture shall last.</P>
    <P>(d)  What type of fishing gear is to be used.</P>
    <P>(e)  What type of fishing is undertaken.</P>
    <P>(f)  When the share fisherman is relieved from his duties.</P>
    <P>(g)  What direction the proceeds of that venture shall take as regards sale, etc. </P>
    <P>In short, the only input into the venture on the part of the share fisherman is that of his labour which he carries out as requested by the boat owner for which he receives payment.  This input is far removed from that which a partner in the venture would hope to enjoy. </P>
    <P>(3)  The boat owner exercises the right to dismiss</P>
    <P> (a)  the share fisherman from his place of work.</P>
    <P>(b)  to refuse entry to the share fisherman to his place of work &mdash; as in a &ldquo;lock out&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> (4)  The boat owner exercises the right to withdraw remuneration to a share fisherman as soon as labour is withdrawn for whatever the reason, whether it be sickness or otherwise. This is far removed from a partnership where in most cases there would be consultation on the matter.</P>
    <P>(5)  The security enjoyed by most self-employed or partners in a business as a result of capital assets acquired during the course of their employment, is not enjoyed by share fishermen.  In fact, to the contrary the only asset he has at any time is his ability to work. When his ability to work is curtailed, through no fault of his own, income needed to sustain the livelihood and welfare of himself and his family is totally eliminated.  When this happens without the cover of social insurance the hardships caused to the family are very disturbing.  This is unacceptable in today's society, and is socially unjust. </P>
    <P>It is worth putting those words on the record because they express the frustration and annoyance of share fishermen, not just with their lack of insurance cover but with the judgments in the two High Court cases.  As matters proceed they may have to look for personal representation in regard to their actual status.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but it will have to be looked at closely on Committee Stage because it does not go far enough, and I will have many other queries.  An additional 5 per cent in PRSI out of the wage of the share fisherman will bring to 10 per cent the contribution expected of him if he opts for this extra scheme to give him unemployment benefit and disability benefit cover, 13 weeks is not sufficient cover.  Perhaps that could be rolled over a number of years &mdash; for example, 39 weeks over three years &mdash; because in some winters when there is mild weather and good fishing there might be no need for fishermen to be on shore for 13 weeks; whereas in other winters, such as this one, fishermen have been on shore for 26 or 27 weeks already.  Therefore they <Col N="476" /> should be able to roll over any unemployment benefit entitlement they might garner from this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that they should have to wait until 1996 to come into benefit. They will not start making this payment until April of next year and will not come into benefit until 1996.  In recent years many share fishermen's families have had to depend at Christmas time on the local St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charities.  It is necessary to deal with the situation.  These are not self-employed people in the accepted sense.  I understand the technical reasons for this provision. They will be assessed a year in arrears.  The method of payment has yet to be determined.  However, it really is necessary that special transitional arrangements be made in the first year to bring share fishermen into benefit immediately, because they are workers in the sense that any other employee is a worker.  They have no assets, they have no capital, they have no money left over from last year with which to pay this year until they come into benefit.  Exceptional treatment is needed to bring share fishermen into benefit immediately once they start payment.</P>
    <P>As amnesties are fashionable it would be only just to allow those who have been outside the social welfare code for the last few years because of the Griffiths and McLoughlin judgments to come into it immediately on the basis of an amnesty whereby there would be no investigation of their back books.  Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Minister for Finance on that and avoid prolonging the agony of fishing families.</P>
    <P>Skippers who to date have been quite happy to treat their share fishermen as employees and pay the PRSI at the Class A1 rate should make allowance in the wages they pay for the extra PRSI contribution that will now have to come from the share fishermen themselves.  Otherwise the skippers will be better off while the fishermen will be worse off.  Can the Minister say if skippers will be responsible for any PRSI back money which would be due as a result of the 1992 judgment?  What, if anything, does the <Col N="477" /> Department of Social Welfare intend to do about that?  Can the Department do anything about it?</P>
    <P>In general the Bill solves the problem that has been created.  The fisherman have requested the Minister to consider the position in the UK.  From April this year share fishermen in the UK had to pay only £7.75 per week for 13 weeks in arrears and this payment guaranteed them full Class A1 benefits.  While the Minister has improved the position in relation to unemployment benefit and disability benefit, our share fishermen are not getting full Class A1 benefits.  In the interests of competition and peripheral communities &mdash; the communities the Cohesion Fund was set up to look after &mdash; I ask the Minister to see if he can bring the position here closer to that of the UK.  I am sure the Minister can take that extra step to bring the position in relation to our share fishermen into line with that of the UK position and provide them with full Class A1 benefits for a slightly lesser contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned other issues she would deal with on Committee Stage. I welcome the moves to insure volunteer development workers.  Their insurance was overdue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the guide to the Consolidation Act is circulated to all members of the Oireachtas. It is an idiot guide to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act and will be very useful in explaining different issues.</P>
    <P>It is nearly Christmas.  Every year there are crises and problems in regard to the social welfare Christmas bonus.  Every year some social welfare recipients receive the bonus and others do not.  I am particularly concerned about those who have been on social welfare for a long time.  They may not have been on unemployment assistance for a long time. In many cases the rate of income they would have received would be lower than employment assistance.  Unemployment benefit can be lower than unemployment assistance.  In my constituency I know of people in receipt of long term unemployment assistance who when they became ill went on to disability benefit and <Col N="478" /> found they no longer qualified for the Christmas bonus, even though they may have been out of work for a long time.</P>
    <P>When people move from one end of the social welfare code to the other their entitlements to Christmas bonus and free fuel should be maintained and I ask the Minister to consider those in that category. I note the principle to which the Minister referred and recognise that there must be control and that recipients only a short time unemployed or in receipt of disability benefit should not be entitled to such benefits.  It would be very nice to give those benefits to all recipients. Recipients who have been out of work and are in receipt of unemployment assistance and then have to go on to disability benefit should not lose their Christmas bonus or the entitlement to free fuel.  Under the present system they do lose those benefits.  I ask the Minister to address this matter this year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the present position regarding the statutory instrument he introduced in relation to the direct collection of PRSI from share fishermen in November 1989?  I presume this Bill supersedes that and will be recalled or annulled or whatever happens to statutory instruments that no longer apply.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House.  It has taken a long time to resolve anomalies of treatment under the social welfare code, <Col N="479" /> particularly in the case of share fishermen. I ask the Minister to consider on Committee Stage the difficulties in relation to the 13 weeks and the 12 months for disability benefit and the date on which the share fishermen will receive benefit if they choose to contribute under the new optional scheme.  I ask him to consider also the UK system where our counterpart share fishermen are entitled to full class A1 benefits for a smaller weekly contribution.  That anomaly has not been addressed by this Bill.  For four years I have pursued this issue through the Seanad, on adjournment debates, special notice questions and Social Welfare Bills.  I raised this issue again on this year's Social Welfare Bill and through parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  I am pleased the Minister is addressing this issue and has recognised the quandary and the crisis that has existed during bad weather when fishermen find themselves land-based through no fault of their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Doyle and other Members in welcoming this Bill. As spokesman on Social Welfare when in Opposition, I raised this issue many times.  I am pleased that the Minister. who promised to address this matter sometime ago, is now doing so under this Bill.  This type of legislation should be extended to many other sectors who encounter great difficulty in coming to grips with the complex calculation of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1992 a number of regulations were introduced following the famous High Court case which I sponsored and <Col N="480" /> which was won on behalf of certain categories of dockers.  That gave rise to a certain degree of panic in the Department of Social Welfare and as a result many regulations were introduced in rapid succession.  Those regulations were intended to close loopholes and avoid abuses of the social welfare system.  In some cases they were necessary.  There is no doubt that there was abuse in certain areas in the system.  The system was abused by employers who used the subsidy to subsidise themselves rather than their employees.  In the past I gave many examples of cases where days, rotas of work and hours of work were virtually manipulated to suit the system of the day. People in many sectors of industry &mdash; for example, service industries, the fishing industry and the building industry &mdash; were caught up in the blanket of regulations introduced to close loopholes.</P>
    <P>Fishermen suffered as a result of the introduction of those regulations and they are frustrated with the system.  For example, in Clogherhead, where there are 35 boats, many fishermen unknowingly suffered as a result of those new regulations.  Heretofore, unemployment assistance was calculated on the basis of whether a fisherman was working on a particular day.  That was the basis of the case fought for dockers in the High Court.  They had to prove that they were unemployed on a particular day or for a number of days.  Some genius in the Department of Social Welfare came up with the idea that unemployment assistance should be calculated on the basis of a person's earnings for the previous year. This created a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>That position was not satisfactory for a fisherman who earned £10,000 or £15,000 in 1992.  His earnings were used to his disadvantage in the calculation of his 1993 unemployment assistance.  The more the Department tried to regulate the position the more confused it became.  Directives were issued from the Department to regional offices and managers but regional managers did not understand the content of those directives.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome this very <Col N="481" /> positive move in isolating a unique sector.  This is not an area where people work at a machine and the only thing that will put them out of work is lack of orders, breakdown on the line or illness. This is an industry whereby people's earnings are based on many factors, particularly the weather.  A fisherman never knows from one week to another whether he will be working at his work depends on tidal conditions, boat breakdowns and particularly the weather.  He receives no warning and cannot operate a system in the same way as a textile mill or footwear factory.  Therefore, this matter needs to be covered by separate legislation and regulation.</P>
    <P>I disagree with a number of provisions in the Bill and perhaps the Minister will consider them.  The introduction of an optional clause means that people have the right to opt for the scheme if they wish, but that is a dangerous concept. Everybody in the industry should be covered. The result of this provision in the case of a trawler crew will be that some people will be in the scheme and others will not.  The trawler owner or skipper will be required to keep records for inspection by the Department of Social Welfare and he will be severely penalised under the Bill for not doing so.</P>
    <P>Before the introduction of computers the employer was required to stamp a card for the employee and the employee was entitled to see those cards at any time.  The same applied in the case of trade union representatives.  With the introduction of computers the system was messed up and the more the system is computerised the worse it gets.  In this case it should be obligatory on everybody in the industry to join the scheme.  Under the Bill the onus is on trawler owners or captains to keep proper records. However, fishermen in Clogherhead in my constituency and elsewhere on the east coast, due to certain conditions, are required to fish on the west coast and are away from home for weeks on end.  These people have very little time to sit in an office keeping records.  Therefore, the system should be simplified to provide <Col N="482" /> for easy calculation, record keeping and inspection.</P>
    <P>The best way to simplify the system is to forget about percentage payments and provide for just one payment.  I do not see why the average share fisherman's earnings could not be calculated and, based on that figure, a premium could be set, payable on a monthly basis to ensure that arrears do not occur.  If contributions are paid on a yearly basis, arrears of up to two years may occur and the people involved may find that due to the weather or other circumstances they are unable to work and cannot afford to make the payments.  Premiums should be paid monthly, as is the case, for example, in the VHI.  People should not have to operate a pre-dated record system whereby they would have to pay an auditor to produce an audited account &mdash; I am sure that is the only system the Department would accept; they would not accept a share fisherman's word as to his earnings or those of the crew.  Taking into consideration travelling expenses and so on these earnings are always the subject of dispute.  The people in this industry will also be forced to keep a more updated tax record because the two systems are closely related, and I do not disagree with that.  The introduction of a system of monthly premium payments would dispense with the need to keep extensive records and would also save time for Department inspectors in visiting ports to examine records.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that there will be an interim period between the time the Bill comes into force and the time the benefits will apply.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter.  To simplify the system the ministerial order should be cancelled, in that way the calculation for share fishermen would be dealt with on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    <P>If people do not opt to be covered for unemployment or disability benefit, do they have the option of unemployment assistance when they are unemployed due to weather, breakdown or whatever? That is a very important question.  What is the incentive to opt for a scheme which pays benefit for only 14 weeks? <Col N="483" /> Obviously the Department must have calculated the number of weeks a share fisherman is likely to lose in the year.  In normal circumstances it would be impossible to make such a calculation or to decide how long a person will be out sick.  For example, if a person develops a serious illness and has to go into hospital or a sanitorium and is unable to participate in share fishing for a period of six months, will disability benefit be discontinued after 13 weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability benefit applies for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing regulations that person would be deemed unavailable for work or incapable of work.  Will the Minister clarify that point and confirm whether a person in those circumstances would qualify for unemployment assistance when disability benefit is exhausted? The Minister should take those points into consideration when drawing up the regulations.</P>
      <P>The famous High Court case has given rise to major problems for the self-employed. The Bill is a move in the right direction in so far as it deals with a unique category of part-time workers.  Other categories include the part-time workers in banks and the security firms which have mushroomed.  A Bill to cater for the many categories of part-time workers to which I referred is long overdue.  I know from recent statements by the Minister and his Minister of State that such legislation is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of share fishermen has become so complicated that this Bill will be very much welcomed by the fishing industry in general.  Not only has the Department of Social Welfare become tied up in the calculation of unemployment assistance but community welfare officers, who are trying to work in tandem with the officials of the Department of Social Welfare at local level, are also tied up in calculating unemployment assistance.  It appears that the Department's calculations are at variance with the regulations laid down by the Department <Col N="484" /> of Health for community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage when I will have more detailed points to make on the various sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this long overdue Bill.  Since the judgment of the High Court on 14 February 1992 fishermen have been in limbo.  Their contributions were paid for them by the skippers of the boats on which they worked but for some unknown reason the court judgment exempted the skippers from paying these contributions.  That was a retrograde step.  We cannot question a High Court judgment, but the Minister should immediately have sought to alleviate this situation instead of allowing it to continue for almost two years.  This judgment meant that unemployed fishermen were unable to claim sick benefit or unemployment assistance for almost two years. They were forced to live on whatever frugal savings they made prior to the judgment.  Many of these fishermen have been living on the breadline because inclement weather prevented them from fishing.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is <i>au fait</i> with the position in the fishing industry.  Fishermen cannot be classed as ordinary workers as they rely on the weather for their business.  For example, if there is a hurricane or a gale force wind they cannot go to sea and may have to remain in port for as long as five or six weeks during the winter months with no income.  It must have been an oversight that the Department of Social Welfare allowed this situation continue for almost two years.  The legislation, even at this late stage is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous parliamentary questions were tabled to the Minister asking what he proposed doing to rectify this problem. The Minister should ensure that fishermen receive benefits from the day they start paying their contributions.  I do not think that is too much to ask the Minister.  I am sure he listens to any <Col N="485" /> points made and knows the seriousness of this issue.  I have no doubt he will rectify this anomaly and give fishermen cover from the day they pay their first contributions.  Fishermen, through no fault of their own, have been discriminated against and denied the right to pay their stamps and receive benefits for almost two years.</P>
    <P>Will the contributions paid by the fishermen from 6 April be regarded as full class A1 benefits and will the fishermen be eligible to receive all the benefits under this class?  Why should Irish fishermen not be given the opportunity to pay their contributions in the same way as fishermen in Great Britain and other countries?  Will unemployed fishermen who have paid their contributions be classified as unemployed and registered on the live register?  If not, then the legislation will not achieve what it is supposed to achieve.  It is of paramount importance that unemployed fishermen are treated in the same way as as other unemployed people.</P>
    <P>I know fishermen in Schull, Union Hall and Castletownbere who do not earn one penny for 14 to 16 weeks during the winter.  For the past few winters these people have had no income.  The new scheme will not be introduced one day too soon for people who have been debarred from receiving social welfare benefits for almost two years.  The Minister should introduce a scheme granting these fishermen the benefits they should have received in the past two years.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to a fisherman who has 15 years' A.1 contributions? Will the Minister give an assurance that the new category of contributions being introduced by the Minister will be combined with the original records of fishermen's contributions and will they be taken into consideration when they retire?  Will those contributions be taken into consideration also in regard to benefits that accrue to all unemployed people?</P>
    <P>The Bill states that new optional contributions will be payable from 6 April 1994 but that the benefits will not accrue <Col N="486" /> until 1 January 1996.  Is it a coincidence that 1 January 1996 is the day the Spaniards and the Portuguese will be allowed access to our 50 mile fishing box, the day the European regulation comes into effect?  If the Spaniards and the Portuguese are allowed enter our fishing waters to ravage the 50 mile box at present denied them under previous European agreements, the Minister will be inundated with claims for unemployment assistance and benefits from Irish fishermen.  Not only will the Spaniards and the Portuguese destroy our fishing stock, they will take the limpets off the rock and there will be nothing left for our fishermen except unemployment benefits.  That will be the position and it is sad that the date for the introduction of benefits under this scheme is the day when the ruination of Irish fisheries will be evidenced in the exploitation by those foreign vessels.</P>
    <P>It is not their fault that fishermen have not paid their contributions for the past two years.  The Minister should seriously address this problem in the Bill and if he does not we will put down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that in the past share fishermen were regarded as employees for social insurance purposes and were insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  He stated that their insurability status changed following certain court decisions.  Will the Minister define a partnership between a skipper and a crew member when the skipper employs that crew member?  The skipper has a right to sack crewmen at any stage while they are in his employment if they are not suitable.  In that case, how can those crewmen be described as share fishermen?  How can the Minister describe a deckhand as a shareholder with the skipper of the vessel?  It is impossible to do so and in this regard the legislation is fraught with difficulty because it is open to challenge in the European Court that an employee cannot be regarded as being in partnership or a shareholder in the vessel.  He is employed as a crewman and the obligation rests with the skipper of the boat, as was the <Col N="487" /> case, up to 14 February 1992, to ensure that the correct contributions were paid for that employee to enable him to benefit under the Social Welfare Acts if he needed to do so.</P>
    <P>Where is the employer-employee relationship defined in this Bill?  It is ludicrous to describe a fisherman employed by the skipper of a trawler as a shareholder in that vessel.  As everybody knows that is not the case.  All expenses are deducted from a trawler's turnover, the skipper takes his share and the remainder is divided among the crew members.  No one could describe that as a share partnership.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the Minister's lengthy contribution on this Bill that many anomalies must be rectified by him before we can give this legislation a smooth passage through the House.  Indeed, there is much more to be considered in this legislation and I urge the Minister to listen to the demands of the Irish Fishermen's Association, trawler owners and individual fishermen.  There is no legislation with which one cannot find fault and I urge the Minister to ensure that this legislation will copperfasten the benefits of the people who have been denied them for the past two years.</P>
    <P>It is evident that those fishermen have been victimised for the past two years.  It is very evident that many of them had nothing on which to live while their boats were tied up.  It is also very evident that, were it not for the community welfare officers nationwide, many of those people would be on the breadline.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take into account the serious position that arose resulting from that court decision.  I would urge him to take into consideration also the fact that many of those fishermen may not be in a position to meet the 10 per cent contribution required of them if they take up that option of the scheme. It is my opinion that the provisions of the scheme are somewhat harsh in that respect.  I can see no reason for the Minister not obtaining more legal advice in an endeavour to draft legislation compelling the skipper of a boat to pay contributions <Col N="488" /> on behalf of his employees.  I would remind the Minister that one cannot classify a bartender as a bar owner, that one cannot classify a deckhand on a fishing boat as a shareholder in a fishing boat, because he will have had no input in its purchase.  Therefore, how can he be classified as a shareholder?  I should like these matters clarified by the Minister when replying.  Otherwise, the provisions of the Bill will be fraught with danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is the third Social Welfare Bill this Minister will have introduced in the House this year.  Without being patronising in any way, I would say that a mark of all his legislation is that he has attempted as far as he possibly could to protect at all times vulnerable groups in our society, whether they be small or larger minorities, whether they be workers, unemployed people or people who were ill.  Of course, that does not surprise me in the slightest because in whatever Ministry he has served the standard of excellence of this Minister has always been high and clearly evident.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which provides protection for share fishermen and arises out of the Griffiths case in 1992, when it was decided that the employer/employee status did not exist in relation to share fishermen.</P>
      <P>All of the provisions of this Bill are extremely welcome.  Of course, it would be preferable if the Minister could see his way to extending the 13-week rule in relation to unemployment benefit, because a fisherman's job is an extremely difficult one fraught with many dangers. As has been said by previous speakers, there is an almost irrefutable argument for stating that the social protection afforded share fishermen should be the same as that afforded other members of the workforce.  Having said that, I strongly encourage the Minister to extend the provisions of the Bill to include occupational injuries benefit to share fishermen. That is something they would welcome enormously and indeed something they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one provision which may not <Col N="489" /> have received much notice in the Minister's introductory remarks but which is nonetheless extremely important.  That is the one concerning employers' PRSI contributions.  The Minister stated he had met representatives of the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation in regard to the levels of PRSI paid in that industry, indicating that he may well give consideration to reducing those levels.  I would welcome any such initiative on the part of the Minister, because there is no point in pretending that the increased level of VAT imposed in the last budget did not cause considerable difficulty within that industry.</P>
    <P>I have met several constituents, both from the retail and manufacturing sides, who have informed me that without doubt there has been a downturn in their activities which, in turn, has led to falling levels of employment in the industry. Always it is of enormous importance, in a small, open economy such as ours, that indigenous industry be given every possible break by the Government.  Therefore, I am extremely pleased to note that the Minister has met that federation.  I sincerely hope that the results of their discussions will be beneficial and fruitful, not merely for those engaged in the clothing industry as employers but also for their employees, in regard to their chances of maintaining employment, and for prospective employees in that industry.</P>
    <P>On another level I should like to welcome the Minister's decision to extend to voluntary development workers overseas the right to full rate unemployment and disability benefit on returning to this country.  There is no gainsaying the fact that by their work they make an unselfish, outstanding contribution.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister has recognised the contribution of that small group as well.  We must remember that in the final analysis a country's social welfare laws reflect its civilisation.  If small, vulnerable groups are not attended to by a caring Minister for Social Welfare, then society will be the poorer.  It has to be said that whenever such vulnerable groups, minorities or others, have <Col N="490" /> encountered difficulties in the social welfare area, the Minister's record has been extremely good in closing off loopholes and eliminating such difficulties as had been encountered.</P>
    <P>On a more general level there is urgent need for action to be taken about the length of time taken in having unemployment assistance appeals and all other social welfare appeals heard in the appeals office.  Prior to the establishment of the appeal office there had been delay in having appeals processed.  Unfortunately, my experience in relation to many of my constituents, ranging across a wide spectrum of social welfare entitlements, has been that appeals simply take too long.  Where an appellant may have a sustainable case, such delay causes a severe drain on the resources allocated for supplementary welfare allowance and results in a tremendous amount of anxiety and stress for families and others involved in that they have no certainty about their factual position.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precise steps should be taken to enable the appeals process to be dealt with more quickly. The delays in the office cannot be allowed to continue because people are experiencing grave difficulty as a result of the present position.  I am not critical of anybody in the appeals office, it is possible they do not have sufficient staff to deal with the appeals.  Whatever the cause, staff shortages or resources, I earnestly request the Minister to ensure that the appeals process is expedited in the interests of those who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Another area which I would like to mention relates to the free fuel scheme. I have come across people in receipt of minuscule pensions of £6 or £7 from Great Britain or elsewhere and they feel a tremendous amount of resentment and disappointment that if a pension is more than £5 they cannot qualify for the free fuel allowance.  That matter should be addressed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tough new regulatory powers to tackle abuses of PRSI and social welfare in certain sectors, including the building and construction industries, <Col N="491" /> no self-respecting public representative would support fraud or abuse of the social welfare or any system. However, when public statements are made in relation to issues such as this it should be pointed out that the problem is minor and that the vast majority of people in receipt of social welfare are receiving the sums concerned legitimately. It is always easy to taint a group who are unfortunate enough to be dependent on the State for their survival by a generalised statement.  People should be very careful in relation to such statements. Failure in this respect could do a disservice to those dependent on the welfare system and injure their dignity and pride.  However, we must accept there is a problem in relation to abuse and fraud and in this respect the provisions of the Bill will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>In short, the Bill safeguards the rights of a vulnerable group of workers engaged in a very difficult task.  Apart from their entitlement to protection under social welfare legislation I am particularly glad the Bill is before the House and will be passed.</P>
    <P>Of all the indigenous industries this one has the greatest potential but, sadly, it received the least attention from successive governments.  Small piers and harbours throughout the length and breadth of the country built at the behest of imperial powers and which provided a livelihood for small communities along the coastline are now in decay and ruin, which is very sad.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the Bill and earnestly request the Minister to carefully consider my proposal in relation to extending the protection for share fishermen, to include their entitlement to occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill, it is clear there is a general welcome for it. I agree with other Members that this Minister, in terms of dealing with the whole question of social welfare, is one of the most diligent and caring Ministers that has been involved in the social welfare <Col N="492" /> area.  That view is shared not alone by people involved in the various sections of the Department, where morale is very high, dealing with very difficult problems but by people unfortunate enough &mdash; I use that term carefully &mdash; to be in receipt of social welfare benefits but who would prefer to be working.  There is an appreciation that the Minister understands their circumstances and, since assuming office, has used every opportunity to ensure fairness in every respect and that it is seen to be part and parcel of how the whole area of social welfare is organised, how the various funds are distributed and allocated under the various subheads to the recipients.</P>
      <P>We are dealing principally with the position of the share fishermen.  Because of the Griffiths case in 1992 a serious question mark was raised regarding social insurance benefits.  Obviously that situation had to be cleared up.  This Bill goes a long way in reassuring people earning their livelihood in very uncertain conditions.  They do not know from day to day, week to week or month to month what level of income they will be able to sustain because they cannot predict the result of any day's fishing.  In addition the vagaries of the weather mean they may not be able to make a living.  Therefore, there must be a realistic fall back position that recognises the contribution these individuals make in terms of working in a recognised profession.  While they may not own the craft involved or earn a huge income they are, nevertheless, committed to operating vessels which give them the opportunity to be productive, to have a self worth and to earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that legislators enact provisions to cater for those who work in a sector of great uncertainty and have no guarantee of a livelihood.  The State should be in a position to assist it difficulties arise.  Obviously difficulties will arise when a person cannot work because of prevailing conditions and is unable to earn an income and second, when a person is injured or disabled.  The State should be in a position to assist the families of persons so affected.  I come from a fishing constituency and I know <Col N="493" /> this legislation will be welcomed by many people who earn their livelihood at sea.</P>
    <P>One point that intrigues me is how special contributions will be paid.  This issue needs to be addressed.  Irrespective of the level of income, most people experience difficulties in meeting a bill at the end of the year if they do not get into the habit of making regular contributions over a period.  This is not peculiar to persons in any particular walk of life.  I am as guilty as anybody else.  I prefer to make monthly repayments rather than having to face a bill at the end of the year when I have all sorts of other matters to worry about.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for people who want to contribute voluntarily to this scheme to make a minimum monthly contribution. That would encourage more people to join in the first instance and continue in the scheme.  More people will wish to join if the payment of contributions is organised on a monthly basis.  The minimum contribution of £250 per annum may be a great deal of money for a person to fork out at one time.  A person may not be in a position to predict his total income at the beginning of the year could make monthly payments on the basis of the minimum and the balance could be paid as funds permit.  The vast majority, if not all, those engaged in share fishing would be likely to get involved in such a scheme.  This would put into practice in a more practical way what the Bill is trying to achieve and people could avail of some of the benefits when times are not so good.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with the question of fraud.  He referred to the recent public comments about people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits. Those comments were hurtful but perhaps the point which was being put across was that the culture does not encourage people to take up productive employment when opportunities exist at a rate of return the same as the social welfare payment.  The culture is that it is simply not worth taking up a job in those circumstances.  That is the prevailing atmosphere, rather than that large numbers are abusing the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> We all know that there are not large groups abusing the system and, indeed, the statistics the Minister outlined are very encouraging.  However, it should also be very encouraging for legitimate employers to know that if they stick to their task and are honest in the operation of their business the State will ensure there is a level playing field in which to operate a business and that they can be as profitable as any other legitimate businesses. For far too long companies were operating on the margins with the effect that when employees lost their jobs they found out that their social welfare contributions had not been made.  It is of crucial importance that the area be cleaned up.</P>
    <P>I had to smile inwardly when I heard Members speak on the clothing industry. It should not have come as a surprise to Members on the Government benches to hear the effect the massive increases in VAT would have on the clothing industry. The Government received a report three months previously outlining how bad things were without any extra burdens being placed on them.  Some crocodile tears are being shed because the facts were well spelt out in this House but were not listened to.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister adverted to employers' PRSI contributions being out of sync with rates in the UK and other areas.  He expressed concern at the rate of employers' PRSI which is in excess of 12 per cent.  This causes difficulties for employers.  I applaud the Minister for saying that because this has been an enormous deterrent to employing people for a number of years.  I wonder if I am reading the signals right as I believe the Minister has sounded an optimistic note about what he and his Cabinet colleagues may be about to do in next year's budget. I do not wish to be presumptuous but I hope that what he said today on PRSI will become a reality.  I am a member of a number of committees, for example, the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment, the National Economic and Social Forum, the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; I have lost track of the number of committees that deal with <Col N="495" /> the question of employment &mdash; and in all discussions one cannot escape the artificial barriers that exist to creating employment.  By that I mean barriers created by Government.  All Governments have been party to this, no party in the House has a clean bib.  Governments create artificial barriers to employment, such as tax wedges, PRSI increases, increases in employees' and employers' PRSI contributions, VAT increases and the 1 per cent income levy.  All these measures are clearly anti-employment taxes.  If many of these taxes were removed it would not make a massive change in the unemployment figures but it would change the culture by making employment attractive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point and I will come back to this again.  The Minister understands the points I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with fraud and abuse we must have regard to the fact that £3.7 billion is available in the Department, a substantially greater amount than the tax take from the PAYE sector.  People are entitled to the money but is it realistic to pay out money without any return?  On the one hand an enormous amount of work remains to be done and on the other thousands of people are unemployed.  We must consider value for money from the point of view of the State and potential employees.  The provision of employment will have a major knock-on effect in boosting self-esteem, contribution to society and a person's value in society. The culture is wrong and we are all guilty. The way we deal with the culture is not helping to encourage people to become employed.  We need quite substantial cultural changes in our perception of the State role and how money made available to the State can be used productively in society.  If the money is productive, even if only in a marginal sense, there is more opportunity for all and in the long term <Col N="496" /> we might stem increasing demands on the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister introduced this measure in relation to share fishermen.  Will the Minister consider how contributions are to be paid as these payments could be streamlined?  I hope this measure will help to sustain people in fishing who would otherwise have had to leave because, without some assistance from the State, they would not have been able to make a legitimate contribution to society.  The fishing industry is worthwhile and offers potential for the future.</P>

      <P>I will do my best without promising to adhere strictly to the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  He has shown himself to be an innovative considerate Minister in all the portfolios he has held and his knowledge and grasp of the needs of the poor in society shines through every Bill he brings forward.</P>
      <P>The Bill relates essentially to 2,000 share fishermen.  The speakers represent constituencies with a strong fishing industry. The fishing industry is unique in that it is located in the villages around the coasts.  County Louth has its quota of share fishermen and its slice of the fishing industry in such places as Clogherhead. These areas play a significant role in local economies and in the economies of the greater region.  This industry is a national wealth creator, every time a fishing boat lands its catch it adds to the national cake.  It is important to recognise the role of fishermen in our economy through the social welfare or the industrial development codes.  It is a labour intensive industry and it will remain a labour intensive industry.  There will always be the boat owner, the share fishermen and the crew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the 1992 High Court decision left share fishermen in a vulnerable position so this legislation is very important <Col N="497" /> and timely.  We are talking about people who do not work normal hours.  They put to sea early and late and their occupation is very much at the mercy of the weather. Employment in this industry is volatile, unpredictable and dangerous on occasions.</P>
    <P>The importance of the fishing industry cannot be overstated.  In places such as Clogherhead in south east Louth the fishing industry plays a pivotal role in the local economy.  For a long time now the local fishing community have been campaigning for the development of a proper pier facility in the village.  It is urgently needed and we all look forward to favourable consideration of this application under the National Development Plan.  I am sure that the Department of the Marine is actively considering the case.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for rural development from 1990 to 1993 there was a special provision for small fishery harbours and Clogherhead was included in it.  The grant aid available was on a 50/50 basis and clearly many of the local authorities who effectively would have been expected to match the fund money were not in a position to provide it.  I hope that additional grant aid will be available to allow this much needed infrastructural work to proceed as the industry is too important to neglect.  It is important to the fishing communities in places like Clogherhead who need proper landing facilities and facilities from which fishing boats can put to sea.  It is important that those employed in the fishing industry have peace of mind.  Fishermen are similar to the rest of us; they are subject to ill health.  Often they are confined to land because of bad weather.  It is important that the social welfare code provides for payment of disability benefits to fishermen; and if they are unable to go to work they should be in a position to claim unemployment benefit.  Share fishermen pay mortgages, are subject to the normal weekly family financial demands and it is vital that they be in a position to meet those ongoing commitments. The Minister will assist our 2,000 share fishermen by the introduction of this legislation.</P>

      <P>As I come from a county where fishing plays an important role in the local economy, I am bound to welcome this legislation.  I concur with Deputy Kirk in that this Bill is of interest to all maritime Deputies and will impact greatly on the 2,000 share fishermen affected by it.  There has been much confusion and uncertainty in the fishery sector for a number of years, mainly because of two court cases to which some Members already referred.  <i>The Revenue Commissioners v. McLoughlin</i> case took place in 1986.  In that case the court held that each fishing trip was deemed a separate venture and that for the tax purposes the crew of a boat should be regarded as self-employed.  As a result of that judgment the Revenue Commissioners agreed that every boat owner should have the option of remaining a registered employer or of deregistering. To become deregistered permission had to be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners. Some owners opted for that while others remained registered.  As a consequence the Department of Social Welfare introduced a new system of collecting PRSI contributions from share fishermen.  That was a good scheme and ensured future benefits for such fishermen. It operated from February 1989 until February 1992, when the case of <i>The Department of Social Welfare v. McLoughlin</i> came before the courts.  The judgment in that case was practically the same as the 1986 one and consequently, since February 1992 the social welfare system does not provide for share fishermen. When signing on during periods of unemployment or disability they are means-tested for dole assistance and in many cases no assistance is payable as their means are based on the previous year's earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Share fishermen are in a difficult position. Due to the nature of their work, fishermen are subjected to long periods of unemployment and inactivity.  For example, they are at the mercy of the weather and during a spell of bad weather their boats are tied up and their families do not have any income.  In some cases fishermen may be 100 miles from home <Col N="499" /> when bad weather strikes and they have to pull into foreign ports in the north of Scotland or further afield and remain there until the weather is suitable for sailing and fishing again.  During such periods fishermen and their families do not receive any benefit under present legislation.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are also subject to the seasonal aspect of fishing.  The mackerel season is crucial to the economy of Donegal. Killybegs being one of the main mackrel fishing ports not alone here but also in Europe.  The mackerel fishing season starts around now and lasts until the spring time.  For the remainder of the year it is non-existent.  Also, herring, salmon and other species of fish are available only during certain periods of the year.  Fishermen who fish for those species have their boats tied up when they are not in season and under present legislation receive no social welfare benefits during that time.  Fishermen are also subject to the market forces of supply and demand.  If there is a good supply but no demand, prices will fall.  It is a very uncertain and hazardous occupation. There has been much confusion during the past number of years because of those court decisions.  Fishermen are subject to the hazards of the high seas and frequently suffer from illness and injuries during which time they are not entitled to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I would welcome any Bill that proposes to rectify and regulate those matters.  In saying that I am sure I speak on behalf of the fishing community in Donegal from Burtonport to Greencastle and many other places engaged in fishing activities. Fishermen must support their families, pay mortgages and meet other financial commitments.  They are confused and are suffering shortfalls at present because of the anomaly created by those court cases.</P>
    <P>Contrary to public perception, fishermen are not millionaires.  Most of us will have read the irresponsible articles in some newspaers which highlighted the huge sums of money made by fishermen. Many of my neighbours are fishermen and I would like to put on the record that <Col N="500" /> very few fishermen earn huge sums of money.  A few super trawlers operate on our seas, but they must also meet their overheads.  However, the fishermen we are discussing here are certainly not millionaires.  For many months of the year they receive no income whatsoever either from fishing or from the State.  In the past number of years <i>The Skipper, The Marine Times</i> and <i>The Fishing News</i> have run five or six pages advertising boats for sale.  There are more boats for sale than people investing in new vessels. That is a concrete indication of the position in the fishing industry at present.</P>
    <P>As a result of EC policies and CAP reform fishermen are now restricted to quotas and can no longer engage in unlimited fishing. When they reach their quotas they are required to tie their boat up until such time as they are entitled to go out again.  It has been brought to my attention this week that some fishermen are experiencing difficulties in their own fishing grounds, particularly in the Rock-all area.  I will not deal with that matter now as this Bill deals primarily with social welfare but I am mindful of the fact that the Minister was held in high standing when he held the position of Minister for the Marine.  I am glad that he continues to show an interest in fishermen.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will be welcomed by people in my constituency there is annoyance that it was presented almost without warning.  Although we have been aware of the difficulty for many years and that it was accentuated following the court case in 1992 there should have been more consultation and discussion with the industry before the Bill was presented. The first indication that this Bill would be introduced was given at the Ard-Fheis about two weeks ago, perhaps the Minister rushed the legislation so that he would have something to announce. However, I am not quibbling with this. The Bill has been introduced and it marks a step forward but, as I said, there should have been more consultation before hand.  We only received it a few days ago. Before Committee Stage the Minister should avail of an opportunity to meet <Col N="501" /> the fishermen and those involved in the industry as they may be able to show how the Bill can be amended and improved.</P>
    <P>Section 4 states that a person engaged in share fishing shall be entitled to opt to become an insured person under the new scheme subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in regulations.  How will an application be made and what conditions will apply?  Will every person who regards himself as a share fisherman be eligible and will there be an appeals mechanism? Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of other shortcomings. If a participant in the schemes ties up his boat and signs on for unemployment benefit will it be limited to a period of 13 weeks?  Given that a boat could be tied up for a number of months due to weather conditions and seasonality can this period be extended?  If a person is unfortunate enough to suffer an illness or is involved in an accident and has to sign on for disability benefit will this be limited to a period of one year?  The Bill states that contributions will be payable from 6 April 1994.  What will happen in the meantime if a person has to sign on for unemployment benefit or disability benefit?  If I am reading the Bill correctly people will not be entitled to receive any benefits for another two or three years.  As there has been hardship due to the court cases can the Minister say when those who participate in the scheme will be entitled to benefits?</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir ba mhaith liom, mar Theachta a thagann ó cheantar a bhfuil an iascaireacht iontach tábhachtach do eacnamaíocht an cheantair, fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and congratulate the Minister for introducing it.  It addresses in an effective and positive manner a most unsatisfactory situation from the point of view of the fishing industry.  As we are aware, in the past share fishermen were regarded as employees for social insurance purposes and were insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  However, the position changed as a result of a High Court case to which members referred. Following that case share fishermen were no longer regarded as employees.  Notwithstanding this some employers continued to cover their employees until 1992 when the Department of Social Welfare took a case against a person in my area for the non-payment of contributions. However, he won his case and this is the case that has given rise to all the problems.  As I said, these fishermen are now regarded as self-employed. However, they are left without vital cover during periods of illness and unemployment. This placed an additional burden on them leaving them in a legal limbo.</P>
      <P>Let us be in no doubt about the seriousness of this matter; many fishermen were affected.  Almost everyone working out of Dunmore East in my constituency, one of the five major fishery ports in the country, is engaged in share fishing. There is a lack of space in this harbour due to the increase in the number and size of fishing boats and trawlers using it. During the past 20 years the number has increased substantially.  More importantly, the rate of average displacement has increased threefold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of these fishermen are compounded during the herring season to which there was a reference earlier, to the extent that if there is a gale, boats may have to travel up river to seek shelter in other harbours.  Therefore, there is <Col N="503" /> an urgent need for additional quay side berths to satisfy demand.  Furthermore, during the summer months, pleasure craft and yachts from Britain or France en route to the south-west make their first call to the harbour.  However, because of the increase in the number of fishing boats using the harbour there is no space available for these craft but local fishermen try to co-operate with them.  As a former Minister for the Marine, the Minister is well aware of the position.</P>
    <P>Things have become so bad that one can walk from one side of the harbour to the other across the boats.  Something must be done to address the problem. Fishing is a tough job at any time of the year and these problems, on top of everything else, do not help.  The problem is being addressed in this legislation and the Minister is to be commended on his effective response.</P>
    <P>Some of the East Donegal Deputies referred to millionaire fishermen in Donegal.  That may be a perception but at least there is such a perception.  There is no such perception in my part of the country nor is there in Wexford.  Fishermen have problems and we must help them as much as we can.  Recently there was talk of categorisation.  The Department of the Marine wrote to the fishermen telling them what they were going to do and said they would consult with them afterwards.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>The herring season this year is very poor, but when things were good in 1991 the ports were closed down.  The uncertain nature of Irish weather leave share fishermen open to periods of unemployment. They have problems also with owners or skippers of vessels.  Usually there is a share for each man and corresponding share for the boat owner, and this is after the deduction of expenses.  In many cases extra shares are put in for gear etc.  That is another uncertainty that the share fishermen have to put up with in addition to the dangers inherent in carrying out their day-to-day work.  For all these reasons it is imperative that share fishermen, and their families, be <Col N="504" /> covered for unemployment and disability benefits as soon as possible.  This Bill addresses this need.</P>
    <P>The difference between unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit may not, at times, be great. Therefore it is possible that fishermen may not take up the option offered in this Bill.  They may be fearful of coming into the tax net for the first time.  Share fishermen with an income of more than £2,500 a year will have the option of paying special contributions which will entitle them to unemployment and disability benefits.  Those who opt for the scheme will pay a contribution of 5 per cent of their reckonable income in the previous income tax year up to the PRSI earnings ceiling and subject to a minimum contribution of £250 a year. Optional contributors will be entitled to disability benefit for a maximum of 52 weeks in any continuous period of illness. I welcome the fact that the payment covers a period of this duration. However, under this system somebody with a particularly low income may end up paying 10 per cent of his income to get cover and that seems excessive.</P>
    <P>Will fishermen and boat owners be able to take up the option if the fisherman opts in, will that impose additional duties on the owner of a boat?  What if he does not want to opt in?  What if he does not want to opt in?  Does he have a choice? Will owners pay employers' PRSI to the Department in respect of the money earned by the share fishermen?  I have spoken to people at home and the only opposition to this scheme seems to be coming from owners and skippers.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to a contractor.  If there is a problem in regard to a boat owner, can the fisherman be deemed to be the contractor even though he is not the owner of a boat?  Will the records kept by skippers, owners etc.  be matched with the returns coming in for the fishermen, and will that also cause problems?</P>
    <P>Not only in regard to social welfare legislation but also taxation the Government has been trying to get more compliance and that is welcome.  We have <Col N="505" /> been used to the attitude that anything will do and it may take a little time to convince everybody of the benefits of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry deserves the Government's full support.  The Minister for the Marine has indicated his commitment to our fishing industry.  Today, through this legislation, the Minister for Social Welfare has done likewise.  I hope this will be an ongoing process and that over the lifetime of the Government we will see many more progressive measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to provide for the introduction of an optional scheme of social insurance for people engaged in share fishing.  Under the proposed scheme those whose principal livelihood is derived from share fishing will have the option of paying additional special contributions which will provide insurance for disability benefits. Share fishing means that the profits from a catch, after deduction of expenses, are divided between the fishermen, the skipper and the owner of the boat.  In a test case in 1992 it was decided that fishermen are self employed people and are therefore not eligible for social employment benefits when they are out of work.  This Bill is an attempt to redress that and from that point of view it is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a perception abroad that fishermen are a well off sector in the port areas where they fish.  This is not so in many cases and, from my knowledge of fishing in Galway, it is certainly not the case there.  Fishermen may have to remain in port for extended periods. Restrictions on quotas may restrict fishermen fishing at certain times.  Unsuitable weather conditions make it dangerous or impossible for fishermen to fish and those conditions may prevail for three to four weeks or longer.  They are also restricted by the seasonality of the species they fish.  Mackerel fishermen in Galway must fish according to the fishing season of that species and they may be out of work for a long period of time. The threat of pollution in inner bays from <Col N="506" /> the disposal of untreated sewage into the sea is beginning to restrict the work of fishermen, particularly in inland port areas and in the port area of Galway.</P>
    <P>An EC directive due to come into force here in 1998 will provide that seaside towns will no longer be able to dispose of their raw sewage into bays without secondary treatment.  That directive is welcome.  I hope steps are being taken in our coastal areas to ensure that they will be in a position to implement and fulfil the provisions of that directive.  A new sewerage scheme has been prepared for Galway and is awaiting funding, but it has not been sanctioned.  It is difficult to believe that Galway, a city with a population of 52,000, is today still pumping its raw sewage into the bay.  That position cannot continue.  Finance must be provided to assist local authorities carry out the necessary work of secondary or tertiary sewage treatment in all seaside areas to avoid pollution of our bays.  The position can be neglected only for a certain length of time.  The sea cannot cure all our waste disposal problems?</P>
    <P>Repayments must be paid on a boat while it is tied up in dock and the crew are out of work during that time.  The boat may be tied up in a foreign port and the crew may have to maintain themselves for a considerable period until the weather is suitable for them to go to sea again.  Apart from the danger involved in fishing and the unsocial hours associated with it, the fishing industry is mainly a young man's profession.  People do not remain fishermen for all their working lives because of the heavy physical requirements and dangers associated with the job.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  I would like to have certain matters clarified on Committee Stage. Since the 1992 court case and, indeed prior to that, Fine Gael has advocated the provisions contained in this Bill.  I would like to tease out the sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.  Section 4 requires clarification.  Paragraph 24A (1) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> A person engaged in share fishing shall, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, be entitled to opt or become an insured person (&lsquo;optional contributor&rsquo;)...with effect from the contribution year beginning on the 6th day of April 1994...</P>
    <P>I will seek clarification of the optional extent of that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 35A (a) of section 7 states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding section 35, where in any period of interruption of employment a person, having satisfied the contribution conditions contained in section 32 by virtue of having paid optional contributions, has been entitled to disability benefit for 312 days,...</P>
    <P>Will disability benefit expire after 312 days in respect of a person who is out of work due to an accident or for some other reason?  What effect will the 13 weeks' contribution have in regard to the eligibility of fishermen to claim disability benefit or social employment benefit?  It is not appropriate to deal with these matters on Second Stage, but I will raise them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my unreserved support for the intention and principle contained in the Bill.  I live in a coastal area among fishermen and I am aware of their position for the past ten to 12 years. The Minister for Social Welfare is deserving of our congratulations for the thorough and speedy manner in which he has dealt with the issues involved.  Arising from two Supreme Court decisions share fishermen lost their long held status as employees.  They were left without vital PRSI cover during periods of illness and unemployment.  That matter has been referred to on many occasions.  We all know of such cases and may be inclined to cite the more serious cases where a fisherman may have been out of work for a period of time.  He would have had to put food on the table, meet his mortgage repayments and other normal financial family commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> I have always found that fishermen are prepared to work at any time of the day or night and always make a genuine effort to find work.  In the 1989 storm the piers in Kilmore Quay, Duncannon and Dunmore East were damaged.  Following that storm Kilmore Quay was not functional for a period of six months and that caused great difficulties for fishermen, who were unable to claim the unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  Fishermen are anxious to work at all times in all weathers.  When for whatever reason they are unable to fish, they are unable to find jobs onshore because those jobs are mainly in the fish processing industry. There are no jobs in that industry when fish stocks are not available.  Kilmore Quay is 15 miles from Wexford town and Duncannon is 20 miles from New Ross. It is difficult for people to travel that distance to seek work.  In such cases fishermen are without jobs and money. Many fishermen had to borrow for the period in which they were without funds. Under this Bill share fishermen will again be entitled to unemployment and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>A special word of thanks must be paid to the share fishermen in Kilmore Quay, with whom I worked very closely, who have been to the fore in this matter.  The persistence of their campaign, together with the enlightened approach of the Minister, has brought this Bill to fruition. This Minister, when Minister for the Marine, visited all the ports in the country and took time off when in Kilmore, Duncannon and Dunmore East to talk to the fishermen about their problems. When he then moved to his new job as Minister for Social Welfare he did not forget those unfortunate people, the lobby for whom is not great.  While the fishing industry has substantial priority in Government, nevertheless the number concerned is not sizeable.  I thank the Minister for his easy accessibility and understanding and for bringing this Bill to fruition.</P>
    <P>I spent a good deal of time discussing this Bill with share fishermen, particularly in Kilmore and Duncannon, and their reaction is one of thanks and is <Col N="509" /> overwhelmingly favourable.  However, these people put forward a number of points that could further improve the Bill.  Their main concern is that the period of 13 weeks disability cover is not sufficient. For example, in the event of bad weather, engine breakdown, unexpected repair work or, in cases such as that which arose in 1989 when Kilmore Quay was not functional, these people could be out of work for much longer than 13 weeks. This must be taken into account.  Like Deputy McCormack, I ask the Minister for clarification on disability payments.  I know of a number of people in Kilmore Quay who fell off the pier, had accidents relating to work or became ill and the period of disability payment as provided for in the Bill is not sufficient in cases such as these.  I ask the Minister to take on board this aspect.  Share fishermen are also concerned that they will have to wait until 1996 before they are eligible for benefit.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which these people are concerned is the cost of the premium.  A sizeable number of share fishermen may in any given year, earn less than £5,000.  I was interested to hear Deputy Kenneally refer to millionaires among fishermen.  I know of no millionaires in the fishing feet in County Wexford, and I know them all fairly well. Considering that some of these people earn less than £5,000 the minimum contribution of £250 represents more than 5 per cent of their earnings.  Essentially these people are being asked to pay extra premiums for less insurance that they received before the court decision.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of whether share fishermen will be entitled to unemployment assistance, as are other people, when the 13 week period of unemployment benefit is exhausted, this matter is not directly addressed in the Bill and I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the matter.  These people are concerned about liability for levies prior to April 1992.  I would ask the Minister what is the position in this regard. As many Members are aware, a number of people in self-employment, not necessarily fishermen, have received very high <Col N="510" /> tax demands from the Revenue Commissioners. Because share fishermen were regarded as self-employed some of these people in my constituency have been asked for substantial sums of money.  I cannot understand how these figures are calculated because they certainly are not derived from earnings in fishing.  Obviously I do not wish the Minister to comment on the taxation problem because it is not his responsibility but I would like clarification on liability for levies prior to 1992.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to sympathetically consider the points I raised on behalf of share fishermen.  I suggest that before the Bill is taken in Committee it might be fruitful if the Minister met again the delegation of fishermen from Kilmore Quay, with whom he has built up a substantial rapport, or indeed fishermen from any part of the country.  As I said, this Bill is a fantastic achievement on the Minister's part and by doing what I ask he can make it a little better.  Again, I thank the Minister for his prompt action in introducing the Bill and I congratulate him on a job well done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing forward this issue. It is often the case that small groups in society are ignored when something happens that adversely affects their position. I have admired for a long time the <Col N="511" /> Minister's ability to understand the social and economic contribution of groups such as share fishermen.  One matter that this Bill brings to light is the total change in employment patterns.  We are dealing here with a group of people for whom the employer-employee relationship is not the normal one, and increasingly we find that people fit into this pattern.</P>
    <P>Up to the time a court decision was made in 1992 share fishermen were considered as employees.  However, a High Court decision changed that position and left these people very vulnerable.  Under the Bill share fishermen will be entitled to disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  I accept that there were numerous difficulties in drawing up this Bill, particularly in striking the right balance between cost and benefit.  I recognise that a proper balance had to be struck.  It is very important for people with financial commitments &mdash; like everyone else, share fishermen have families to support and mortgages to pay &mdash; to be guaranteed an income during a season when work is not available.  The fishing industry is notoriour for its stop-start nature and for having good and bad years.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems facing people employed in seasonal employment is how to meet their commitments to lending institutions when they are laid off.  In this respect, I welcome the provision which will guarantee share fishermen who have been paying their contributions an income when they are not working.  I also welcome the provision relating to disability benefits.  The Minister should clarify the position regarding injury benefits.  While the payment of disability benefit for a year will cover many cases, fishing is a high risk industry and fishermen may sustain injuries which will prevent them working for longer than one year.  The Minister should ensure that occupational injury benefits cover will be paid on an ongoing basis, with no fixed time limit, even if fishermen have to make a small extra contribution.  It would be tragic if a fisherman who, as a result of an accident at work, was incapable of working in the <Col N="512" /> long term received no benefit after one year.</P>
    <P>Fishing can be classed as a high risk industry in the sense that very few fishermen work up to the age of 66.  Due to the nature of the work, and the need to be physically fit, it is fair to say that very few fishermen work on a full-time basis up to retirement age.  Indeed, many fishermen are forced to retire before they reach the official retirement age.  This is a problem for the people involved in the fishing industry.  The Minister should look at the long term consequences of this early retirement.  No provision is made in the Bill for invalidity pensions and older people who may have to retire due to arthritis or some other condition should be guaranteed an income rather than have to depend on disabled persons' maintenance allowance or some other means-tested benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a positive response to what is a practical problem and it will open up new possibilities in the insurance field.  I accept the difficulties involved in devising a scheme to deal with this problem.  I understand the background to the 1992 court case.  Perhaps we can discuss this and other difficulties at a later stage.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>Creidim féin gur dul chun cinn mór é. Is í an iascaireacht ceann de na tionscail go bhféadfaimis a fhorbairt ar an gcósta.

Ceann de na buntáistí móra a bhaineann le tionscal na hiascaireachta ná gur brabach iomlán don stáit é.  Is ceann de na tionscail é go bhféadfá a rá go bhfuil idir 90 faoin gcéad agus 100 faoin gcéad de bhrabach ag an eacnamaíocht as mar níl aon chur isteach air ó thaobh iomportála de seachas na báid féin san ábhar atá i gceist.  Mar sin tá fíorthábhacht go deo ag baint leis an tionscal <Col N="513" /> seo ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta de.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire, a bhí mar Aire na Mara agus a bhí thar a bheith gníomhach mar Aire na Mara, tar éis díriú ar an gceist seo agus teacht suas le réiteach air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their extensive contributions and welcome for the Bill.  They dealt in depth with its provisions and pinpointed some of the problems involved in devising a proper scheme.  As I said in my opening remarks, we were forced into a very difficult position. After the first court decision, regulations were drawn up which ensured cover and benefits for fishermen, particularly share fishermen.  That position obtained until the 1992 court case when, despite the best efforts of the Department of Social Welfare, fishermen were snookered, so to speak, and the regulations fell.  This left share fishermen in a very difficult position and created problems for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>This Bill will provide an optional special scheme for share fishermen.  It is very dangerous to provide a special scheme for any category of worker because, as many Deputies said, other categories of workers could also ask for special schemes.  The provision of special schemes is anathema to the social insurance system.  Many Deputies said they would like a smaller number of classes in the system.  However, instead of reducing the number of classes from 12 to three, as was suggested, we are increasing the number of classes to 13 for very good reasons &mdash; we are doing it to meet particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies sought to redefine the term &ldquo;share fishermen&rdquo; and asked what constitutes a crew.  We are bound by the High Court decision in this matter.  The Department of Social Welfare brought the case to court because an owner was not prepared to pay his employer's contributions and the Department was afraid that if this practice spread no contributions would be paid and share fishermen would be placed in a difficult <Col N="514" /> position.  The Department took the case in an effort to remedy the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it lost the case.  We are now faced with the situation described so well by Deputy Doyle.  As she has said, she has monitored this issue very closely, as indeed have other Deputies living in coastal areas.  I was asked to met the Killybegs fishermen and I would be happy to meet with any groups or organisations between now and Committee Stage.  I had extensive discussions with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and with representatives from Kilmore Quay.  They have a deep interest in the subject and have tried also to come up with solutions to the problem.  It is from those discussions that I brought forward these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why it is an optional scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot force people to do something that the courts say they are not required to do.  That is the problem. They are essentially self-employed people by definition and we cannot force them to be otherwise.  It may be possible to find a way to deal with that in the long term, but for the moment we are providing the option for people to participate in the scheme.  That can be discussed at greater length on Committee Stage.  As Deputies will be aware, if I am in a position to establish a scheme I prefer to get that scheme up and running and then modify it or consider other possibilities at a later stage.  To set up such a scheme in the first instance is difficult enough from the financial point of view, but it may be unwise to talk about other possibilities with the scheme for fear of sinking the ship for the ha'p'orth of tar. On the other hand, if we get a basic structure in place people will see that it will not be abused or require too much funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of those points have been made here today, particularly by Deputy <Col N="515" /> Mary Coughlan, who as a native of Donegal is closely associated with the fishing industry.  She made it clear that although there may be a few people around the country in the millionaire class, they would be very much the exception compared with some of the vast fleets that operate here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan also raised the question as to what happens the A1 stamps which have already been accrued and whether they will be taken into account in regard to entitlement to benefits.  A number of other Deputies raised that point also.  I can say that they will be credited, but since a person may be self-employed for a period in between, a gap may develop which may present a problem.  In some instances people would have credits in relation to, say, disability or unemployment benefit.  However, as I understand it, they would be few in number.  Another Deputy asked if those contributions will be taken into account in regard to pension rights and I can say they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan recognised that the cost involved in this scheme is sufficiently high as far as the individuals are concerned. The problem now is that there is no longer an employer-employee situation. In normal circumstances the employer and the employee both make a contribution, but that is the difficulty with the situation we face now.  I can tell the <Col N="516" /> Deputies that this scheme will cost us money; that is the reality.  On the other hand, as some Deputies have said, there is the question of solidarity.  There are the exceptional circumstances where people have made contributions all along and I recognise that.  The fishing industry is a fairly hazardous one but it is also an industry which is in a very special position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned the fact that boats could be tied up for up to 26 weeks in a year.  Indeed, Deputy Doyle said that in some years they could be tied up for 13 weeks while in others it might be 26 weeks and she asked whether we could examine the possibility of a rollover situation where the years could perhaps be combined.  I will certainly consider that between now and Committee Stage to see if there is any merit in the proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan also asked what would happen following the 12 month period of disability benefit.  What would follow that depends on the individual circumstances. Immediately following the cessation of disability benefit the person would be entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance and then the person might qualify again for a further period of disability benefit.  However, we can discuss this on Committee Stage.  I had intended including that in my contribution today but decided that it was more appropriate to deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan and several other Deputies raised the question of accidents on board ships.  That, of course, raises the question of occupational injury.  This is an issue that I will consider, bearing in mind that I am setting up a new scheme that is not in expensive in practice. However, I believe that, where possible, occupational injury benefit should be available in all sectors and we will consider how that might be dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the possibility of my meeting with various groups between now and Committee Stage and Deputy Coughlan referred to the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation.  I was actually due to meet that organisation last <Col N="517" /> Monday but because of its European commitments it was unable to keep the appointment.  I am scheduled to meet the organisation next Wednesday.</P>

That is not necessarily reflected in the media but nevertheless it is a reality.  Much of the change that has been brought about in this House over the years has come from the convictions of Oireachtas Members. The change has not always come about as soon as the Members have the conviction because I may not be able to provide funding at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we do pursue those issues fairly actively.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan raised the question about people who may also work in a fish factory.  In that case one could qualify for benefit under the contributions from the fish factory, which are full A1 contributions, or one could combine the two in order to qualify for such benefit. These could all be combined, which would be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan asked when one comes into benefit, whether people could <Col N="518" /> pay back contributions to enable them to come into benefit sooner and whether we would examine that position.  Certainly we will examine it.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Rabbitte on Tuesday, 23 November 1993:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the collapse of the talks for another Programme for Economic and Social Progress provoked by the failure of the Government to terminate the 1 per cent income levy and eliminate the &lsquo;dirty dozen&rsquo; social welfare cuts; and, in view of the hardship caused by both measures, calls on the Government to reverse them in the next budget. </P>

      <P>I listened with a certain amount of difficulty to Government Ministers last evening.  Judging by their reactions to the motion it is obvious that Fianna Fáil and Labour have very short memories.  If one or both parties had honoured their pre-election promises or budget statements, there would have been no need to table this motion as the talks about another programme for economic and social progress would have been making progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, <Col N="520" /> Deputy Burton, had the audacity to accuse Opposition Members of intellectual dishonesty.  This time last year the Labour Party had concluded its general election campaign based on commitments to reversing the so-called dirty dozen cuts and reducing the taxation of low-paid workers.  The constant hypocrisy of the Labour Party is so brazen it defies belief.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare will admit that in April last she misled the public by claiming repeatedly that all the dirty dozen cuts had been reversed.  Indeed she accused Deputy De Rossa &mdash; I am sure he will support me in this &mdash; of dishonesty when he pointed out correctly that only four of the 12 cuts had been modified.  Yet the Minister of State could say last evening that the Opposition had an unwarranted obsession with cuts in social welfare.  Such a statement on the part of a Minister with responsibility for poverty, is extraordinary, particularly when her party claims to be the champions of the poor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is simply no justification for the self adulation in which the Minister engaged last evening for any of the changes effected in social welfare.</P>
      <P>Today social welfare payments represent the same proportion of GNP as they did in 1982.  We must remember also that, since 1982, the average industrial wage has increased by 14 per cent in real terms whereas spending per head on social welfare increased by approximately 10 per cent.  Will the Minister accept that 80 per cent of social welfare recipients are in receipt of payments below the minimum level of income recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister for poverty, <Col N="521" /> by not only opposing this motion but by the entire tone of her contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the entire tone of the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare she will now have to convince us by her actions that her aspiration is to eliminate poverty rather than perpetuate it.</P>
      <P>Now locked in Government by its senior partners, no longer having the freedom to preach about the needs of the unemployed or social welfare recipients, the Labour Party does not want anybody else to speak on behalf of those people either.  I warn the Government parties that we will not be silent or be silenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1992 the Leader of the Labour Party, now Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, accused the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, of social vandalism because of the dirty dozen cuts.  At a Labour meeting in Clonmel in my constituency, he went even further and described the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy as &ldquo;a cut a fortnight Minister&rdquo; who was hacking away at social welfare entitlements at the rate of approximately one every two weeks.  Deputy Spring said that the then Minister for Social Welfare was deliberately and consciously trying to create a new type of citizen, that Deputy McCreevy and Fianna Fáil thought in <Col N="522" /> terms of two classes of people, donor and recipient, and that, for very crude political reasons, it was endeavouring to exploit the fears and prejudice of that mythical donor class by turning the equality mythical recipient class into scapegoats.  Deputy Spring continued to say that he had news for the then Minister, that there was one class of citizenship only and that all the Minister's efforts to create second-class citizens, based on the appeal to politics of envy and begrudgery, would fail.  That is the recorded view of the Leader of the party of the Minister of State on the dirty dozen cuts last year about which she now claims the Opposition parties have an unwarranted obsession.  Those were her Leader's views on social welfare cuts which she claimed in the course of her contribution last evening were really not all that important.  In fact she said:</P>
    <P>There are other, much more serious, issues in the social welfare system which do need consideration but which have been ousted from discussion by the unwarranted obsession with the 1992 cuts on the part of certain people.</P>
    <P>What a U-turn, what blatant hypocrisy. The Minister for Finance endeavoured last evening, but failed, to justify the Government's continued refusal to eliminate the 1 per cent income levy introduced in the last budget.  He will not listen to Congress, Members of this House, or the loud opposition voices among the public at large.  He explains that domestic and international bodies such as the ESRI and the OECD want him to reduce the national debt further, thereby obliging him to retain the 1 per cent levy for at least another year.  Perhaps the Minister is surprised that the imposition of this levy provoked such a backlash but he must face the reality that the levy is being imposed on modest incomes.  Neither is any allowance made for the payment of a levy when a person's income tax liability is computed.  In other words, the money extracted from the citizen in the form of the 1 per cent levy is also subjected to PAYE and other income tax.  Therefore, the blatant assertion on <Col N="523" /> the part of the Minister for Finance that he must frame his budgetary strategy in accordance with the desires of the ESRI, the OECD, the World Bank and others is formal confirmation on the part of Fianna Fáil and Labour that their primary objective is to reduce, the national debt.</P>
    <P>How can we expect a Government, so obsessed with lofty aspirations to reduce the national debt, to have firm control over public finances?  I admire its aspirations but certainly not when the price must be paid by those who suffer from the effects of the 1 per cent income levy and the dirty dozen social welfare cuts.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we now face a future without any <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because of the Minister's stubborness about the 1 per cent levy and Labour's disregard of the dirty dozen.</P>
    <P>I support the motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have been good for this country. We have achieved much that would not otherwise have been achieved.  We have secured a level of economic growth that is the envy of most European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in improving our social welfare services. Weekly payments for the 800,000 people and their 700,000 dependants on social welfare have been kept ahead of inflation.  Some 83 per cent of people now receive the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. Real progress towards achieving the <Col N="524" /> priority rates for the remaining group has been made through consistently targeting this group for special increases.</P>
    <P>Families have benefited significantly through child benefit increases and improved family income supplement for those bringing up families on low pay. Measures have been introduced to tackle fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming of benefits and to protect the workers PRSI fund.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the security of occupational pensions schemes has been strengthened to protect the £13 billion in assets which the 500,000 members of these schemes have invested.</P>
    <P>We have improved the range of options for second chance education and introduced new work return supports for unemployed people and lone parents.</P>
    <P>A new relationship between Government and the voluntary sector has been achieved and will be developed further.</P>
    <P>All of these improvements, which cover every section of Irish society &mdash; workers, employers, those who depend on social welfare, those who work full-time in the home and those who work with voluntary and community groups &mdash; have been made possible by the consensus approach brought about by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These agreements have harnessed the commitment of the Irish people represented by the social partners in a concentrated drive to build a stable economy and a better future for everyone.</P>
    <P>We need another programme for economic and social progress type agreement with the social partners if the progress made to date is to be consolidated and progressed.  We must be positive and forward looking.  These objectives are far from the minds of those who tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>I have made my position on the 1992 measures &mdash; the so-called dirty dozen &mdash; very clear in this House on a number of occasions.  I hope the Deputies opposite are in no doubt in that regard.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the Government provided for a range of improvements to social welfare <Col N="525" /> including a 4 per cent increase in weekly payments and special increases for those on the lowest payments.  Those improvements cost some £85 million in 1992 and £162 million in a full year.  This year's budget provided for a general increase of 3.5 per cent in weekly payments and a number of other improvements at a cost of a further £180 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on social welfare services increased from around £3.1 billion in 1991 to £3.4 billion in 1992 and to £3.7 billion in 1993.  That is a measure of this Government's commitment to improving the position for those who are dependent on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The other social welfare measures introduced in 1992 which had an impact on particular groups have been reviewed. Some have been eased substantially and in other cases I have taken significant initiatives to alleviate the difficulties which they cause for people.  I will continue to review the impact of the remaining measures on people and any further changes necessary will be made.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputies opposite, I will briefly set out the adjustments that have been made.  First, the introduction in 1992 of a new contribution condition for receipt of disability benefit which requires at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year was revoked for people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance.  These people could not satisfy the new paid contribution condition because they were already on social welfare.  Second, the contribution condition for receipt of dental and optical benefits requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year was revoked for people in receipt of disability benefit for more than 12 months, invalidity pension, long term unemployment assistance, and pre-retirement allowance.  Third, dental and optical benefits have been restored to pensioners affected by the change in the contribution condition for receipt of those benefits requiring five years paid contributions instead of three.  Fourth, dental and optical benefits have been restored to PRSI contributors earning up <Col N="526" /> to £30,000 per annum and £60,000 per annum if the contributor has a dependent spouse.  The previous earnings limits were £25,000 and £50,000 respectively. Fifth, access to unemployment benefit which was restricted for certain part-time and casual workers has been substantially improved.  The condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit for part-time workers has been relaxed by reducing from two days to one day the loss of employment which a part-time worker must incur in order to be regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment.  Sixth, the amount of daily earnings disregarded in assessing earnings from casual insurable employment for unemployment assistance purposes has been substantially increased.  The new disregard amounts to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an extra £15 for each day worked.  This is a very practical improvement.  It means that a married man with two children can now earn up to £34.42 for each day in which he works without affecting his rate of unemployment assistance for the days in which he does not work.  A full review of the eligibility rules for unemployment benefit for all categories of casual workers is underway and if necessary, I will bring forward legislation to address their situation.</P>
    <P>Seventh, as regards exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the circulars issued to health boards have been withdrawn since last June and have been replaced by a new code of practice for those on social welfare who are having difficulty in meeting their fuel bills.  I believe this measure will be progressive and developmental.  Not only will it cure the difficulties that were created but it will bring the whole system forward in the direction in which I think Members would like to see it developing.</P>
    <P>I want particularly to make it clear to Deputies the importance of the new code of practice.  This code of practice has replaced the controversial circulars issued in 1992 to health boards which had the effect of limiting the assistance given as an exceptional need in respect of fuel <Col N="527" /> bills.  The objective of the new code of practice is to link the various supports offered by the utilities and the health boards so as to provide a co-ordinated assistance programme for those on social welfare payments who get into difficulty with their ESB and gas bills as a result of exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The code sets out agreed procedures to be followed by the utilities in responding to the customer's difficulty.  An important feature of the new code is that discretion to make payments to customers with exceptional needs rests entirely with the health board.  Let me emphasise that point.  Discretion to make a payment remains an integral feature of the new arrangements.  When we talk about an exceptional need, an example might be where there is sickness in the household or where the customer is obliged to meet other essential needs. I am satisfied that the new procedures enshrined in the code of practice will offer the customers a practical and supportive basis for resolving difficulties with outstanding bills.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the initiatives I have taken, as a result of my review, has been to alleviate any particular difficulties identified as arising from last year's measures.  I assure the House that the measures still in force will continue to be reviewed in the light of their impact on social welfare customers and any further necessary changes will be made.</P>

      <P>I believe the country needs another programme for economic and <Col N="528" /> social progress.  The Government wants another partnership agreement to share and shoulder the tasks and opportunities that lie before it over the next few years. Above all, young people and the unemployed depend on the social partners to show the way for a breakthrough in tackling unemployment and developing our valuable indigenous resources.  Let us concentrate especially on our indigenous resources and talents, on the needs of our young people and those without work.</P>
      <P>The Government has participated in a responsible way in the pre-PESP talks and has made it clear that it will be imaginative, progressive and realistic in a further <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  The parameters are clear.  Both sets of doors are open.  The Minister for Finance and the trade unions have made that very clear. Let us use both &ldquo;doors&rdquo; together, put the country first and come to the table and talk business for another <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in the value of a consensus based approach to solving our economic problem and securing a stable economic and industrial relations climate.</P>
      <P>In negotiating any new national consensus both sides must bring something to the table.  The Government has clearly signalled its commitment that the 1 per cent levy is to be temporary and on 15 November put forward proposals to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to begin phasing out the 1 per cent levy in the 1994 Budget and to complete this process not later than the 1996 Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined by my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, last night and by the Minister for Social Welfare tonight, substantial progress has been made in the social welfare area.  But real negotiations mean that both sides must bring something to the table.  There has to be commitment to an agreement that actually delivers on stability.  There has to be certainty in planning the public finances. Most important, any new agreement <Col N="529" /> must focus on the greatest single problem facing the Irish economy, that of unemployment. It must be an agreement that maintains and improves competitiveness, that supports the creation of new jobs and, as is so clearly a central issue, one which retains existing jobs.</P>
    <P>Tackling unemployment must be the cornerstone of any new agreement to replace the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Just as in the late eighties the problem of the public finances was top of the agenda in negotiating the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, now is the time to put tackling unemployment to the top of the agenda in any new national settlement.  Unemployment has virtually trebled since 1980 and the rapid growth in the labour force and the prolonged recession in Europe which have helped fuel that increase are likely to continue for some time to come.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan was drawn up to maximise the long term return to the Irish economy in terms of economic growth and job potential.  A central response to hard-core unemployment is the £900 million.  Local development programmes are targeted at unemployment blackspots and the long term unemployed.  The success of the plan in achieving the top range of job targets is crucially dependent on domestic economic responses and in particular the maintenance and improvement of competitiveness.  Any new pay agreement should be driven by the need to create and maintain employment and the need to tackle the problems of long term unemployment.  While we all aspire to improved standards of living, we need now to put jobs first.</P>
    <P>To achieve a real consensus focused on unemployment may involve all sides moving away from established positions and being prepared to make short term concessions in the wider interest.  The broad approach to pay determination has to concentrate on improving our competitiveness through pay moderation.  It must also aim for a settlement at a level which will enable resources to be assigned to policies for improving employment.  We need to establish structures <Col N="530" /> where people can see that their sacrifices are being translated into jobs and not just disappearing down an economic black hole.  Restraint on the pay side must be matched by restraint in the growth of other incomes.</P>
    <P>In order to improve our employment performance it is vital that we improve competitiveness.  While competitiveness involves productivity, product quality, management and a host of other factors, competitive factor incomes, including wages, are central to employment growth, particularly in indigenous industry and services, which are our most labour intensive economic sectors. Ireland exports 70 per cent of what we produce.  Competitiveness is clearly essential in the exposed sectors of the economy, those competing at home and abroad with goods and services of other countries.  Calculations using the Department of Finance's economic model suggest that every 1 per cent improvement in competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trading partners results in an extra 4,000 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, those at work across all sectors had substantial increases in earnings.  In manufacturing, earnings increased by 16 per cent; in the public sector, by 21 per cent, and in the building sector, by 30 per cent.  These are substantial increases when compared to the 8 per cent cumulative increase in inflation over the period.</P>
    <P>Over the first two years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, we had little or no gain against our main trading partners as a group, against the UK or against the former ERM narrow-band countries.  This year we expect to gain about 6 per cent competitiveness against our main trading partners and a little over 3 per cent against the former ERM narrow-band, but a loss of over 1 per cent against the UK is forecast where we export our most labour intensive produce.</P>
    <P>This year's gain in relative competitiveness has been due to devaluation rather than moderate growth in incomes. In the longer term, of course, devaluation <Col N="531" /> increases import prices, which tends to cancel out short term gains, and moderate wage settlements must be the key to long term competitiveness gains.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness is equally important in the non-traded sector of the economy, in public and private services which are sheltered from direct competition with the outside world.  The cost of these services, whether in the private sector or in the public sector, has to be financed by the rest of the economy and should not put our traded sector at a competitive disadvantage or serve to lower the economy's job performance.</P>
    <P>Restrictive practices and lack of competition means that many private services impose excessive costs on the traded sector of the economy, costing jobs.  For example, the cost of banking and legal services and the excessive insurance costs we face in this country due to the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; mentality, all make Ireland an expensive place in which to do business and serve to lower our economic performance.</P>
    <P>Pay determination in the public sector poses two separate issues.  First, the overall level of pay settlements should reflect what both the public finances and the wider economy can afford.  The overall level of pay increase comprises annual increments, basic increases under national wage rounds and special pay claims.  The public sector need to be able to compete fairly for skilled workers, and mechanisms are needed to ensure that pay levels in key areas do not fall behind the private sector in a way which jeopardises efficiency.  The mechanisms for special pay claims have been the subject of detailed negotiations with unions and Civil Service management.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government spells out an ambitious agenda for reform, for improved public services, for example, for the mentally handicapped and the homeless, and for tax relief targeted on the low paid and those caught in poverty traps.  To implement this agenda we need cartainty in planning the public finances.  It is my personal belief that mechanisms are needed in any new <Col N="532" /> national agreement to ensure certainty in the total public pay bill, both general pay increases and &ldquo;specials&rdquo;.  Such a system is essential if Governments are to be able to plan ahead with any degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years inflation has averaged just over 3 per cent and is forecast to be slightly over 1½ per cent this year, the lowest inflation rate in over 30 years.  However, any new pay settlements must take account of both the almost nil inflation rate at home and, more particularly, the anticipated movement of prices in our trading partners, where many are now facing falling output prices, posing both a competitive challenge and an alarming fall in real spending power in many of our customer countries.</P>
    <P>With Europe deep in recession there is a real need for a serious growth initiative at European level on a scale sufficient to tackle the problems of falling output and rising unemployment.  As an exporting country Ireland has a particular interest in developing such an initiative, as our prosperity depends critically on that of our customer nations.  Microeconomic policies alone, aimed at securing better functioning labour markets, will not rescue Europe from the depths of the current recession.  Europe as a whole is close to a large closed economy, not a small open economy, and small open economy policies in individual countries on aggregate turn out to be the wrong policy for Europe as a whole.  Expanding investment can give the European economy the short term lift and long term supply side improvements needed to improve the European economies' competitive and long term performance.</P>
    <P>In this context Ireland's high savings ratio, which is not being translated into productive investment, is lowering our growth potential.  It is hoped that lower interest rates, with the steady fall in rates since last January, will help a pick-up in investment.</P>
    <P>The Government is willing to open negotiations with the social partners on a national consensus on pay and jobs.  In keeping our door open, it must be <Col N="533" /> emphasised that we need a sense of realism.  There are no blank cheques for reducing the tax burden, increasing social services, reforming the welfare system or for paying ourselves.  Any reductions in taxation have to be paid for elsewhere, and must be done in a way which safeguards the public finances and essential public services.</P>
    <P>In expressing the Government's willingness to enter meaningful and realistic negotiations with jobs as the priority, in implementing major reforms in the welfare system, and in placing a commitment on the table about the phasing out of the 1 per cent income levy, the Government is asking the other social partners to come to the table in an equal spirit of generosity.  We want to see all sides around the table putting into practice what so often is lipservice &mdash; let us put jobs first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must proceed to lift the 1 per cent income levy irrespective of whether there is a new national pay agreement.  Obviously the pace of its removal must be linked to a radical new approach which would put employment first.  Both the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment have clearly indicated the time table for the removal of the levy.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible to ignore the context in which the 1 per cent levy was introduced.  Approximately £280 million in additional public service pay costs arose in 1993 and £70 million was paid out in December 1992 to meet existing commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> A forecast by the Department of Finance on interest rate developments in 1993 has proved to be very conservative.  The Labour Party has consistently maintained that lower interest rates were possible. There was also an unstable currency situation in the ERM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1 per cent levy must go in the context of a Government policy to tackle unemployment seriously.  We want the trade unions to agree a realistic pay agreement but the Government cannot address unemployment if those at work <Col N="534" /> are not prepared to trade off some proportion of income increases in return for increased recruitment by both the public and the private sectors.  National pay agreements go back to 1964.  If we analyse national agreements over the past 25 years we can agree that one consistent factor has been a trade off in relation to pay increases, of embargoes on public service recruitment and the stifling of employment growth in the economy. That is what happened in the 1980s under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and it must be avoided in the next national agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with the sentiments in the motion tabled by my colleagues in Democratic Left on the removal of the levy but some of the comments about the Department of Social Welfare have been very unfair.  I campaigned on some of the key elements of the dirty dozen social welfare cuts, for instance the removal of optical and dental benefit and disability benefit for long term unemployed people.  They, and various other cuts have been fully restored.  A major difficulty for Deputies who represent the constituencies encompassing large unemployment areas is related to supplementary welfare benefit. We campaigned hard for a code of practice and the Minister has recently come up with such a code which is beginning to make an impact.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with unemployment we must aim higher than previous administrations. To put the live register in perspective, unemployed people would much rather pay income tax than be forced to rely on the dole.  I am heartened that the Delors paper on Growth and Employment set the objective of reducing the EC unemployment rate by half, by the year 2000.  In the context of Ireland, this would translate into a reduction in the live register of at least 140,000 or 20,000 per annum over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>A number of critical decisions must be taken if we are to see this through.  I was surprised that the Governor of the Central Bank did not once refer to the research findings of his staff which estimate <Col N="535" /> that 32,000 jobs were lost from 1980 to 1992 because of the appreciation of the punt.  The latest NESC study, A Strategy for Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, in its comments on exchange rate policy echoes the silence of Mr. Maurice Doyle on the currency debacle which affected this country, courtesy of the Bundesbank and the ERM.  I am relieved that Mr. Peter Cassells, General Secretary of ICTU, has criticised the report as being too conservative in its approach to unemployment. What worries me is that the study appears to rubber stamp an automatic return to the old narrow bands ERM which simply means Bundesbank rule.  The deputy leader of our German sister party, the SPD, Mr. Oskar La Fontaine, has attacked the Bundesbank's policy.  In <i>The Financial Times</i> this week he said:</P>
    <P>It was a great mistake to have raised interest rates once again at the beginning of the recession.  That has cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, because exports have collapsed.</P>
    <P>He made the point that the 10 per cent effective revaluation of the Deutsche Mark against other European currencies has the same affect on German export prices as a 33 per cent wage increase.</P>

      <P>Listening to the proposers <Col N="536" /> of the motion last night I felt that this was an attempt to embarrass the Labour Party rather than anything else and as a member of Fianna Fáil I almost felt left out of the argument.  The motion regrets the collapse of the talks and we would all share that regret, but to say that the collapse was provoked by Government is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Trade unions here are becoming a bit like the Unionists in the North.  They are afraid to sit down, afraid to talk, afraid to get in and do some hard bargaining. They cannot expect the agreement to come to them so I would urge the unions to get in and do their best for their members.</P>
      <P>Nobody welcomed the levy and we all hoped it would be temporary.  The Government has indicated its willingness to abolish it over two or three years although it has not said how that will be done.  It has not said whether it will reduce the levy by two-thirds of 1 per cent next April and by one-third of 1 per cent of the following April, or whether the threshold will be increased next April to £280 and the following year to £380. Most people did not object to the levy in principle but that it applied at such a low level.  It is clear that one interpretation of the Government's offer would exclude most industrial workers from the levy from next April.  In that context, I cannot understand why the unions do not negotiate for their members.</P>
      <P>I was an active trade unionist for years and I am aware that under a national agreement everyone is looked after.  In a free-for-all strong employees are looked after but vulnerable employees fall by the wayside.  I appeal to the unions to talk and to look after their members.</P>

      <P>Tonight the Progressive Democrats will oppose the Government amendment to what we regard as a timely Private Members' motion tabled by <Col N="537" /> Democratic Left.  A key reason for that relates to the fact that we could not support the Government's brazen prevarication on the question of removing the 1 per cent levy which should never have been imposed and which should not be the kind of issue which would lead to a collapse in the negotiations on a pay consensus.  That appears to be the case.</P>
      <P>From the day of its announcement the Progressive Democrats opposed this fifth tax on work, which has added, as the Minister for Finance belatedly admits, the equivalent of a 2 per cent increase to the standard rate of tax.  It was a means of bringing in by the back door a measure which, if spelled out clearly on the first day, would have been grossly unacceptable even at the Cabinet table.  Now that we know it is the equivalent of writing off the changes in the basic tax rate of the previous year, this crude measure should be disposed of now.  It was never anything more than a smash and grab tactic for money, introduced without due regard for its effects on individual taxpayers or its employment consequences.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech on 24 February last the Minister for Finance stated that the levy would yield approximately £78 million during 1993 and £130 million during a full year.  It is interesting to note from the Minister's speech last night that during the several months since the Minister made that speech the £130 million yield for a full year has increased to £145 million.  If this levy was designed as a temporary measure, why not dispose of it now?  Why wait until the public finances grow fatter from its yield, when weaning the Exchequer off will be more difficult then weaning if off now following a temporary introduction and before a full year's yield is produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In revenue terms it would be easier for the Government to say no now rather than in the future.  If the anticipated receipts for this year are the £78 million gross which the Minister stated would be the case in his budget speech last February, I estimate that the net cost to the Exchequer of abandoning the levy at this stage would be the equivalent of £65 million in terms of the closing budget position <Col N="538" /> for the current financial year.  If that is the case the Government should call it a day now and drop what was an ill-conceived measure from the outset.  If this is a way of opening the doors, about which the Minister for Social Welfare spoke tonight, for consensus on pay policy and competitiveness in the future, the price should be considered seriously by the Government.  Once we start to gear up on the full year revenue effect of this levy, gearing down will be much more difficult than disposing of it now.</P>
    <P>Can we afford to do without the £65 million?  It is simple in any political speech, particularly in Opposition, we claim what we can.  But I noted with interest the case with which the Minister for Finance explained how, because of a European Court decision in respect of enforced changes in the VAT proposals in this year's budget, we would have a shortfall of £65 million on the figure stipulated in the original budget estimate.  Will he close down shop as a result?  Will it wreck the world as we know it?  Will it throw the public finances into gross disarray; or is it a shortfall the Government can afford to live with, give or take a little?</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy McDowell, this week, the Minister stated that he remains satisfied the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1993 will be reasonably close to the budget estimate of 2.9 per cent of GNP.  Therefore, the Minister is not unduly perturbed about the economic consequences of a £65 million VAT shortfall this year as a result of a European Court decision.  A sum of £65 million was explained away with comparative ease yesterday by the Minister; but the net cost of disposing of the levy, which would amount to approximately £65 million in respect of this year's out-turn, could not be contemplated.</P>
    <P>The truth is revealed when one compares the casual ease with which assurances were given in respect of the financial effects of the VAT changes and the doggedness of the Government's position in maintaining the 1 per cent income levy.  It is obvious the Government <Col N="539" /> will not give in on the 1 per cent levy, even though it gave in with ease to the financial consequences of the European Court decision this week.  This little arrangement is not a temporary one and was never designed to be so temporary as to be fleeting.  If, as Deputy Broughan stated, the Labour Party backbenchers have no difficulty in supporting that aspect of the motion, then the Deputy should know how to vote.  It is votes such as his that made this levy law and maintain it in law.  It is pointless having an each way bet on this matter.  If one opposes the levy, there is a parliamentary mechanism to show that opposition.</P>
    <P>The Government should not have introduced this smash and grab income levy in the first place.  Neither should it have allowed the levy to become what appears to be the key obstacle in achieving consensus on pay and competiveness in the economy, if that is what the Government wants.  The example of the VAT changes, to which I referred earlier, begs the question as to what the Government wants.  The intransigence of this Administration on the 1 per cent levy poses a question in the minds of Members of the Progressive Democrats about the seriousness of the Government in its assertion that it wants the social partners to sit down and hammer out a new consensus. It is because of that intransigence that the Progressive Democrats will be voting against the Government's amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare stated earlier:</P>
    <P>The parameters are clear.  Both sets of doors are open.  The Minister for Finance and the trade unions have made that very clear.  Let us use both &ldquo;doors&rdquo; together, put the country first...</P>
    <P>It is pointless calling on people, whether it is Unionists in Northern Ireland or unions in the Republic, to come through an open door to meet a closed mind.  If the 1 per cent levy is a temporary measure I fail to understand why we cannot dispose of it now when we have not yet seen <Col N="540" /> its results in a full year and when the withdrawal symptoms would have less impact than in the future when, presumably, it will be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Discussion on pay policy inevitably focuses one's attention on the overall competitiveness of the Irish economy. As the Minister for Finance assured the House last night, Ireland has some basic achievements of which we can all be proud.  The recitation of those basic achievements was repeated at length this afternoon during Question Time.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance stated that during the three years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> GDP growth is expected to average about 3.5 per cent per annum here compared with just over 0.5 per cent in the European Union and a decrease of more than 0.25 per cent in the UK economy during the same period.  That growth has been export driven and there has been an impressive growth in merchandise exports of more than 11 per cent during that time.  Those figures are not peculiar to the lifetime of the current <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In her review of economic statistics, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance correctly sought a wide focus and quoted figures spanning a decade in terms of employment, economic growth and so on.  From 1980 to 1992 the size of the Irish economy, measured by standard national income statistics, increased by almost a half, while during the same period the volume of exports increased by 168 per cent.  Despite this the dividend in jobs was meagre with the total number at work in the economy falling by 3 per cent and non-agricultural employment increasing by just over 3 per cent.  Manufacturing industry has been at the core of increasing national income.  Yet, while manufacturing output almost doubled, one in every seven jobs in manufacturing was lost.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to any observer, keen or otherwise, of economic statistics that the so-called achievements of which we should all be proud have a hollow and superficial ring when judged against the <Col N="541" /> yardstick of our employment needs.  The paradox of growth without jobs needs more than a passing nod or an occasional glancing reference.</P>
    <P>Against that background, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I strongly welcome the core of the analysis in the speech last week by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle.  While that address attracted much comment because of references to social welfare, if one takes the time to read it &mdash; it runs to 15 pages &mdash; one will see that these were not the core of the remarks.</P>
    <P>The governor noted correctly that there was little evidence of a recession here in the accepted sense of the word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, the governor noted &mdash; I agree with him on this point &mdash; that there was little evidence of a recession here and that we are entitled to be proud of our achievements.  However, he underlined the fact that our performance had been characterised as &ldquo;growth with unemployment&rdquo;.  He also said the Central Bank had done work to devise an alternative to GNP as a measure of economic activity.  The Central Bank is not the only agency trying to come up with an alternative but it is interesting that Mr. Doyle went on to note that &ldquo;this approach indicates that growth over the past few years has been more modest than the GNP figures would suggest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon the Taoiseach informed the House that the Government was committed to improving the links between growth and jobs &mdash; this is a longstanding commitment and the aim of the programme implemented by the Industrial <Col N="542" /> Development Authority &mdash; but the Government cannot do this without first acknowledging the link between growth and reality.</P>
    <P>Our growth figures have been puffed up because of our high dependence on multinational export-oriented industry that clearly engages in transfer pricing. This has the effect of producing phantom growth which is nothing more than an illusion.  This is not a side swipe at the multinationals because they have played a strong, powerful and positive role in the economy but it has been overstated and gives the wrong picture.  For instance, one recent study reveals that in 1990 the value of our chemical exports was 55 per cent greater than the officially recorded value of gross output in that sector while in the office and data processing equipment sector we exported 33 per cent more in terms of value than we produced.  This is proof, if proof was needed, if we take export values and gross output, that companies are engaging in transfer pricing and as a result the figures are distorted.</P>
    <P>Given the existence of studies available to the Government, including the report from its own task force on the Culliton report &mdash; the Moriarty report which deals with this matter at some length &mdash; the report of the NESC which examines the question of transfer pricing among other things and the recent submission by a person of the stature of the Governor of the Central Bank we should cease clapping ourselves on the back for our wonderful achievements in terms of growth. This simply serves to wrongly focus our attention in the debate on employment policy.</P>
    <P>In effect, there are two parrallel economies with real but more modest links between them than our rosy official statistics suggest.  We have, to employ a sporting analogy, steroid-enhanced, super-performing, Ben Johnson-like, multinational sector on the one hand and on the other the rest which, far from giving enhanced Olympic-style performances, are closer to the community games.</P>
    <P>The dangerous illusion is that in reading and conducting public debate on our <Col N="543" /> official economic statistics, without due reservation and qualification, we are producing policy prescriptions for our community games economy based on the fallacy that we are Olympic gold medalists. Far from being castigated the Governor of the Central Bank must be congratulated for his realism and honesty. I hope this pervades public debate on this matter which he sought to address in his paper last week.  When the easy alternative was open to him to march to the phony drum beat of the official statistics he &mdash; to his credit &mdash; courageously chose a path which most others have strenuously chosen to avoid.</P>
    <P>In terms of policy prescriptions to deal with that half of the rise in unemployment in recent years explained by domestic policy failures, Mr. Doyle claims that significant reforms are necessary to make future economic growth more employment friendly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has something constructive to offer in a debate on the Central Bank I will hear him but the priority of the Governor of the Central Bank, and I agree with him, is a reduction in the tax wedge which drives up the cost of employing labour because of the enormous difference between the cost to the employer of hiring someone and the value of take-home pay to the employee. This year, for the first time in six budgets, the tax wedge was widened as a result of the 1 per cent income levy which the Government insisted on defending pigheadedly before the House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A classic example of the effect on employment of the tax wedge can be found by comparing a British and Irish worker, each earning the respective minimum wage rates in the labour intensive clothing sector.  The figures are expressed in Irish pounds.  From a minimum gross wage in Ireland of £131 per week the Irish worker takes home £96.52.  In Britain the gross pay cost is only £113.96 and the British worker is better off on net pay of <Col N="544" /> £99.18.  Therefore, in Ireland it cost an employer in a labour intensive industry like clothing much more to hire someone to work for them and at the end of the week the Irish employee takes home much less.  This is crippling labour intensive industries here and is first on the hit list of the Governor of the Central Bank. He is right to highlight this key issue which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Doyle also said that the PAYE sector shouldered a disproportionate burden of the income tax bill.  I wonder how many people in this House disagree with him.  He commented on the anomalies in the system from the widely publicised welfare and poverty traps, in terms of the disincentive to work, to the size of the black economy.  Again, he is right to focus attention on this issue.  A married man with four children needs to earn more than £14,500 per year at work to be better off than in the welfare system.  Any person who says the system is crazy should not be derided because it is crazy that someone should have to earn more than the average industrial wage to be better off at work than out of work.</P>
    <P>In the context of tonight's motion the Governor of the Central Bank has highlighted the need for a more flexible wage bargaining process which is more sensitive to changes in the macro-economic environment.  He commented in particular on the high average increase in public sector pay and he said that in the context of rising unemployment, the increasing level of public sector pay under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was unsustainable.  I believe he is right.</P>
    <P>In our amendment to this motion, we regret the failure of the Government to terminate the 1 per cent income levy, note our belief that consensus on national pay policy, but not at any price, is important and insist that the system of public pay determination in the public sector needs to be reformed with or without a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The level of unemployment in Ireland, and the chilling prospect that this could <Col N="545" /> substantially worsen before it gets better, is a reflection of an economy and a society reeling from a reality which is far removed from the Olympian heights of our official rhetoric and statistics.  The Governor of the Central Bank has helped to puncture this rhetorical balloon and in doing so has done the country a favour. My party will vote against the Government's amendment because of its dogged defence of the indefensible 1 per cent income levy.  We would like, but we do not expect, Deputy Broughan and his colleagues to act according to their belief for a change.  We will be opposing the Government and moving our amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  The impact of the 1 per cent levy in terms of employment creation has been devastating.  Not alone has it affected our ability to sustain jobs, particularly those at risk at the margins, it has affected our ability to create new jobs.  Listening to Deputy Broughan, I waited with bated breath for the punchline thinking that, perhaps, we were going to have a very interesting vote in the House this evening and that the Labour Party would reassert itself.  Sadly, as Deputy Broughan continued, I found that as usual the Labour Party backbenchers were trying to have their cake and eat it, look both ways at the same time, ride two horses in two different directions and please everybody.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity.  The way he will have to vote tonight may stick in his craw, but it is his conscience he will have to live with.  My conscience is clear.</P>
      <P>There are sectors in this economy which have the ability to create reasonably large numbers of labour intensive jobs.  The clothing industry has been mentioned on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> When that industry was experiencing growth and was in a position to sustain its jobs the Government crippled it with full knowledge of a report setting out the difficulties facing that industry.  An industry that ran the gamut of functions, manufacturing, retailing and wholesale, paid the price of the arrogance of this Government's need to be in office and not implement the policies for which the people voted.  How hollow the promises made ring now.</P>
    <P>The Minister sitting opposite me established the National Economic and Social Forum which involves not alone the political and commercial strands but the trade unions, the unemployed, agriculture and practically every reasonable strand of society.  She knows of the meetings and the type of discussions that have taken place.  It must be with a wry smile that she sees the barriers to employment creation being sustained and new ones erected.  It flies in the face of the efforts of that forum, and others, to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that the removal of the 1 per cent income levy beckons greatly in next year's budget.  I have no doubt that the projected income of about £145 million from that levy will prove too big a cherry for the Government to abandon, and that is a tragedy. The price of that is that the prospect of sensible bargaining for a new pay agreement between the social partners has been put at risk because of the Government's stubbornness in regard to the levy. Although I subscribe to the view that we do not require an agreement at any price, surely it behoves the Government to at least remove the 1 per cent levy so that serious discussion can take place.  We may not have got the wage increases but we could have got real tax reform which would have greatly increased the net take home pay of workers.</P>

      <P>Some pertinent questions must be asked.  Are the social partners part and parcel of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>? Obviously, the answer is yes.  The word &ldquo;partner&rdquo; means one who shares.  It seems strange that a partner would set <Col N="547" /> conditions before entering into negotiations. Partnership does not mean publicly putting one's partner's back to the wall before one commences talks, not to talk of negotiations.</P>
      <P>I would have expected Congress to approach this matter in a level headed manner and on the basis of what had been achieved in the previous <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement. I would have thought it would have asked what has been the increase in a person's take home pay since some of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were not fully honoured. On average the increase has been 5 per cent.  It should have asked if public spending had been kept in check; the figures show that it has been kept in check.  On average our exports have increased by 7 per cent and inflation here is at its lowest for many years.  Those employed in the public sector are satisfied with the pay increases during the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>He may be also able to read it better in Irish.  It specifically calls on the Government to reverse the 1 per cent levy and the dirty dozen cuts.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the talks on a new Programme for Economic and Social Progress as a result of the Government's refusal to give a firm commitment on the early removal of the 1 per cent income levy and the dirty dozen social welfare cuts and the response of the Government to this motion has shown beyond question the fact that the Labour Party has little or no economic clout in this administration.</P>
      <P>In my very first comment on the Programme for Government on 7 January, the day on which it was published, I described it as largely reflecting Fianna Fáil policy in the economic area, while the influence of Labour was strongest on the social content.  Almost 12 months on, the unchallenged dominance of Fianna Fáil is clearer than ever.  Labour has won some welcome reforms in the social area &mdash; and it is entitled to credit for that &mdash; but on the key economic issues of unemployment, poverty and the injustice of our tax system, it appears to have thrown in the towel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of Labour on these key issues has been a great disappointment to the many people who voted for the Party in the belief that when it talked about change, it also meant change in the economic area.  The Labour Party, a fearsome Rottweiler in Opposition, has turned out to be a toothless old mongrel in Government.  Throw it a handful of titbits in the form of a few prestigious Government positions, a fleet of Government cars and a brace of well <Col N="551" /> paid jobs for family and friends and it will willingly roll over and let Fianna Fáil tickle its belly.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has the failure of Labour to make its presence felt been more evident than in the area of unemployment.  When Labour entered Government in January the seasonally adjusted live register figures were at 294,800.  The comparable figure for October was 294,000.  In August of 1992, when the Labour leader was still on this side of the House, unemployment figures of 292,000 led Deputy Spring to demand the recall of the Dáil to discuss the crisis.  That sense of urgency and concern seems to have been totally dissipated by the comforts of office.</P>
    <P>The only acceptable measure of the success or otherwise of an economy should be the number of people in secure, well paid jobs.  Judged against this yardstick, the economy under Fianna Fáil and Labour remains in freefall.  Nobody expected Labour to wave a magic wand and solve the unemployment problem. But what has been a sickening disappointment is the failure of Labour to ensure that the problem was given any additional urgency.</P>
    <P>The indifference of the Government to the greatest economic and social crisis confronting society is demoralising the unemployed and creating an unprecedented sense of despair in parents of children who are coming out of the education system with nothing to look forward to but unemployment and the misery of the dole queue.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party excuse for its minimal influence on the February budget, particularly for its support for the 1 per cent levy and the failure to secure the reversal of the social welfare cuts, was that it had just entered office and did not really have the time to put its socialist stamp on the budget.  Almost a year later that excuse no longer has any validity. Clearly the Labour Party does not consider the imposition of the 1 per cent levy or the failure to reverse social welfare cuts to be of sufficient importance to jeopardise its comfortable positions in office.</P>

      <P>It is time, in particular, that the Labour Party backbenchers made up their minds where they stand.  Will they stand with Deputies Reynolds, McCreevy and Brennan defending the indefensible, or with the trade union movement, PAYE taxpayers and those on social welfare to demand an end to these injustices?  At least some of the Fianna Fáil back benchers showed the courage of their convictions in regard to the Shannon stop-over and forfeited the party whip rather than vote for something with which they disagreed.  It did not take long for the Labour fire to be quenched. We all remember the period immediately after the election when Deputy Kemmy, Deputy Upton or one of the other Labour TDs told Charlie Bird almost daily on the plinth that Fianna Fáil would not be allowed to take Labour for granted.  The influx of so many new Labour Deputies, we were told, would change the face of Irish politics.  Alas, for those who put so much hope in them, the Labour Party TDs have turned out to be the timid 33.</P>
      <P>The trade union movement was correct to make an issue of the 1 per cent levy and the social welfare cuts.  Both were in breach of the spirit of commitments given in the last <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and there could be little reliability placed on future agreements without early action from the Government. It may not have been possible anyway to secure agreement on another Programme for Economic and Social Progress, as there would clearly have been many more hurdles to cross but it is disgraceful that the country has been denied the opportunity of even opening discussions on another agreement because of the Government's intransigence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if there was no problem with regard to a new Programme for Economic and Social Progress we would still be seeking action on these issues because of the basic injustice involved.  The decision to apply a 1 per cent levy to relatively low and middle earners was <Col N="553" /> one of the most objectionable features of the February budget.  It was contrary to commitments given by both Government parties in advance of the last election and flew in the face of the advice offered in the Cullition report.  The threshold of £9,000 is well below the average industrial wage so many ordinary workers, already substantially overtaxed, are finding their pay packets robbed once again. It is regressive in that it applies to every single pound earned, irrespective of allowances, regardless of family size or financial commitments.  It has created another poverty trap and is encouraging low pay.  People earning just below the weekly threshold of £173 are being told that it is pointless to look for additional money when even a small increase will mean that they have to pay the full 1 per cent levy on everything they earn.</P>
    <P>The levy has to be considered against the background of the overall tax picture and the failure of successive Governments to honour commitments to introduce fundamental tax reform.  I doubt if the levy has created many problems for the self-employed, farmers and professionals who are able to take every advantage of tax breaks and massage their incomes down to an artificially low level.  For the PAYE workers, who pay 81 per cent of all income tax there is no escape.  The thumbscrew keeps turning and what causes most anger is that other sectors are still allowed to evade their fair share.  Figures given to me by the Minister, Deputy Ahern, in October show that between 1989 and 1992 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £3,122 to £3,662.  This represents an increase of £540, or 17 per cent, more than twice the rate at which most wages and salaries increased. However, the average tax paid by farmers in the same period actually fell by £72, or 9.3 per cent.  Farmers now pay less than one fifth of the average tax paid by PAYE workers.  I accept that there are many farmers on low incomes who would not come into the tax net, but these tax figures do not reflect the reality of the income levels of the two sectors. If we are to have genuine tax reform, we <Col N="554" /> need a Government that will stand up to the powerful agricultural lobby and insist that farmers and all other groups pay a fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for National Recovery which preceded it, despite their limitations, offered a degree of protection to lower paid workers that they would not otherwise have had.  Part of the opposition now being expressed to another Programme for Economic and Social Progress from right wing economists, business interests and farming organisations is motivated by a desire to see that degree of protection taken away from the lower paid.</P>
    <P>Particular attention has focused on the increase in the public sector pay bill over the period of the last two agreements. Any substantial growth in public expenditure like that is, of course, a matter of concern and has to be kept under review. It is a myth to suggest that all public sector workers have done well.  Those at the top of the pile have done best, and the benefits for those at the lowest levels have been least.  Pay increases for the lowest paid civil servants in 1992 and 1993 were 3 per cent and 3.75 per cent respectively and were capped to a maximum of £5 and £6.50.  Many clerical staff in the Civil Service earn half of the camparable rate in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations have been among the most vociferous critics of the increase in the public sector pay bill.  In September the outgoing President of the IFA, Mr. Alan Gillis, warned that farmers would not support another Programme for Economic and Social Progress if it amounted to &ldquo;a rubber stamp for a future public sector pay deal&rdquo;, but what the farming organisations do not tell us is how well they have done. Between 1987 when the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> started and 1992, the public sector pay bill increased by around 32 per cent.  However, in the same period the value of grants and subsidies paid to the agricultural sector increased from £191 million to £464 million, an <Col N="555" /> increase of £273 million, or an incredible 143 per cent.</P>
    <P>The other issue which the trade unions made a condition for the opening of talks was the dirty dozen social welfare cuts. The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, is another Labour TD who appears to have been seduced by the comforts of office, her former crusading radicalism now just an embarrassing memory.  I do not know whether it was as a result of her political naivety and the cuteness of the Minister, Deputy Woods, that the Junior Minister, Deputy Burton has been cast in the role of principal defender of the social welfare cuts or whether she decided to champion them herself, but her speech last night was indeed remarkable.  After almost a year of falsely claiming that the cuts had been reversed, she has suddenly lurched in a different direction and the line now is that the cuts were not all that important and that we should concentrate on what she described as &ldquo;the most serious issues in the social welfare system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton accused Democratic Left of being obsessed with the cuts and me of repeating a monotonous mantra about the dirty dozen.  What a short and selective memory she has.  I remind Deputy Burton that it was not Democratic Left which coined the phrase the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;&mdash; it was the Labour Party. The candidates who most shamelessly exploited the social welfare cuts during the election this time last year and who gave such unequivocal guarantees of reversal were members of the Labour Party.  Her colleague, Deputy Stagg, another Labour TD, discovered that the road to Damascus was the route to Government buildings, produced a detailed leaflet attacking his constituency colleague, Deputy McCreevy, saying: &ldquo;McCreevy makes the less well off pay for bad government.  Support Emmet Stagg and Jack Wall in their fight against these savage cuts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The most dishonest passage in a thoroughly dishonest speech was where Deputy Burton managed to imply that organisations like the Combat Poverty <Col N="556" /> Agency and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors were not concerned with the dirty dozen.  In fact the CMRS in its submission on the 1993 budget said:</P>
    <P>During the past year the Minister for Social Welfare has introduced a variety of initiatives which he describes as &ldquo;targeting&rdquo;.  In one twenty week period eleven such measures were introduced.  The most striking characteristic of many of these measures has been the way that they take money and entitlements away from the poorest people... It is crucial that this destructive approach to targeting be reversed. We have no problem with targeting resources at the most needy and doing this in an effective and efficient way. However this is very different to what has been happening in 1992.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Combat Poverty Agency in its last annual report, published in June of this year, also referred to the dirty dozen cuts and the need to have them reversed.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is an enormously complex code, governed by legislation consolidated in one Act, and volumes of regulations.  Both the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and his Minister of State, Deputy Burton, have used the complexity of the system to try to obscure and obfuscate what they are doing in regard to the cuts.  The Minister for Social Welfare came into the House tonight and pretended to deal with seven of the dirty cuts, but he dealt only with three of them.  The reality is &mdash; I have with me a document which proves this &mdash; that only one of the dirty dozen cuts has been reversed, the one referring to the supplementary welfare allowance system, and even that is in doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaking of this document is a betrayal of both communities in Northern Ireland and a betrayal of the entire Irish people.  It appears that the document was in circulation at official level within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The exact extent of its circulation is not quite clear or the number of officials to whom it has been circulated.  I expect the Tánaiste will indicate the exact number of officials to whom it was circulated and give their names in response to this debate.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that there has never been an occasion in the history of Irish diplomacy since the State was founded in 1922 when a document of the nature of the one in question was leaked to the press.  Irish Governments and Ministers for Foreign Ministers have been engaged in the most difficult negotiations in the past, dating back to the negotiations for the Treaty, the negotiations for the Statute of Westminster and negotiations for various Anglo-Irish agreements through the thirties, the forties and the fifties to the negotiation of the Irish accession to the European Community.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any case where a Minister for Foreign Affairs presided over a leak of this kind in the past on any occasion in Irish diplomatic history.  It is a matter of extreme seriousness because it should be remembered that if an Irish position paper circulating within the Department can be leaked, so also could a paper circulated to the Irish Government by another Government be leaked. If there are people in the Department of Foreign Affairs or in the Government service who are capable of leaking their own Government's paper, they are also capable of leaking papers supplied by other Governments.  This fact undermines the confidence that other Governments will have, and should have, in their dealings with the Irish Government. Therefore, I believe this is not a matter that can be treated as any other type of leak.  It is not like an internal leak of documents from another Department concerning solely our domestic affairs. A document leaked in regard to foreign relations creates a precedent which could be used to leak documents supplied by other Governments and, therefore, could totally undermine the trust upon which Irish diplomacy must rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe in the case of this particular subject, the most sensitive subject with which we have dealt for many years in Ireland &mdash; the creation of an atmosphere of peace and reconciliation on this island &mdash; that the people with whom the Tánaiste is now dealing, <Col N="561" /> namely, the British Government, will wonder what is really happening here. They will wonder what is the motive for this leak.  They will wonder not only who did it, but why did they do it.  They will suspect an ulterior motive; they will suspect things that may well be completely unfounded.  But until we know exactly who leaked it and why, those suspicions will continue.</P>
    <P>In particular I should like to know how long this document has been in existence? For example, has it been in existence for a number of days, a number of months or a number of weeks?  I should like to know exactly to whom was it circulated. Was it circulated outside the Irish public service or solely within it?  Was it circulated to established civil servants only or also to temporary civil servants?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know exactly what the Tánaiste knew about this matter and what the Taoiseach knew about this matter.  I should like to know if the Tánaiste can tell the House whether the leaking of this document and its timing had anything to do with the Taoiseach's visit to Derry, because it is quite obvious that the Taoiseach was placed in an impossibly embarrassing position of having to respond to questions about a document that it is plain that the leaker knew the Taoiseach had not seen.  Therefore, the Taoiseach was placed in a worse position than I believe any Taoiseach was placed in a matter of this kind in recent memory.  While I have had occasion to criticise the Taoiseach on many matters in the past, the person who was responsible for this leak placed him in a grossly unfair position.  That is a matter for which somebody must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind everyone in this House, in particular the Tánaiste, that this Government and every Government it has succeeded has been based on a number of constitutional doctrines.  One of those doctrines is absolute and total ministerial responsibility for everything that happens within a Minister's own Department.  Civil servants are not separately accountable for what happens. Civil servants do not have to resign because of what happens.  The current <Col N="562" /> doctrine &mdash; I believe it is a doctrine that is somewhat unrealistic but is one that successive Governments have insisted on continuing &mdash; says that one person, and one person only, is responsible for everything that happens within his or her Department and that person is the Minister. The Minister in this case, if the document's circulation had been confined to the Department of Foreign Affairs, is the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and no one else.</P>
    <P>Therefore I want to know, and the House wants to know, what the Tánaiste will do about this.  What personal steps, as Minister, will he take to put this right? When will he be reporting back to the House on this matter and, if he is not going to be in a position to report back to this House, what will he do about his own position in regard to this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to express my own sense of anger and outrage, which is shared by the Government, at the publication in last Friday's <i>Irish Press</i> of a confidential draft document which had been prepared in my Department.  I have not referred to this matter publicly before now, since my first concern has been to take whatever steps I can to find the source of this leak.  As much information as possible has been gathered and I have consulted with senior Garda officers in the matter.  I am determined to take every possible step to find the source.</P>
      <P>The publication arose from the unauthorised handing over of the document in question to Ms Emily O'Reilly, political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press.</i> Whoever gave the document to Ms O'Reilly, obviously in the knowledge that it would be published, either did not know or did not care that the interests of this country would be damaged by that act. Obviously, newspapers and reporters who are handed a scoop like this on a plate are going to be very tempted by it. My criticism is not directed at them &mdash; they must examine their own consciences in the matter &mdash; but rather at whoever handed over the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> This document was prepared as part of a process of negotiation and discussion initiated by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and myself in September last.  The British side of that process had already submitted preliminary views on matters which might feature in resumed political talks in Northern Ireland.  The document published by the <i>Irish Press</i> was a draft, prepared at official level, of what our position might be in response to the position of the British Government.  Of course, as such, the document inevitably could have undergone considerable change before any agreement between the two Governments emerged.  In fact, it had never even been considered by members of the Government here; it was not even at a stage at which it was appropriate to submit it to the Government here, let alone to the British Government.  In addition, the Taoiseach has already made it clear that there is no connection between this draft document and the work in which the two Governments have engaged to find a pathway to peace.</P>
    <P>What this leak has done is to place a cloud over a small number of respected and honourable people.  I have indicated my own willingness to submit to any questioning about the matter by the relevant authorities.  I know that everyone else who had any role in connection with the document is equally anxious to have the matter cleared up.</P>
    <P>The publication of a document like this, prepared for a very specific purpose, inevitably distorts perceptions of the likely outcome of any process of discussion. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. James Molyneaux, last night referred to the &ldquo;smell of betrayal&rdquo; that his constituents detected in public utterances.  All I can say in response to that is that I understand fully how partial information can lead to such a conclusion. But there will be no betrayal of the interests of either community in Northern Ireland by this Government as we search for a peaceful way forward for both communities.</P>
    <P>I hope to have the opportunity in the <Col N="564" /> Seanad tomorrow of addressing the present concerns of those communities in more detail.  For now, all I can say in the time available is that I would number the perpetrator of this leak among the real betrayers of both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 25, 27, 29, and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The comments referred to by the Deputy were contained in a speech by the Governor of the Central Bank which considered aspects of the unemployment problem and measures to address it.  The statement highlighted the areas where reforms are, in the Governor's view necessary:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; first, a reduction in the tax wedge, <Col N="388" /> that is the difference between the cost of labour to the employer and the take-home pay of the employee;</P>
    <P>&mdash; secondly, reform of the social welfare and taxation systems to improve incentives;</P>
    <P>&mdash;thirdly, promotion of a more flexible wage-bargaining process and more efficient work practices. </P>
    <P>In commenting on the issue of reform of the tax and welfare systems the Governor raised the issue of the possible effect of the level of unemployment payments on the incentives to work, particularly at low pay levels, on the creation of welfare and poverty traps and on the development of the black economy.  He advocated a widening of anti-fraud measures of the Department including measures to ensure that people not actively seeking work should not receive welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that my first priority as Minister for Social Welfare is to ensure that claimants, including the unemployed, receive the benefits to which they are statutorily entitled.  The vast majority of claimants are genuine and need the payments which they receive.  I do not accept that the levels of social welfare payments are such as to be a disincentive to work.  The disincentives issue is a very broad one, involving, as the Governor acknowledged, the whole question of the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems.  The Government have set up an expert group specifically to examine this question.</P>
    <P>In relation to fraud I am devoting a considerable amount of resources to the detection of fraud within the system, because I believe that it undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the system; damages the economy and reduces the funds available to those genuinely in need.  It is a statutory condition for receiving unemployment benefit or assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking, but unable to find, suitable employment.</P>
    <P>Claimants are asked when making a claim for unemployemt benefit or assistance <Col N="389" /> to supply information regarding their efforts to obtain employment and may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about this matter. The information supplied by claimants when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, is used by the deciding officer in determining whether the person concerned is available for and genuinely seeking work.  If there is any element of doubt about the position further relevant information is sought.</P>
    <P>Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Claims are reviewed subsequently on a regular basis to ensure that the claimant continues to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to payment.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of decisions are made by local deciding officers with knowledge of the level and type of opportunities available in the locality and awareness of the individual's circumstances. Each of the 8 regions of my Department also has investigators specifically devoted to controlling fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and their record of success is impressive.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputies, however, that genuine customers of my Department have absolutely nothing to fear from activities which are directed at the prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  Activities undertaken to reduce the incidence of fraud are aimed at those who are attempting to cheat the taxpayer.  Staff of my Department are trained to be courteous and sensitive in their dealings with members of the public and also to respect the dignity and privacy of each individual claimant.</P>
    <P>Continued efforts will be made to ensure that the social welfare system is effective in delivering payments to those who are entitled to them and preventing unwarranted claiming.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 31 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme including administration costs was £57.9 million in 1990, £74.3 million in 1991 and £101.1 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>The cost of administering the scheme in 1990, 1991 and 1992 was £9 million, £12.4 million and £11.5 million respectively. The 1991 figure is inflated by some £1.4 million on foot of a retrospective pay award which was paid in 1991 but which related to previous years.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of administration costs on a health board basis for the years 1990, 1991, 1992 is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>Where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social welfare income maintenance, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support. The liability to maintain the family provisions in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 allows for the transfer to my Department of all maintenance received by a claimant, including maintenance paid to children.</P>
      <P>In situations where the family is adequately maintained by the liable relative, that is where the maintenance (which may relate to both the claimant and dependent children) exceeds the maximum rate of lone parent's allowance appropriate to the family size, then my Department is not involved in income support.  However, if the level of maintenance is inadequate or no maintenance is paid to the family, my Department supports the family through the appropriate income support scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> In the case of lone parent's allowance the rate of payment can be reduced to reflect the level of maintenance received from the liable relative.  However, due to the high level of liable relatives who default on maintenance payments, the maximum rate of lone parent's allowance can be paid to the claimant on condition that any maintenance received is transferred to my Department.  The latter option is available to claimants in order to protect the family from the risks associated with liable relatives who default on maintenance payments.</P>

      <P>With effect from July 1992 the circumstances in which a claimant may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for a number of weeks were broadened to include people under 55 years of age who, on termination of employment, receive severance payments in excess of a prescribed amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that a person receiving a redundancy payment of more than £12,000 may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks and the overall duration of entitlement <Col N="394" /> to that benefit of 15 months is reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>This measure was considered necessary to counter situations where the social insurance fund, in effect, could be used as a top-up for substantial redundancy packages which, in some cases, also involved seasonal work for fixed periods in subsequent years.  After consultations with the trade unions and people affected by redundancy, the Government decided to improve the tax situation of people made redundant.  The extra tax-free amounts granted in the Finance Act more than compensate for the nine weeks' disqualification from unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards may make a payment to meet an exceptional need to people who are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. The determination of applications for assistance is a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>I announced recently details of a new code or practice to assist people on social welfare payments who, because of exceptional circumstances, encounter difficulty in meeting their ESB or natural gas bills. The code replaces the 1992 circulars on this matter which I withdrew on 1 June, 1993.  The code of practice involves the health boards, the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann in a co-ordinated response to assist people with such difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code was designed principally to assist people who are having frequent difficulties in meeting their fuel bills. Under the code, the person is advised to contact the ESB or Bord Gáis Éireann, in the first instance.  A repayment agreement will be drawn up which will take account of the inability to pay.  With the individual's permission, the ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann will liaise with the <Col N="395" /> health boards in addressing the billing problem.  The health board may support an agreement made under this code between the customer and the company by way of an exceptional needs payment, if considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>My objective in producing this code of practice is to enable people to get back to a situation where they have control of their budget on an ongoing basis and where the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is used to help achieve an effective and lasting solution.</P>
    <P>My Department has produced an information leaflet on the code of practice which sets out clearly the procedure which each organisation will employ when dealing with such cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 37 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> The carer's allowance, which I introduced in November 1990, provides a direct payment to carers on a meanstested basis.  The scheme was originally designed for people on low incomes who were providing full-time care and attention to elderly or incapacitated social welfare pensioners.</P>
    <P>In July 1991 I extended the allowance to people providing care for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards or recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the end of last month there was a total of 4,685 allowances in payment.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute published a report in December last year which focuses on all aspects of community and institutional care of elderly people and the implications of directing resources towards community care.  I am reviewing the carer's allowance scheme taking account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the conclusions in that report.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report also recognised the benefits of respite care.  I made provision in this year's budget for a fund of £500,000 for grants to organisations providing respite care facilities and service to full-time carers.  Two weeks ago I announced that the Government had doubled this fund to £1 million.</P>
    <P>In introducing the carer's allowance, I took into account the vital and essential role played by carers in our society.  For the first time a basic income-maintenance payment is being made directly to the carer.  I will endeavour to improve the scheme and expand it as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I will also continue to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health, regarding provision for carers generally. A relaxation or abolition of the means-testing arrangements would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment under a contract of service irrespective of the extent of the employment or wages paid.  Accordingly, people employed as home helps by the health board, being in insurable employment under a contract of service, would not be entitled to unemployment assistance for days during which they were so employed.  If unemployed for at least three days in every period of six consecutive days, a person could qualify for assistance for the days not worked subject to satisfying the means test.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Social Welfare Act provided for the exclusion from means assessment of income from employment of a casual nature by a health board as a home help. Accordingly, a person claiming unemployment assistance who is employed as a home help on a part-time basis will not be assessed with any means from these earnings; neither will a person be assessed with means arising from income earned by a spouse employed as a home help.</P>
      <P>I am considering the treatment of home helps generally under the social welfare system.  However, the payment of unemployment assistance to home helps on the days on which they are working would have implications for the treatment of part-time workers generally within the system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The 1991 State Census shows that there are 37,939 widowers in Ireland, of whom 28,916 are age 65 or over.  Widowers at age 65 are eligible for the retirement pension subject to the normal conditions.  At age 66 they are entitled to either the old age contributory or non-contributory pension &mdash; again subject to the normal conditions.  Widowers with children are eligible for the lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>According to the 1991 State Census there are 9,023 widowers aged under 65. There were 689 widowers in receipt of the lone parent's allowance in 1992.</P>
      <P>The question of extending social insurance cover to widowers generally arises for consideration in the context of further extension of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the social security system.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of extending to widowers the present social insurance arrangements for widows would be around £25 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced for the purpose of encouraging the creation of new job opportunities for both the unemployed and lone parents.  It allows them retain a proportion of their entitlements, including secondary benefits, for two years while engaged in paid employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this pilot scheme will encourage growth in industries identified in the Culliton report as having potential for expansion.  It will also provide additional incentives to the unemployed and lone parents to explore new types of employment and self-employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The response to the scheme has been positive.  More than 1,700 inquiries have been received to date from employers, the unemployed and lone parents.</P>
      <P>Self-employment proposals have been received from 150 unemployed people and 130 of these are now in receipt of allowance.  Information on the scheme has also been issued to 2,000 employers. Applications have already been received from over 100 employers offering 255 jobs.</P>
      <P>My Department is adopting a flexible, pro-active and supportive approach to the new scheme.  Definitions of the qualifying categories included in the term &ldquo;local enterprises&rdquo; will not be finalised until a detailed assessment of interest and precise needs is possible.  In the interim, any proposals put forward by employers to create new or additional employment opportunities in the broad sectors covered by the scheme will be considered. At this juncture the only rigid test is that they would not displace jobs in a similar activity in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Unemployed people who submit self-employment proposals under the scheme will be directed to the &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; training courses provided by FÁS.  My Department will liaise closely with FÁS and other relevant agencies to ensure that participants in the back to work allowance scheme receive appropriate support.</P>
    <P>The scheme was advertised for 10 days on national radio and press.  This is the normal duration of advertising campaigns by my department.  It has since been supplemented by the issue of posters on the scheme to all social welfare local offices.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being widely publicised within my Department at all levels.  There are full-time information officers at all large local departmental offices who can provide detailed advice to potential employers and employees.</P>
    <P>In addition to seventeen head office staff, eighteen middle management staff are already working full-time at local level in publicising the scheme.  As the scheme builds up, additional full-time staff will be deployed.  This is a ground-level scheme which will flexibly adapt to local needs.</P>
    <P>I will review the necessity for further national advertising in the light of the local experience over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Although the scheme has been in operation for six weeks only, I am confident that it will demonstrate considerable potential over the coming year and will make a worthwhile contribution to the Government's wide-ranging efforts to combat unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, where an individual is making enforceable maintenance payments to an estranged spouse, PRSI contributions are paid by both the person paying maintenance and the person receiving it, subject to the normal thresholds and ceilings.  The effect of this is that each spouse builds up a social insurance record in their own right, and can each, in due course, qualify for a pension.  I believe that entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and that coverage under the system should be extended as widely as possible. I am at present considering the possibility of extending pension coverage to other categories of people and in this context I would be reluctant to change the PRSI contribution system in such a way as to reduce the present levels of entitlement and coverage.</P>
      <P>All of these issues will be considered next year in the context of a divorce referendum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 40 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to help households who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>A payment of £5 per week is payable to eligible households from mid-October to mid-April.  An additional £3 per week is paid in the Dublin area because of the higher cost of smokeless fuel.  People residing in local authority accommodation, where central heating is already supplied at a subsidised level, do not qualify for a fuel allowance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance applies to people on long term payments.  Disability benefit is a short term payment and is not a qualifying payment under the national fuel scheme.  However, if the health board is satisfied that because of the nature of the illness, additional heating is required, in a particular case, a special payment could be made for this purpose under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Increases in the overall level of the fuel allowance or extension of the payment to other categories of clients would have significant financial implications.  For example, an increase of £1 in the level of the fuel allowance would cost almost £9 million in a full heating season.  Such changes could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Combat Poverty Agency made a submission to the Nutrition Advisory Group established by the Minister for Health to advise on the formulation of a nutritional policy for Ireland.  I understand that the submission is one of 28 received to date which are being examined by the group in the course of their work.</P>
      <P>There is, in my view, a wide range of factors affecting the spending patterns of families at different income levels.  All families whether on social welfare payments or otherwise, who are living on limited incomes, are faced with having to manage their living pattern within these income levels.  I have taken specific measures in recent years to enable assistance and advice to be provided to people on low incomes to help them to get the maximum value from their incomes.</P>
      <P>In so far as the rates of social welfare payments generally are concerned, I have already put on the record of this House my commitment and this Government's commitment to achieving the priority rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  In the area of child income support, the number of child dependant rates has been streamlined from 36 in 1987 to three at present. The minimum child dependant allowance is now £12.80, as compared with £6 in 1987.  This year's budget provided for a substantial increase in child benefit payments to £20 for the first three children and £23 for the fourth and each subsequent child.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, we are committed to increasing child benefit still further over time, following integration of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
      <P>In recent years, social welfare payments have more than kept pace with inflation.  All long term social welfare rates now exceed the commission's priority rate.  The new maximum standard weekly rates for long term payments now range from £59.20 to £68.90.  The carer's allowance has also been increased to the long term rate.  Short-term payments are now at a new personal weekly rate of £55.60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Further advances will be achieved over time and in the context of further growth in the economy.  However, the Government are committed, under the Programme for a Partnership Government, to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the incomes of pensioners.  I will continue to keep payment levels under review and secure further improvements in this area as resources permit.</P>

      <P>In determining entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension, the first £6 of weekly means are disregarded, so that a person with £6 weekly means qualifies for the same rate of pension as a person with no means.  In the case of a married couple this would amount to £12 a week.  A number of other disregards also apply, including a proportion of any earnings of a pensioner with dependent children, the value of the applicant's home and so on.  This means that as far as capital is concerned a person can have means up to £2,987.50 if single or £5,975 if married and still receive the full rate pension.  A couple could have joint capital up to £57,975 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension and participate in all the &ldquo;free schemes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the disregards would have financial implications.  In recent years the practice has been to use any additional resources to increase the basic pension payment rather than increase the disregard.  In this way resources are provided primarily for those with no means.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement scheme provides a weekly supplement to families with children, where one or more parent is in employment for at least 20 hours per week and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly amount.  It is designed to assist low earning families to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were <Col N="408" /> claiming unemployment or disability benefits.</P>
      <P>Since the scheme's inception in September 1984, there has been a steady increase in the number of families in receipt of family income supplement.  In 1990 there were 6,569 families in receipt of the supplement covering 24,536 children, in 1991, 7,157 families with 25,816 children and in 1992 there were 7,735 families providing for 26,764 children.</P>
      <P>The number of families from Limerick in receipt of the supplement in 1990 is not available.  There were 280 families in receipt of family income supplement in Limerick in 1991 and 310 families receiving a weekly payment in 1992.  A breakdown between Limerick city and county cannot be obtained.</P>
      <P>The increased level of take-up reflects the major improvements which I have made to the scheme in recent years. These changes include: a substantial increase in the income limits for eligibility; a reduction in the hours-of-work qualification from 30 to 20 hours; an increase in the number of qualifying children in a family from five to eight; the abolition of the maximum rate of payment; the implementation of a minimum £5 weekly payment for all recipients; children aged between 18 and 21 who are attending full-time education are now regarded as qualifying children; the common fear among potential claimants that they risk losing the medical card has been removed.</P>

      <Quest>the number of deserting parents from whom his Department is collecting maintenance for children under new powers in the Social Welfare Bills of 1991 and 1992; and the proportion that this represents of the cases in which his Department is providing income maintenance to the deserted spouse.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;liability to maintain <Col N="409" /> family&rdquo; provisions are now contained in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  These provisions are based on the widely-accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouses and their children.  Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on social welfare income maintenance, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
      <P>The scheme commenced on 29 November 1990.  To date, over 10,000 cases have been examined by my Department. It is not always possible to trace the current whereabouts of deserting spouses; some emigrate, almost all change address.</P>
      <P>Potential liable relatives were traced in 2,304 cases.  Initial examination indicated a potential ability to pay a contribution under the scheme.  After further detailed assessment, my Department has accepted that 731 of these are unable to make a contribution for a variety of reasons.</P>
      <P>The remaining 1,573 cases, and new cases as they arise, are in various stages of investigation.  Of this group, 271 determinations of liability have issued to liable relatives.  So far, 78 of these liable relatives are making payments to my Department towards the cost of lone parents (separated spouses) allowance, deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit to their spouses.  These liable relatives pay either by way of regular direct contribution to my Department or through family law court orders which are transferred to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these payments, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions also yield some direct savings on scheme expenditure.  These arise as a result of the withdrawal of some claims which were actively in payment.  For example, some spouses make direct arrangements to provide support to their families once the Department intervenes. It is expected that the contributing group will grow significantly as my Department <Col N="410" /> concludes its investigations on the many other cases on hands.</P>
    <P>Changes to the liability to maintain provisions in 1992 strengthened powers of collection and enforcement.  Legal proceedings are being considered in a number of cases where the liable relative has failed to comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The present system for tracing deserting spouses is labour intensive and slow. It is planned to periodically review cases which could not be traced in the past on an ongoing basis.  Major improvements in the computer systems in my Department currently underway will assist this ongoing review process.  I expect that these measures will increase substantially the number of liable relatives making a contribution towards social welfare support for their deserted or separated spouses and their children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific case referred to in the Ombudsman's report referred to a case where a public servant retired at age 64 and then signed on for credits at his local employment office.  Since credits are linked to the last paid contribution and this person's last paid contribution was at the modified rate appropriate to civil servants which does not provide cover for old age (contributory) pension, these <Col N="411" /> credits could not be used for the purposes of qualifying for an old age contributory pension.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards rent or mortgage interest payments to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The supplement is calculated so that, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, the recipient has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family size, less £5. This £5 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not normally given in respect of rent or mortgage arrears.  Health boards would consider an exceptional needs payment towards the payment of mortgage or rent arrears only <Col N="412" /> in exceptional circumstances and where it had been established that such a payment would prevent eviction or re-possession of the property.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants on social employment schemes, which are administered by <Col N="414" /> FÁS, are eligible to apply for rent or mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  The amount of the supplement is determined by the health board having regard to the circumstances of the case. The maximum supplement is the amount which after payment of rent and mortgage interest, would leave the recipient with an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family in size, less £5.</P>
    <P>People participating on social employment schemes are required to work for an average of two and a half days each week for which they are paid a weekly allowance of £77 for a single person and £110.70 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>These allowances are higher than the equivalent rates of supplementary welfare allowance.  Furthermore participants are free to engage in other work or activities during their time off.</P>
    <P>In the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partnership areas, participants in the community employment development programme, which replaces the social employment schemes in these areas can, on a pilot basis, retain their rent or mortgage supplement at the rate in payment prior to participation in the schemes.  The question of extending the same arrangements to people on schemes outside the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas would depend on the outcome of the pilot scheme and on the financial implications.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to people who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has advised that income guidelines are available to assist health boards in determining eligibility. These guidelines are revised annually to take account of the marital status of the client, the number of dependants, and the individual's financial commitments. In addition, weekly payments under social employment schemes are <Col N="415" /> excluded in assessing an applicant's income.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has also advised that people who have held a medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of one year after securing a placement on any of the pilot schemes applicable to the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>An applicant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a health board in relation to an application for supplementary welfare allowance may appeal the decision to the board's appeal's officer.  The total number of appeals received in 1990 was 1,975, in 1991 2,319 and in 1992 3,101.  These figures include appeals under the national fuel scheme which are not available separately.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which require review.  In this regard an advisory group under the chairmanship of my Department has been established with representatives from all health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of standardising practices in relation to appeals has been discussed by the group and the views of appeals officers in the health boards are being considered.  I believe that the existing health board appeals system can be improved by introducing better quality information for clients on their right to appeal; standardising application forms and procedures and explaining more fully the basis for decisions to clients.  These <Col N="416" /> matters will be considered further in the context of the current discussions.</P>

      <P>The Social Insurance Fund was established under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  The legislation provided for an investment account, to be managed and controlled by the Minister for Finance and a current account, which is managed and controlled by my Department.  The annual accounts of the Social Insurance Fund are certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Following a Government decision, the investments of the Social Insurance Fund were realised in 1992 and the income generated was transferred to the current account of the fund.</P>
      <P>The Social Insurance Fund is not entirely self-financing and the Exchequer each year makes up the shortfall between receipts and expenditure.  The Exchequer contribution is drawn down throughout the year, as required.  The income of the fund is comprised overwhelmingly of pay-related social insurance contributions which are estimated to yield £1,567 million in 1993.  The Exchequer contribution is estimated at £197 million. Receipts from other courses are estimated to amount to less than £1 million this year.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contributions are collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the taxation system.  There is a constant flow of funds from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department.  Funds are distributed as required to various outlets &mdash; An Post, banks, and Social Welfare Local Offices &mdash; for the payment of pensions and benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income and expenditure are monitored on a daily basis by my Department. I am satisfied that the arrangements in <Col N="417" /> place ensure that the maximum advantage accrues to the State from the management of the funds.</P>

      <P>A sum of £10 million was provided in the 1993 Estimates for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme of which £9.5 million was paid over to the health boards by the beginning of July.</P>
      <P>The scheme was brought forward to 1 June this year to minimise delays in payment.  The scheme commenced in July 1992.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, in the scheme circular the Department instructed the health boards to ensure that the majority of payments were made by end July.</P>
      <P>The bulk of payments were made in all boards (except the Eastern Health Board) by the end of July-mid August.</P>
      <P>Arising from problems which arose this year in the administration of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme in the Eastern Health Board area which led to serious delays in making these payments, I have been in touch with the Eastern Health Board in relation to the circumstances which gave rise to the delay with a view to ensuring that such delays do not occur in the future.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Act, 1990 which came into effect in January, 1991 safeguards the interests of members of occupational pension schemes by setting down minimum standards which all schemes will have to comply with.  It provides for a regulatory framework for the future supervision of pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Act include the introduction of a statutory minimum funding standard for certain funded schemes, the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members and clarification of the duties and responsibilities of scheme trustees.  The Act also provides for the establishment of a new statutory board to monitor and supervise the new statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>The new minimum funding standard is designed to ensure that, over a period, there are sufficient funds in a scheme to meet liabilities in the event of the scheme being wound up.  Under the disclosure provisions the trustees of a scheme are required to produce annual reports and audited accounts of their scheme and to disclose a comprehensive range of other information to members concerning the operation and the financial procedures of the scheme.  There are strict penalties for trustees of schemes who fail to comply with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July I signed regulations, which come into effect on 1 January 1994, to enable member trustees to be appointed. <Col N="420" /> Members in this way, will have a say in how the assets of the fund are invested. This is a further protection for members.</P>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied that these measures provide a high degree of security of members pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>There are no legislative provisions governing the type of investments to be made by pension funds.  The level of investment in quoted or unquoted Irish securities is a matter for trustees.  However, under Part VI of the Act trustees are obliged to provide for the proper investment of the resources of the scheme in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</P>

    <P>Participants will receive an allowance of £40 a week for up to 12 months.  They can take up other work on the days they are not participating on the programme. Thus, they will be positively encouraged to increase their income and to combine additional practical work experience with the training.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme is operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare. I am anxious to extend the household budgeting scheme to as wide a group of social welfare customers as possible.  At present the scheme is available in the greater Dublin area and in Counties Kilkenny and Waterford and some 1,600 people are having deductions made under the scheme.  Additional counties will have the facility available within the next two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> In addition to extending household budgeting on a geographic basis, I have asked that the question of extending it to other social welfare groups such as lone parents be examined by An Post in conjunction with officials of my Department. However, because other groups are paid by order books, changes to existing computer systems are required.  Assuming that it is feasible, plans will be put in place to extend the household budgeting scheme to other social welfare clients.</P>

      <P>An Post is the main agency for the payment of social welfare pensions and benefits.  Last year my Department and An Post concluded an agreement for the provision of encashment services and for the modernisation of post office counter services which will ensure that social welfare customers receive a truly modern service.</P>
      <P>Like most other social welfare customers, unemployed persons will receive their unemployment payments at post offices as cash payments are phased out of local offices of my Department leaving the way open for the introduction of less frequent &ldquo;signing-on&rdquo; and improved information services for customers.  As part of its programme for the modernisation of all its counter services, An Post is introducing new technology to improve the speed and efficiency of making these payments.  New technology will be introduced at 600 post offices over a three year period.  The new personal social services card, designed to banking standards, will speed up access for customers to payments at post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the five year period of the agreement it is estimated that the cost of paying social welfare payments at post offices will be of the order of £163 million and <Col N="426" /> that the cost of the development of new technology services for my Department will be of the order of £18 million.</P>

      <P>All applicants for unemployment payments are required to show that they are able to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  With the exception of citizens of the UK, with whom Ireland has long-standing reciprocal arrangements, non-nationals, including citizens of European Union member states, are required to register with the registration officer, Garda, of the Department of Justice.  Deciding officers of the Department of Social Welfare take the view that unless a non-national has been granted registration by the Department of Justice and is legally resident in Ireland they cannot be considered to be freely available for employment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Non-nationals are required to register with the registration officer, Garda, within three months of their arrival in Ireland.  Accordingly, unemployment assistance may be payable for up to three months following arrival in Ireland if the other statutory conditions are satisfied.</P>

However, participants in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; educational schemes for long <Col N="427" /> term unemployed people and lone parents schemes may retain their basic social welfare payment and their secondary benefits such as rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the duration of the course.

      <P>The free telephone allowance scheme applies to people in receipt of social welfare or certain other pensions who are aged 66 or over and to incapacitated people under 66 who are in receipt of a pension or allowance for long term incapacity.  The scheme was intended for people who might otherwise be unable to summon help in an emergency. To qualify for this allowance the person concerned must be living alone or only with children under 15 years or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities, who decide this having regard to their ongoing assessment of the policing requirements of those areas.  They inform me that the current strength of Kilcormac Garda station is one sergeant and two gardaí. This has been the strength at the station for several years.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are aware that there has been an increase in the number of burglaries in the area this year and have been taking specific action to deal with this problem.  This includes additional patrols in the Kilcormac area and the operation of checkpoints throughout the sub-district. The gardaí inform me that as a result of their activities, five persons were arrested within the last week and brought before the courts for crimes committed in Kilcormac.  They have been remanded in custody.  The gardaí are confident that their action will lead to a significant reduction in the level of crime in the Kilcormac area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> Kilcormac forms part of the Community Policing Scheme for Rural Areas, which was introduced in 1991, Birr being the Area Headquarters.  The introduction of the scheme has resulted in the crime prevention and deterrent capabilities of the local gardaí being increased and there are now more mobile patrols and checkpoints being performed in Kilcormac than at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>While there is no member currently residing in Kilcormac, the Garda inform me that they cannot compel any member to live in a particular area, although they are encouraged to reside within a reasonable distance to the town or village in which they serve.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Authorised insurers are not required to furnish information in the form sought by the Deputy in their annual returns to my Department.</P>
      <P>However, it can be discerned from The Blue Book, which is the Insurance Annual Report published by my Department, that management expenses account for approximately 16 per cent of the premium income for all types of nonlife insurance business underwritten by authorised insurers; the remainder of the premium income would go towards meeting the cost of claims.  The average cost of motor insurance claims, which includes personal injury compensation and property damage, was £4,456 in 1992.</P>
      <P>I can further advise the Deputy that of motor insurance claims cost as a whole, approximately 67 per cent and 12 per cent are attributable to personal injury compensation and property damage respectively.  Questions about the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland Scheme are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would add that these statistics further illustrate the need to reduce the cost of personal injury compensation in the context <Col N="451" /> of employment retention and job creation.</P>

      <P>My Department is unable to trace any applications from the person named under the June 1992, December 1992 or January-February 1993 special beef premium schemes.  He has been deemed ineligible for payment under the June 1993 special beef premium scheme for animals of 21 months of age or over as he did not maintain the number of animals on which he applied for premium for two months as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulations payments for the 1993 special beef premium schemes could not commence until after 1 November 1993 and even then only a 60 per cent advance can be paid in cases where the necessary administrative or on-the-spot checks have been carried out.

      <P>Under the scheme of installation aid a condition is that the young farmer be installed on the holding.  The position is that this condition is only fulfilled when the applicant is registered as the owner in Land Registry. Under the scheme of installation aid for young farmers the young farmer must satisfy a number of specific criteria i.e. age, education and labour input, within two years of setting up as a full time farmer.  To satisfy the labour input criterion the applicant must show that the holding has a labour requirement of 1 to 1.5 MWU.  Evidence beyond the deed of transfer may be needed to show details of other lands owned or leased by the applicant which may influence the calculations in regard to the labour requirement. However, I am continuing to examine all aspects of the scheme including further possibilities for the earliest practicable payment of the grant.</P>

In response to this consultation, I made a comprehensive submission on behalf of the Government to the UK authorities which details our opposition to THORP and calls for a full, open and independent public inquiry.</P>
      <P>As part of this most recent public consultation British Nuclear Fuels plc prepared a document for the UK authorities entitled &ldquo;The Economic and Commercial Justification for THORP&rdquo;.  This document did indicate that some 1,800 tonnes of uranium fuel is in storage at Sellafield awaiting reprocessing and that &ldquo;over 90 per cent of this fuel has been dismantled in preparation for reprocessing&rdquo;.  I would expect that this should not be a factor which would affect the decision to be reached by the UK authorities on THORP.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any serious malfunction in the computer system at Sellafield. I am aware, however, of recent media reports of a computer virus at Sizewell B station in south-east England, which is nearing completion.

      <P>The question correctly states that the Central Statistics Office records social class in census of population data.  However, this data cannot be readily linked with mortality or morbidity data.  National morbidity data only exists for certain notifiable conditions, primarily infectious diseases and does not include occupational information.  The National Cancer Registry has recently been established to register all cases of cancer.  This will include occupational data, but it will be several years before the register is sufficiently complete to allow research in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For mortality, death certificates record socio-economic group rather than social class, but even this limited information is recognised to be of poor quality.  The circumstances in which the information is sought are very difficult, and very often <Col N="460" /> the person providing the information does not have an accurate picture of the previous occupation or occupations of the deceased.  For these reasons, the Central Statistics Office does not publish information on socio-economic groups in its reports on vital statistics.</P>
