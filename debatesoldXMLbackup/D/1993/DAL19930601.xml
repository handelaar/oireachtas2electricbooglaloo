      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated on several occasions in this House, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-97</i> is a four year plus programme which the Government is committed to implementing over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the figures published in today's newspapers showing that the PAYE sector contributed £2,700 million in tax, or 88 per cent of the total tax take, and in view of the fact that the Programme for Government contains a section entitled, &ldquo;Taxation of Savings and Investments&rdquo;, was it envisaged in drawing up the programme that the controversial tax amnesty for hot <Col N="1194" /> money stashed abroad would be part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going from the general to the particular. This is a general question on the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a specific section dealing with taxation of savings and investments abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a specific matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he should do so by way of question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a specific question in relation to this programme.  Was it envisaged that this would be incorporated in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has already pointed out that this is a general question. If the Deputy wants to ask specific questions about the programme he should table a question to the appropriate Minister. He can be assured that the malfunctioning of Front Bench communications in Fine Gael does not occur on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach pay attention to page 41 of the programme which promises legislation to deal with the problem of money laundering which is not an offence here at present?  Can I have an assurance that this promise in the programme to create the offence of money laundering will be introduced in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to priorities and timescale.  Has the ethics in Government Bill slipped in terms of priority?  Will the ceiling on contributions to political parties and politicians be installed before the legislation granting an amnesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question on the Government Bill is in order, but the other miscellaneous matters the Deputy is raising are clearly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish if the ethics in Government Bill will be brought before the Bill to legalise an amnesty for tax cheats with the consequent danger of political parties benefiting from contributions as a result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if the Taoiseach is not allowed by the Chair to answer questions about the specifics in the programme, what is he allowed to answer questions on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, Deputy Bruton we cannot go into specifics on the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  The programme consists of specifics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give rise to considerable debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It consists of nothing but specifics.  I want to know when will the Taoiseach introduce the legislation to deal with money laundering which is not a criminal offence here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should table a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was in order.  You agreed it yourself, and the Taoiseach was going to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, yes.  Does the Taoiseach wish to reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The ethics Bill is in the course of preparation.  I said that here on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the distinction between the ethics in Government Bill and a Bill on money laundering?  Why can the Taoiseach not answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of such a Bill, Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask Ivan Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Ethics has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the section of the programme entitled, &ldquo;Creating Jobs and Tackling Unemployment&rdquo; contains a paragraph committing the Government to the further development and strengthening of a dynamic and efficient State enterprise sector and acknowledging the role State bodies will continue to play in the economic live of this country, it is now official Government policy as expressed by the Tánaiste last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please Deputy Higgins, come to the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that no further privatisation <Col N="1197" /> of any State companies will take place during the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government states the position quite clearly and that will be adhered to by both parties in Government and by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that the ethics in Government Bill was in the course of preparation but the question specifically was as to what priority it is now being given.  Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House when it will be introduced, and if it will be introduced and completed before the House rises in July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be introduced as soon as it is ready.  It has not come to Government yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether it is still the intention of Government to restore public accountability, transparency and trust to ensure the highest standards in public life? Would he say how that squares with the introduction of a tax write-off for those who have broken the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be ample time to discuss taxation in the Finance Bill coming before the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hypocritical amendments do not add to the type of standards about which the Deputy spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I have noticed that both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, in reference to policy matters, argue on the basis of whether provision for this tax write-off is contained within the Programme for Government.  Would the Taoiseach inform the House whether there has been any procedure agreed between the Government parties to deal <Col N="1198" /> with important policy matters which arise and are not contained within the Programme for Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government deals with those as a matter of course as they arise throughout the term of Government.</P>

I am also scheduled to visit Paris this month for meetings with President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur.

      <P>It is well established international practice that, on the occasion of official visits abroad, gifts are exchanged between host and guest.

It would appear that Deputy Shatter never spoke to his colleagues when in Government or he would know exactly the procedure.

It would be open to the Deputy <Col N="1206" /> to put down a further question to the Minister for Health, if he wishes.  As I said, the question of extending the barring orders legislation is being considered in my Department.  I made this clear to the House on 16 February when the matter was discussed.  The matter will be considered in the context of the Programme for Government and the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation. However, there are complications.  The question of the extent to which the legislation should be extended has to be carefully considered with a number of other issues, including the question of protection orders, whether they should be made permanent and who should be entitled to apply for them.  It is my intention in due course to extend the legislation dealing with barring and protection orders.  Cases have been brought to my attention where, for example, mothers have been terrorised by grown up sons but I cannot at this stage state the exact parameters of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his colleague, not in reply to a Dáil question but in a considered speech prepared by his Department, said that he would talk to the Minister for Justice about this matter?  Will the Minister have discussions in this regard with the Minister for Health whose area of responsibility this is?  Is the Minister aware of the fact that long before the Commission on the Status of Women reported and long before the Kilkenny incest investigation the Law Reform Commission recommended that legislation be introduced in this area?  When will a final decision be made by the Minister on the nature of this legislation?  Will it be published before the Dáil goes into recess for the summer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct when he states that the question of possible extensions in this area has been on the stocks for a long time.  As far back as 1986, for example, the question of whether there should be permanent protection orders was considered.  Indeed, a draft Bill was prepared at that time but, in the course of consultations, a considerable volume of objections was received, particularly from a number of women's organisations which apparently felt it might not be desirable because many district justices might be inclined to avail of the protection order procedure alone on a permanent basis rather than the more effective barring order procedure. Consequently, that legislation was then dropped.  For all these reasons the matter is complex and requires some care in setting the parameters.  The examination of the procedures is underway in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that we have legal redress for victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. Any employee who considers that she or he may be a victim, may refer a complaint to the Labour Court under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977. Nevertheless, there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to introduce even more explicit provisions in employment equality legislation with a view to eliminating sexual harassment at work.  I am currently examining what legislative provision will best meet this commitment <Col N="1208" /> in the review of employment equality legislation.</P>
      <P>Over and above legislative provision, I have been examining what other measures should be taken on this matter. In this regard I have been examining the views of employer and trade union interests on the EC Recommendation and Code of Practice on the Protection of Dignity of Women and Men at Work.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these views and the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on this matter I have been reviewing how to progress the adoption of an Irish Code of Practice.  I have now decided that an Irish Code of Practice should be drafted by the Employment Equality Agency in full consultation with the social partners and other relevant bodies.  I have asked the agency to commence this work without delay and report back to me by the end of October.  At that stage I will consider how any such draft code might be given legal effect.</P>

Will the Minister indicate what steps he intends to take to ensure that within every business concern someone is readily identifiable to deal with such complaints when they arise?  Will he agree that there is a need for a public information programme to ensure that the current protections available under the law are known to people who are the victims of sexual harassment at work?</P>

      <P>I agree with the general comments made by the Deputy although the person who spoke at the Rape Crisis Centre yesterday, when the document was presented to me, was at pains to point out that the number did not relate to firms but to employees.  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that that number of firms is involved.  However, I agree there <Col N="1209" /> must be maximum publicity so that people are aware of their rights under existing legislation.  A number of efforts have been made by organisations in that regard.  For instance, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has published documentation and held seminars.  In addition I attended a seminar organised by the Irish Nurses' Organisation, the Employment Equality Agency also has responsibility in this area and has published documentation.  The survey published yesterday highlighted the importance of firms &mdash; and I agree with Deputy Shatter &mdash; nominating and appointing a particular person to whom complaints could be addressed and which would then be investigated and examined in a sympathetic and completely confidential manner.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that we have been backward in dealing with this question, indeed in many respects we have been quite advanced: the Labour Court have upheld that sexual harassment will be regarded as discrimination of the employee.  That decision goes back quite a number of years.  Ireland took the initiative in initiating a measure that led to the establishment of a code of practice by the EC. The code of practice may not be quite appropriate to the Irish scene and that is the reason I have asked the Equality Employment Agency to prepare an Irish code of practice.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 28 together.  When replying to questions in this House on 28 April last I said that it is my intention that the additional £100,000 allocation in 1993 would be used in order to reduce the length of the waiting lists at the various law centres by availing of the services of private solicitors.  I believe that private solicitors have a significant contribution to make in helping to provide a cost effective and efficient civil legal aid service and I am considering how best they can make that contribution.  In this regard I have sought the views of the Legal Aid Board on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have already had discussions with the Incorporated Law Society in relation to the contribution which private practitioners can make.  I have also examined the submissions on the subject of private practitioners with particular reference to: the economic benefits which might accrue from having local solicitors act for clients where the courts in question may be distant from the law centre; the feasibility of making arrangements for local solicitors to provide direct service to clients in towns distant from law centres; and in &ldquo;conflict of interest cases&rdquo; where the one law centre cannot act for both parties in the one case.  Details of the scheme are currently being worked out by the Legal Aid Board and it would be premature at this stage to say in what manner the scheme would operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that in cases of &ldquo;conflict of interests&rdquo; and for economic reasons it is preferable to have the private practitioners involved.  Before the Minister spends the additional £100,000 allocation on the services of <Col N="1212" /> private practitioners will he discuss with the Incorporated Law Society the role of the private practitioner and the setting of a realistic scale of fees?  As we know, £100,000 will not go very far if the fees that we had been reading about lately in relation to other matters are charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Deputy Harney that I will be keeping a very close eye on the level of fees that will be negotiated for solicitors who carry out work under the legal aid scheme.  I have had discussions already with the Incorporated Law Society on the general subject and, as Deputy Harney knows, the Incorporated Law Society recommended that private practitioners had a role in this area.  I am satisfied they have a role as a supplementary back up facility.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of economic efficiency things have not always worked out well in the various law centres, for example, in cases where it was merely an adjournment of a case or an application to a court it was necessary for a solicitor to travel from a distant law centre instead of using a solicitor from the town where the case was being heard.  A practice was adopted of sending a solicitor from the law centre and it would take a day to do nothing more than seek an adjournment. That is not economic.  Likewise, where clients are a considerable distance from a law centre it makes sense to avail of the services of a private practitioner.  I agree that the level of fees will be crucial and I will not agree to any scheme to employ private practitioners unless I am satisfied that the suggested level of fees are reasonable.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister be more forthcoming and have the discussions with the Incorporated Law Society in order to reach agreement before we start down the road of employing private practitioners?  If it is left to the Legal Aid Board to negotiate fees on a case by case basis, I believe we will not be charged realistic fees, the additional allocation will not go very far, and a bad precedent will be established.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear, but that is exactly what will be done.  Fees will not be negotiated on a case by case basis and a scale of fees will be agreed with a set fee for each type of work to be handled, a fee for an adjournment, judicial separation, a barring order or whatever.  A scale of fees for all cases will have to be agreed and there is no question of negotiating on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>Other than where the Legal Aid Board's services may be concerned my Department has no particular responsibility for State services in cases where allegations of domestic violence or sexual abuse are made.  The Departments of Health and Justice are the Departments with primary responsibility in these areas.  Accordingly, any improvements which might be brought about in the area of co-ordination of such services, can best be undertaken by those two Departments.</P>
      <P>Indeed in the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation which was headed by Ms. Catherine McGuinness, SC, it is recommended that:</P>
      <P>responsibility for ensuring that interagency reviews are carried out should be assigned to the Health Board.  My colleague the Minister for Health is currently examining the report.</P>
      <P>As responsibility for co-ordination in such matters is clearly not a matter for my Department it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

Does he acknowledge that the primary victims of such abuse are women and children and that if the rights of women and children are to be protected equally the Department of Equality and Law Reform should act as the co-ordinating Department, as the evidence from the Kilkenny incest case showed an abysmal lack of co-operation over a long number of years between the various agencies under different Departments?</P>

They include a large number of other areas which were not included in that Department in the past.  Clearly, the Department of Health and the health boards are at the cutting edge of these issues and should be in communication with the Garda when they come across cases they suspect should be investigated. I presume that is the reason the McGuinness report suggested the health board should have the co-ordinating responsibility to liaise with the Department of Justice and the Garda in appropriate cases.  As the House is aware the Minister for Health has provided an additional £5 million this year to bring all the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My brief on issues of inequality is drawn from those set down in the Programme for a Partnership Government dealing with equality.  Its focus is on the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality, or national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community.  I intend to pursue this commitment by amending employment equality legislation and through the introduction of an equal status Bill.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that notwithstanding the brief given to my Department, the role of other Departments and public service agencies in addressing discrimination and inequality in respect of their functions and the citizens they serve is not removed.</P>
      <P>The plight of those experiencing disadvantage, including young people in some inner city areas, will continue to be addressed through the economic and social policy measures of a range of Departments including Health, Social Welfare, Education, Environment and Enterprise and Employment.</P>

I do not deny that there are areas of social deprivation in the inner city and, indeed, in the outer county as well as in many parts of Ireland.  Many aspects of the matters outlined by the Deputy such as health, social welfare, education, housing, employment and so on are the responsibility of the relevant Departments. It is open to Deputy Gregory to table questions to each of those Ministers on those issues, so far as their area of responsibility is concerned.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he will accede to the request from the Council for the Status of Women for a special grant to ensure that the valuable second report of the Commission is widely disseminated.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women has already been widely disseminated and that considerable efforts have been made to make it accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>One thousand copies of a guide to the report which summarised the findings in each chapter with full details of the recommendations were published and have been made available, free, to women's groups, social partners and other decision makers.  The Council for the Status of Women itself received a substantial proportion of the print run of this free guide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate that the council would wish to generate a continuing discussion on the report's recommendations among its member organisations.  With that end in mind the council has approached me with an outline proposal for a series of <Col N="1219" /> workshops on the report to take place at different locations around the country.  I have already advised the council that it will not be possible to increase its operating grant for 1993 but, apart from that, my Department would be happy to assist the council in any way possible to realise its aim.  I have also advised the council that I will give sympathetic consideration to an increase in its grant in 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not able to do anything immediately but I welcome the indication that he will do something in relation to this in 1994.  Given the tremendous demands on the existing small budget of the council, does the Minister believe it is reasonable to expect that they will be able to undertake this desirable work from their own resources?  Further, is the Minister aware that the 1,000 copies have been distributed and that there are no further copies available for the many groups who deserve access to this information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the object of the Deputy's question.  Within the resources available I will be very happy to assist her in any way I can.  I do not think the 1,000 copies have been distributed.  Many large organisations, including trade unions, the ICA and so on, are affiliated to the council.  They have the resources and, I am sure, will make arrangements to debate the report fully and communicate their findings back to the council.  I am fully supportive of the work of the Council for the Status of Women and am anxious to assist it in any way I can.  I am in communication with them on a regular basis and I have indicated that I will see what may be done to increase their grant-in-aid in 1994 subject, of course, to the budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>Given the importance of the recommendations in this report and that only 1,000 copies were made available for dissemination to various groups, how does the Minister intend <Col N="1220" /> to make the recommendations known to people living in rural areas who do not belong to organisations and who will not have access to the report unless the Department makes funds available to ensure they do?  Why should it be necessary for a person to be a member of an organisation to have access to this report?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's question all too well.  A very large number of organisations is affiliated to the Council for the Status of Women and they have all received free copies of the document.  The question of having a further print run might have to be considered in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach.  However, it has been well disseminated and the extensive network of groups is very much involved with it, as is my own Department. The Council for the Status of Women is a very broadly based representative organisation.  I am not sure how many constituent organisations are within it but, as far as I recall, it is a very substantial number.  I was at its annual general meeting and saw the representation. Any woman who is interested is well aware of what is going on, the work that will proceed in the years ahead to highlight various aspects of the report will be undertaken in a wide variety of ways through many of the constituent organisations.  I would be prepared to help with that in any way I <Col N="1221" /> can and if something can be done next year I will certainly do it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not feel that there is an anomaly whereby there appears to be unlimited funds for the Taoiseach to travel abroad with his entourage, for questionable returns, while the Council for the Status of Women which is doing such a valuable job cannot travel within the country to provide women and men with the information and workshops that are needed to inform people of this valuable document?

All appropriate steps are being taken within the ambit of my Department to monitor it, recommendation by recommendation, Department of Department.  Likewise, the Council for the Status of Women and its constitutent organisations have received 1,000 copies of the document free so that every constituent organisation of the council has received at least one copy, in many cases considerably more than that. It is an ongoing process which will continue for the remainder of this year and into next year.  This House will have an oppportunity from time to time to review that position.  I will be able to report the progress on these recommendations and I hope the House will be well satisfied in this regard as time passes.

I will ask the Minister to consider ordering a reprint as, clearly, not enough copies are available?  The Minister's commitment must be given practical expression and one way is to make the report available and ensure that all those who wish to have a copy get it so that the recommendations can be discussed and a fruitful debate ensues.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.  In line with a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I am in the process of carrying out a major programme of family law reform which will culminate in the referendum on divorce in 1994.  The programme reflects many of the proposals in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown and anticipated a number of recommendations on family law matters set out in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The implementation of this programme of reform will, I believe, help substantially to ensure the success of the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>In the context of the programme in question, a Bill on the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders, which I initiated this year, has been enacted.  The Bill giving equal rights of ownership in the family home to spouses will be published in the next few weeks.  The Family Law (No. 1) Bill, contained in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, which among other matters will extend the powers of the court in the area of domestic maintenance orders, is in the process of being drafted and will be introduced later this year.  Legislation which will put the scheme of legal aid and advice on a statutory basis is also being prepared and I expect to have it in place by the time of the referendum.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to proceed with as many measures of family law reform as departmental resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the divorce referndum, it is my view that the best contribution that can be made to its success is for all involved to conduct the referendum campaign <Col N="1225" /> in an informed and calm manner having regard to the importance of the issues involved and the human problems to which they relate.</P>
    <P>To this end, I will be publishing in advance of the referendum the specific legislative proposals on divorce that will be introduced in the event of a positive referendum outcome.</P>
    <P>Opposition parties have already had an opportunity to express their views on the divorce issue in the course of the debate in this House on the White Paper on Marital Breakdown on 26 March 1993. Nevertheless, I am prepared to have further discussions with all political parties on this very important issue and would welcome any proposals or suggestions which they may wish to put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe it is time to move on?  The information he has given to the House today is similar to that given by him on a number of occasions since the Government published its joint Programme for Government.  The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Flynn, stated that he hoped to hold the divorce referendum this year and we are now told it will not take place until next year.  The people want to know the option which the Minister considers correct in regard to the divorce referendum. Does he not believe it appropriate to begin to spell that out at this stage?  There has been a great deal of consultation in that regard and I am sure the Minister is well aware of people's views on the matter.  Would he agree with the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, that this legislation should be enacted sooner rather than later and that the incorporation of five different options, each one more vague and cumbersome than the previous one, does not amount to leadership?  Is it not time for the Minister to give us a little leadership and indicate his precise thinking in relation to divorce legislation?  The public perception is that this matter has gone on for too long and that it is time to set down clear markers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need have no <Col N="1226" /> fear in regard to the question of leadership. At the appropriate time leadership will be given, the legislation will be introduced and the Government's determined option will be announced, debated and voted on.  In the meantime, discussions are taking place and a debate on the White Paper has taken place in this House.  The Deputy is not correct in stating that all parties have made their views known.  The Progressive Democrats' spokesperson certainly made her views known.  Other parties were not so forthcoming but that is a matter for themselves. The Government will discuss all the options and the one it selects may not necessarily be one of those stated in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown. That is not a comprehensive and exclusive list of possible options; there may well be a mix of other options which are not indicated in that White Paper.  All aspects of the matter will be considered and the Government will make and announce its decision at the appropriate time.  The support and co-operation of all parties on this important issue will be sought. For that reason, I am open to discussion and consultation on the issue with any Deputy or party who wishes to avail of that opportunity.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm the information he gave on the national airwaves last Friday on the important related issue of pensions?  Will he indicate that the Government's approach to this matter will involve giving both the first and second spouses pension rights?  Will he clarify if that will relate to contributory or non-contributory pension rights?  This is an important issue and I would welcome the Minister's confirmation of the information he gave on the national airwaves last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on the national airwaves, I am not in a position to clarify the exact specifics of the position in regard to pensions but an interdepartmental committee, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department <Col N="1227" /> of Social Welfare, is examining the issues mentioned by the Deputy.  I will be at pains to ensure that nobody loses out by reason of a change of nomenclature or because a person is not a widow. There should be no loss to such persons. The broad method by which that will be accomplished has not yet been determined and will be considered by my Department and the Government when the interdepartmental committee publishes its report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that he has sent out conflicting signals in regard to his own thinking on this matter? Has the Government decided to hold a referendum in June of next year in conjunction with the European elections? Will he recommend a simple deletion of the prohibition in the Constitution or that something should be written into the Constitution?  Will he ensure that there is access to the courts?  The Minister referred to putting the legal aid scheme on a statutory basis but that, in itself, would not lead to access to the various provisions of the law.  As the Minister is aware, it takes one year to secure an appointment at the legal aid centre in Tallaght.  Unless we provide additional resources our legal aid system will not be able to deal with the volume of clients seeking advice following the enactment of divorce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt with the question of legal aid in this House on a number of occasions recently and there are other questions tabled today which I do not want to anticipate.  I have not yet made recommendations to the Government as to the format of the constitutional amendment.  Consequently I am not in a position to supply the information requested by the Deputy.  Those matters will be considered and decisions will be made at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women recommended the deletion of Article 41.2.2º of the Constitution which it considered was now outmoded.  I am sympathetic to the commission's view of this provision and I will consider, at an appropriate time, what action might be taken on this recommendation. In the meantime, I would be interested to receive views from the widest possible range of individuals and organisations including all political parties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's openness in regard to considering this issue.  Does he accept the commission's view that this Article was never of any advantage to women in the home and was used to the disadvantage of women at work and that it is now seriously outmoded?  Would he accept that Article 41.2.1º on its own, without Article 41.2.2º, sufficiently acknowledges women's role in the home and that Article 41.2.2º confines women to that narrow role alone?</P>

      <P>I agree with the thrust of <Col N="1234" /> Deputy Flaherty's comment but I would be interested to hear her view on Article 41.2.1º which, it seems to me, also has the wrong emphasis.  I find it somewhat surprising that the commission made no comment about that Article.  Overall, I agree that the question of a constitutional amendment will have to be considered.</P>

      <P>The Minister put a question to me and I would like to have an opportunity to reply.  I must remind the Minister that he should not ask Deputies questions.  We are here to ask the Minister questions.  Why does the Minister continue to say, &ldquo;at the appropriate time&rdquo; in relation to every reply he has given?  When will be &ldquo;the appropriate time&rdquo;?  Will the Minister accept that the Constitution in so far as it refers to women refers to them in an extremely offensive way and presumes they are either mothers or wives?  Single women have no role in the Irish Constitution. Would the Minister agree that it is his responsibility to look at the Constitution in so far as it relates to women and produce proposals for reform of the Constitution to be put to the people as on the same day as, perhaps, the divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility and it may well be considered although I do not think it would be a good idea to have that constitutional referendum at the same time as a divorce referendum as it might possibly detract from it.</P>
      <P>The question of Article 41 will be considered at an appropriate time.  I would point out to Deputy Harney that the Constitution was in existence this time last year and the year before; it is not a Constitution that was brought in two months ago.  It has been there for some time.</P>

      <P>The commission was set up to make recommendations to Government and, indeed, that is precisely what it has done.  How much more consultation does the Minister wish to have in relation to this provision?  Would the Minister agree that it is time, as we approach the year 2000, for our Constitution to reflect a more modern Ireland and not the paternalistic approach contained in this provision?  We should have a specific equality provision enshrined in our Constitution like Germany, Portugal, Greece, France and the Netherlands?</P>

I have indicated that I sympathise and agree with the recommendations of the commission in so far as 41.2.2º is concerned.

Would he agree that rather than tinkering around piecemeal with aspects of Articles 41 and 42 the two subparagraphs should be redrafted not only to give women equal rights and to protect those rights but also to protect the rights of children?  Can the Minister indicate to the House what work, if any, is being undertaken in his Department to examine the manner in which those Articles discriminate against and create difficulties for children in circumstances where their welfare should be protected?</P>

I cannot say that the Department has carried out any work on it but we are of the opinion that it is appropriate to examine it.  Further consultation is necessary.  The last word on a matter of that nature does not necessarily lie with the second commission alone.  Obviously, its views are very important and I am sympathetic with its recommendation on that Article but the procedures will continue.  I would be hopeful that before too long it may be possible to have a constitutional referendum on that and any other Articles requiring revision in keeping with the 1990s.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the reason the commission identified Article 41.2 as causing greater difficulty is that the legal terms in which it was written were used to justify active discrimination or various treatments of women in the workplace prior to the introduction of EC law covering that area?  Will the Minister accept that that is a major reason to consider that provision? I share the Minister's view that Article 40.1.1º discriminates against men who are homemakers.  While it is a positive statement of the value of work in the home it is discriminatory against men.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a question raised by <Col N="1237" /> Deputy McDowell on the law of real property he suggested that I set up a volunteer committee of experts, comprising representatives of the Irish Association of Law Teachers, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society, to make proposals for or prepare draft legislation.  I indicated at the time that I would be prepared to consider setting up such a group and Deputy McDowell offered to chair it.</P>

Does he <Col N="1239" /> not recognise that lawyers have an inordinate representation in the Dáil and that there are great dangers in giving them influence over and above what they have managed to attain already?  Would the Minister not be better advised to provide an expert group among people who are not represented in the Dáil such as unemployed, the poor, the marginalised, minority groups and women who are very often at the receiving end of the difficulties created by solicitors and lawyers in complicating the law to the extent that one can only receive the benefits of the law by employing a solicitor?  The Minister's approach in this regard is back to front.  As Minister responsible for equality, surely Deputy Taylor should be considering ways of reducing the influence of lawyers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If people with expertise can help in drafting legislation that will be of help to disadvantaged groups, it seems a waste of resources not to use the skills and abilities of those people who may be prepared to serve and make a substantial contribution.  Participation in such a grouping would require a degree of dedication on the part of many people, and I would be grateful to any Members who would be prepared to give their time, abilities and energy to help in this area. That is not to say representative groupings such as those indicated by Deputy McManus may not be necessary or important.  One such group is being set up which Deputy McManus has agreed to chair and I am grateful to her for undertaking that important task.  No doubt groupings will also be set up to <Col N="1240" /> deal with other matters, but that should not detract from the willingness of Members of the House with expertise in various areas to make a contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Racial discrimination may take varying forms.  I am not aware of the existence of any specific nationwide survey in this area.  Certainly this country is not entirely free form racial discrimination &mdash; few countries are.  The Harmony organisation instances cases from time to time.  Perhaps we are remiss in that we did not introduce anti-discrimination legislation sooner, as was done in many other countries.  Even if racial discrimination exists to a very small degree &mdash; I believe it is a small degree &mdash; I am sure all members agree that legislation should be on the Statute Book to outlaw and prohibit it and to provide sanctions in respect of it.  I am aware of <Col N="1241" /> a number of isolated cases over the years, but this is neither the time nor the place to go into them in detail.  The cases were dealt with within the parameters of existing legislation, which is insufficient and unsatisfactory to deal with some aspects of racial material circulated on occasion. In accordance with the Programme for Government I am anxious to proceed with the legislation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important way of dealing with this matter will be by way of legislation.  One should try to highlight it as far as possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, although that is not racial discrimination nonetheless it is indicative of discrimination in many respects.  There has been legislation to deal with this matter since the mid-seventies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries; it is regrettable that only now in the 1990s we are getting around to introducing such legislation here.</P>

      <P>On 27 May 1993, I announced the appointment of Deputy Liz McManus as chairperson of the Government Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
      <P>I expect to complete membership of the task force shortly.  It will then be able to commence its work on advising me on planning the implementation of a coordinated national policy in relation to travellers.  The task force will include travellers, representatives of groups working with travellers, local councillors and officers from the relevant Government Departments, as well as a senior official from a local authority.</P>
      <P>I have given the task force wide-ranging terms of reference which will encompass the issues examined in the report.  No doubt the task force will take the report into account in its deliberations. Pending receipt of the recommendations of the task force, I have emphasised to local authorities that they must proceed with and extend where appropriate the services for travellers for which they are responsible.  Government Departments will also be proceeding with the current programme for travellers.</P>

      <P>I note that the Minister said he had seen the report but he did not say he had read it.  Will the Minister not accept that this survey of travelling families in the west of Ireland makes shocking reading?  The report says, for example, that 61 per cent of the couples surveyed were involved in consanguineous marriages, so in-breeding is a major problem resulting in many genetic disorders in children.  About 20 per cent of the travelling children surveyed in County Galway had serious hearing impairments.  This is perhaps the only real survey of the difficulties experienced by travelling families.  In the light <Col N="1245" /> of the shocking findings, will the Minister ensure that we can take steps in the short term pending the report of the task force, in order to deal with some of the obvious problems?  Will the Minister consider, for example, providing genetic counselling and a proper family planning service for travelling families?  The survey showed that 28 per cent of all travelling families included more than ten members, even though the mothers were very young, teenage mothers in some cases.  In the short term will the Minister provide genetic counselling and a comprehensive family planning service, including advice and family planning devices and so on, to travelling families?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the report.  As Deputy Harney says, many of its findings are of singular concern.  I am sure the report will have the immediate attention of the task force.  On the issue of genetic counselling and family planning, I will consult with the Minister for Health to see what can be done in that regard.  This report was presented to the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>In relation to the protection of children which has been a source of much debate recently, would the Minister not agree that, although we all agree that the travelling community have rights as an ethnic minority the State must intervene to protect children?  This report shows that many travelling children are at risk of neglect by virtue of their habitat and the way they live. Health care services should be put in place immediately along with a domiciliary service for infants and young children in the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree.  On all of those issues I will consult with the Minister for Health.  Happily, the Government has made £5 million available in 1993 to implement the Child Care Act.  I am sure an appreciable proportion of that will be relevant to the children of travelling families.  With that money major advances should be possible in 1993.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that from the report it appears that in nearly 90 per cent of travelling families in the west where marriages occur the participants share a great grandparent or a grandparent?  It appears from page 34 of the report that a travelling child is 20 times more likely to be profoundly deaf than an ordinary child and eight times more likely to be referred for evaluation in respect of mental handicap.  Does this not mean that there is a huge urgency now to offer those services, and not just to consult with the Minister for Health about it?  We need to do something positive to assist young travellers who are about to be married and to advise them of the enormous implications of these disturbing figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that they are disturbing figures.  Many of the findings are a matter of grave concern.  It is not just a matter of consulting with the Minister for Health.  This report was presented to the Minister for Health and I am quite sure he and his officials are taking the appropriate steps in connection with it. They will be all the better able to do that now by reason of the additional £5 million for child care which has been provided by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women presented its final report to Government on 11 February 1993. Having completed its assigned task it then ceased to exist, as is the nature of such Government commissions.</P>
      <P>The next stage is action on the recommendations in the commission's report.  I have already asked all Government Ministers to bring forward proposals drawn from the commission's report so that a programme of implementation can be established.  A monitoring committee will oversee implementation of this programme. Work is well in hands on this approach and my intention is that the programme will be in place and the monitoring committee operational by autumn of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the disputes in Dublin Bus have resulted in a reduction in services of approximately 25 per cent with consequent serious inconvenience to the public.  The issues in dispute in both cases can and should be resolved through negotiation and do not warrant the disruption of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drivers' dispute arises from the introduction of a revised network of services for the Blanchardstown-Cabra-Castleknock and Dunboyne areas.  This was the subject of intensive discussions at local level and at the Labour Relations Commission and was then referred to the Labour Court.  In its recommendation issued on 12 May the Labour Court recommended that all elements of the network review, with one exception, be implemented from 17 May for one month during which time the parties would <Col N="1249" /> negotiate on all the detailed points raised in respect of the changes.  The Labour Court gave us an undertaking, in the recommendation, to arrange a hearing and issue a recommendation without further formality in the event of failure to reach agreement on any particular point. The recommendation was accepted by one of the unions concerned, the NBRU, but was rejected by SIPTU.  It is a matter of regret that SIPTU took this course of action, particularly having regard to the undertaking given by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The craft workers' dispute arises from productivity negotiations which have been ongoing for the past three years. The claim has been the subject of detailed negotiations at the Labour Relations Commission from which two sets of proposals emerged but which were rejected by the workers concerned.  The claim could have been referred to the Labour Court at that stage but the unions opted instead for strike action.  A Labour Court hearing was arranged for Friday 28 May on the understanding that the workers would resume normal working. However, as the workers did not comply with a request from their unions to return to work, the Labour Court hearing did not go ahead.  The Labour Court had informed the unions that if they resumed normal working a court hearing would be held within 24 hours.  There was a meeting of craftsmen today and I regret that the workers voted against a resumption of normal working.  It is difficult to understand why the workers opted to take strike action in the first place and why they persist in their refusal to resume normal working despite the recommendation from their unions to do so.</P>
    <P>In the context of industrial disputes, the best solutions are to be found when the parties themselves follow proper procedures with a view to reaching negotiated settlements.  The State provides machinery, in the form of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to assist parties whenever there are particular difficulties in arriving at negotiated settlements.  In the vast majority of cases, employers and trade unions either reach mutually acceptable <Col N="1250" /> solutions to disputes directly or with the assistance of the independent dispute settling agencies.  The services of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are designed to ensure that parties have impartial, expert and independent assistance, in incremental stages, to reach settlements and to avoid industrial action.</P>
    <P>In both Dublin Bus disputes, the unions concerned do not appear to be willing to follow normal well established procedures for resolving disputes.  In these circumstances it would be wholly inappropriate for me to intervene personally. These disputes are causing unnecessary and avoidable hardship to Dublin commuters which I fully appreciate. I urge the unions, their members and all others concerned to take this into account and reconsider their positions with a view to ending both disputes quickly.  The Labour Court is available at this stage to give any assistance it can to all the parties in both disputes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that issuing 3,000 protective notices by Dublin Bus management to their employees was a most provocative and undoubtedly served to harden the position on both sides?  Furthermore, with regard to the drivers' dispute at the Phibsborough bus depot, is the Minister aware that SIPTU is willing to go back into the Labour Court at a moment's notice, if needs be this evening?  Last week I understood the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, said in this House that the Labour Court was available and standing by.  Will the Minister say whether the Labour Court is still standing by and why the court will not call in the two sides in the drivers' dispute to resolve any outstanding issues in this dispute at least?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court is available to all parties to the dispute if they wish to avail of its considered and professional machinery.  I recommend that all parties to the dispute, including those at the bus depot to which Deputy Gregory referred, avail of the fact that the Labour Court is available, that they <Col N="1251" /> exercise that option and move quickly in an endeavour to resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, irrespective of his or anybody else's views of the issues in dispute or about adherence to procedures, that both sides in this dispute are now rapidly digging themselves into entrenched positions?  Will he also agree that it is now critical, to serve the travelling public, that a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; formula be found?  Will the Minister ask the Labour Court to intervene directly in the SIPTU dispute &mdash; where the issue involves the suspension of employees and who are not involved in today's ballot?  Will he ask the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court to have discussions with Dublin Bus and the craft unions on some kind of a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; formula in view of today's discussions?  If those initiatives fail, will the Minister intervene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am open to the idea that my Department and the two institutions answerable to the Department, although clearly independent, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, should vigorously explore a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; formula that would have the consent of all those involved.  Deputy Gilmore &mdash; with his previous experience as a professional trade union representative &mdash; will recognise the complexities of this dispute, its history and the problems associated with it. However, the House can take it that I will encourage the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, with the consent of the parties associated with this dispute, to pursue vigorously the search for a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, expressed the same disappointment with the dispute in the House last week?  It is clear that the Minister is adopting a &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; approach? Given that the strike has escalated, the outcome of the vote today among craft workers, the disruption which has been caused for those who are trying to get to <Col N="1252" /> work and the threat to jobs, the Minister must intervene directly in this dispute having regard to the fact that the former Department of Labour, which was always seen as another part of the machinery in solving such disputes, has been absorbed into the Minister's Department?  Would the Minister not intervene directly and outline the action he intends to take during the next 24 hours to bring this potentially explosive and damaging strike to a conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;No arrangement, compromise or settlement in respect of any liability for income tax or income levy, shall be made, where such arrangement, compromise or settlement would amount to an arbitrary or invidious discrimination between the taxpayer or class of taxpayer and taxpayers or classes of taxpayers who have complied with their obligations in respect of such taxes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise for a period longer than five minutes the question of the tax amnesty.  I am glad we are not having a recurrence of what took place on the Adjournment Debate last week.  This amendment relates to a broader one which has been divided into two parts on the advice of the Bills Office. Amendment No. 174 relates also to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> I regard this as part of the care and management process vested in the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the integrity of purpose and function of the tax collection system.  While amendment No. 1 is confined, as recommended by the Bills Office, to income tax and the income levy, its related amendment deals with corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The entire care and management process and the responsibility vested in the Revenue Commissioners is at the heart of this amnesty measure.  The amnesty is a knee jerk quick fix means of raising revenue, as is the 1 per cent income levy which has been universally criticised.  In a sense, this is a compound fracture in the tax breakdown of this year's budget and Finance Bill because the amnesty is explained in part, if not completely, by the desire to find a second revenue source to get the Government out of the political fix of the 1 per cent income levy which it should never have introduced.</P>
    <P>The amnesty has more pernicious faults in respect of the integrity of the tax system than the 1 per cent levy.  It is an insult to the compliant tax paying public and is unprecedented in its form as a tax amnesty.  Reports would suggest that the Government intends to write off all due liabilities under the income tax Acts, corporation tax, capital acquisition taxes, capital gains tax or income levies and replace such universal write-off of liability with some penalty, as yet unspecified, but widely thought to be a flat rate tax of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is in essence a lottery style bonanza for tax cheats and it has been underwritten by the Government as a quick fix means of raising revenue.  This is an extremely ill thought out measure.  Up to now the Minister for Finance, out of a sense of consistency and decency, has not gone on the record in relation to this matter because he did not know which way to turn.  I believe the reports are correct and that the Minister was advised not to accept this amnesty.  They are correct in that the Revenue Commissioners believed that this amnesty, providing a charter for tax dodgers, would be a gross <Col N="1379" /> offence to those who complied with their taxation obligations over the years or even to those who complied with earlier amnesties that did not write off tax liability in the normal process.  The amnesty measure is ill thought out for more than that reason.</P>
    <P>There was nothing in the budget speech about a tax amnesty.  However, ten weeks after the budget and after due reflection by the Minister, his advisers, the Revenue authorities and the Government there is no reference in the Finance Bill to the word &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; or its laundered version &ldquo;incentive&rdquo;.  Even though the Minister could move item No. 5 on the Order Paper, an amendment between Committee and Report Stage to a Financial Resolution, he cannot let us know how this reprehensible proposal will proceed because he does not know.  It was reported that the Cabinet would make up its mind today, as they did not do so as part of budget policy, during the debate on the Finance Bill, in the Select Committee last week or in any Resolution before the House since then.  To whom will this amnesty apply?  Reports are mixed in this regard.  However universal its intended application may have been those who are now running scared under proper political scrutiny and the weight of public criticism and odium which this proposal has brought about will now see more limitations.  In respect of what period of time and to what funds held in this country or outside will it apply?  Clearly it will relate to tax cheats, dodgers and evaders, a group of people who are economic mé féiners in respect of the operation of the tax system. However, if one were to listen to the proponents of this measure and the reported remarks of the disappointed Taoiseach on his return from Malaysia &mdash; in so far as no one appeared to be interested in his trip and were more interested in this Bill &mdash; it would appear that those mé féiners, dodgers and evaders are now about to transform this land to one flowing with investment milk and honey.  We will now be confronted by latter day patriots on the economic front, <Col N="1380" /> the greatest mé féiners in our recent economic history.  I have never come across such staggering and profound naivety as to suggest to the public if they were gullible enough to swallow it &mdash; that those cheating mé féiners who evade their responsibility in law should now be transformed &mdash; at the stroke of a ministerial pen &mdash; into some form of latter day patriots and economic saints.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I must advise the House that we are now on Report Stage and I must dissuade Members from making a Second Stage speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to respect the Chair's ruling and will be as brief as I can on an issue which cries out for comment and which finally we have found some way of raising.  I will not tax your patience, Sir, but I ask for some indulgence on this matter.  The Government which makes up its tax policies as it goes along failed to include on Second Stage or Committee Stage of the Finance Bill a reference to the amnesty and still continues its merry dance in respect of its proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the issue of equity, exemption limits in the Finance Bill show that single people earning £70 a week or less will become liable for the full weight of taxation here and that a married person is liable for twice that amount.  Under the income levy a person earning £173 a week or more will be liable for a fifth tax on work.  Reports indicate that for all income held offshore or perhaps in certain accounts in Ireland and for accrued capital gains such investment will have earned during the years, a flat rate tax of 15 per cent will apply.  That position flies in the face of the basic concept of social <Col N="1381" /> justice and tax equity in terms of the construction of our tax code.  It has been argued that this makes sense in relation to interest rates and again lower them. What caused our interest rates to come down?  Devaluation, which the Minister did not want.  Ireland's position at the top of the band within the exchange rate mechanism, the strength of sterling and the fall in German interest rates has helped to bring interest rates down but this measure will not help.  The phenomenon which I described are the foundation stones on which our interest rate reductions are founded and it is superfluous to argue that interest rates will fall as a result of this measure.  Those dodgers and evaders have broken the law under the income tax Acts, the corporation tax Act, the capital gains tax Act, the three income levies and the exchange control regulations.  At a stroke that evasion and law breaking is to be set to one side in favour of those mé féiners who brought about the dodging element which this Government wants to underwrite and legitimise.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that this provision will lead to greater investment here.  Is it not the case that those mé féining, self-serving, tax cheating evaders did not give a damn about the Irish economy?  They took their money out of the country, they did not look for productive investment and our need was no less a few years ago than it is today. They did not care about the Irish economy. They lined their own pockets, cheated and evaded and we are now saying they will be the saving grace of our economic future.  This is absolute nonsense.  Is it not the case that we do not have exchange control and if this money is brought in laundered and legitimised for whatever price that it can go out again by means of a revolving door? We will now have rotating laundered money introduced with the compliments of the Labour Party instead of a rotating Taoiseach which we thought was a condition of the formation of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention briefly a letter which a colleague received this week from a <Col N="1382" /> woman with a tax liability who had heard a discussion on the radio about the tax amnesty.  She said that as she listened to the radio the sheriff sat in her hall preparing to remove her piano.  It was only when a neighbour came and contacted her brother that she was left alone that day.  She lives in a very remote place, has an old age pension as well as a very small British allowance.  She said that she was forced to pay £500.  She is 79 years of age and only has what it will take to bury her.</P>
    <P>She went on then to make one or two political comments which I will not repeat.  That woman had the sheriff sitting in her hall waiting to take away her piano or the small amount of money she set aside to bury her while the greatest dodgers, cheats, mé féiners and self servers in the history of the State will get away scot-free.  In terms of the ethics of this issue we are quickly moving from the image of the island of saints and scholars, which we like to pride our ethical past on, as a shining beacon of light across Europe, into an island of swindlers and dodgers to be underwritten by this partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The amendment raises one profound point which the Minister, the Government and those who support this issue must address.</P>
    <P>In respect of all the relevant taxes that I have mentioned, the class of taxpayer who has evaded, dodged and cheated will be treated in a manner which is arbitrary and invidious in respect of the equity and the operation of the existing system if this amnesty becomes law.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I will not tax you any further.  I have two final comments.  I have heard from members of the Labour Party that this measure is designed to be an alternative to the 1 per cent income levy.  That was a disaster and they should never have agreed to it but this is a greater disaster in terms of its attack on the integrity of the Irish tax code.  They should not agree to this as a knee-jerk response to a measure which was wrong in the first instance.  Some Labour Party members talk about additional spending on health and education arising out of this measure.  The Minister will know, even if some of those Members do not, that more spending will be a recurrent and perpetual feature whereas this amnesty, if it ever comes about, will be a once-off measure.</P>
      <P>This amnesty is a dog's dinner of an invasion on the integrity of the Irish tax code and it is well worthy of its senior author at Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know where to begin on this issue given that we have conflicting reports as to the extent to which Cabinet supports this proposal or whether there is majority support in Cabinet for it.  It was apparently adopted at the whim of the Taoiseach against the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and, one must assume, against the advice of the Minister for Finance who is present.  I do not envy Minister Ahern's job today in defending a measure for which he apparently has no stomach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the new philosophy of the Government is to tax the needy and reward the greedy.  We only have to <Col N="1384" /> examine the record to date which includes a 1 per cent levy on relatively low incomes, tax on disability benefit &mdash; I am sure there is not a Deputy who has not received representations from constituents whose incomes have been slashed as a result of tax on disability benefit &mdash; and single individuals on an income of £70 a week.  The taxing of this income drives them into deeper poverty as a result of the failure to properly reform and introduce equity into our tax system.  Yet this extraordinary decision was taken to introduce a tax amnesty for people who essentially abandoned this country to its fate in the eighties and who are, in my view, economic and social traitors.  They acted treacherously in the way they abandoned their responsibility to support our education and health systems. It must be remembered that in the eighties there were pleas of insufficient money to pay for our health services. Health cuts were a common feature and indeed the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, will remember that it was former Deputy Haughey who on arrival home from Japan declared surprise at the furore concerning health cuts.  He promptly lost the election he subsequently called due to his annoyance concerning a Private Members' motion that was passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax cheating is not a victimless crime and we should not have a Government which is prepared to reward people who abandoned the social services of this country.  We have had debates on the need for services for those with disabilities and mental handicap. We have had debates about schools that are under-funded, under-funded capitation grants and schools that are falling down.  In my constituency, Dublin NorthWest, the Holy Spirit national school in Ballymun, which Deputy Flaherty is raising on the Adjournment tonight, is literally falling down and yet there is no money to rebuild it because these tax cheats took their money out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The Government is proposing to invite them back, give them an amnesty on the tax they owe, an amnesty on any penalties they might have faced and an amnesty on the interest they might have had to pay as a result of failing to pay their fair share of tax.  It is an extraordinary decision.  Hundreds of thousands of PAYE workers who do not pay tax willingly &mdash; I do not think anyone pays tax willingly &mdash; are compliant and pay their fair share.  In fact, I understand they pay 87 per cent of the total tax take according to recent figures.  These people are being slapped in the face and insulted by this proposal to reward tax cheats.</P>
    <P>We must not forget either the thousands of honest business people in this State who have paid their share of tax also.  I would argue that some of them have not paid a fair or adequate share but certainly they have not run away from the country and abandoned the services, the poor, those in need or our health services as these tax cheats have.  We have been told that something in the order of £2,000 million has been stashed away by these people.  Few ordinary mortals would have £2,000 million stashed away.  One wonders at what level of society these people operate or how they have accumulated these vast fortunes.</P>
    <P>It is with some surprise that we hear the Government, at a time when everybody thought they had seen sense on this issue, announce overnight that they will introduce this tax amnesty.  The surprise is multiplied by the fact that the Labour Party seems to be accepting this proposal rather meekly.  We are told that they oppose it but, apparently, they did not push it to a vote in Cabinet in an effort to defeat it.  We have also the extraordinary spectacle of the chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, actively promoting the idea.  It boggles the mind as to what the Deputy is thinking about when he argues that this State should be supported on the basis of tax cheats being rewarded.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a few other points in relation to this matter.  The fact that the Taoiseach expressed surprise at the row and the disbelief this proposal has generated among honest taxpayers indicates <Col N="1386" /> that the man lives in a different world, that he is still attached to the old Fianna Fáil cute hoorism, the idea that the country should be run by strokes and winks and nods.  If that gombeen style of politics is still prevalent in the top echelons of Cabinet we have serious cause to be concerned.</P>
    <P>This country has been rocked by scandals for the last number of years as a result of business-political involvement in various matters, some of which have been aired at tribunal level and some in various investigations by accountants and others, and I do not propose to rehash them.  One would have thought that in view of that experience the current Taoiseach, whose Government lost so many seats in the last election precisely because of this style of approach to business and politics, would have learned his lesson. However, that is not the case and we now have another example of this gombeen culture, the belief that anything is justified in business and any attempt to ensure that people other than those in the PAYE sector pay their fair share of tax should be dropped and that those who do pay their fair share should be insulted and slapped in the face with this crazy notion of a tax amnesty for tax cheats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government announced its intention to bring in this amnesty the subject has recevied much comment.  It is important that the Government does not create the perception that it accepts the behaviour of tax dodgers The amnesty is a recognition that, despite the best efforts of the Revenue Commissioners, people have escaped the system and a lot of money is held outside the country.  Various figures have been put on the amount of money involved but that remains to be seen.  The Government is not, as other speakers have said, rewarding the greedy; the amnesty is an acceptance that people have escaped the system and it is an opportunity to get money back into the country.  This amnesty will reap a rich harvest for the Exchequer and will provide additional money for the needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last amnesty was a tremendous <Col N="1387" /> success although there were a number of doubting Thomases before its introduction. I will quote a Member of this House who spoke on the matter in 1988 He said:</P>
    <P>I particularly commend the Minister on the introduction of the amnesty. It has been the most far seeing and imaginative amnesty introduced for many years.  I sincerely hope it is what the Minister wishes and that it will benefit the Exchequer.  By getting this amnesty, if it works, out of the way, and with real self-assessment being rolled in following on that, we could bring the taxation system, particularly in the areas which cause concern, up to date.  This would mean an effective return to the Exchequer.  We would not be pretending every year that there are £600 million, £700 million or £800 million owed to taxes when most of it is assessed and notional, and does not have real relevance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment in the name of Deputy Cox proposes to proof our tax system against tax settlements which effectively amount to unfair discrimination as between those who are complying with the system and those who are not so complying.  The proposal is designed to proof the present law against the measure which it is proposed to introduce in the near future by way of legislation. I do not understand how somebody like Deputy Power can be so blind to the realities as to see no difference between what is proposed by some members of this Government, particularly the Taoiseach, and what happened in 1987-88.  What happened then, as the Deputy well knows, is that every taxpayer was told: &ldquo;Pay every penny you owe and we will excuse you the penalties and the other compliance measure, which is interest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had his chance to speak.  People could stand up and say about that amnesty, as it was called, that every taxpayer who availed of it paid up to date every halfpenny in tax that he or she owed.  That was the <Col N="1389" /> principle of that amnesty and it was a principle based on fairness, justice and equity.  It was based on the fact that no person was excused their legal responsibility, a principle whereby the pound paid by the poor working man who has enough pressure on his family budget by way of tax every week was no better or no worse than the pound paid by the people who availed of that amnesty.  It was an amnesty available to everybody, put in place on the basis of a principle of fairness, an amnesty which shamed nobody and which brought no political, media or public condemnation.  It was essentially different from the theft being sanctioned by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, should have at least the honour to stand up for the integrity of the tax system and the Revenue Commissioners, to abide by the advice given to him by his best advisers.  He should have the honour and integrity to say that he will not be the Minister responsible for the destruction of faith that is implicit in this proposed amnesty, the destruction of faith in our institutions, politicians and our system.  If he had any honour and decency, Deputy Ahern would say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Go ahead with this amnesty, but go ahead without me&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach's bluff can be called if a sufficient number of members of the Cabinet have the moral courage to stand up and say it is unfair and wrong.  Everybody in the country knows it is wrong to say to a working class woman in Ballyfermot earning less than the average industrial wage: &ldquo;Give us 48 per cent of your extra earnings in income tax and 7.5 or 8 per cent in levies of various kinds &mdash; more than half of every extra penny you earn&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister is saying to that person, but what is he saying to the fat cat friends of the Taoiseach who are going to repatriate hundreds of millions of pounds under this system?  He is saying &ldquo;give me 15 per cent of the total&rdquo;. How abject a proposal that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15 per cent flat rate tax is shameful because it means that the longer the money is out and the more tax evaded, the better off one is.  If one had the money <Col N="1390" /> out for 15 years one would pay 1 per cent per annum on this illegal fund held abroad.  If one had it out for two years one would pay 7.5 per cent on the capital fund.  The more one has cheated, the more one has abandoned the economy which the Taoiseach now claims one is supposed to help by bringing back this money, the more damage one has done, the more one has shirked his social responsibility, the more the Minister, Deputy Ahern, will give by way of reward.  That is what the 15 per cent flat rate means.  Nobody in the western world would consider it anything but shameful. Can the Government side show me any civilised country which has said to the people who cheat, &ldquo;Give us 1 per cent per annum of your money and we will be happy&rdquo;, but which says to the ordinary working class girl in Ballyfermot &ldquo;Give me 48 per cent or 55 per cent of your extra earnings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can Fianna Fáil, which is supposed to be a party representing the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; in Irish society and which trumpeted its left of centre origins recently while courting the Labour Party in order to form this iniquitous Government, stand up for that?  How can the Labour Party which is supposed to be the party of workers become the party of evaders, cheaters and multi-millionaires who want to launder their cash in this country?</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister sitting silently or saying that this is not his decision.  This is a decision which has been pushed through the Cabinet at the behest of the Taoiseach.  Phrases have been used in this House which do justice to the kind of morality which this represents. This suggestion is bankrupt in moral terms.  It stinks.  It damages people's faith in institutions and it tramples their sense of hope.  Does anybody on that side of the House know what it is like when one cannot afford to feed one's kids and send them to school, or to pay a mortgage, to hand up more than half of every extra pound earned?  Does anybody really understand what it is like for someome who is doing that week in and week out to see people who have <Col N="1391" /> brought their money to Jersey, to the Cayman Islands or to the Isle of Man or who have secreted it in building societies here being told that they can pay 1 per cent each year on the capital sum and that no further questions will be asked. It is a shameful proposal and it is about time that the people responsible stood up and justified it in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox in his contribution said that the Taoiseach had in some way dignified the very people who are about to repatriate these moneys as latter day heros who are coming to our economic rescue in times of difficulty.  They are no such thing.  They are quislings, people who opted out and decided to take no part in the fight to get Ireland's economy back on its feet.  These are the people who took the money out when Deputy Ahern's party in 1987 was making hard decisions to try to get the economy back on its feet.  These people betrayed the Government and now the Government is rewarding them.  The worse the betrayal, the greater the reward.  It is a shameful act which should not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The wording in Deputy Cox's amendment brings to mind the fact that this is also wrong in terms of justice.  It is a measure which in the last analysis will have to be looked at by the courts.  Any proposal from the State which discriminates between individuals or classes of individuals in any way must be justified by reference to what is either a difference in social function or a difference in moral capacity.  That is what the Constitution says.  The State, when it brings in a law cannot say that all those with red hair should pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent and all those with black hair must pay at the rate of 20 per cent.  Every differentiation must be rationally based. What is the rationale for the differentation in relation to people who will be offered a 15 per cent flat rate if this amnesty is passed?  The only difference is that they cheated.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and I know of many taxpayers who had to borrow to pay capital acquisitions tax, people who made mistakes doing that and whose livelihoods <Col N="1392" /> were destroyed because they over borrowed to pay tax.  People who have complied with their tax obligations have been ruined by having done so.  I know many families who have gone without for years while their better off neighbours apparently had access to offshore funds or building society accounts and had no moral qualms.  Those families scrimped and saved to pay the taxes and the Minister is now delivering them an insult and a slap in the face of unprecedented proportions.</P>
    <P>The point about the differentiation proposed in this revenue amnesty is that it amounts to something which the Constitution does not permit.  The Constitution does not permit the State to make one person pay 40 per cent tax or 45 per cent tax and another person pay 1 per cent per annum during the period when that person kept money abroad. Because the Constitution does not permit that, the Minister will find that more and more people will queue up to impugn any such amnesty before the courts of this land.  They will queue with relish in order to bring the Government to heel and force it to comply with the Constitution. Because of that, I predict that this amnesty will be an abject failure.  Nobody will bring money back when there is a case before the courts, the gist of which is a claim that the amnesty is unconstitutional. Nobody will bring money back in the shadow of legal question mark over the measure the Minister has been forced to introduce by the Taoiseach against his own wishes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen had the effrontery to suggest that I was engaged in sabotage in pointing out the obvious.  Nobody in their right minds would repatriate money to avail of this amnesty because it offends against every person's sense of decency and against the Constitution.  The small handful of naive people who will repatriate their funds, who think that this represents justice and who think that they are safe, will find that they have been duped into bringing back money into this country in circumstances where an apparent amnesty turned out to be a puff of <Col N="1393" /> smoke because it infringed the basic concept of justice and the Constitution.  It is not sabotage to point out the obvious about such a measure, that the State has no right to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant people so as to punish the law abiding citizen and subsidise the cheats, the frauds and the robbers who put their money aside in circumstances where they knew they were committing crimes against our system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked in this House the other day a very opportune question as to how many crimes one had to commit to avail of this amnesty.  He asked whether one was enough or whether there must be two.  His question was prescient because it slowly emerged that the Taoiseach also has in mind that money left under false names in building society accounts, in foreign accounts, external accounts or the like will also be covered by the amnesty.  That is what the Taoiseach has in mind.  Somebody used the phrase that this is cute hoorism at its worst.  It represents a low point in social morality and a shameful departure from any sense of fairness.  People who are being hounded by Revenue sheriffs to comply with penal tax rates know that the Taoiseach's rich friends will be able to avail of a money laundering operation of unprecedented dimensions and get away with a 1 per cent levy on their hot money.  How can they justify that before the bar of public opinion?  They cannot. Every working man and woman who has spent the past few weeks wondering whether this could truly be Government policy must know that this Government is not on their side in this mindless pursuit of the quick fix.  This Government is determined to do anything it can to get its hands on any money.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in his bad-tempered interview with the media at Dublin Airport last evening that there could be no losers in this operation.  Will the Minister for Finance tell him that we are all the losers because of the damage to our tax system and our taxpayers will become more resentful.  What is happening in <Col N="1394" /> every corner of this land every day of the week will intensify.  There is virtually nowhere that employers are not being asked by employees for under-the-counter payments, £10 for expenses or whatever. There is virtually no building contractor who is not propositioned in that way by his employees.  There is virtually no shopkeeper who finds it easy to pay the full whack of tax to keep his shop open on Saturday mornings and at nighttime. There is virtually no publican who can get lounge staff to work on a fully taxed basis at night.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who will realise there is no such thing as an underlying basis of morality in our tax system.  The reaction of very many people, selfemployed, employees, employers will be: &ldquo;If the rich can get away with it, why should not I?&rdquo;  The answer they will give is: &ldquo;I am a sucker, whereas they have politically influential friends&rdquo;.  That is the only difference.  A proposal emanating from Deputy Davern, which appears to have been adopted by the Taoiseach &mdash; pushed through cowardly by a totally abject Cabinet, none of whom apparently would stand up for principles in this matter &mdash; deserves to be rejected.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House that Article 40.1 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>The second clause of the Article says that the only permissible exceptions to that proposition are differentiations based on social function.  There is no social function difference between a tax evader and a tax complier, or differentiation on the basis of moral capacity, but there is a huge differentiation in terms of moral capacity between those who scrimped and saved to pay the sheriff and those fat cats who kept their money abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister had better take on board the fact there will be litigation about this. It will be challenged in the courts.  As the <Col N="1395" /> implications of what is proposed sink into the minds of ordinary people, and the better they are explained to the courts system when the time comes, the more obvious it will become that what the Taoiseach, Deputy Davern and a few other people who are practising this cult of cute hoor politics are actually doing offends against everybody's basic sense of decency and, above all, offends the Constitution itself.  Once it becomes clear to the people on whom the Taoiseach is relying to repatriate their ill-gotten gains from abroad that they will not get away with it, that they will be challenged and harried, as they deserve to be, and that the tax inspector will keep an eye on them in the future, this amnesty will turn out to be a total failure.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Finance to stand up, as he should do, for his Department, for the Revenue Commissioners, for the integrity of the tax system, indeed for what people in his constituency would believe is basically fair.  If he and his colleagues in Government had the elementary courage to do it, they should tell the Taoiseach to go ahead but without them.  If the Minister had the courage to stand up to the Taoiseach, as some in his party, including Deputy Power, stood up to a former Leader of their party, this proposal would cease to be a runner.</P>
    <P>With the exception of one member of the Labour Party, I have not seen here since this debate began any of the people who have been prating on about ethics in Government.  I do not see the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who has been talking at great length about a new set of standards in public life.  She can tear up her Bill if she votes against this amendment this evening.  Every member of the Labour Party who talks in public about improving standards in public life can tear up the programme for a partnership Government and stop talking about a different approach to standards in Irish public life, if none of them will stand up to vindicate basic standards of decency. Where are they now?  They are skulking <Col N="1396" /> in their rooms.  Why are they not here listening to a debate on a matter to do with standards which really affect working class people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to put on the record my position and that of my party on this matter.  Since last Wednesday morning when the Government announcement was made, I have been the focus of almost as much attention as the amnesty.  This is a political tactic on the part of the Government <Col N="1397" /> to try to divert attention from the content of the amnesty to my decisions and amendments.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, I wish to set out the reasons my party, on mature reflection, having considered the matter fully, will be opposing the amnesty and supporting amendment No. 1.  From the outset, I saw some merit in the argument that we should try to attract foreign capital home. I accept that it is of no benefit to the economy.  However, when the other arguments were put to me, I found them overpowering.</P>
      <P>The two principle reasons we have decided to oppose the amnesty are, first, in all previous amnesties relief was provided in respect of interest and penalties, not in respect of the capital, and, second, we do not believe it is possible, having considered the matter in some detail, to draw the line at foreign funds; in other words, one could not restrict it to foreign money held abroad only; one would have to include non-resident accounts in Ireland because this represents foreign money held in Ireland. Given the ease with which someone can open a non-resident account in Ireland this would effectively mean that people with money in a biscuit tin, or under the mattress, would be able to avail of the amnesty.  Those are the two considered reasons we will be opposing the amnesty. I have altered my initial view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the 1988 amnesty.  I have in front of me a copy of section 72 of the 1988 Finance Act which sets out in detail the conditions attached to that amnesty.  It provided that in the period 27 January 1988 to 30 September 1988 people could pay all amounts of tax due before or during that period in accordance with all previous tax Acts; that notwithstanding this, they would not have to pay relevant interest owed by them which was unpaid on the expiration of the period referred to and that proceedings would not be initiated or continued for the recovery of any fine or penalty.  That amnesty was very sucessful. I do not know what comments were <Col N="1398" /> made by each Fine Gael speaker at that time or what may have been said by any Fine Gael speaker in past years, but since last Thursday our considered position is that we are opposed to this amnesty.</P>
    <P>I have been taken aback, as I am sure the Government has been, by the tidal wave of emotional reaction against the amnesty by compliant taxpayers.  It would be prudent and sensible for the Government to take this into account. This is a matter of political judgement but perhaps it was unforeseen.  It has evoked a debate, not on best law and practice or what is in the best interests of the Exchequer, but about morality and compliance. That is the context in which this debate is taking place.</P>
    <P>I do not see myself as being excessively moralistic.  I do not care for such politics; I would rather deal with an issue on its merits or demerits, which are clear in this instance.  First, if one tries to restrict the amnesty to foreign money it could lead to capital outflows to avail of it.  The only thing I would say about my amendment is that under current tax law the Revenue Commissioners do not have ready access to bank accounts.  The position is they have to go to the High Court but only if they have sufficient evidence to show that there is something there.  If the Government persists it must consider the possibility of changing the law to provide access to bank accounts.  It is unjust in relation to our tax compliance system that there is scrutiny in terms of an audit, but no access to bank accounts.  I should say also that the system would be severely undermined in relation to corporation tax, VAT, PAYE and PRSI payable by the corporate sector or a sole trader.  The Government will have to try to preclude this.</P>
    <P>I am not against amnesties <i>per se.</i>  Let me give one example.  Very shortly the tax and social welfare codes will have to be integrated with the result that it will be impossible to work and sign on at the same time.  It is important when it is no longer possible for a person in Tallaght or Jobstown, to whom Deputy Rabbitte often referred on Committee Stage, to clip hedges every day of the week and <Col N="1399" /> sign on for the dole at the same time that they take up employment rather than say to themselves that they cannot admit that they are working and signing on and that therefore they should remain on social welfare.  An amnesty in that instance would be appropriate.  Amnesties <i>per se</i> have to be considered on their merits. However, the more amnesties one has the more people will be able to budget in the expectation that there will be an amnesty with the result that the system will be undermined because people will say that every six to seven years amounts will be written off and they should hold out.  To be fair to the Minister for Finance he finds himself in a difficult position on this issue.  It is no secret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being argued that an amnesty will lead to a reduction in interest rates and to money being brought back, but this is greatly exaggerated. When one takes into account the amount of money that is in circulation under the auspices of the Central Bank, no matter how much money will be brought in it will not have any meaningful impact.  Because of the exchange controls in operation at present those who bring money in are perfectly entitled to take it out again.</P>
      <P>I wish to summarise what my party's position is on this amnesty in the clearest possible terms.  We are not opposed to all amnesties but we believe that a line should be drawn in the sand; in other words amnesties should be granted only in limited circumstances to provide relief in respect of interest payments and penalties, not in respect of the principle. Second, it would not be possible, administratively, to draw up an amnesty to provide for foreign capital only.  Any capital anywhere in Europe would be made available.  For those reasons we will be opposing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I resent Deputy McDowell's comment that the Labour Party is now the party of evaders and cheats.  That is an insult to my party.  His final words at the end of a long speech, in which he pontificated and gave his own moral judgment, were that his recommendation to those with money outside the country would be not to bring it back because something extraordinary would happen.  On the one hand, he is condemning the amnesty and on the other giving a legalistic judgment on what these people should do.</P>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the amendment in the name of Deputy Cox and I would apply it in the case of every taxpayer whom the Department of Finance is aware of, both inside and outside the country.  It is insulting to suggest that in some way Department of Finance officials condone this activity and might have access to information.  It is my experience that they use information in the appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>After the last tax amnesty, the system of self-assessment was introduced and there were very strict penalties imposed for non-compliance.  We know that people do their best to pay their tax liabilities but because of staff availability the Revenue Commissioners can conduct audits in only 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent of cases.  It has been discovered that people who made legitimate profits were advised by Irish banks, tax consultants and financial houses to use various procedures both inside and outside the jurisdiction in order to escape paying further tax. Some professionals can enjoy a very high standard of living by advising clients to move surplus funds out of the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous Government discovered that on average, approximately ten bank accounts were held per adult head of the population.  People knew that if they earned more than £100 interest from any deposit account they were taxed on the remainder.  This led people to open bank accounts everywhere, throughout the country, and outside the jurisdiction in the North and in Britain.  Let us not talk about attracting the funds of the drug <Col N="1401" /> barons or the Provisional IRA, because no doubt they are involved in everything where a fast buck is to be made.  There are people who made legitimate profits in the country and moved the money outside the jurisdiction because they were advised to do so.  We do not have access to that money, indeed, we do not even know it is there.  If anyone knows of such accounts abroad, he has a duty to inform the Revenue Commissioners because the procedure is there under the self-assessment system and persons who do not comply with the tax law can be dealt with.  We have all had experience of negotiating with the Revenue Commissioners for people who discover there is a penalty for non-compliance and they want to get back into the tax net.</P>
    <P>The case is put vehemently that people who took advantage of the last amnesty to come into the tax net have been penalised ever since.  What has been happening is that they are being asked to pay the same amount of tax as everybody else.  I am in sympathy with the case Deputy Rabbitte so eloquently made on Committee Stage for the PAYE sector.  The PAYE sector have no facility to escape any tax, indeed, their tax is paid before they are paid and most are put to the pin of their collar to survive.  It is unlikely, therefore, that they have money deposited outside the jurisdiction.  Under existing legislation, the Revenue Commissioners have power to confiscate money that is held illegally so Members with information of this should inform the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party members are entitled to have views on the amnesty.  It was discussed at length at the parliamentary Party meeting and a great many Members expressed reservations about the idea that people could expect to escape from their normal tax liabilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are now suggesting that people should repatriate their money and invest it in special DIRT accounts.  The Minister has confirmed that by reducing the rate of tax from 26 per cent to 10 per cent we have already attracted a great deal of money into the economy.

Eventually we will have to abolish it because we must keep in line with European Community law.  I do not like people from the Progressive Democrats preaching to the Labour Party &mdash; from their chairperson downwards &mdash; or to Cabinet Ministers and presuming our views on any subject.  The views we express will satisfy the members of the Parliamentary Party in consultation with their Cabinet members.

      <P>I will be brief because I want to give the Minister an opportunity to reply to what is probably the most important amendment we have had during this debate on the Finance Bill. Its purpose is to preserve the integrity of the tax system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is at risk here is the integrity of the tax system itself.  On the Order of Business today somebody referred to the fact that the figures due to be published from the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1408" /> within the next few days will show that 88 per cent of the burden of paying tax in the State is borne by the PAYE sector.  It was 89 per cent in 1979 when 750,000 people throughout the length and breadth of the country, from cities and towns, came out on to the streets of this country protesting about the unfairness of the tax burden being carried by them.  Almost 15 years later the situation has not changed.  The perceived inequity of the tax code as it stands is real and the Minister is promising to bring forward legislation which will reward the carpetbaggers and the tax evaders and punish those who have borne the task of paying the cost of State services during the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently those who have betrayed the country will be welcomed back and those who pay for running the country will be further penalised in the form of the 1 per cent levy.  What an extraordinary Government this is, that in the same year would introduce an additional 1 per cent inequitious levy on those who are already paying their taxes and a couple of weeks later announce an amnesty for those who have evaded their taxes and their due responsibility to the State.  It is not, as Deputy De Rossa said, a victimless crime and it is not just the people whom Deputy McDowell spoke about who struggle on a weekly or monthly basis to pay their taxes but all those people in our society who during the past 20 years or so did not get access to a fair education system, because we were not able to pay for it, because those who controlled enormous wealth took it out of the country, salted it away for that period and now propose to bring it back for a minimal penalty.  Nothing transmits privilege in this society like education.  A great many of our citizens have been deprived of that education as a result of our inability to provide it.  Yet what do we do?  We drive them out as exiles.  They may be better educated than those in the fifties, but not that well educated in a great many cases.  These are the exiles who are abroad.  Successive Foreign Ministers grovel for additional visas for them, but the tax exiles who denied this <Col N="1409" /> State its fair share of tax will be given the red carpet and welcomed back by the State provided they pay 15 per cent off the top. It is an outrage.  I cannot believe that the same Minister who in the 1992 Finance Act &mdash; and I was one of the few Opposition spokespersons at the time who supported him &mdash; shut down some of the bolt holes for those carpetbaggers would open the sluice gates to these people to bring their ill gotten gains back into this economy.  It is time we heard from this Minister on what precisely his position is. I believe that this is Albert's amnesty, as I said during the Adjournment debate last week.  It really was the final insult to this House not that the Minister for Finance did not take that Adjournment debate &mdash; that is not what constituted the insult; he may have had good reason for not being here &mdash; but that the Minister for Social Welfare came into this House and presented the case for the Government on the tax amnesty, the same man who has inherited a Department which imposed cuts on the most vulnerable, downtrodden and weak, the people at the bottom of the pile.  It was not until he was confronted on a televison programme last night that the Minister announced, for the third time, that he has issued circulars withdrawing some of those cuts.  When Deputy De Rossa contacted his Department at 5.05 p.m. yesterday evening no such circulars had been issued, but by the time he got on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, which is recorded at 7 p.m., the circulars had already gone out.  The spectacle of the Minister for Social Welfare coming in here defending this amnesty was insulting to the people.</P>
    <P>I want to make a comment on the socalled economic arguments for this amnesty.  Is the Government totally insensitive to the fact that the spectrum of political opinion, of people commentating on politics and economics for a livelihood, have opposed and exposed the fallacy and shallowness of any economic arguments?  There is an argument, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for a onceoff 15 per cent slice off the top for the Revenue, but there is no good economic argument because the fact is that the <Col N="1410" /> people who salted away their money in tax havens are not the kind of business people or entrepreneurs that would have put their money into productive investment projects in this country in the first place.  If they were, the money would not be abroad.  There are any number of vehicles for them to bring their money back in here and invest it appropriately in job creating projects if they were so minded or if that was their disposition, but it is not.  They are far more likely to bring their money back and purchase a block of Mespil Road apartments or whatever kind of property came on the market and drive up the price of property in so doing.  There is no risk to themselves and this economy is no better off.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, and the Minister for Finance knows it, that the one thing this economy is not short of at the moment is big money.  What we are short of is suitable investment projects to absorb that money.  Whatever argument might have existed when this economy was on the floor at the beginning of this year, when interest rates for mortgage holders were going through the roof and when people could not buy money in the bank to keep their commercial business going, whatever argument there was then for a fiscal boost, it does not exist now, with interest rates going in the opposite direction in the wake of devaluation and an absence of good investment projects for the kind of money envisaged here.  There are no economic arguments for this and we really should get away from this simplistic idea that spokespersons and proponents for the amnesty have been getting away with on television, which is that it is terrible that all this money is abroad and are we not better getting it back here, that it can only do the country good.  That kind of &ldquo;Mother macree&rdquo; economics is neither here nor there and it is about time that somebody exposed it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has dealt at some length with the exposition by the Minister for Social Welfare on the night of the Adjournment debate, and again last night on television, when he argued that we got £520 million from the amnesty in 1988.  There is no comparison between <Col N="1411" /> the amnesty in 1988 and the one proposed now.  The tax cheats in 1988 paid their due taxes and were let off their penalties. They paid their due taxes and that is why we got £520 million.  We would not have got £520 million if we had been applying 15 per cent off the top.  What is the point in going on with this pretence that this amnesty is the same as the one on the last occasion?  The Minister for Finance should tell us as well who is lobbying for this tax amnesty.</P>

There may not be many votes in this tax amnesty but I suspect that there is a good deal of political contributions for whoever brings it in.  We need to know from where the lobbying is coming.  It is clearly not coming from Deputy Ferris's constituency, to judge from the speech he has just made, and I am quite sure he is speaking for his party.  It is not coming from Minister Ahern's constituency.  I think we should know.  What we are really seeing here is the business man as politician.  We have seen this side of the present Taoiseach in other areas of his political conduct in Cabinet.  This is the difference between the business man as business man and the business man as politician.  I think that the present Taoiseach thinks he can run the country like he ran his private company.  One cannot be doing deals and cutting corners and be insensitive to the fact that one is governing a country.  One cannot be insensitive to the burden borne by the majority of tax complaint citizens and completely ignore them and spit in their eye in the manner proposed by opening the sluice gates for every carpetbagger who betrayed this country, took his money out of it over the last 20 years, or at least since exchange controls were imposed, <Col N="1412" /> and who now wants to bring it back because it suits him to pass it on with the minimum tax liability to his off-spring in this country.  It is a disgrace, and I believe the Minister knows it is a disgrace, and now that exchange controls have been lifted it can flow back out just as quickly.</P>

We cannot run the country on the basis of saying that we will give Mullaghmore in return for a tax amnesty, and that seems to be the way decisions are being made at the moment &mdash;&ldquo;make Michael D. happy and we will make the Taoiseach happy&rdquo;.

What is at risk is the very efficacy of the tax system and I do not see how the Government can expect tax compliant citizens to continue paying their full share of taxes and find themselves treated in this manner.  It grieves me to hear, as I heard on the radio when I was driving here this evening, the chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Jim Kemmy, a politician for whom I have a lot of regard, going out to bat for this appalling amnesty.  These are not productive business people.  These are the very type of fat cat manipulators of finance <Col N="1413" /> in this economy that Deputy Kemmy used to revile.  It is sad to see him reduced to saying that we are glad to receive whatever crumbs fall off the table because we need the money.  It is as somebody said last night on that television programme when he adverted to James Connolly's remark about the swine getting the biggest swill.  Never in the history of the recent politics of this country have we seen such a blatant example of those with the largest snouts at the trough getting most out of it.  It is a disgrace that any Government should propose such a measure and expect tax complying citizens to continue to pay the cost of running the services of this State. During an Adjournment debate I referred to a matter which is a good example of this, the shenanigans which surrounded the purchase of the Ballsbridge site in the Telecom affair.</P>

However, the inspector concerned, Mr. John Glackin, has now been obstructed in concluding his work precisely because of what will be provided for if this amnesty measure is implemented &mdash; in other words, an account in a false name in a foreign bank to which an inspector cannot get access or information about to complete his inquiry and the sole purpose of which is to defraud this State of due taxes and liabilities.  It is that type of tax carpetbagger this Government hopes to legitimise and expects the rest of the taxpaying community to applaud.  This amnesty measure is a scandal and I hope <Col N="1414" /> the Minister for Finance will tell us he will not impose it on the taxpayers of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to facilitate my colleagues in making a contribution on this important subject.  I do not wish to make a long statement on the matter.  I merely want to tell the Minister what the people of my constituency and others feel about the implementation of this measure.  They believe it is unfair to 90 per cent of the public who are honest, decent people meeting their tax obligations to the letter of the law.  There is a growing unease that the laws of this land are being applied unequally, that there is one law for those in the know and that the ordinary citizen must bear the full rigours of the law.  Some people can get away with drink driving charges, and kick down doors in well known establishments in the city and get away with it, but if an ordinary poor person takes a pound of butter from a supermarket in desperation he or she will be sent to jail. That has serious consequences for the running of this country and people will rebel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the amendment.  The Minister is well aware that most small business people are diligent in the manner in which they pay their taxes. They dread the famous window envelope coming in the post and merely want to pay their bills and rear their families. Therefore, it is unacceptable that those they elected and trusted with their votes <Col N="1415" /> to take care of their interests are prepared to turn their backs on them and welcome home people with vast fortunes of money that could not have been accumulated in the first place if such people had paid their proper taxes.</P>
    <P>I consider myself to be as astute as anybody, but to my knowledge if people pay their way they will not accumulate a fortune.  A figure of £2 billion is being talked about in regard to the proposed amnesty.  It is unbelieveable that that amount was creamed off ordinary business people in this country.  It would be unfair of me to mention certain business areas, but the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance seem to know that vast amounts of money that were not used for productive purposes are stored away in foreign bank accounts. It is unacceptable that the Government should now tell those people they can bring that money home and it will be taxed at only 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is welcoming this measure as if they were welcoming the Prodigal Son.  I will not give a lecture on the Bible or moral issues, but to my knowledge the Prodigal Son squandered all his father gave him.  These people have accumulated vast amounts of money by sucking it out of the system.  I will not disparage all Members of the Fianna Fáil Party because some of them are honest decent people and the Minister is one of them.  I know the Minister believes in his heart that this is a wrong move and I appeal to him on behalf of the ordinary citizens of this country to reconsider the matter.  If the Minister wants people to continue to pay their taxes he should forget about this amnesty and the public will respond.  Jobs are scarce and morale in low, but the people are merely looking for a little lift to show that their efforts are acknowledged by the Government. This injust measure will do the opposite. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position on this matter and the public will appreciate him for it.  Excellent contributions have been made on this matter, but I am disappointed with the contribution from Deputy Ferris, who has <Col N="1416" /> supported the ordinary people for many years.  It is appalling that anybody in this House should condone the accumulation of money through the sale of drugs, abuse of our young people and robberies of banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister is now telling those people that all is forgiven and that they can bring their money home.  What about the unfortunate people who have gone through the turmoil of seeing their young children become addicted to drugs because of such ruthless people?  It is unacceptable that those who perpetrated such crimes on families and young people or who held up bank managers and their staff resulting in some people having nervous breakdowns should now be made welcome here.  The implementation of this measure will leave the country wide open to household burglaries, bank robberies and so on.  A Fine Gael or Progressive Democrat Government would certainly not introduce such a measure and a change of Government would be welcome for this reason alone. I am totally opposed to the proposed amnesty.</P>

      <P>In the couple of minutes at my disposal I would like to say something about the proposed amnesty or what might be more accurately called a write-off of tax which is outrageous and unacceptable.  It makes a mockery of compliant taxpayers.  It also makes a mockery of social welfare recipients who should be considered in regard to this matter.  Most days of the week people get money on the dole which they should not get because they are working.  If such people are caught they are prosecuted in the criminal courts and sometimes sent to prison for two or three months.  We should compare the few hundred pounds at issue in such cases with the millions of pounds at issue under the subject we are discussing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> It strikes me as unlikely that a proposal that has the strange genesis this one has could have worked because the two principal progenitors I heard advocating it in recent weeks were Deputies Davern and Kemmy.  I do not know whether the breeding is by Deputy Davern out of Deputy Kemmy or by Deputy Kemmy out of Deputy Davern.  Whichever way it came it is not surprising that it is a piece of economic and social policy that does not work and, in horse-breeding terms, between them in their efforts they have produced a three-legged jennet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The law that has developed in relation to occupiers' liability includes premises, buildings and so forth.  The scheme of this Bill is to confine the matter to land, except in relation to other structures that are on the land such as posts and fencing as well as buildings that would be purely subsidiary and ancillary to the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with both trespassers and those who are allowed on to the land with the occupier's permission, but with no material benefit for the occupier, such as, members of gun clubs, hunters, anglers, bird watchers and so on.  Under the <Col N="1418" /> Bill the occupier of land will have no responsibility for trespassers, but he would not be entitled to intentionally harm a trespasser except in necessary self-defence, defence of another, or in defence of his property.  He must not set traps for a potential trespasser.</P>
    <P>For those who are on the land with the permission of the occupier, that occupier shall not be under any obligation to the individual except that he shall be obliged to give warning of the existence of any concealed dangers which exists on the land and which are actually known to the occupier.</P>
    <P>There has been a strong campaign for reform in recent years by many national organisations.  David Butler, chairman of the IFA's national industry and environment committee in a statement recently stated:</P>
    <P>In all cases the financial viability of Irish farms is becoming such a distressing issue that it is imperative that further impositions and perceived threats to Irish farmers be alleviated by immediate reform of the law on occupiers liability.</P>
    <P>Donal Murphy, General Secretary of the ICMSA also in a recent statement said:</P>
    <P>Our position is that we want the legislation to exempt farmers, and, indeed, all property owners, from any liability, or any duty of care to any person on land, or other property, without the owners permission.</P>
    <P>On 1 April this year, Alan Gillis, President of the IFA at a public meeting on occupiers liability at Ballyvaughan, County Clare said:</P>
    <P>The failure of successive Governments to seriously address this outdated law on occupiers liability has forced farmers and other landholders into the corner, where they have been left with no alternative, but to limit access to their lands.</P>
    <P>This trend will have major implications, not only for the tourist industry, but also for many local sporting organisations and <Col N="1419" /> individuals such as gun clubs, bird watchers, hunters, walkers, fishermen, archaeological and historical societies, and so forth.</P>
    <P>If the present law continues, most landowners will have to chosse between allowing access on to their property and running the risk of civil claims for breach of the common duty of care, or on the other hand, refusing access.  The tendency in recent times is to refuse access and this seems to be the trend right across the country.</P>
    <P>There is a growing demand both on the domestic and European market for activity-oriented holidays in natural surroundings. The report of the tourism task force, published in 1992, identified the excellent potential to position Ireland as an activity/special interest destination.  It highlighted also the growing interest in nature and ecology reflected in a greater demand for environmentally friendly holiday experiences.</P>
    <P>If access on to land is limited by landholders because of the fear of being sued the potential for Ireland as a major destination for activity type holidays could be seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section (3) of the Bill is to reverse this trend by enabling landowners to permit recreational, or educational, access on terms which will exempt them from most of the liability to the entrant.  This view is supported by the National Association of Regional Game Councils, which has a total membership of 20,800 involving 854 gun clubs.  The following is an extract from their recent submission to the Law Reform Commission on occupiers' liability:</P>
    <P>In amending legislation on occupiers' liability we suggest that a clause be inserted to allow that sportsmen who enter land to pursue their sport do so at their own risk.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Association of Adventure Sports, outlined his organisations position recently:</P>
    <P>A landowner should have no duty of care for anyone crossing his property <Col N="1420" /> for recreational purposes, provided: (a) no admission charge is made by the landowner and (b) no positive action is taken by the landowner to cause injury to the recreational user.</P>
    <P>This supports my approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The report of the Green 2000 Advisory Group presented to the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, in February 1993 made several references to the reform of the laws relating to occupiers' liability. Page 17, section 1.8 of that report states: &ldquo;Laws relating to the liability of landowners are vague and should be clarified&rdquo;. This recommendation was repeated in page 88, section 58.</P>
    <P>On page 282, section 5.11, strong recommendation was made that, &ldquo;the laws relating to occupier liability are inadequate and it is vital that these matters be addressed as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The concern about safety on land is a real one.  Land is often naturally dangerous, particularly where there is open water and, of course, modern farming methods including the use of machinery and plant which are also dangerous.  In addition for management purposes, it may be necessary, for example, for gates not to be securely anchored.  Stone walls and fences are by their nature at times insecure and can be dangerous for the individual crossing over them.</P>
    <P>Freedom of access to historical sites and national monuments is also at risk. Two of the most important historical and archaeological sites in the Burren region have been fenced-of to visitors &mdash; Leamnaneh Castle and Portnabrone Portal-Dolmen probably the best known megalithic grave in Clare.</P>
    <P>Also, Cahercommaun Stone Fort and Fiddaun Castle across the border in County Galway have been fenced-off. Indeed, throughout the Burren the signs are ominous.  Signs stating, &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo; and &ldquo;no trespassers allowed&rdquo; are now common features of the Burren district.  This is a serious development and I am convinced is a source of no comfort to the farmers involved.  The farming community has <Col N="1421" /> traditionally been welcoming and has shown great generosity towards tourists and other users of the Irish countryside for sporting and recreational purposes. Indeed, as Alan Gillis said recently: &ldquo;This attitude of help and co-operation has been an integral element in the success of the Irish tourism industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fault, does not rest with the farming community.  The failure of this House to enact legislation to protect landowners from legal action will eventually close the Irish countryside, not only to tourists, sporting and recreational organisations, but also to our growing and expanding urban population.  This will have major implications for the future of Irish society.</P>
    <P>Certain elements in the legal profession claim that the whole question of occupiers' liability has been blown out of all proportions by the farming organisations. However, I am convinced that the concerns of landowners about the potential financial and legal risks which they face are fully justified.  We are living in an environment with an ever increasing litigation mentality.  Clear evidence for this can be seen from the dramatic increase in personal injury claims being brought against the property owners in the State such as local authorities, State agencies such as the ESB and CIE, golf clubs and so forth, which have all reported a serious rise in the numbers of claims and the amount of individual claims.</P>
    <P>Premia taken out by farmers for public liability reflect the potential risks faced by the insurance companies.  The removal of some of these risks hopefully would have the effect of preventing these premia from increasing to unsustainable levels.  Indeed, many farmers do not have public liability insurance which places them in an invidious and vulnerable position. It is inequitable that a landowner should be forced to insure against the uninvited public coming onto his land.  In short, the law needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>To put the whole matter into perspective, should a landowner be liable in law for an injury or accident sustained by an individual who is on his land for the <Col N="1422" /> purposes of poaching, stealing the landowners' livestock or any other activity? The answer, clearly, is that the landowner should not be responsible for any inquiry sustained to such an individual. Unfortunately, as the law stands, the landowner is potentially liable to a trespasser whose presence is foreseeable, in circumstances where injury to that person is foreseeable and where the landowner failed to take a reasonable care to prevent that injury.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with its specific provisions, I will refer briefly to the background of the Bill.  The duty imposed on persons who occupy land derives from the common law.  The law of occupiers' liability is yet another monument to the inactivity on the part of the Legislature which should have acted in this critical area long before now, our failure to act has meant that the law in this area is to be found in a number of case decisions. These court decisions are often conflicting and though they may achieve justice between the parties, it can often be at the expense of adding confusion to an already confused area of law.</P>
    <P>Previously, the common law recognised three categories of persons who may find themselves on the lands of another, namely, invitees, licensees and trespassers. The duty imposed by law depends upon which category the persons fall into.  Invitees must be warned of unusual dangers on the land or premises of which the occupier is aware or ought to be aware.</P>
    <P>Licensees must be warned of concealed dangers of which the occupier is aware. No duty was owed by the trespasser; however, he or she could not be intentionally harmed by the occupier.  These categories are in accordance with what the average person in the street would instinctively feel was the law as it ought to be.  However, as a result of a number of decisions the clarity of the common law was thrown into confusion.</P>
    <P>The principal problem which this Bill seeks to address is the duty owed to trespassers. The common law position was clear.  However, in a number of celebrated decisions the courts have held <Col N="1423" /> that the duty of care owed to all entrants, including trespassers, is akin to the general duty in the law of negligence, that is the duty to take reasonable care.  The facts of the cases that have given rise to these decisions are in general tragic.  They involve infants wandering into electricity sub-stations or onto railway tracks and receiving severe injuries.  On a human level one could not quarrel with the decisions in these particular cases but the problem is that the principles laid down in these cases apply far beyond the particular circumstances of a seriously injured child.  The net result of all this is that arguably a trespasser is in too strong a legal position.  Such a situation offends against common sense and basic fairness. We cannot leave it to the courts to solve this problem.  A court can only deal with the facts of the particular case before it. It cannot take an overall view of the law as it ought to be and so apply it.  This is a problem which only the Legislature can solve.</P>
    <P>Another separate difficulty emerging is that there is now some doubt over the very existence of the categories to which I referred.  Some recent court decisions suggest that these categories are now redundant and that the general principles of negligence, as laid down in the Donoghue <i>v.</i> Stevenson case, apply to occupiers of land.  If this became the established law, it could impose a very high standard of duty on occupiers of land, a duty which would be reflected in higher insurance premia and an increased number of claims.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Occupiers of Land Bill, 1993, seeks to bring clarity to the confusion that has arisen.  The Bill will put into statute what was previously the common law position.  The duties owed to licensees and trespassers are clearly stated in unambiguous terms.  Invitees are not included in the Bill.  Basically, the duty owed to an invitee was a high one. The occupant had to protect the invitee from unusual danger of which the occupant was aware or ought to have been aware.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to the benefit of the <Col N="1424" /> occupiers of land in so far as it states the duties that they owe.  It is also of benefit to the licensee and the potential trespasser as they know exactly what duty is owned to them and it acts as a disincentive on the part of a trespasser to bring a speculative claim against the occupier of land.</P>
    <P>In Britain and Northern Ireland the law on occupiers' liability has been updated and defined by statute law.  The Occupiers' Liability Act, 1957, imposed a duty on an occupier to take reasonable care for the safety of lawful visitors including invitees and licensees.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) of the 1957 Act states that an occupier of premises owes the same duty, the &ldquo;common duty of care&rdquo; to all his visitors, except in so far as he is free to, and does extend, restrict, modify, or exclude his duty to any visitor or visitors by agreement or otherwise.  The 1957 Act did not deal with the question of trespassers. We must look at the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1984, to seek the standard of care owed to a trespasser.  According to section 1 (i) of the 1984 Act the question is whether &ldquo;any duty is owed by a person as occupier of premises to persons other than his visitors in respect of any risk of their suffering injury on the premises by reason of any danger due to the state of the premises, or so things done or omitted to be done on them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3) of the 1984 Act provides that an occupier owes a duty in respect of such a risk if (a) he is aware of the danger, or has reasonable grounds, to believe that it exists; (b) he knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe that the other is in the vicinity of the danger and (c) the risk is one against which, in all the circumstances of the case, he may reasonably be expected to offer the other some protection.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (5) of the Act states that any duty owned by virtue of this section in respect of risks may, in an appropriate case, be discharged by taking such steps as are reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to give warning of the danger concerned or to discourage persons from incurring the risk.  In this section of the 1984 Act it seems that a clear warning of <Col N="1425" /> the risk will usually discharge liability in the case of a trespasser.</P>
    <P>The Occupiers Liability Act, 1957, as interpreted by the courts, has been a noticeably successful measure of law reform.  It brought certainty to an area of law previously characterised by technicality and uncertainty.  The 1984 Act has not been as successful even though it does pitch the duty to the trespasser at a lower level and also limits the level of damages which the plaintiff may claim. However, in some cases the provisions in the Act are breaking down because courts have deemed the warning signs to be inadequate or placed in the wrong location and so forth, with the result that the responsibilities were passed back to the property owner.  For this reason, I decided against taking the same legislative road as that taken in the 1984 Act in England.  The provision in section 3 (2) of the Protection of Occupiers of Land Bill, 1993, relating to trespassers is certain and clear-cut.  It provides clear legal guidance for farmers and other landowners about their rights, obligations and potential liability towards entrants onto their lands.</P>
    <P>The national farming associations have received several commitments from the Minister's predecessors regarding the introduction of legislation on occupiers liability.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, gave a commitment in January 1992 to introduce legislation to reform the law during the term of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This commitment was reiterated by former Deputy Pádraig Flynn in March 1992 when he was Minister for Justice.  As the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will end this year, your time is running out to introduce legislation on this subject.</P>
    <P>The most recent commitment was given by Minister Charlie McCreevy on Wednesday, 19 May to Mr. Alan Gillis. He told the IFA leader that he favoured the association's proposal that there should be no liability for trespassers or anyone else entering the land with a farmers' permission where no commercial charge was being made.  If Minister <Col N="1426" /> McCreevy is consistent he will have no option but to support this Bill.</P>
    <P>On behalf of farmers and other landowners I appeal to the Minister to accept this simple but comprehensive legislation which is designed to take the terror out of the whole question of occupier's liability. I appeal to him to allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage where it can be amended if necessary and, in the interests of law reform and openness, to accept the Bill.  I received widespread support for the Bill from all the national farming organisations and from Deputies on all sides of this House, including those in the Government party.  I see no reason why this Bill cannot go to Committee and amended if necessary.  I do not claim it is the perfect solution but it is what most people want.  It is simple but it would be effective and would satisfy the demands of all organisations, including the main farming organisations.  I appeal to the Minister to carefully consider the Bill.</P>

      <P>First, I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, for introducing this Bill to the House.  Sadly, absolutely nothing would have been done in this area and the Government would have continued to ignore this serious issue were it not for the initiative taken by Deputy Deenihan in introducing this Bill.  I can only hope that his action will at least focus the Government's attention on the alarming consequences of the present legal position in regard to public liability and spur it on to accept this Bill graciously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of protection for landowners has been the cause of endless sleepless nights and of constant worry and unrest for many farmers who do not know when a claim will be made against them which would ultimately put them out of business. Under present legislation landowners pursue their business activities with a lethal death sentence hanging over them, a sentence which they cannot avoid, for which they have committed no offence and from which they have no legal protection.  That landowners are responsible for injuries incurred on their property to people whom they have not <Col N="1427" /> invited on to it and whom they never knew entered their property is ridiculous. The neglect and disinterest shown by successive Governments in confronting this serious issue of public liability is inexcusable and inexplicable.  The lack of urgency by the Government in addressing this grave injustice to landowners is nothing short of criminal.</P>
    <P>The basis of our judicial system is that a penalty must fit the crime.  Yet landowners are subject to the most severe penalties without having committed any crime.  It is inconceivable that a farmer could lose his entire farm as a result of a claim made against him.  Everybody here knows that the landowner's liability law is outdated and archaic.  The mystery is that many more landowners have not paid the ultimate price of being forced out of business as a result of the present system.  I must warn that the fact that this is so does not mean it will not happen in future, and immediate steps should be taken to update this law.</P>
    <P>The need for a change in the law is very urgent.  We must realise that farming methods have changed and are continually modernised, resulting in more and more machinery in every farmyard, newer and better technology methods to cope with farm effluent and faster and better ways of production.  However, great are these new methods, they all have one thing in common: they are a threat to farm safety, and the potential for serious accident is greater than ever. Surely it should be sufficient for a farmer to try to ensure the safety of his family and workers, who at least appreciate the inherent dangers in modern farming methods, rather than having to cope with the intrusion of those who have little or no understanding of the potential dangers.</P>
    <P>All farmers have become more safety conscious.  A tremendous awareness programme was initiated as a result of an excellent safety campagin by the farming organisations and Teagasc.  Nevertheless those of us involved in farming know that this message will seep through only to those involved in agriculture and will <Col N="1428" /> never be fully appreciated or realised by those outside the industry.  It is difficult for farmers adequately to impart safety awareness to trespassers.  Despite superhuman efforts on the part of landowners to pursue the utmost safety precautions, they may nevertheless become the victims of injuries incurred by uninvited persons who, due to a lack of appreciation of the dangers involved, fail to realise the pitfalls.</P>
    <P>It is crystal clear that the law needs to be updated but no-one was prepared to take the initiative until Deputy Deenihan, on behalf of Fine Gael, took the time and trouble to prepare this Bill and present it to the House.  Not only was there inaction by the Government on this matter but the Law Reform Commission delayed and procrastinated in revising the outdated landowner's liability law. That this body, like the Government, put this issue on the back burner, is clearly worthy of the most severe criticism.  I would remind the Minister that a commitment was given, as outlined by Deputy Deenihan, by the Minister for Justice in December 1991, that a discussion paper would be prepared so that legislation to reform this law could be placed on the Statute Book before the expiry of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1993.  As we are all aware, no progress was made.  Those who are appalled by the lack of urgency in this area are well justified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The lack of revision of the landowner's liability law is jeopardising job creation in tourism, sport and business interests in rural Ireland.  I take it from the Minister's remark that he is going to impart good news to us this evening.  The threat to landowners from personal injury claims could close down the Irish countryside and could result in serious damage to job creation efforts in tourism and the sport industries.  It would take only one serious accident whereby a farmer is greatly affected by a liability claim from an unwelcome visitor or trespasser to realise this scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> We must recognise the outstanding co-operation of landowners, even under these circumstances, in allowing people onto their lands.  The farming community should be able to welcome the many sporting and outdoor leisure pursuit organisations onto their land without continued exposure to a clearly unfair liability.  Frustration at the Government's failure to address this issue seriously has in many cases forced farmers to fence off important historical sites on their lands. Deputy Deenihan mentioned instances of this.  As awareness of the extent of the dangers of the lack of legal protection grows, a worsening situation will develop.  I understand that at least four sites have already been fenced off and the implication of this trend is disastrous for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that landowners do not wish to be forced into this corner of refusing entry because of the Government's inaction in introducing vital changes to an outdated law.  For generations farmers have welcomed visitors to historical sites on their lands but the continuing threat of personal injury claims is totally unacceptable to them.  This Bill is the solution to this serious problem.  It ensures that owners of land will no longer be liable for injuries to trespassers and others.  It deals very adequately with trespassers and those who are allowed onto the land with permission, but with no material benefit to the occupier, such as gun club members, hunters and anglers. The Bill is comprehensive.  It includes an obligation on the occupier to give warning of the existence of any concealed dangers on the land which are known to the occupier.  It also includes a section which states that the occupier cannot intentionally harm a trespasser except where necessary in self-defence, defence of another or in defence of his property.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deenihan said, the Bill has been welcomed by the two main farming organisations who have congratualted him for initiating this reform of the law. The Government should accept this Bill but no doubt it will be rejected on the usual spurious grounds that it is flawed. The majority of Opposition Bills seem to <Col N="1430" /> be flawed in the eyes of the Government yet we are never told where they are flawed.  The Government must accept this Bill as the answer to the problem as it is accepted by those who are affected by the law.  They are the judges.  Surely the Government is embarrassed by its inaction.  I doubt if it will further embarrass itself by rejecting this Bill.  The present law can be viewed as a liquidator or sheriff looking over a landowner's head and if something goes wrong he can strike at any time and take it all away.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, we live in a time where to sue at all costs is an acceptable standard of behaviour. We have become obsessed with suing and it generally leads to a handsome reward. This does not help.  As we speak tonight, landowners can be sued for something for which they have no responsibility and over which they have no power.  It is amazing how emergency legislation can be swiftly introduced when the Government considers it necessary but there is no such haste to update the public liability laws.  Obviously farmers and landowners can wait.  They are not part of the golden circle whose interests must be protected at all costs.</P>
    <P>Landowners want justice and justice is expressed in this Bill.  I hope that after tonight landowners can rest easy knowing that some action is being taken to protect their interests and to protect them from the results of the present law which could devastate their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the legislation and I, too, praise Deputy Deenihan for his efforts in this regard.  Deputy Deenihan is very much aware of the damage which is occurring to the tourist industry because of the lack of legislative change in this area.  This Bill will be good news to the farming community if it is accepted.  Farmers live in daily fear of the situation that could arise if a trespasser is injured and resorts to the courts.  Under the present system the claim could result in a farmer having to sell his land to pay legal costs.  That is entirely wrong.  It is amazing that this problem has not been properly addressed.  We all have a <Col N="1431" /> reasonable idea of what an acceptable solution would be yet little has been done.  It is no wonder that the public are cynical about politics and politicians when a relatively simple problem cannot be addressed.  How can we solve complex problems, with regard to unemployment and emigration when we do not solve problems which we can solve?  Varying interest groups are demanding the type of legislation introduced by Deputy Deenihan.</P>
      <P>In this era of Dáil reform, new committees and open Government, the Government should be more than willing to accept legislative initiatives from Opposition parties.  We were elected to assist in the running of the country and not simply to oppose the Government. When we bring forward constructive legislation the least we can expect is a constructive reponse from the Government. It is difficult to speak in advance of the Minister, but if the rumours we hear are correct, this Bill will be rejected. I hope the Minister will surprise us and be positive, unlike his colleague a fortnight ago on the refugee protection Bill.  I hope the Minister will not come up with a meaningless excuse in order to put this vital legislation on the back burner.</P>
      <P>Nowadays there is a claims mentality and for every fall there is a ready legal redress.  Because of that mentality, small property owners live in fear not just of the physical danger posed by trespassers but of the financial penalty which might arise.  This is a ridiculous situation.  Every visitor and every trespasser poses a possible minefield of litigation and expensive compensation, for the unfortunate landowner. The result of our ineffective legislation is that landowners live in fear of trespassers and we have a total disincentive to rural development, tourism and employment.  Who would want to set up a small project bringing visitors to farms and so on if it involved negotiating a legal minefield in the event of an accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Deenihan said, many areas of tourism interest have been fenced off and places are closing down because the <Col N="1432" /> landowners are worried about the financial penalty which might arise if a visitor is injured and litigation ensues. People are demanding Government action and are most disappointed that there has not been an adequate response to date.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has not been in office very long and we do not expect all solutions to be forthcoming overnight. Nonetheless, the least we might expect is that the Minister would respond reasonably positively to this Bill, indicating his willingness to accept its spirit.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deenihan said, no doubt amendments will be required which can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will be reasonable, positive, far-seeing and take a step in the right direction.  We all recognise that such is required, when rural areas, tourism and so on all will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equity and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for giving the House the opportunity to debate the subject of occupiers' liability. I assure the House that I will give very careful consideration to all views expressed on this important subject.  The Government is committed to reform of the law relating to the liability of occupiers for injury resulting to persons on land or other property.  The Programme for a Partnership Government makes that clear and a commitment was, of course, given in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there is consensus on the need for change in this area.  Representatives of the farming community in particular have been seeking such change.  The issue is what form the change should take so that the right balance can be struck between the interests of the occupiers of land and those of other persons who enter the land.  The law on the matter is complex, and is not without some controversy.  Based as it is on common law rules, as distinct from rules laid down in statute, it has undergone fundamental changes arising from decisions of our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> I appreciate and share some of the concerns which have prompted Deputy Deenihan to initiate this Bill.  Deputy Deenihan and other Deputies will know that the Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law of occupiers' liability.  It was precisely because of the complexity of the law, the state of its development, the range of opposing interests and the need for comparative studies to take into account the position in other countries, that the matter was referred to the Commission early last year.  The House will be aware also that the Law Reform Commission intends to issue a consultation paper in the very near future with a view to informing interested persons and groups and to invite submissions from them.  I must confess that I find it just a little surprising in the circumstances, therefore, that Deputy Deenihan should at this stage press his Bill to a full debate by the House without the benefit at least of having the commission's paper on the subject.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that the commission will shortly publish its paper.  As soon as the consultation paper is published, I will act immediately to prepare my proposals for legislation on the subject, taking into account the views expressed in the House, the commission's paper as well as the considered views of interested groups.  I shall then submit my proposals in the matter to Government as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Because the Law Reform Commission's paper is not yet available I am not in a position to indicate whether I would be prepared to support a change in the law along the precise lines suggested by Deputy Deenihan.  The Government is not therefore in a position to give its support to the Bill at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would like to be as constructive as possible in relation to Deputy Deenihan's Bill, so I would put it to him that next week he might consider proposing an adjournment of the debate on the Bill so that I can have an opportunity to study the Law Reform Commission's paper, when it is published.  If, after that examination, the Government decides that a <Col N="1434" /> proposal along the lines of his Bill is appropriate, we can then come back to the Bill.  If, on the othe hand, the Government's view is that the issue requires a different or a more detailed basis than this short Bill, the House has my assurance that I will bring forward the necessary proposals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Deenihan insists on pressing his Bill to a vote the Government will oppose it for the reasons I have outlined. As I have indicated, I nonetheless welcome the opportunity to have this debate. In developing my own proposals on the subject.  I will give most careful consideration to the views of speakers on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Might I proceed by outlining to the House, if only briefly, the existing law on this issue.  In doing so I hope to demonstrate the particular context within which change is being sought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from contractual entrants, where the general rule is that the rights of such persons are to be regulated by reference to contract, persons who enter onto property have traditionally been classified into three categories &mdash; invitees, licensees and trespassers.  The law on occupiers' liability is concerned with the duty of care that is owed by occupiers to those categories of persons.</P>
    <P>In general terms, a person is an invitee where his presence on the property is likely to convey a material benefit upon the occupier, for example, a person who visits a cinema.  Here, the duty of the occupier is to use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual dangers of which he knows, or ought to know.</P>
    <P>By contrast, a licensee is a person who is permitted to be on another's land but whose visit does not materially benefit the occupier, for example, a person who makes use of a public park or playground. The occupier's duty in this case is essentially to warn of concealed dangers of which he is aware.</P>
    <P>A trespasser, on the other hand, is a person who goes onto property without an invitation of any sort and the duty of care of the occupier was for some time limited to not injuring the trespasser by intentional or reckless conduct.  A problem <Col N="1435" /> with this particular rule is that it automatically assumed that a trespasser was a person of lawless intent.  It did not make allowance for the fact that in many instances trespassing might be quite an innocent activity, wholly devoid of malice.  In this context, the position of children who stray on to the land, attracted perhaps by some natural feature such as a tree or water, is of especial relevance.</P>
    <P>These rules of the common law have determined the status of entrants to property and, in turn, have marked the limit of the occupier's duty towards them.  The rules, because of their apparently strait jacketed approach, were liable to cause injustice in particular circumstances.  Perhaps it was not surprising that it was in a case involving injury to a child that our courts have in recent years altered those rules.  I refer to the judgment in 1974 of the Supreme Court in McNamara <i>v.</i> Electricity Supply Board.  In that case the Supreme Court gave careful consideration to the legal basis of any duty which a defendant might owe in cases generally of trespass.  Following that judgment the occupier is now regarded as owing a duty to trespassers whom he could reasonably foresee and the duty is to take such reasonable care as the circumstances demand.  The effect of the judgment has been to elevate the duty of care owed to trespassers &mdash; adults as well as children &mdash; to a much higher level than was previously the case.</P>
    <P>In arriving at their decision, the Supreme Court referred approvingly to an earlier Irish case from the late sixties &mdash;<i>Purtill versus Athlone Urban District Council.</i>  A passage from the judgment of the court in that case, delivered by Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, helps to inform us of the key considerations which led to the decision to the McNamara case.  That passage reads as follows:</P>
    <P>When the danger is reasonably foreseeable, the duty to take care to avoid injury to those who are proximate, when their proximity is known, is not abrogated because the other party is a trespasser.  The duty to those in proximity <Col N="1436" /> is not based on any implied term of an invitation or a licence, or upon any warranty for safety which might be thought to be inherent in any such invitation or licence.  Rather is it based upon the duty that one man has to those in proximity to him to take reasonable care that they are not injured by his acts.  What amounts to sufficient care must very necessarily with the circumstances, the nature of the danger, and the age and knowledge of the person likely to be injured.</P>
    <P>In the McNamara case, the court did not explore the issue as to whether a similar duty applied in relation to other categories of entrant such as invitees and licensees and subsequent cases have not brought about a clear resolution of this matter.  The traditional three-tier category of invitee, licensee and trespasser has not been displaced as the criterion on which the level of care or the standard of safety is based.</P>
    <P>We therefore have a situation where the law has evolved as a result of various court decisions in the last few decades. The bulk of those decisions have dealt with the position of trespasser and, for the present at least, may suggest that trespassers could be entitled to a higher duty of care than other more lawful entrants onto land.  Inevitably, this uncertainty has caused landowners, farmers in particular, to fear that they may become the focus for a substantial damages claim not only in relation to trespassers but also in relation to other categories of entrants.</P>
    <P>However, farmers' worries may have been lessened to some extent by a decision of the High Court in 1991.  The case involved two members of a gun club. One was covered by an indemnity scheme and had express permission to shoot over the farmer's land.  The other was not so covered and had no such permission.  The uninsured party injured the other who then sued his own gun club, the person who caused the injury and also the farmer.  The case against the farmer was on the basis that he should have ensured that person's shooting on his land were insured.  Giving his decision on a motion to exclude the farmer as a co-defendant <Col N="1437" /> the judge said that his view was that the farmer as owner of the land would be liable as he had habitually allowed a dangerous activity on his lands to take place and would have to take reasonable care.  However, he did not think that, in the final analysis, the farmer could be expected to keep a perpetual look-out to see that people who were not insured did not shoot over his land.  The judge accordingly struck out the case against the farmer on that basis.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this case I am aware of the continuing concerns of the farming community at what they perceive to be the degree of uncertainty in the present law.  I took the opportunity to discuss those concerns at meetings which I have had with the IFA and ICMSA and I shall be taking them into account in the context of the preparation of my proposals for legislation on the matter.</P>
    <P>The issue, as I said earlier, is the path of reform which we should choose to follow.  The law here is governed by decades of common law tradition and it is clear that this tradition is no longer serving us as well as it might and that appropriate statutory intervention is necessary to clarify matters.</P>
    <P>There are models for reform in other jurisdictions which help to inform on this important topic.  The model which exists in England, and which has been followed to a large extent in a number of other common law countries, would seem to be working with a reasonable degree of success.</P>
    <P>The main change effected by the Occupiers' Liability Act of 1957 in England was to replace the rules of the common law under which the duty of an occupier differs according as the visitor is an invitee or a licensee.  The Act provides that the occupier of premises owes the &ldquo;common duty of care&rdquo; to all his lawful visitors, that is, a duty to take such care in all the circumstances of the case as is reasonable to see that the visitor will be safe in using the premises for the purpose for which he is permitted or invited to be there.</P>
    <P>That Act did not deal with the question of trespassers.  Indeed, the law in England, <Col N="1438" /> as in Ireland, in relation to trespassers was radically changed in the seventies by decisions of the courts. Eventually the position in England was put on a statutory footing by the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.  Under that Act, if the occupier has reasonable grounds to believe that a danger exists on his premises, and the consequent risk is one against which in all the circumstances he may be reasonably expected to offer some protection, then he will owe a duty to trespassers whom he has reasonable grounds for supposing may be in the vicinity.  The duty is essentially to take such precautions as are reasonable in all the circumstances to see that they do not suffer injury.</P>
    <P>The approach under the English 1957 and 1984 statutes offers a good deal of flexibility in that the duty of care varies with the circumstances of the case and the law always recognises that a child will be less careful than an adult and that an adult will be alert to any special risks incidental to his visit.  Under the legislation, it is also open to non-business occupiers, or business occupiers who allow visitors to enter free of charge to historic sites, for example, to exempt themselves from liability.  There are also provisions which relieve a landowner from liability in respect of risks which are willingly accepted by persons going onto the land.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1957 Act regarding warning notices was also applied by the 1984 Act to trespassers so that the duty owed by occupiers to trespassers can be discharged in appropiate cases by notices on the land.</P>
    <P>A legislative model which has attracted some support among the farming community is that which operates in the American state of Illinois.  In essence, landowners there who allow someone onto their land for recreational purposes do not have to take special measures to protect that individual from harm.  Nor is the landowner liable for any damages or injuries the individual may suffer.</P>
    <P>From the foregoing, it is clear that there are different ways in which the issue of occupiers' liability can be tackled.  I <Col N="1439" /> have no doubt that, consequent upon the publication of the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper, other ideas will also be put forward as meriting exploration and examination.  I have in mind the position in particular as it operates among our EC partners.  In the EC context we already have a common system of laws in relation to product liability and, although admittedly occupiers' liability may not come fully within the competence of the EC institutions at present, the position in other member states is something which we should take into account as far as practicable in the preparation of our own legislation.</P>
    <P>I now turn specifically to the Bill which is the subject matter of this debate.  It is traditional for Ministers to say that Private Members' Bills are badly drafted or defective, but perhaps Deputy Deenihan could bear with me if I gently point out some of the difficulties I see with the wording of this Bill.  Its main purpose appears to be to overturn the effects of the decision of the Supreme Court in the McNamara case and to replace it with a provision on the lines of the law as it obtained in relation to trespassers before that decision.  The McNamara case decided that the occupier owes a duty to trespassers whom he could reasonably foresee and that the duty in such a case is to take such reasonable care as the circumstances demand.  The relevant circumstances include the degree of care which would ordinarily be looked for in relation to the trespasser so that the occupier must be prepared, say, for children to be less careful than adults.  Section 3 (2) of the Bill provides however, that except where injury is intentional, no duty of care would be owed to a trespasser. No exception, it seems, is made for children.  It is a matter for consideration as to whether this should be the approach to take and there are many, I assume, who would have reservations about it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) of the Bill appears to do no more than restate the common law rule that the occupier owes licensees a <Col N="1440" /> duty to warn them of concealed dangers of which he or she knows.  On that basis the licensee must take the land as he or she finds it with all its imperfections and the occupier would have no obligation to make it safe for use by the licensee. Presumably, the purpose of the section is an attempt to rule out the possibility of the general duty of care &mdash; based on the ordinary principles of reasonable foreseeability &mdash; being applied to licensees by our courts as in the McNamara case.  Given that there is some uncertainty in our law as to the liability of occupiers in relation to licensees, I accept that some legislation here appears to be necessary.  English legislation has, as I have mentioned, abolished the distinction between invitees and licensees and that is something I am sure that the Law Reform Commission will have looked at carefully.  The Bill before the House does not, of course, deal with invitees.  It is confined only to licensees and trespassers.  However, the distinctions under the present law with regard to categories of entrants are recognised by most commentators as being somewhat arbitrary.  They are perceived by many as a relic of a bygone era when they were formulated.  I would, therefore, have to ask whether any legislation which hopes to introduce an element of reform into this area should not at least tackle the issue of these distinctions and canvass the question as to whether they should be maintained in a modern society.</P>
    <P>Of fundamental importance also on this issue is whether or not that the law should, subject to certain conditions, be brought within the ordinary rules of negligence, as in other common law countries. Should the position of children or other vulnerable groups not be catered for in a way that protects them better than adults?  I think also that if we are to proceed with legislation in this area we should try to make its provisions as comprehensive as possible.  Indeed, perhaps some measure of codification of the law could be achieved.  The Bill lacks entirely any feature of codification.  It is no more than an <i>ad hoc</i> measure.  The Bill's provision <Col N="1441" /> in addition would also sit unhappily with the current body of law in this area because no attempt has been made to reconcile them with the common law rules.  The Bill, in fact, is silent on whether or not the rules of common law would still apply, and it would seem to be open to litigants to pursue a case on the basis of either the common law rules or the rules in the Bill in relation to licensees and trespassers.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the scope of the Bill is confined to land but does not take into account that the duty of occupiers is not confined to injuries occurring on land but also extends, for example, to those occuring on vessels, vehicles or aircraft to the extent that they may arise from a dangerous condition of those structures.  Again, I should mention that the Bill uses merely the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; without defining it.  It may be the intention under the Bill that the rules of common law would continue to determine who is an occupier but that is not made clear.  It should also have been made clear to what extent occupiers would need to have control over the land or structure before they could be made liable.</P>
    <P>As I hope Deputy Deenihan appreciates, I make those points not in any way to criticise the Deputy himself but simply to give some of the reasons that I would prefer to study the Law Reform Commission's paper before formulating my formal proposals on an approach to this subject.  In addition to farmers and many other occupiers of land and other property, the State has a particular interest in this whole area and not just as an occupier. The valuable amenities of our countryside should be used to the maximum extent possible both for pleasure and for profit.  Those amenities inevitably have an attraction for visitors, both domestic and foreign.  Therfore, it is in the wider interest of our national economy that these attractions should continue to be available to those who seek them out.  There is considerable untapped tourism potential in our national heritage, particularly in the area of outdoor leisure pursuits.  Properly <Col N="1442" /> utilised, this potential could be a source of considerable revenue to local economies and could underpin, in a vital way, the social and economic cohesion of those communities.  I recognise that fact fully.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, as more people participate in outdoor leisure pursuites, there is an increasing risk that they will suffer injury in consequence.  In many ways, the acceptance of such risks is inseparable from their full participation in, and their enjoyment of, these activities. I fully accept that the growth in this kind of outdoor interest, together with the associated growth in the level of risk which is voluntarily undertaken by the participants, is not reflected in the liability imposed by the law as it currently stands.  These are matters also which I am sure the Commission will have taken into account in the preparation of its paper.</P>
    <P>In many ways the law as it stands has come full circle.  Initially, the law on occupier's liability was perhaps unduly concerned with safeguarding the interest of the landowner and minimising the risks which attached to his ownership of the land.  This concern was to be seen in the very narrowly focused framework according to which entrants were classified into a variety of categories, with a different duty attaching to each category, depending on the benefit which he or she conferred on the landowner in question. The question we now ask ourselves is whether this is indeed the approach which we wish to maintain or whether we should go in a direction which has been followed in other common law jurisdictions or do we go further afield. Should not our laws, therefore, offer such flexibility that entrants would be entitled to a level of safety that depends on the particular circumstances of the case rather than a level of safety that is automatically dependent on the class or stratification of the entrant.</P>
    <P>While the Government shares some of the concerns which gave rise to this Bill, we are not proposing to support it at the present time for the reasons I have given. Our approach is to await the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper which <Col N="1443" /> is to be published within the next few weeks.  It is my intention to proceed with the submission of proposals in the matter to Government as quickly as possible after that, taking into account the views expressed in the House, the Commission's deliberations and the reaction to the Commission's paper from interested groups.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for Deputy Deenihan to consider favourably the generous gesture I have made and to agree to adjourn the debate rather than press the matter to a vote.  This would give me an opportunity to examine the Law Reform Commission's paper which is due in about three or four weeks' time, so that all aspects of the matter can be fully and carefully considered.  Perhaps the Bill can be amended.  Failing that, we will bring in more comprehensive legislation which I hope will have the approval of all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I compliment Deputy Deenihan on introducing this Bill which is long overdue, in the absence of legislation to protect farmers from users of their land.  In the past some farmers have paid dearly for people crossing their lands, for example fishermen, shooters or day trippers.  If such a person happens to put his foot in a rabbit burrow and breaks his leg or turns his ankle in a cow track he is entitled, under the present law, to bring a case against the farmer for compensation. Many have paid up without even going to court on the understanding that they would have lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of such protective legislation many farmers have taken steps to protect themselves by erecting those very uninviting signs, &ldquo;no trespassers allowed&rdquo;.  That is not an inviting sign for any tourist, bearing in mind that we are <Col N="1444" /> described as the land of the 100,000 welcomes. If one sees &ldquo;no trespassers allowed&rdquo; signs in many different places along the roadside one begins to wonder where the welcomes are.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we may concern ourselves too much with the effects on tourists.  We should think a little more of ourselves. There are many sportsmen and women who use the land, for example, people orienteering, walkers, fishermen on their way to lakes and rivers and shooters. Generally, the shooting season is from 1 September to 31 January &mdash; a five-month period.  For those people who are fortunate enough to live in the more favoured areas where the glorious twelfth is celebrated, they have five and a half months shooting.  The glorious twelfth in this case is the opening of the grouse season.  That means for five and a half months of the year farmers are under threat of being faced with an injury bill from people who may not have been invited on to the land or given permission to enter the lands.  I understand that is the reason this Bill has been introduced. There are a number of definitions in the Bill, one of which relates to the licensee. &ldquo;Licensee&rdquo; means one who enters on the land by the permission of the occupier and &ldquo;trespasser&rdquo; means one who enters on land without the permission of the occupier.  Section 3 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The occupier of land shall not be under any obligation to a licensee to make it safe for use....</P>
    <P>Does that mean he is under the obligation to the fellow whom he goes not invite, namely the trespasser?  Section 3 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The occupier of land owes no duty of care to a trespasser but he is not entitled .... to harm a trespasser.....</P>
    <P>Does that mean he is entitled to harm the person he has invited on to his land?  I understand what Deputy Deenihan had in mind when introducing the Bill but it would be much simpler to state that the occupier of land shall not be under any obligation to a licensee or to a trespasser <Col N="1445" /> and that the occupier owes no duty of care to a trespasser or a licensee. Whether invited or not, a man is not entitled to harm anyone, with the exception of self protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would heed the contents of the Bill.  I expect he will vote accordingly, together with members of his party and his colleagues in Government. I support this Bill and again compliment Deputy Deenihan on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I compliment my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, on bringing in this much needed and long overdue Bill.  We can say all we like about legislation and what should be done and we can wait for reports and set up commissions but in the long run something has to be done to rectify injustices.  Nothing could be more unjust than the present system where somebody who trespasses on land or property can sue the owner.  It is an archaic law.  With my non-legal training I do not need anybody to tell me that the wording should be simple.  I agree with Deputy Foxe that it should be clear-cut that the landowner owes no obligation to anybody.  If I want to do something with my property why should I have to worry about somebody trying to steal it?  If I dig a hole in the ground to bury my gold and somebody happens to fall into it, why should I be liable for any damages caused to him?  The thing that should be done is to cover him up with the gravel and not give him any compensation.  The whole concept of this responsibility is completely unjustified and indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister expressed surprise that Deputy Deenihan had introduced this Bill without having the benefit of the Commission's paper on the subject. The Minister of State has the advantage of living in the city and may have many rural contacts.  He may even own 1,000 acres in the country.  If he was in touch with farmers, farmer organisations or attended a dinner dance organised by any of the farming groups, he would know that it is the one topic that is upsetting to landowners because they do not <Col N="1446" /> know the day or the hour they will get a bill for, perhaps, something they do not know anything about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to householders. It is not a rural phenomenon only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I accept that point.  The whole question of public liability has become ridiculous. Business people are put out of business because they cannot get cover.  I know a painter who got a contract but he could not get public liability cover.  I know another person who pretended he had public liability because he could not afford to pay £4,000.  I agree that not only should we deal with this issue but we should broaden it out.  This Bill concerns farmers, mainly landowners.  This is something they worry and talk about because they can see the difficulty whereby somebody can sue them and put them out of business.  For that reason the Bill should be welcomed and the Minister should support it.  I was on a committee dealing with this matter during the life of the last Government but the committee collapsed because of the election.  It was important then that we should deal with it, and it is still important.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that a problem with this rule is that it automatically assumed that a trespasser is a person of lawless intent.  I do not think it makes any difference. I suppose it makes it worse if somebody is coming in to rob one and he gets hurt and one has to compensate him. However, a trespasser is a trespasser. The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>It did not make allowance for the fact that in many instances trespassing may be quite an innocent activity which is wholly devoid of malice.  In this context, the position of children who stray onto land, attracted perhaps by some particular natural feature such as a tree or water, is of especial relevance.</P>
      <P>The question that springs to my mind straight away is: should every landowner cut down his trees in case some trespasser comes in, decides to climb a tree and then falls off and breaks some bones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> If we want to have a beautiful countryside and beautiful ash trees and oak trees scattered all over the countryside and ponds or lakes, are we to stand back from all this and say that the farmer is liable because there is a danger that somebody may trespass and get hurt?  If the farmer is lucky enough to have trees and water on his land, why should he have to compensate a person who comes on to his property and falls into the lake or from a tree?  We do not need any commission report.  All we need is commonsense.  Let the farmer get on with his life.  He has enough expenses to meet without having to pay people who invade his property.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Supreme Court gave careful consideration to the legal basis of any duty which a defendant might have in cases of trespass in general, and that Deputy Deenihan was overruling the Supreme Court decision.  I am innocent enough to believe that the Dáil should be laying down legislation and that the Supreme Court should be interpreting it.  Often in the past it was the Supreme Court who decided what legislation should be passed because we have been dragging our feet. I would have assumed that any decision made by the Supreme Court is made on the basis of existing legislation and that if we bring in legislation providing that no compensation is to be given to a person who is a trespasser, or even an invitee, that that legislation should stand. I do not see why, if a farmer gives a man permission to walk his alsatian on his land and the alsatian drags him over a quarry into a 40ft. pool of water, the farmer should be liable.  However, because of our archaic legislation that farmer is liable to compensate that invitee.  I would not make any distinction between invitees, licensees or trespassers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): It is trying to deal with an archaic system. The Minister said that perhaps all those <Col N="1448" /> matters should be left out of it altogether. Why not start in 1993 with legislation that is understood and is in plain English with no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;ands&rdquo; or &ldquo;wherefores&rdquo;?  We are forever continuing on with old legislation &mdash; what was written in 1875 and 1775 has to be continued.  The Minister gave the example of the state of Illinois where, in essence, landowners there who allow someone onto their land for recreation purposes do not have to take special measures to protect that individual from harm, nor is the landowner liable for any damages or injuries the individual may suffer.  Is that not what this Bill is really trying to do?  In Illinois farmers have no liability.  Why can we not, in 1993, introduce such legislation here?</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I do not mind the intervention because it explains things.  We are dealing with something that is very important.  This Bill deals with the responsibilities of landowners. It mean so much to the farmers. We should be bending over backwards to get to the stage where a farmer can rest peacefully at night and not worry in case somebody comes on to his land.  That is what it boils down to.  We can have all the legal arguments we like and definitions of words and so on.  I do not care if the person is engaging in a sporting activity, is invited in or is a trespasser.  The land owners should have no liability whatsoever to cover that person's injuries if he should have an accident.  Some years ago a person tried to break into Croke Park and fell through the glass roof on the handball alley and got something like £20,000 in compensation.  We are standing things on their heads and it is impossible to survive because of the costs of public liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note something else the Minister said, that the licensee must take the land as he or she finds it with all its imperfections and the occupier will have no obligation to make it safe for use by the licensee.  I am sure that a farmer hearing that would be drawing up emergency plans to go out with tractors and trailers to fill in all the holes and so on, on his land because the licensee is now expected to take the land as he or she finds it.  Why should the trespasser, the invitee or the licensee not take the land as they find it?  Surely to God a farmer cannot go around with a flash lamp at night telling people to watch their step, that there is a hole there, a tree over there and not to jump into the lake?  What kind of legislation are we bringing in to deal with the practicalities of a farmer's life?  The Minister asks should our law not, therefore, offer such flexibility that entrants would be entitled to a level of safety that depends on the particular circumstances of the case rather than a level of safety that is automatically dependent on the class or stratification of the entrant.  The Minister is arguing again on behalf of the trespasser or the invitee.  The Minister is arguing <Col N="1450" /> that there should not be a standard laid down on the basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): That particular statement &mdash;&ldquo;should not our laws offer such flexibility that entrants would be entitled to a level of safety that depends on the particular circumstances of the case rather than a level of safety that is automatically dependant on the class or stratification of the entrant&rdquo;&mdash; indicates one thing.  This Bill is saying that trespassers just do not get compensation, that there should be no liability attaching to the landowner in the case of trespassers.  The Minister stated that there should be a balancing act but I do not believe there should be.  If the Minister waits for the publication of a report there is a danger that instead of <Col N="1451" /> dealing with the protection of landowners and farmers there will be a hidden agenda that will make it worse for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter here.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the arrest of John Matthews in London, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and the subsequent charge against him on 4 May this year?</P>
      <P>John Matthews was returning home to Ireland on 27 April when he was arrested at Heathrow Airport.  The now infamous British swab tests were carried out on his hands, the results of which were not made known to John until three weeks after his arrest.</P>
      <P>Ms Gareth Pierce, the solicitor who represented the innocent members of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four at their respective appeals, has taken up the case of John Matthews.  Ms Pierce has expressed immense reservations about this alleged forensic evidence.  She has cast serious doubt on the subsequent three identification parades on which John was placed for three different offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Matthews is only five foot two inches in height and has what has been called distinctive bright ginger hair. Taking those distinguishing features into account, John was picked out only after considerable hesitation by one witness who initially indicated that he could not make a positive identification.  I understand the same witness said originally to the police that the accused was approximately five foot seven inches in height. Will the Minister agree that there are serious reservations in regard to this case?  I implore him to act immediately on this matter.  We have already seen the effects of fabricated evidence such as this on Irish citizens.  We cannot afford to be complacent about such matters.  We must <Col N="1452" /> act now, 17 or 20 years from now will be too late.</P>
    <P>It appears that the British police force is acting in the same manner as it did in the mid-70s when it was under pressure to arrest people for the bombing campaign being carried out at that time, regardless of the lack of evidence and the blatant lies that were told against the innocent people who were arrested and convicted of those atrocious crimes.  This is the second serious mistake the British authorities have made this year.  I am sure the Minister is aware of a gentleman called Mr. Murphy who was arrested earlier this year after three people had supposedly identified him.  It was later discovered that he could not have been at the scene of the crime because he was attending a meeting with a number of other people.  On the day after his arrest, <i>The Sun</i> newspaper displayed a bumper headline &ldquo;Caught Mr. Big&rdquo; stating that he was one of the most senior people in the IRA in England at the time.</P>
    <P>When John Matthews was arrested he was questioned about three different bomb attacks in England, one in June 1992, one in October 1992 and for the bombing of the NatWest Tower in the city of London on 24 April 1993 with which he was subsequently charged.  I understand that on the date in question in June 1992 John was being conferred with a degree at Queen's University and on the date in question in October 1992 he was working at a hospital in London and this was verified by people working there.  Leaving aside the flimsy forensic evidence and the dubious identification parade, John has an air-tight alibi.  At the time John was supposedly planting the bombs in the NatWest Tower he was at home with his aunt in Wood Green, north London, watching a Bruce Springsteen concert.  John is the first Catholic ever to be elected President of the Geographical Society of Queen's University.  He has impeccable credentials from people from all sides of the community in the North of Ireland and following a raid on his family home by the RUC they stated that it was a mistake and that neither John nor his family had any connection with the IRA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> Gareth Pierce stated:</P>
    <P>John's position has all the hallmarks of many worrying cases in the past which have led to innocent people being wrongly convicted.  Here, it appears that one inconclusive and manifestly weak piece of evidence is being used to prop up another similarly inadequate piece of evidence.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone either inside or outside this House to get the impression that I want the true perpetrators of those horrific crimes to walk free.  What I do want is the real terrorists, the people who actually planted these bombs, to be arrested and convicted.  I am convinced, and I know of many other people who are equally sure, that in this instance once again the British authorities have charged the wrong person.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Matthew's family contacted me as their local Deputy I assured them that I would do all in my power to highlight John's case and keep it under active review.  That is why I am asking the Minister to take this matter up as a matter of urgency with the British authorities and to keep us informed of their deliberations in the matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I can confirm that I am fully aware of the details of the case to which he refers. As the Deputy will know, the person concerned was arrested on 27 April and detained in police custody under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  On 4 May he was charged with offences arising out of recent terrorist activities in London and has been remanded in custody since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While conscious of the seriousness of the charges involved I am also fully aware of the concerns which have been expressed about this case, and the anxiety which it has caused for the family and relatives of the young man who has been detained.  I am particularly conscious of the serious concerns which have been expressed by his family, his legal representatives and by the Deputy here this <Col N="1454" /> evening, regarding the circumstances of the arrest and continuing detention of the person in question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware that the embassy in London, in discharge of its consular responsibilities, has been actively involved in this case.  In addition to maintaining contact with the family and legal representatives of the person detained, an officer of the embassy visited him in prison on 21 May.  The embassy has also been in touch with the British authorities with a view to facilitating access to the prison for members of his family.  The embassy will continue to follow closely developments in this case with a view to ensuring that the consular rights of the detained person are fully protected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the operation generally of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to ensure that the rights of Irish citizens are fully respected.  The British authorities are in no doubt as to the Government's position in this repect. We have, for example, conveyed our views on several occasions to Lord Colville in connection with his annual review of the Act and we have consistently made clear to the British authorities our concern that the legislation should be applied in an even-handed manner and that abuses should be eliminated.  For its part the embassy in London continues to monitor developments in individual cases and to maintain close contact in this area with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that the embassy in London will continue to follow closely developments in this case, and to offer whatever consular assistance would be appropriate in the circumstances. Finally, I will personally monitor developments through our embassy.</P>

      <P>I am making a special appeal to the Minister to withdraw from public auction on 10 June Agriculture House, Oakpark, Tralee, County Kerry. If this building passes out of public ownership it will be lost forever to the people of Kerry and Ireland.  In reply to a Dáil question on Tuesday, 25 May, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that he did not accept that the architectural importance of the building necessitated its retention in public ownership.  I am afraid the Minister has been poorly advised on this matter.  Agriculture House is a building of major historical and architectural significance. I would rate it in the same category as Muckross House and Derrynane House, as a building of major significance.  Unfortunately, very few buildings of its quality survived our War of Independence.  We lost some of our most important potential assets during that period which if they had survived would enhance tourism considerably in the country.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the history of Agriculture House.  The house was built by the Evans brothers of Cork at the cost of £34,000 and an Italian firm were engaged to do the painting and decorating for a further £6,000.  The house was completed in 1857 and Mr. Morris Sands, the owner, occupied the house at that time.  The Sands mansion was built in a fine Victorian gothic style.  The main house is of red brick and limestone facing.  The workmanship and materials throughout are of the finest quality.  The entrance lobby, great hall, drawing room, morning room and stairs are especially fine.  In 1922 Oakpark demense was divided and sold.  Bishop Charles O'Sullivan, the then bishop of Kerry, purchased the mansion, woods, lawns and entrance.  The property was to be used as a general novitiate for the Presentation Order and it was purchased for £3,500.  This house and surrounds were used as a novitiate for the Presentation nuns in Kerry from 1924 to 1974.  In 1974 Tralee Urban District Council purchased the property and the following year sold the house to the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> The house is now up for public auction on 10 June.  The property will go into private ownership on that date unless the Minister intervenes.  A number of groups in Tralee are anxious to take over the building for different purposes.</P>
    <P>I received a circular from the No Opportunities for Women, NOW, group which states:</P>
    <P>As a member of the NOW group, I feel that this is a unique opportunity to acquire and develop Oakpark House and to honour the heritage of this gothic style house as a community project.</P>
    <P>We as a group envisage that this initiative would be economically viable with creative opportunities for community development.</P>
    <P>We would therefore like you to intervene to stay the auction date.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time in respect of this important local issue.  I support the case made by Deputy Deenihan in respect of Agriculture House, Oakpark, Tralee, which the present owners, Teagasc, have decided to sell by public auction. This beautiful building has tremendous architectural value and it is imperative that it is retained in public ownership.  Already many organisations and individuals in Tralee and Kerry have shown great interest in this building.  The local urban district council, under chairperson Councillor Mary O'Halloran, intends calling a meeting of all interested groups with a view to drawing up a plan of campaign to raise the necessary funding to acquire this property and retain it in public ownership.  By doing this they hope to blend it in with the other successful developments in Tralee, for example, the Geraldine experience, the windmill and, the steam train.  For this reason I appeal to the Minister to adjourn the auction for three months and during that time a steering committee representing the cross section of individuals <Col N="1457" /> in Tralee and Kerry would be in a position to negotiate the satisfactory purchase of Agriculture House from Teagasc.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that it is important to maintain our cultural and architectural heritage.  For this reason I appeal to the Minister to accede to the request Deputy Deenihan and I have made.  If the Minister is not satisfied, through I believe he will be, the auction can then proceed after three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The building at Oakpark, Tralee, which is the property of Teagasc, is now too big for that organisation's requirements.  Teagasc has experienced some financial constraints in recent years. In order to provide for the efficient and effective operation of the body and its long term financial viability an efficiency plan was prepared by Teagasc in consultation with the Department.  The plan had a number of elements including the utilisation of the resources, physical and human, in the most cost effective manner possible.</P>
      <P>In addition the disposal of assets is essential in order to provide resources for necessary capital expenditure required by Teagasc in order to fulfil its mandate.  Under the legislation Teagasc is required to give priority to education and food work.  The importance of food research in terms of the development of the industry cannot be over emphasised. In this context the retention of unnecessary assets of buildings cannot be justified.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to maintain our cultural and architectural heritage.  But Teagasc was established for an entirely different purpose, namely, to provide advisory, educational and research services for the agriculture and food industries.  The preservation of architectural heritage must be done through different agencies.  There is of course no need whatever for State ownership to protect such heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  The Tánaiste has also expressed his concern in relation to the matter and I have noted <Col N="1458" /> the views expressed by Deputies on both sides of the House about giving time to the local committee to consider its position in respect of its likely purchase of the property.  I will convey these views to Teagasc in the light of the timescale referred to by both Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the danger or threat to the building.  As the Deputy is aware any alteration will require the permission of Kerry County Council, the relevant statutory authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the serious problem arising from the closure of the CPV factory, Clones, County Monaghan.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to my comments.</P>
      <P>The CPV factory has provided excellent employment over the past 25 years for the people of Clones town and surrounding areas.  At peak times, more than 160 people are employed full-time in the factory and the benefit of this to the town of Clones is impossible to quantify.</P>
      <P>Clones has been badly hit over the years because of its proximity to the border.  Garages, filling stations and many other small businesses that carry on business in most towns were closed down mainly because of the taxation problems associated with being in business so close to the Border.  The fact that many roads were closed because of the troubles also had an enormous impact on the social and economic life of the town.</P>
      <P>In the light of these problems, a serious effort must be made by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government, but especially by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to resolve the problems at CPV and maintain the workforce for the benefit of the business and social life of Clones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CPV to Clones is equally, if not more, important than Digital is to Galway.  One only has to remember that the Minister and his entourage flew to America at very short notice to do everything possible to <Col N="1459" /> save employment in Digital.  We welcomed that move at the time.  We would expect the Minister to take similar action, to help an Irish company based in Clones remain in business.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Leonard has said he intends to raise this issue with the Taoiseach and the Minister today.</P>
    <P>I wish to give my support, in whatever way possible, to ensure that the town of Clones is not allowed deteriorate any further.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the effect of the mishandling of the position at the Ballybay meat factory to see the damage the loss of 100 jobs, or more, can do to any town.  The fact that Ballybay and Clones are so close means that it is even more important to ensure that the workforce at CPV is retained.  While CPV employed in excess of 150 or 160 people one must realise also that all the service industries involved with CPV will have to bear the consequences of this closure.</P>
    <P>This factory was taken over by Powerscreen Limited, a major international company, late last year.  Powerscreen Limited, based in Dungannon, is recognised as a very successful firm and there would seem to be no reason they and the very skilled workforce in Clones should not be able to work as a team to provide long term employment and exports for Clones and the country in general.  If this factory closes at the end of June many families will have serious financial problems. Those with house and car loans as well as other commitments will lose their main source of income.  The Government and taxpayers will have to bear the cost of providing social welfare benefits and all that that implies.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that this major enterprise, in a town with the amount of difficulties Clones is experiencing, is given an opportunity to survive. It is not without sadness I say that the development team is meeting tonight to discuss how it can utilise EC funds and the International Fund for Ireland to develop the structure of the town in general.  However, without the workforec <Col N="1460" /> in CPV providing some of the town's wealth, those developments may not be possible.  I appreciate the Minister being here tonight and I hope he will do what he can in this regard.  This is not a political issue, it is a matter of wanting to get something done in a positive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at the outset that I fully share the Deputy's grave concern regarding the impending closure of this company and its adverse consequences for employment in Clones.  I would like to put on the record of the House, as the Deputy has already indicated, that Deputy Jimmy Leonard, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon and, indeed, Senator Ann Gallagher have all expressed their concern to me over the last number of days about this matter.  I want to assure Deputy Crawford that, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I will do all in my power to prevent the closure and, if this does not prove possible, to minimise its effects on Monaghan.</P>
      <P>CPV has had a long and fruitful relationship with Clones since its establishment in 1967 to manufacture sheet metal containers.  Since then it has received substantial assistance from the State for its investment activities.  The company supplies containers mainly to the bulk chemicals industry which entered a severe downturn in 1992.  This has, unfortunately, resulted in a sharp build-up of capacity in the container supplier industry with consequent downward pressure on prices.  In fact, average unit prices for bulk containers have fallen by almost 40 per cent over the past few months.</P>
      <P>CPV Limited has been particularly badly affected by the downturn in its customer industry and has been experiencing severe competition in price and quality of product from its major international competitors.  As a result the company has been making losses and its order book situation is very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company was acquired by new owners in 1992, who have been making <Col N="1461" /> strenuous efforts to put the undertaking on a more viable footing.  However, the management are having to face up to the realities of the deteriorating situation of the company's financial position in the face of the extremely difficult trading conditions in which it is operating.  This has led to a situation where management see no alternative option but to close.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that the IDA are and have been in close and constant touch with the company to see if anything can be done at this stage to avoid closure and consequent job losses. I fully appreciate Deputy Crawford's personal concerns in this matter and I am prepared to be available to meet with whoever he and the other public representatives for Cavan-Monaghan consider would be influential in attempting to find a way to assist this industry.  I do recognise its critical importance to the town of Clones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Chean Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter in the House and to thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, for being present here to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment in respect of the Ballinrobe sewerage scheme is to seek clarification from the Minister as to the reasons the scheme has not commenced to date and hopefully to have an indication from him when work might actually commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballinrobe is an important market town in a strategic location in County Mayo.  It is situated between Lough Carra and Lough Mask in what is a rich agricultural region comprising good soils and, in some cases, fractured limestone. It is served by the River Robe which takes raw sewage from Claremorris, Hollymount and Ballinrobe town.  It is an important angling centre, having hosted on Lough Mask and close by on Lough Carra the World Wet Fly Championships <Col N="1462" /> on a number of occasions.  From that point of view it is an important aspect of the economic development of Ballinrobe.</P>
    <P>This is one of a number of important developments due to take place in the town, including an extension of the Lough Mask regional water scheme from Ballinrobe to Claremorris.  It is important to note that there has been much concern expressed in recent years about the condition of the Robe waters.  While these have been constantly monitored by Mayo County Council and the pollution monitoring personnel, concerns have been expressed.  In a time of expansion and of growing population in that general locality it is important that this project would proceed.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Council were informed by the water and services section on 22 April 1993, that in respect of the Ballinrobe sewerage and sewage disposal scheme £3 million was set aside for this by the Department of the Environment. I am aware that this £3 million was subject to approval by the EC, coming as it does under the Cohesion Funds.  I am aware also that Mayo County Council complied with all the regulations of the Department, that they had their scheme approved, that they sought tenders and that they made a recommendation.  I am further aware that one of the contractors then sought legal advice on the tender system and I believe the Attorney General has clarified that matter and that the Department of the Environment should now be in a position to accept the recommendation of Mayo County Council and to allow work to proceed.</P>
    <P>I cannot over stress to the Minister the importance of this development to Ballinrobe.  It is a small town without a major industry, apart from a few small but important ones, and has been without any industrial development of any size over the past number of years.  I hope that the Minister in his reply will be in a position to indicate that the legalities of the issue have been cleared up and that hopefully work will commence at an early date.  When work does commence I would hope that the shopkeepers and <Col N="1463" /> businesses on both Glebe Street and Bridge Street, which must close for a number of weeks while the work is going ahead, would at least have the county manager's endorsement in respect of a proportionate waiver regarding rates. This is necessary because of the amount of business which will be lost due to the total closure of business on these streets for a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that this is a very important scheme for Ballinrobe. It is contingent for the whole region upon having both Hollymount and Claremorris following suit.  It is vital that this project proceeds quickly.  In that context I hope the Minister will clarify for the House and for the people of that locality that the legalities have been resolved and that he will give his imprimatur for work to commence in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Enda Kenny for raising this matter which allows me to indicate to the House the priority and the objectives of this Government in terms of the provision of major sewage treatment and disposal systems throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current construction programme will provide secondary treatment facilities at a significant number of locations, including Athlone, Longford, Tuam, Castletroy, Monaghan, Tralee, Ballybunion, <Col N="1464" /> Swinford, Kanturk, Bailieborough, Dingle and Killorglin.  That should be an indication to the Deputy of the progress being made in providing these essential and basic facilities to deal with inland river and coastal bay pollution.</P>
    <P>There is no slackening of the ropes in dealing with problems of this kind.  We have been successful in attracting EC aid and the sum of £42 million is being provided this year in that context.  There is no argument about Ballinrobe.  The scheme there is 40 years old, is totally overloaded and is particularly vulnerable during times of flooding, leading to minor pollution problems in the area of the River Robe.  Therefore this is a priority scheme.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the scheme is £8 million. Provision has been made this year for inclusion of the project outlined by Deputy Enda Kenny under the Cohesion Fund.  Administrative arrangements made in consultation with Mayo County Council and my Department for submission to the EC have been completed. An essential requirement under the Cohesion Fund is that each individual project be submitted and this matter has been dealt with.  As soon as a decision is taken at EC level I will not hesitate to sanction the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 June 1993.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Equality and Law Reform I am deeply concerned to see progress in this area.  I am examining the feasibility of more aggressive implementation of equal opportunities programmes.  In this regard the recently published Fifth Annual Report on the Implementation of the Equal Opportunity Policy and Guidelines for the Civil Service is to be welcomed.  As this report is the work of a joint management/union Subcommittee of General Council &mdash; the central conciliation council for the Civil Service &mdash; it ensures that equal opportunities issues in the Civil Service remain high on the agenda of both management and unions.</P>
      <P>My Department is undertaking a survey to establish baseline data and monitor progress in local authorities, health boards and State-sponsored bodies.  I expect that this survey will provide a basis for those organisations to plan relevant programmes of positive action.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also of the decision by the Government to ensure that, in future appointments to the boards of State companies, the gender balance of the board will be a major factor to be taken into consideration.  We have set a target which over a four-year period will ensure that at least 40 per cent of their directors will be women.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 111 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure of meeting with some members of the AIM group in March of this year when they advised me of their situation.  In recent years AIM have received an annual grant of £3,500 from the Eastern Health Board.  In addition, the Department of Health have made grants, totalling £15,000, available to them.  I am aware that they have also applied for a grant under the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies which is operated by the Department of Health and that my colleague, the Minister for Health, is at present considering their application.  I will have consultations with him on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In principle, potential women candidates for appointment to State boards, like potential men candidates, are self-selecting as they come to attention through achievement in their work, through voluntary efforts or other contributions to society.  The low proportion of women board members to date reflects the difficulties women have had in access to senior management and board positions in the economy generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's intention to change this situation and to bring about gender balance on the boards of State-sponsored bodies over a four-year time span.</P>
      <P>There are already a number of lists of potential women board members in existence, for example, that of the National Women's Talent Bank.  If the Council for the Status of Women wishes to produce a list I would be quite happy to circulate it to Government Ministers for consideration, bearing in mind that membership of State boards should be drawn from as wide a pool as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government welcome the efforts of the members of the Security Council, notably Britain, France, Russia, Spain and the United States, to build on the united approach to the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina which the international community has been pursuing.</P>
      <P>This united approach has been based on the plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina which was developed by International Conference co-chairmen Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.  The plan has been accepted by the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, but not the Bosnian Serbs.  It was made clear by the Presidency of the European Community on 27 March that the Twelve fully support the Vance-Owen plan and that it remains the only viable road to a just and lasting peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Action Programme on Former Yugoslavia, agreed on 22 May by five members of the Security Council, should be seen as complementing rather than replacing the provisions of the Vance-Owen peace plan.  It contains a series of immediate measures which are necessary in light of the tragic situation <Col N="1266" /> which exists on the ground in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the dangers which this poses for the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>All the principal elements are already central to the approach being followed by Ireland and the European Community. They include a commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance; the rigorous enforcement of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro to bring about the withdrawal by the Bosnian Serbs for territories occupied by force; the sealing of Serbia's border with Bosnia-Hercegovina to this end; action to ensure that the many thousands of Bosnians who are living in appalling conditions in towns, designated earlier by the Security Council as &ldquo;safe areas&rdquo; can be given the protection from Bosnian Serb aggression which they most urgently require.</P>
    <P>Specific decisions on a number of these questions are currently under consideration in the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The five have also warned that assistance to Bosnian Croat forces engaged in ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina could result in the international community imposing sanctions on Croatia.</P>
    <P>The action programme fully supports the work of the Security Council on the establishment of an international tribunal for the purposes of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in former Yugoslavia.  The Security Council, by its Resolution 827 of 25 May, decided to establish this Tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> In addition, the five are supporting further steps to prevent overspill of the conflict. These include the reinforcement of the international presence in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in the Serbian Province of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The Government are gravely concerned about the latest fighting in Bosnia, including that in Sarajevo and Gorazde. These recent developments underline the need for a continuing united international approach to the conflict.</P>
    <P>Ireland will, in conjunction with its EC partners, continue to work actively for the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan, which remains the best hope for the survival, with peace and respect of human rights, of Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reconfirm Ireland's support for the Tibetan people's right to self-determination, as expressed in the Irish-sponsored UN General Assembly Resolutions of 1959 (1353 XIV), 1961 (XVI) and 1965 (2079 XX).</Quest>

      <P>In 1959, 1961 and 1965 Ireland supported UN General Assembly Resolutions on the question of Tibet.  The 1959 resolution called, <i>inter alia</i>, for respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life.  The 1961 resolution called, <i>inter alia</i>, for the cessation of practices which deprived the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, including their right to self-determination. The 1965 resolution reaffirmed the earlier resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The People's Republic of China became a member of the United Nations in 1971, taking the seat occupied by the Republic of China, Taiwan.  In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with China, the Irish Government recognised the People's Republic as <Col N="1268" /> the sole legal government of China. Diplomatic relations are conducted with China on that basis.</P>
    <P>On 10 March 1993, the Dalai Lama in a statement said that Tibetans must continue to engage the Chinese Government in a dialogue that &ldquo;is mutually beneficial and will eventually lead to earnest negotiations to peacefully resolve the question of Tibet.&rdquo;  Ireland has noted this statement by the Dalai Lama and other recent statements which focus particularly on full respect for the human rights of Tibetans and on the need for dialogue and negotiations.</P>
    <P>The central concern of the Government's policy towards Tibet is also the need for respect and protection for the human rights of Tibetans and for their distinctive cultural and religious life.  Our concerns in this area, and those of our partners in the European Community, have been regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities.  The question of human rights abuses was raised directly with the authorities in Tibet by a delegation of EC ambassadors, including the Irish ambassador, which visited Tibet from 15 to 23 May 1993.</P>

      <P>The World Health Assembly, held in Geneva on 10-14 May 1993, considered a resolution which sought to ask the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on whether the use of nuclear weapons by a state in war or other armed conflict would be a breach of that state's obligations under international law, including the WHO constitution.  Voting took place by secret ballot.  The outcome was that the resolution was adopted by 73 votes in favour, 31 against, with 6 abstentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a longstanding practice not to reveal how Ireland votes in secret ballots <Col N="1269" /> held in international organisations, and I do not intend to deviate from that practice on this occasion.</P>

    <P>* As detailed above, Public Capital Programme spending is comprised of both Exchequer funded and non-Exchequer funded expenditure.  A total of £944 million of the Exchequer-funded element of the 1993 PCP relates to voted capital services of which £191 million issued up to end-March of this year.  This represents 21 per cent of the 1993 voted capital provision and indicates that Exchequer funded capital spending is broadly on target.  Non-Exchequer funded PCP spending is monitored on annual basis for Budget Book purposes and, as such it is not possible to estimate first quarter issues in this regard.</P>

      <P>A number of properties in Cahirciveen, including the Penal Church, have been the subject of compulsory purchase procedures by Kerry County Council, in connection with a car parking development which they are proposing to locate in the area. The Commissioners of Public Works have recommended to Kerry County Council that the Penal Church should be preserved.  Officials from both the Office of Public Works and the county council have been working to reach an accommodation, whereby both the church can be preserved and the car parking development can proceed.  I would hope that a mutually agreeable solution can be arrived at shortly.  Arrangements will be made at the appropriate juncture to enter the Penal Church in the Register of Historic Monuments, as provided for under <Col N="1272" /> the National Monuments Act, 1930 to 1987.</P>

      <P>I announced recently that the circulars issued to health boards in 1992 in relation to assistance with ESB and Gas debts by way of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme would be withdrawn with effect from the end of May 1993.  These circulars have now been withdrawn with effect from 1 June 1993.</P>
      <P>The circular I am now issuing to health boards ensures that people who experience particular difficulties with ESB and Gas payments will receive help.  Guidance issued for community welfare officers ensures that help will be available where there are exceptional circumstances and where the expenditure could not reasonably be met from the client's normal weekly income.</P>
      <P>New arrangements are being made to help people who have difficulties with their ESB or gas bills.  My Department is drawing up a code of practice which will involve the health boards, the ESB and gas companies in providing an integrated and effective response to people in difficulties.  The code of practice will be finalised shortly and published in the form of an information leaflet.</P>

      <P>I have been particularly concerned for some time about the problem <Col N="1276" /> of indebtedness and moneylending.  This is a serious problem which has been with us for some considerable time and which particularly affects the unemployed and those on low incomes generally.</P>
      <P>In May, I introduced a household budgeting facility for social welfare customers. The service has been introduced on a trial basis in Dublin and the intention is to extend this facility as quickly as possible to all areas of the country.  The service allows for deductions to be made from social welfare payments with the customer's consent.  The amounts can then be paid over to the ESB, gas company and local authorities.</P>
      <P>I see this service as having great potential to assist social welfare families who do not normally have access to the financial budgeting service provided by the banks.  The offices included in the initial phase are: (a) North Cumberland St., Ballyfermot, Kilbarrack, Nutgrove, Tallaght, Werburgh St.</P>

    <P>It is intended to progressively extend the scheme to cover all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>In 1992, my Department funded the establishment of pilot projects around the country, aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending. Five projects were set up in Dublin city, West Clare, Cork city, Limerick city and Waterford city.  Under this scheme local groups who had already been involved in this work are expanding their efforts and are trying out a variety of new and different appoaches to tackling the problems of moneylending.  The key elements of the projects include a general money advice element, targeted at families identified as having particular problems with moneylenders, a role for both statutory and voluntary bodies and an emphasis on practical, budget based measures that would have success over the long term in removing people from dependence on moneylenders.  The regional management of my Department and the local community welfare service are both actively involved in these projects.</P>
    <P>The work of these projects is being monitored by my Department.  I will be examining the results of this evaluation with a view to extending the scheme later this year.</P>
    <P>In the light of the outcome of the evaluation currently being undertaken I will consider what further measures may be required, including the question as to whether a survey of the kind suggested by the Deputy should be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1991, I extended social <Col N="1278" /> insurance to part-time employees earning £25 or more a week.  This measure brought 27,000 part-time workers into the social insurance system for the first time and means that they are now insured for the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions.  The vast majority of these workers now have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for short term contributory benefits such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Changes in the benefits system were required to accommodate this group. One of these changes related to unemployed benefit.  The purpose of unemployment benefit is to provide a replacement income for people who have lost their full-time jobs.  Now that so many part-time workers, some of whom normally work only a day or two per week, are covered by social insurance, it was necessary to review the conditions for unemployment benefit to ensure that they were in line with the scheme's objectives. The new arrangements require the claimant to have suffered a loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit. Initially, regulations provided that the employment lost has to be at least two days for persons normally working four or more days in the week and one day's loss for persons employed from one to three days.  In March of this year, I reduced this requirement to one day in all cases.</P>
      <P>Any person who is adversely affected by the provisions of these regulations may instead claim unemployment assistance for the days of unemployment. From April 1993, I revised the regulations governing the assessment of insurable earnings for unemployment assistance purposes to improve the position of workers with earnings from part-time work.  A person can now earn an amount equivalent to the normal daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an additional £15 per day for each day worked.  This, for example, means that a married man with two dependent children can earn up to £34.42 per day without affecting the rate of unemployment assistance payable for each day not worked in the same week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> In the case of certain casual workers, including some dockers, I am aware that the new provisions for the treatment of part-time workers may result in a reduction in their overall income when their period of entitlement to unemployment benefit is exhausted.  I am currently examining this situation with a view to further improving the position of these workers.</P>

This represents about 12 per cent of the total of 84,800 claims received.  All claims received have been processed for Phase 1 entitlement, higher personal rate of benefit and extended duration of unemployment benefit, with the exception of a small number where additional inquiries had to be made to determine entitlement.</P>
      <P>Processing of Phase 2 entitlement, household supplement for dependants and entitlement to unemployment assistance, commenced in April.

      <P>Removal of asbestos from buildings is controlled by the Factories (Asbestos Process) Regulations, 1975 and the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989.  The 1975 Regulations require written notice to be provided to the Health and Safety Authority 28 days before any process where asbestos dust is liable to escape is undertaken.  The 1989 Regulations require the submission, prior to the commencement of any work involving the removal of asbestos or products containing asbestos, of a satisfactory plan <Col N="1289" /> of work to ensure the safety and health of workers.  These regulations are enforced by inspectors of the Authority who assess each notification submitted to them.</P>
      <P>At present, work is in progress on the preparation of draft regulations which will reduce the maximum levels of asbestos permissible in workplaces to protect workers and the general public.  These regulations will transpose into national legislation Council Directive 91/382/EEC which amends Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.</P>

In determining the suitability or otherwise of an applicant for overseas service the commanding officer will take account of the applicant's conduct, military qualifications, medical grading, age and family circumstances.</P>
      <P>Personnel are trained specifically for each overseas mission and every effort is made to ensure that they are familiar with the mission and the country in which they will serve.  Briefings are given on local conditions both in the military and civilian area.</P>

      <P>On 24 January, 1990 the then Chairman of Aer Lingus informed my predecesor that major losses has been incurred in Aer Lingus Holidays Limited.  These losses, it was stated, had arisen mainly from unreported trading losses over a number of years of some £7 million.</P>
      <P>The Chairman also informed my predecessor that, in addition, it had been deemed prudent to write down the value of the company's apartment properties by some £3 million.</P>
      <P>An investigation into the reported discrepancies was carried out by a major chartered accountancy firm, Craig Gardner. The Garda Síochána were also contacted by Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>On 11 May, 1990 my predecessor received from Craig Gardner the report of their investigation into the affairs of Aer Lingus Holidays.  The report confirmed that the company over a period of years incurred previously unreported trading losses of £7.3 million, of which £3.6 million was incurred in the year ended 31 October, 1989 and £3.7 million in earlier years.  The report also revealed unreported property losses amounting to £2.1 million in the years 1988 and 1989 and unaccounted for property borrowings of some £700,000.</P>
      <P>Having consulted the Attorney General, my predecessor referred the Craig Gardner report on 15 May, 1990 to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> My predecessor issued the following instructions to the Board of Aer Lingus:</P>
    <P>(1) to furnish to him immediately a detailed report on the measures which had been taken to improve the internal system of financial control within the Aer Lingus Group;</P>
    <P>(2) in particular, to satisfy him that there were now adequate controls in place to ensure that irregularities such as occurred in Aer Lingus Holidays could not be repeated anywhere in Aer Lingus or in any of its subsidiaries;</P>
    <P>(3) to take disciplinary action, where appropriate, in the light of the Craig Gardner report and advise him in due course of the action taken;</P>
    <P>(4) to take appropriate civil action, where necessary, and let him know the outcome; and</P>
    <P>(5) to make arrangements for a phased and orderly withdrawal by Aer Lingus Holidays from the tour operating businesss at the end of the season.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, following the submission of the original Garda report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, further investigations have been necessary and these are proceeding with a view as to a decision as to whether there should be criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Besides the question of criminal proceedings, I am aware that Aer Lingus have brought two sets of civil proceedings arising from the affairs of Aer Lingus Holidays, one of them against the former auditors of that company.</P>
    <P>I am advised that any further comment on my part would involve the risk of prejudicing not only any criminal proceedings which may be brought but also those civil proceedings.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the recent announcement by the UK Transport Secretary of the intention to privatise British Rail passenger services by seeking private franchises to operate the various routes, he will give the implications he believes this has for Irish passengers using the various ferry services, such as Cork to Swansea, Rosslare to Pembroke, Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead and other such routes, in the terms of, the availability of throughticketing, the quality of service, the price of the service and the implications for rail freight; whether his Department is keeping a watching brief on the matter; if he has made any representations to the UK authorities on the matter; if he has conferred with ferry operators or other relevant parties on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 20 May 1993, the British Secretary of State for Transport, Mr. John MacGregor, MP, announced plans for the immediate restructuring of British Rail's freight businesses and a timetable for privatisation with the publication of &ldquo;Rail Freight Privatisation &mdash; the Government's Proposals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In a press notice dated 24 May 1993, on plans for franchising BR's passenger rail services, Mr. John MacGregor, MP, set out the likely shape of future rail services across Great Britain.  He was announcing the mix of InterCity, regional and commuter services that will make up the 25 different businesses across the country which BR will now set up as the basis for what will become the privatised railways network.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to speculate on the implications that these outlined plans will have for specific ferry routes.  My Department is monitoring developments and it is my intention to consult with relevant interests including ferry operators.</P>

      <P>The information requested is detailed in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that comparisons between prices and price trends in different countries require care.  This warning is specifically included in the EC Commission's Oil Bulletin Petrolier from which the data has been obtained.  Such comparisons are of limited validity, not only because of fluctuations in exchange <Col N="1316" /> rates, but also because of differences in product quality, in marketing practices, in market structure and the extent to which standard categories of sales are representative of total national sales of a given product.</P>
    <P>In addition, high wholesale and retail margins, high distribution costs and low throughput at retail sites, all combine to increase petroleum product prices in Ireland in comparison with other EC countries.</P>

      <P>I welcome the research published by the Rape Crisis Centre in relation to sexual harassment in the workplace.  It is timely, particularly in so far as it provides some insight into the attitudes of the respondents (Personnel Practitioners) to, the problem of sexual harassment in employment.  I will consider the research carefully.</P>
      <P>I am taking a number of steps in an effort to address this problem.  Arising from consultations with the social partners and the Employment Equality Agency on the implementation of the provision of the EC Recommendation and Code of Practice on the Protection of the Dignity of Women and Men at Work I am satisfied that there is a broad measure of support for the development of an Irish Code of Practice in this area.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have asked the Employment Equality Agency to undertake the preparation of a draft Irish Code in full consultation with the social partners.  The Agency is to report back to me by the end of October.  The Agency provides advice and assistance free of charge to victims of sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>In addition I am, in my current review of Employment Equality legislation examining which legislative provision will best meet the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to introduce improved provisions in relation to sexual harassment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns of female non-consultant hospital doctors in relation to alleged discrimination have been addressed in the report of a group representative of my Department, Comhairle na nOspideal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board which was recently presented to me.</P>
      <P>The group undertook a comprehensive examination of the number and distribution of consultant and non-consultant hospital doctor posts in acute hospitals.  The report recommends a number of strategies designed to achieve an equitable mix and distribution of medical manpower throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am still studying the Group's report and I intend to formally circulate it for discussion to all relevant parties.  In the meantime, I would prefer not to comment on any of the specific recommendations pending completion of the consultation process.</P>

    <P>* May include some private patients.</P>
    <P>The latest information available in my Department indicates that there are 862 people on the public waiting list for elective in-patient orthopaedic surgery at St. Mary's Orthpaedic Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that approval was given to the Southern Health Board by my Department last year to provide new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher.</P>
    <P>A project team has been established and the planning process is underway.  It is anticipated that work on the project will start later this year.  The availability of the new clean air theatre will facilitate a greater throughput of patients.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the £20 million Major Action Programme on Hospital In-Patient Waiting Lists which I launched recently.  The overall aim of this Programme is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in particular problem specialties, including orthopaedic surgery.  The Southern Health <Col N="1326" /> Board will receive substantial funds of £1,736,500 as part of the Programme in respect of an additional 1,370 procedures which includes an additional 640 orthopaedic procedures at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital and Tralee General Hospital.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the target set for additional orthopaedic procedures in the Southern Health Board in 1993 is greater than the number of persons on the waiting list for more than a year.</P>
    <P>I am confident these developments will lead to a substantial improvement in the service for orthopaedic patients in the Southern Health Board area as a whole.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the reaction to the Medical Council's recent statement on ethical guidelines, particularly by members of the medical profession, that the statement is open to different interpretations in respect of whether it would or would not be ethical under the proposed guidelines to terminate a pregnancy in the circumstances set out in the Supreme Court decision in the &ldquo;X Case&rdquo;.  The further statement issued by the Medical Council, following my request that they clarify the matter, does not, in my view, resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in the casualty unit at University College Hospital, Galway. However, the Deputy will appreciate that some delays are an inevitable part of busy casualty departments which have a large throughput of patients.  Each patient must be assessed to determine his/her medical priority, and urgent cases are attended to promptly.  This necessarily means that patients with less urgent conditions will experience some waiting time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that a Joint Working Group comprising of representatives of the Western Health Board and my Department is currently examining the short term development needs of University College Hospital, Galway in the areas of in-patient accommodation, Theatres, X-Ray, and the Accident and Emergency Department, <Col N="1328" /> with a view to recommending an interim development plan for the hospital.</P>

      <P>Everyone, regardless of income, can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of the following conditions:&mdash; mental handicap, mental illness in persons under 16, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.  In addition hospital in-patient and out-patient services are available free of charge to all children suffering from the following conditions:&mdash; mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy.</P>
      <P>General practitioner services and all prescribed drugs are provided free of charge to medical card holders.  Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs <Col N="1329" /> would justify this.  At present almost 36 per cent of the population hold medical cards.</P>
    <P>I have given the matter of granting medical cards to persons with a mental handicap or a disability very careful consideration. While I am of course anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one, I do not think that it is justifiable to grant a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding whether to apply to the court for an order placing a child in its care, a health board must have regard to a wide variety of factors, including the nature of the abuse or neglect, the likelihood of its recurrence, the family circumstances and the possibility of securing the child's safety and welfare without having to take the child into care.  A further important consideration is whether there exists sufficient admissible evidence to satisfy the court that placement in care is justified, having regard to constitutional and legal framework <Col N="1331" /> within which such cases fall to be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has no plans to develop a specific information campaign for second-level schools in relation to breast cancer.  However, the topic of breast cancer is covered as an integaral part of broader cancer prevention programmes which are based on the ten point European Code Against Cancer.  When formulating and devising all school health education programmes, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and the Irish Cancer Society always takes cognisance of these points. This European Code Against Cancer advocates that certain cancers may be avoided if a person refrains from smoking, moderates their consumption of alcoholic drinks and maintains a balanced and sensible diet.</P>
      <P>To this end the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has been involved in the development of a number of initiatives which encourage second-level students to exercise responsibility regarding their health and choose the healthy option.  These initiatives relate generally to lifestyle but also include specific references to cancer relevant areas such as tobacco, alcohol misuse and diet.</P>
      <P>They include the following:</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a) International Conference on Health Education and Cancer Prevention in Schools</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the European Commission's <Col N="1335" /> Europe Against Cancer Prevention Programme, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education hosted an International Conference on Health Education and Cancer Prevention in Schools in Dublin in February 1990. During this conference recommendations emerged as to how the school can encourage and support the individual to adopt a health lifestyle and thus prevent the onset of many of today's lifestyle-related illnesses, particularly cancers.</P>
    <P>In 1991, my Department, together with the Department of Education and the Irish Cancer Society hosted an Irish Conference on Health Education and Cancer Prevention in schools.  This conference was attended by a wide range of teachers interested in the areas of health education.</P>
    <P>Participants at this conference made many recommendations for the promotion of cancer prevention education in schools.  It was recommended that the concept of the Health Promoting School should underpin all aspects of school life. It was also recommended that school programmes should be based on a holistic and healthy lifestyle approach, while acknowledging the progressive need for pupils to know the biological facts related to the onset of diseases such as cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. These programmes should emphasise the key elements of young people's lifestyles which are particularly vulnerable to influence during the pubertal and adolescent period of development.</P>
    <P>Adhering to these recommendations, my Department is currently involved in a number or health education campaigns in second-level schools.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b) The Health Promotion School Network</i>
    </P>
    <P>The pilot phase of this Programme is currently in a development stage and is a joint initiative between the Health Promotion Unit of my Department and the Psychological Service of the Department of Education.  A selection of both primary <Col N="1336" /> and second-level schools have been chosen to participate in the Programme which will look at the impact of such issues as school ethos, attitudes of staff and school environment on the implementation of health promotion initiatives.  The main aim of the Health Promoting School is to foster healthy environments conducive to the promotion of health.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c) Smoking Cessation and Reduction Action Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is a peer-led anti-smoking programme currently at the end of the first year of its two year pilot phase.  It was developed by my Department's Health Promotion Unit as well as the Psychological Service of the Department of Education, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Youth Federation.  It involves training young people in leadership and facilitation skills in order to enable them to work with their peers on reducing the incidence of smoking in their schools. Peer leaders are supported by a teacher who in turn also received training and support from the management team for the Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d) Health is Lookin' Good Health Messages Competition</i>
    </P>
    <P>This year saw the fourth year of this highly successful competition.  Students in all second-level schools were invited to design a t-shirt or alternatively to compile a radio health message on a Healthy Lifestyle theme.  Teachers and students were supplied with relevant health information thus ensuring that all young people might become more aware of the benefits of adhering to a healthy lifestyle.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(e) Dissemination of Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has a wide range of lifestylerelated resource materials available free of charge to the general public.  Teachers are encouraged to avail of this facility and order bulk quantities of materials as required.  Titles include: You, Drink and Your Life; Smoking and Health; and A Guide to Daily Healthy Food Choices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> (f)  Support for Irish Cancer Society Initiatives</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit actively supports and assists the Irish Cancer Society in the implementation of schoolbased programmes.  The Irish Cancer Society produces a magazine entitled &ldquo;Choices&rdquo; which can be used in the classroom as a trigger for discussion on cancer prevention.</P>
    <P>From all of the above the Deputy will acknowledge that my Department is involved in many cancer prevention initiatives.  However, it is my belief that cancer education should not commence at second-level, but should be tackled at an early stage as part of a broad-based social and health education programme in primary school.  For this reason the Health Promotion Unit has been involved in the development of comprehensive primary school health education materials.  One such package is &ldquo;B1 Follain&rdquo; which has been successfully piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board and is now awaiting wider dissemination.</P>
    <P>Consequently I am satisfied that co-operation between my Department and the Department of Education has resulted in the provision of many resources which allow for the area of cancer prevention to receive attention at several stages during any young person's school career.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 140 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In organising school transport services, Bus Éireann plan routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable, while, at the same time, ensuring that vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of trips to schools and, consequently, some pupils may have to wait some time, both morning and evening for their service. Such an arrangement applies in this case and I am satisfied that the standard of service from the Ardara area is on a <Col N="1348" /> par with that available in other areas throughout the country.  In the circumstances, the present arrangement is the most that can be offered.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether national schools in acutely disadvantaged areas with serious discipline problems are adversely affected by the panel system and in some specific instances cannot fill their vacancies until every other school has filled theirs and on the fact that this can influence the quality of the teachers available to them and only serves to compound the schools problems; if she will allow a school (details supplied) in Dublin 1 to advertise a permanent position, in view of this; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>When making a permanent appointment, a Board of Management may select any teacher listed on the panel, and make him/her a firm offer in writing, of the post.  A teacher on the panel must accept the post offered unless s/he can claim an exemption on the grounds that the school making the offer is more than 45km distant from their existing school.  A teacher may not refuse a post on the grounds that s/he does not wish to teach there.  If the teacher refuses the post or does not reply within seven days, the Board of Management should advise my Department immediately.  No further action should be taken by the Board of Management pending contact from my Department.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances my Department will write to the teacher concerned reminding him/her of the obligations placed upon him/her in exercising his/her panel rights and instructing him/her to accept the post within seven days.  If the teacher does not accept the post s/he will forfeit panel rights and be taken off salary in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to schools to fill their vacancies by open competition only if the panel is clear.  In the case of Rutland Street <Col N="1349" /> national school there is a teacher in the school who is currently on the fifth year of a career break and has deferred panel rights.  The school authorities have not as yet been able to ascertain whether this teacher intends to resume in September, 1993.  If the teacher resumes the Board of Management may place her in the vacancy.  However, if the Board are informed that she will not be resuming, the Board should make a firm offer to one of the teachers on the Dublin panel as previously outlined.</P>

      <P>The children of the general area in question are eligible for transport to <Col N="1350" /> either Celbridge or Naas Post-Primary Centres.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by my Department that places are available in these schools for these children.</P>
      <P>However, some parents from the locality wish to send their children to Clane Post-Primary Centre.  They are not eligible for transport to this centre, which is in another catchment area.  Consequently, the most they can be offered by my Department is concessionary transport from the catchment boundary of their appropriate school.  This may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated and that no extra cost is incurred.</P>

    <P>Details of specific projects grant-aided by my Department from national lottery funds are published annually in the Appropriation Accounts.  The 1991 Appropriation Accounts have already been published and the 1992 Appropriation Accounts will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The amount of time required to provide full details of all projects to be funded in 1993 would be inordinate.  I would be glad, however, to provide details of any projects in which the Deputy has a particular interest.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has recently applied for inclusion in the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</P>
      <P>As I have recently announced in the House, I am allocating additional exquota teaching posts to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme with effect from September, 1993.  As part of this arrangement, additional schools will be newly included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>All national schools were recently circularised and invited to apply for inclusion in this allocation.  On the basis of information submitted, schools will be assessed and prioritised in order of need.</P>
      <P>The application submitted by the school mentioned by the Deputy, together with applications received from all the schools that responded to the circular, will be given full consideration in this context.</P>
