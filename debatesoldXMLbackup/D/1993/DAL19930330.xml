      <asker>Mr. J. Bruton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women that women's interests should be properly represented on the NESC.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the recommendation referred to by the Deputy.  I would point out that all the social partners represented on the NESC represent, among their members, both men and women.  This is particularly true of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the National Youth Council of Ireland who represent very large numbers of women. The commission has separately recommended that the social partners should give greater representation to women in their activities and, in accordance with that recommendation, could include more women in their representation in the NESC.  They should consider this particularly because of the five independent members nominated by the Government, two are women, amounting to the 40 per cent representation by women which the commission has generally <Col N="1074" /> recommended as a minimum representation on State boards.</P>
      <P>The present mandate of the NESC falls to be renewed in November 1994 and, in that context, the question of how women's interests might be better represented on the NESC will be considered, in conjunction with the social partners and in the light of the commission's recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that only three of the 26 members of the National Economic and Social Council are women and that only one of the representatives of the social partners is a woman?  Is the Taoiseach willing to consider giving women's organisations direct representation on the NESC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that of the five independent members nominated by the Government two are women and this complies with the 40 per cent recommendation of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The mandate of the National Economic and Social Council will be renewed in 1994 and the question raised by the Deputy will certainly be considered between now and then to see how best representation for women can be effected on the NESC.  It is a matter for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Youth Council of Ireland and other organisations to include more women in their nominations to the NESC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What obstacle is there in the way of the Taoiseach deciding, even in the immediate future, to act on this recommendation of the commission to allow women's representatives to represent women's organisations on the NESC as of the next meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already responded to that question.  I said we will consider ways and means of improving the position between now and 1994 when the mandate comes up for renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the composition <Col N="1075" /> of the National Economic and Social Council has the Taoiseach any proposals in mind to ensure that women who operate in the regions as opposed to Dublin-based women will be represented? Bearing in mind that there are regional development policies at every level, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that this is an ideal opportunity to involve women who are doing great work in the regions but who do not always find their way onto membership of these bodies, and what steps will he take in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Deputy that there are very fine women throughout the regions who make a significant contribution to regional and national development.  I will certainly advocate at every opportunity that those organisations represented on the National Economic and Social Council consider putting forward more women nominations for inclusion on its board. The Government has met its requirements under the recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and we will certainly do everything possible to encourage other organisations to do likewise.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that there is a recommendation in the commission's report that the Government should require nominating bodies to practise a gender balance policy similar to that adopted by the Government in terms of the 40 per cent quota in relation to nominations to State boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already responded in that context.  Certainly, we will advocate to all organisations with representation on the National Economic and Social Council, and other bodies, that they comply with the recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying he is willing to give women direct representation through women's organisations on the National Economic and Social Council before the mandate expires for the existing NESC, or is he saying he will wait until the mandate expires to consider taking action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the various bodies that make nominations to the National Economic and Social Council are independent in their own right.  Is he seriously suggesting that we direct those bodies to withdraw their representation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The family which is recognised by the Constitution is the family founded on marriage.  The question of whether the same recognition might be extended to other relationships or situations is one which requires very careful consideration by the Government because of its far-reaching implications <Col N="1077" /> for marriage and for our society.  It will receive that consideration, and the possibility of the Law Reform Commission being requested by the Attorney General to consider the issues of law involved will form part of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that there will not be an avoidable delay in the examination of this complex matter, which will impinge on the type of society we want.  It will get the urgent consideration it deserves.  I cannot give an exact timetable on it now, but, as I said, there will not be an avoidable delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that this examination of the definition of the family is likely to be undertaken and completed before or after the referendum on divorce?  That is not a question relating to a timetable but to the sequence in which various events could occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The same answer applies.  The examination will be carried out.  It will get the due consideration required because of the complexities of the problems involved.  I am not in a position to add anything further with regard to a timetable or the length of time it would take.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept, given that one in five children born into this State is born into a family which is not based on marriage, that if we are to have a fair and equal society, our Constitution which is the fundamental document through which we are governed should protect those children and those families?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers are informed on taking office of the general principle that they should not engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the duties of their offices.  Ministers are required to draw the attention of the Government to any matter before Government in which they or their family <Col N="1079" /> have a material interest, and not to participate in decision making in the matter unless the Government decides otherwise. These guidelines have been applied by successive administrations over a long number of years and continue to apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider, for instance, that the position of treasurer of Fianna Fáil is incompatible with the position of Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is no more incompatible than the position held by Deputy Richie Ryan as trustee of the Fine Gael Party or by Deputy Ray MacSharry when he was treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This has gone on for a long number of years.  If the Deputy has any views as to why this should change, I will be interested to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the position of treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party involves raising funds from business?  How can the Minister for Finance pretend to be impartial in his decision making as it affects business if he is, on the other hand, seeking money from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what gives rise to this type of question from the Fine Gael Party.  Is it frustration at seeing themselves in Opposition for a long time and the fact that their treasurer might never be Minister for Finance? There is no evidence that any of the people I mentioned failed to discharge their ministerial responsibilities honourably and to the full.  If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary he should let me know.  Otherwise, I can understand his frustration.</P>

      <P>The Government made the Minister for Justice (Agency) Order, 1993, on 9 March last, assigning the duties of the Minister for Justice during her absence to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Other Ministers, in accordance with long established practice, made their own arrangements, as appropriate, for the discharge of their duties while they were abroad on official business.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach may be reluctant to give too much information as he is sensitive about the fact that most of his Cabinet were abroad on St. Patrick's Day.  Can the Taoiseach tell us who had responsibility for the different Ministries while the Ministers were away, in accordance with the Constitution, which requires that arrangements are made according to law to regulate who will discharge functions of particular Ministers while they are abroad?</P>

      <P>It is a long standing practice that Ministers go abroad on business from time to time.  The Deputy knows what arrangements apply and that there are specific arrangements in <Col N="1082" /> relation to the Minister for Justice. Deputy Garret FitzGerald in 1984 went abroad with a number of Ministers and Ministers of State.  From the weekly questioning by Deputy O'Keeffe one would think this was a new phenomenon.  Does the Deputy forget the time when his own party was in Government?  The people outside know what the Deputy is trying to do.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree, without any disrespect to the members of the Judiciary, that most judges come from a privileged background and live in parts of the city and the country which are not areas of serious conflict and problems and, therefore, are not acutely aware of the problems people face and are not equipped to deal with problem of vandalism?

      <P>I would not agree that judges come from privileged backgrounds.  All of us are aware that many of them are former solicitors who have an intimate knowledge of their districts and have been dealing with people at all levels within the society in which they operated as solicitors.  Secondly, getting lay members of the public to act in a judicial fashion would create certain constitutional difficulties which, I am sure, the Deputy is well aware of.  A number of Articles in our Constitution deal with the courts, in particular Articles 34 to 37.  Article 35.3 states clearly that no judge can be in receipt of any payment, other than the payment received as a member of the Judiciary.  If we were to incorporate the practice in Northern Ireland and in the UK in relation to lay magistrates the Constitution would have to be changed to allow them to retain their ordinary employment.</P>

Will the Minister agree that judges tend to be if not of the Dublin 4 postal district certainly of the Dublin 4 <Col N="1085" /> type?  I am not talking about the higher courts where a high level of knowledge of the law is required but of the lower courts where they simply do not understand the pressures people are under resulting from acts of vandalism perpetrated against them in the communities in which they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 51 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Apart from the number of judges currently sitting, there are two issues here &mdash; first the method whereby individuals are selected for membership of the Judiciry and, second, the training provided for those who join the Bench.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with these separately but it is appropriate first to acknowledge the context in which the questions arise. They arise against a background where certain court decisions have given rise to public unease.  While it is understandable that such questions should arise at this time, I think it necessary to make the point that the number of court decisions which give cause for public concern is quite small &mdash; for every decision of this kind there are thousands which are delivered without controversy or any cause for controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also necessary, I believe, to make the point that there is no guarantee that different selection methods &mdash; or indeed training courses &mdash; for judges would guarantee an end to controversial <Col N="1088" /> decisions.  People in all walks of life, even those who have been through the most rigorous training and selection processes, make decisions from time to time with which others strongly disagree.</P>
    <P>Judicial appointments are, in accordance with the Constitution, made by the President on the advice of the Government. The Constitution also provides that the terms of appointment of judges shall be regulated by legislation.  The relevant legislation does not provide for any outside agency to assess candidates for appointment to the Bench and I have no proposals at present for the introduction of amending legislation which would provide for such assessment.</P>
    <P>Our system of recruitment to the Judiciary is based on the idea of bringing in people who are experienced and trained practitioners.  The formal qualification required for appointment as a District Court judge is not less than ten years practice as a barrister or solicitor; for appointment to the Circuit Court, it is ten years practice as a barrister and for appointment to the Supreme Court and High Court, 12 years practice as a barrister.  To become a barrister or solicitor in the first place requires successful completion of a course of study laid down by the qualifying authorities.  The periods of practice prescribed are the minimum and most persons appointed have considerably more experience.</P>
    <P>Although the emphasis is on the need to select people who have the necessary legal qualifications, the Government &mdash; all Governments &mdash; also naturally take account of the suitability generally of the individuals recommended for appointment. No Government will advise the President to appoint somebody who is manifestly unsuitable for Judicial office. Some who are recommended for appointment subsequently make controversial decisions but, as I say, there is no guarantee that this would be avoided simply by changing the selection method.</P>
    <P>As regards training courses for judges, the scope for the exercise by me of initiatives in this area is quite limited having regard to the constitutional independence of the Judiciary.  I am of course <Col N="1089" /> aware of suggestions to the effect that legal training and expertise, which, as I have explained, is a precondition to appointment in all cases, is not enough and that specialists in other fields should have an input to judicial training.  I know that the Judiciary are also aware of these suggestions and I wish to confirm that I am certainly willing to assist in any way I can with initiatives which the Judiciary may wish to bring forward now or in the future in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are 17 High Court judges, including the President of the High Court, and 18 Circuit Court judges, including the President of the Circuit Court, serving at present.</P>
    <P>A review of the activity levels in the High and Circuit Courts, to assess the impact on those courts of the alteration in the court jurisdiction levels introduced by the Courts Act, 1991, is almost completed.  When I have the full findings of the review before me, I will be in a position to recommend any reallocation of resources which may be warranted to the Government.  Comment by me on the numbers of judges required in each court, in advance of the completion of the review, would be inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's long reply, she has not answered my question, the reason for which was not, as she suggested, recent controversial decisions or that I believe in the necessity for training judges.  However, I asked the Minister if she agrees that there is an urgent need for more judges because it takes one and a half to two years for a case to reach the Circuit Court and two years or more or reach the High Court. I accept that some Circuit Court judges work very late and have a better record than others but it is a disgrace that civil actions take so long to come to trial.  That is why there is an urgent need for more judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also agree that it is necessary to change the criteria in regard to the appointment of solicitors?  It is wrong that solicitors can be appointed only as District Court judges.  There are <Col N="1090" /> outstanding solicitors and, therefore, the prohibition in the Courts Act, 1936, should be removed so that solicitors can be appointed to the higher courts on a case by case basis.  Given the difficulties experienced by the Law Society recently and the professional way in which it handled those difficulties, will the Minister consider, as a symbolic gesture to solicitors who have done outstanding work, removing the prohibition and appointing a solicitor to the Circuit Court and the High Court in the foreseeable future?  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.  Has she received a submission from the Law Society in this regard and, if so, has she considered it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The delays in regard to the hearing of civil actions which the Deputy mentioned are not always court related.  In many cases, particularly in the case of personal injury, they are not proceeded with or, indeed, are adjourned at the request of the legal team on one side or the other.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Harney's view in regard to the appointment of solicitors.  The Law Society recently sent a submission to my Department in relation to the appointment of solicitors to the courts and I will be taking that into consideration.</P>

      <Quest>her views on claims that a disco hall (details supplied) in Dublin 1 is used as a major distribution centre for the illegal drug ecstasy between 1.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. at weekends which is outside the opening hours provided for under licence, that the gardaí have no powers to force its closure and so curtail the drug distribution and that three other disco halls (details supplied) are also used as drug distribution centres.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, makes provision for the licensing, control and supervision of places used for public dancing. Under this Act, persons who wish to use premises for public use <Col N="1091" /> as a nighclub or a discotheque or to hold public dances, or to operate a dance hall, ballroom or nightclub, must apply to the courts for a public dancing licence in advance.  These licences are renewable on an annual basis, unless revoked or surrendered earlier.  The 1935 Act also provides that no place, whether licensed or not licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor, should be used for public dancing unless a public dancing licence granted under this Act is in force.  The use of a place for public dancing without such a licence is a breach of the legislation.  Furthermore, if intoxicating liquor is sold on such premises they must be licensed for this purpose.  The 1935 Act also provides that any member of the Garda Síochána or any other person may appear in court and &ldquo;be heard in opposition to such application and may adduce evidence in support of such opposition&rdquo;.  The Deputy will appreciate that the issuing and revoking of such licences is, however, a matter for the courts.  They are independent in their functions and are subject only to the law and the Constitution.</P>
      <P>All the premises referred to by the Deputy are very closely monitored by the Garda Síochána.  Where there is evidence of breaches of any of the conditions set out in the licences or of any criminal activity all appropriate action, including prosecutions where appropriate, is taken.  The Garda have also brought a significant number of charges against persons using these premises and as some of these charges are pending I am constrained in discussing these matters further.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have carried out an extensive investigation into one of the premises referred to by the Deputy which does not seem to apply to the courts for a public dancing licence.  A file in relation to these premises has been prepared by the Garda and has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are very alert to the dangers of the drug known as &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; which first appeared in Ireland in 1991.  I am, however, informed by the <Col N="1092" /> Garda authorities that there is no evidence of large scale abuse of this drug. A number of measures have been taken by the Garda authorities to counter the use of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; including the monitoring and surveillance of events which attract a teenage following and where substances of this kind may be available.  For obvious reasons I cannot give details to the House of specific locations and events which are the subject of such surveillance and monitoring as to do so would adversely affect Garda operations.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorites that these measures are proving effective and have resulted in a number of charges and seizures being made in connection with the possession and use of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware drug offending is treated very seriously by the Garda authorities and drug enforcement is a priority.  The drug situation in Dublin and elsewhere in the country is monitored continuously.  All strategies adopted by the Garda to deal with the problem are the subject of ongoing review so that the problem is dealt with as effectively and efficiently as possible.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the problem of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; abuse can be dealt with effectively as part of their ongoing strategy for dealing with the drug problem in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the urgency of this question was brought home very forcibly by the news this morning of the tragic death of a young man carrying some 300 &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; tables internally and that this means of concealment is all to common and presents a particular difficulty to gardaí? Will she further agree that this is a rapidly growing problem, not alone in Dublin but in Cork and many other parts of the country?  Huge profits are being made from the distribution of this drug and major criminal and buisness interests are involved.  One distribution network has been established in the dance and disco halls which I have brought to the Minister's attention and, without updating the law, the Garda are unable to act effectively by closing halls operating outside the terms of their licence.  The proprietors <Col N="1093" /> of such halls are fully aware of the powerlessness of the Garda and the inadequacy of the existing law.</P>

      <P>I explained to the Deputy in my reply that the Garda have been monitoring closely each of the locations which the Deputy mentioned in his question and I am not in a position to give him the information he requires in regard to a number of those places because of ongoing prosecutions.  The Deputy is probably also aware, in relation to the other venues he mentioned, that prosecutions have taken place successfully and that the Garda, in monitoring each of those premises, are careful to put together a case in relation to prosecutions where necessary.  I agree with the Deputy that the leaseholders or the owners of such premises have a huge responsibility to society and to those who frequent their premises to ensure that no illegal activity is carried out on their premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that under their licence, the halls and clubs in question should close and dancing should cease at 1 a.m. but that this requirement is ignored by the proprietors and that the premises remain open and dancing continues until 5 a.m. or later, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays? Large quantities of the drug `ecstasy' have already been seized by the Garda but the after-hours opening continues specifically for the purpose of drug distribution and the penalty for failure to comply with the licensing regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputy for all the information he has given, but I think he is aware that this information is also available to the Garda.  As I said in regard to two of the cases &mdash; the two about which I think the Deputy is most concerned &mdash; in one case a file had been prepared by the Garda and is now with the Director of Public Prosecution for a decision.  In the second case the Garda acted immediately where the premises was found to be in breach of the licence given by the courts.  This is important because, as the Deputy knows, there have been cases where the Garda have gone to court, objected to licences being given to premises but regarding which a decision was made by the court which went against the Garda recommendation.  Neither the Garda nor the Minister for Justice has any control over this.  It is important to realise that the Judiciary has independence in this regard, and I do not think Deputy Gregory or I would want to interfere with that.</P>

      <Quest>if a decision was taken by the previous Government to the effect that the cost of maintaining courthouse accommodation in Ireland would henceforth be defrayed from central funds rather than as a charge on the rates as is provided for under section 13 of the Courthouses (Provisions and Maintenance) Act, 1935; and, if so, the sums, if any, which have been provided from central funds since that decision was taken.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1990 the Government decided that local authorities should be relieved of the financial burden of providing and maintaining courthouses and that the cost should in future be borne by the Exchequer subject to a limit to be agreed annually between <Col N="1096" /> the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>A sum of £3.2 million was provided for this purpose in the 1991 Estimates.  This provision was reduced to £1 million in the Financial Review of July 1991.  A sum of £1.25 million was provided for each of the years 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>Because of budgetary constraints, it has not been possible to defray the costs incurred by local authorities in maintaining courthouses and the capital building programme for courthouses has been restricted to those areas where need was greatest.</P>
      <P>A number of courthouses throughout the country require renovation.  Because of the limited availability of financial resources, priorities are being established in my Department between the different premises requiring attention.  Progress has not been as rapid as I would like it to be but I am confident that the next few years will see substantial improvement in the standard of court accommodation throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the facilities in courthouses are an absolute disgrace, unlike the facilities in most Garda stations which, thankfully, are among the best in Europe?  The vociferous campaign pursued by the Garda Síochána ten-15 years ago has borne fruit.  Similar provisions have not been made for courthouse accommodation. Even basic facilities are not available in courthouses.  Will he agree that this is unacceptable?  Will he further agree that where a facility cannot be made available in a courthouse, some consultant facility should be provided for litigants and their legal representatives so that they do not have to continue to meet in the backs of cars outside courthouses, etc., which happens in many cases at present?  Finally, will he agree that £1.25 million will not do much to solve the problem given the very bad existing conditions? Does he have any estimate of what it might cost to bring our courtroom accommodation up to the standard which is normal throughout the rest of Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, judging by the number of requests in the Department, expenditure of £12 million would be required to improve courtroom facilities. With regard to the other parts of the Deputy's question, much of the courthouse accommodation badly needs to be upgraded.  Nobody will deny this.  Part of the problem arises from the fact that many of these courthouses were built during the last century &mdash; this has certainly exacerbated the problem.  With regard to the Deputy's point that £1.2 million is inadequate to deal with the problem, of course we would like to have more money to spend on courthouses but this is the amount which has been voted by the Government.  I would remind Deputy Harney that the decision taken in 1990 which restricted the initial allocation from £3.2 million to £1 million was taken by a Cabinet which included two members of her party.  This might be another example of the so-called &ldquo;12 to two votes&rdquo;, but my information is otherwise. The Cabinet at the time, which included Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy, decided, first, that the obligation should be shifted to the Central Exchequer &mdash; I agree with that decision &mdash; and that, second, they could not meet the obligation imposed on them by that decision.  I am sure that their intentions were good and that they intended to proceed as quickly as possible along the line of full Exchequer funding for these purposes. That was the intention of the Government which included Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley, and it is also the intention of this Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not feel precluded by the constitutional decision in relation to confidentiality in that he has given me details of Cabinet decisions?  I was not trying to exonerate members of my party or to make a political partisan statement about this matter.  Successive Governments over a long number of years have not regarded the administration of justice in our courthouse accommodation as a priority.  Will the Minister agree that the recent very <Col N="1098" /> expensive renovations at, for example, Letterkenny courthouse, were not sufficient? Apparently it has now been found that the jury room is not soundproof. Will he agree that when changes of this kind are being made at great expense to the taxpayer they should be appropriate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, changes of that nature will be a priority in any future building or refurbishment programmes carried out by the Department of Justice. The Government believes that the sum of £1.25 million which will be provided in 1993 will be sufficient to allow us to proceed with the Cork and Galway projects.

      <P>I wish to make a point which has been brought to my attention by legal practitioners.  If a jury is asked to be removed from the court because the judge and counsel wish to discuss a certain point, the intention is that the jury would not be able to hear that discussion. Therefore, a soundproof room must be provided.  Despite the modern renovations at Letterkenny courthouse it does not have a soundproof room.

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the extra arrangements, if any, she intends to put in place in order to ensure that visitors to this country, especially during the high tourist season are not subjected to robberies, physical attacks, car break-ins and other abuses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of course concerned that visitors to this country should be subjected to criminal attacks.  Tourists in any country may be vulnerable to attack, and indeed <Col N="1100" /> while in many countries the risks are far greater than they are here, this does not take from the abhorrence with which we view the problem or lessen our determination to prevent such attacks occurring.  This country has a reputation for friendliness and a tradition of hospitality which is world renowned.  It is unacceptable that a tiny minority of people should undermine the reputation of the Irish people by cowardly attacks on people they perceive as soft targets. I, therefore, fully support the Garda and the tourist interests in their efforts to ensure that tourists to this country are afforded as much protection as possible.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities and Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests have in recent years established a very close and effective system of liaison which ensures that all aspects of the problem of attacks on tourists are examined and co-ordinated and a programme of measures are drawn up annually to deal with the problem.  A meeting to discuss the 1993 season has already taken place between the Garda authorities and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The Garda measures include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, both uniformed and plainclothes, during the summer months to areas frequented by tourists and the provision and distribution of an information leaflet which contains practical advice on how visitors to this country can protect their property and personal belongings.  In addition, all Garda patrols particularly those in areas of high tourist interest are encouraged to be alert to the problem and the topic is also covered extensively in Garda inservice training programmes.  Gardaí are encouraged to avail themselves of language training courses to enable them to be of assistance to visitors and foreign language training courses are provided at the Garda Training College, Templemore. In addition, the Garda office in O'Connell Street serves as a centre for advising tourists to Dublin on preventative measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been calls <Col N="1101" /> from time to time for the speedier processing by the courts of cases involving tourists.  This matter has been carefully considered and special provisions in this regard were included in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  These provisions allow a tourist who is the victim of a crime to make an immediate statement before a district judge.  This statement may be used as evidence without the necessity for the victim to attend the subsequent trial.  The Act also provides that the victim may give evidence from abroad by live television link.</P>
    <P>I am confident that everything that can be done is being done to deal with this problem.  The matter will however continue to be kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the positive tone of the Minister's reply.  However, would she agree that Dublin is now becoming the black spot of Europe from the point of view of attacks on tourists? Is she aware that 75 per cent of crime against tourists are committed in the greater Dublin area and that the figures, for this year, I understand, would be in the region of 1,200?  Will the Minister clarify the system of producing affidavits in court?  As I understand it, affidavits are not permissible at the moment under Irish law and plaintiffs must be present to deliver their evidence <i>viva voce.</i> A major problem is the perpetration of crime by young offenders.  Is the Minister aware that in many cases the offenders opt for trial by judge and jury and that it is about eight months before those cases are taken, by which time the victim will have lost interest in the case?  Finally, could the court system be improved so that the offenders are brought to justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that Dublin is becoming one of <Col N="1102" /> the black spots in relation to attacks on tourists.  Very many of us who have travelled abroad from time to time for holidays and other reasons have been the victims of crimes committed against us. It would be unfortunate if the relative minority of young people that the Deputy talks about who are responsible for these attacks on tourists were to damage Ireland's reputation as a welcoming, warm and friendly country.  I know that Bord Fáilte works in very close collaboration with the Garda to ensure that every measure possible is put in place to prevent such attacks taking place.</P>
      <P>In relation to the way in which we prosecute such people, the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, was a huge step forward in that it allowed for the victim to make an immediate statement to a district judge which then could be used in the subsequent court case and also allowed for a live television link-up during the prosecution of such a case in court.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dublin, the Garda station in O'Connell Street is very valuable for both the gardaí and tourists, most of whom come through O'Connell Street if they come to Dublin.  They can avail of the opportunity to visit a Garda station and be advised by the gardaí in relation to difficulties that they, or any of us as tourists in any country in the world, might encounter from time to time.</P>

      <P>This is not just a problem for tourists but for many locals in Dublin.  I had the experience last night of having my windscreen broken while stopped at a traffic light at a spot where, I have since been given to understand, this is a regular occurrence.  In the light of the Minister's response to the question, is she in a position to ensure that there are additional Garda patrols, given the discussion we had here on the Criminal Justice Bill when I quoted the <i>Garda Review</i> figures in relation to the number of gardaí?  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said at the time that I was incorrect in quoting the <i>Garda Review,</i> which indicated that the numbers of gardaí had gone down over the past 20 years.  Is it true that the numbers of gardaí have in fact gone down?  If so, does the Minister intend to rectify this situation so that she will be in a position to have these additional Garda patrols which are necessary, particularly in the black spots that I mentioned?</P>

      <P>Two points arise in relation to the replies given by the Minister.  It is all very well to make a deposition before a district justice. However, many of these cases depend on visual identification and that involves bringing the accuser into the presence of the other person.  Would the Minister agree that that is a problem?  In my experience, one of the tactics used by people convicted on a summary basis is to prolong the agony by appealing the case to the Circuit Court.  Would the <Col N="1104" /> Minister agree that it is essential that there should be an almost immediate rehearing in the Circuit Court where a tourist is to be inconvenienced by being brought back?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate that, if there is to be some form of consultative process between her Department and the Judiciary in relation to sentencing, an intimation that severe sentencing in these cases is in the public interest?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in areas where there is a considerable concentration of tourists, video surveillance is one of the possible ways of discouraging assaults?  I am thinking of the major thoroughfares of this city where tourists are such easy prey to pickpockets and muggers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, we already have video surveillance in operation in the greater Dublin area and it is certainly proving very effective. Visual identification is, of course, a problem, but I think Deputy McDowell would have to agree that the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, was a major step forward. Perhaps it is something we need to look at.  In relation to appeals to the Circuit Court, I would agree that if possible those hearings should take place almost immediately.  There is a question on sentencing policy later on.</P>

I would ask the Minister to be very cautious in her discussions with Bord Fáilte and they, in turn, with Aer Lingus and the other carriers into Ireland.  I would not like to give a false impression about the nature of the country which could be very damaging.  One might think one was going into a war zone if one heard an announcement from the airline to be careful.  I accept the points made by Deputy Deenihan but we do need to be careful.</P>

That operation is fairly well known and has been very helpful to the Garda Síochána from time to time.  I agree with Deputy Harney that any information to be given out to tourists coming into the country would have to be dealt with sensitively.  I pay tribute to the efforts made by Bord Fáilte and the Garda Síochána to treat the issue sensitively. I have no doubt that the airlines and the ferry operators will be prepared to handle the matter in the same way.</P>

      <P>To my knowledge, no.  The only aspect to which I would refer the Deputy is a recent report of the Tourism Task Force, which recommended that the feasibility of establishing casinos should be fully investigated.  The Department of Tourism and Trade has consulted my Department in this matter.  My Department is consulting the Garda Síochána at present and a reply is awaited.  When the issue was most recently mooted, in 1987-88, the Garda Síochána was consulted and was very much opposed to the introduction of casinos.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's general reply.  I gather from the way in which he has replied that his answer to the question is in the negative. I share the Minister's views.  Would the Minister confirm that the most socially deprived are most vulnerable and suffer most from the operation of casinos?  It should be remembered that the machines are pre-set and are merely profit spinners for a tiny number of people.  Would the Minister make sure that any feasibility study carried out takes into account the views of social workers and others who would deal with the social aspects and the consequences of the issuing of more licences?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Mitchell will know, the local authority in Dublin rescinded an earlier decision taken under Part III of the 1956 gaming and lotteries legislation to allow gaming to take place in the area covered by the local authority. I understand that there have been several appeals to the courts against the local authority decision and that one of the factors being raised in the appeals is that the meeting at which it was decided to <Col N="1107" /> rescind the earlier decision was not properly called.  Of course, those who have made appeals are continuing to operate their machines while the appeals are pending.  In other areas recourse has been had to the courts by people trying to stay in operation after a date on which they should have closed down.  It may be that consideration has to be given to amending the legislation passed in 1956 and 1986 with a view to the imposition of greater controls to ensure that the legislation we have is properly enforced.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which came into operation on 5 June 1992 enables the Garda Síochána, subject to certain conditions, to obtain bodily samples from persons suspected of certain types of serious offences for the purpose of forensic testing, including DNA profiling. I have given my full backing to the introduction of DNA profiling in this country and plans are well advanced in <Col N="1108" /> the forensic science laboratory for the early introduction of this technique.</P>
      <P>The laboratory has been provided with the necessary specialised equipment at a cost of over £100,000.  In addition, two molecular biologists have been recruited and trained in the specific techniques of DNA profiling for criminal work as well as having been trained as forensic scientists. Extra accommodation has been provided and converted for use by the laboratory.  The Deputy will appreciate that DNA profiling is an extremely involved and complex procedure and a painstaking system of preparatory work must be completed before the technique is put into operation.  I am informed that it is hoped that this work wil be finalised and the technique introduced into the forensic science laboratory in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her very helpful reply and for indications that progress is going apace.  Does the Minister know that at present when a DNA test is carried out a sample has to go to Britain under the constant supervision of a member of the Garda Síochána, who has to stay in Britain overnight and return with it?  This procedure came to my attention in relation to a murder case in my constituency for which such evidence was considered vital.  This is surely a very inadequate way to conduct business in view of the shortage of gardaí and, presumably, the increasing need for such evidence.  Does the Minister have an expected commencement date for the provision of this service in Ireland?</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell's question is very detailed, the detailed information sought in the question about individual court districts and areas is not available from central records and could be compiled only by the reallocation of scarce staff resources from other, more important tasks, which would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>However, I can inform the House that the expenditure on the purchase, rental and maintenance of computer equipment, software and related items for all courts in each of the last five years was as follows: 1988, £163,628; 1989, £263,611; 1990, £220,415; 1991, £157,595; 1992, £191,704.</P>
      <P>Computerisation of court offices is vital to a modern and efficient court service. While it is true that financial constraints have limited funds available for the purpose in the past, I am pleased to inform the House that I have secured a large increase in the moneys to be spent on information technology in the courts this year.  The sum involved is £304,000, and this represents an increase of almost 60 per cent on last year's figure.  This money will be used to purchase equipment and suitable software and also to replace outdated equipment in the courts.</P>
      <P>A major computer training programme for courts personnel is just concluding and it is hoped that this will ensure that computer systems installed in court offices are used to their full potential.</P>
      <P>In the past few years considerable progress has been made in the computerisation of the work of the District, Circuit and High Courts.  I am committed to using the resources available to me to ensure the expansion of computerisation of the various court offices in 1993.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know that at present all High Court orders, for instance, are issued in handwriting, which involves huge delays and means that people are not able to use precedents, which would be so much easier if there were access to technology such as wordprocessors?  What recent progress has been made in putting the judgments of the superior courts on to a computer base and has that effected a speeding up of judgments?  Would the Minister also indicate whether it is proposed to give any assistance to judges to tighten up their judgments and so on and whether he is satisfied with the current arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I might outline for Deputy McDowell what happened recently. Among the measures adopted is the computerisation of the central office of the High Court which is now at the testing stage.  The introduction of a case tracking system for Circuit Court offices has been installed in three offices to date and is under evaluation in others.  A family law accounts package has been made available to the Dublin Metropolitan District Court Family Law Office and an automatic office system to provide post-court documents, such as fines, notices and warrants is being introduced in Dundalk, Galway, Killarney, Kilkenny, Listowel, Monaghan, Naas, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Trim, Tralee, Tullamore and Waterford District Court offices.  The networking of all local probate offices to the central office in the Four Courts is almost complete.  Work on replacing the computer system in the Metropolitan District Court and Limerick District Court is under way.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question about assistance to judges &mdash; this may not be strictly relevant to this question &mdash; we are taking steps to provide some research assistance to judges.  In relation to secretarial assistance, I am prepared to examine that position.  We will be talking to a number of people about it and I will communicate with the Deputy on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that this area is rather chaotic at present, for example, in that all the listings are carried out manually?  While we are all good at telling outside interests how they should conduct their businesses more efficiently would he agree that we need to ensure that the courts are operated and managed more efficiently?  Furthermore, would he agree that if basic computers were made available to all courts, including the District Court listings could be undertaken by computer and that cases that could be settled earlier and could be weeded out?  Would he agree that we could log developments in cases, so that there would not be the need for witnesses, sometimes from abroad, to sit around for days without a precise idea when their case might be reached?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the figure he announced earlier, less than £1 million over five or six years, is grossly inadequate since it took more than £40 million to computerise part of the Department of Health approximately ten years ago?  Therefore, £1 million for work on our courts is grossly inadequate; we need to do much more.  For example, Naas Court is only now getting a word processor.  Computerisation would be cost-efficient because the most expensive way of doing anything nowadays is manually and also the most inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I agree that improvements need to be made.  I should say it is not a figure of £1 million once off.  As I indicated earlier, we have been spending money on this over the years. For example, we increased the allocation this year by 60 per cent, which I do not think too bad in straitened financial times.  We intend to continue doing so. However, I might point out to Deputy Harney that computer consultants were commissioned in 1992 to prepare a technical plan for the extension of computerised office information systems in all branches of the courts.  I will be implementing that plan as quickly as possible.  I am also monitoring developments in courts in other jurisdictions with a view to ensuring that the best possible <Col N="1112" /> computer facilities are made available to our courts.  For the benefit of the House I will outline the court offices which have access to information technology.  The High Court offices concerned include the central office, the Wards of Court office, the office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, the Examiners Office, the Probate Office, the office of the General Solicitor for Wards of Court.  In Circuit Court offices all but three have word processing equipment and the remainder will be equipped later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments referred to are inaccurate and unfair.  They are inaccurate because they take no account of a range of services provided to those in custody including medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare, work/training and education.  They <Col N="1115" /> are unfair because they denigrate the excellent work done, day-by-day, by prison staff, doctors, psychiatrists, welfare officers, work trainers and teachers who put so much valuable work into caring for those in custody.  Those working within the prison system operate on the basis that it is their duty not just to contain prisoners in custody until lawful release but also to help them to cope with their sentences, to develop their abilities and skills and to lead them towards a constructive life in the community on release.</P>
      <P>Presumably what is at issue here is the provision of special treatment programmes for prisoners convicted of sex offences.  In approaching this topic we have to be very realistic about what is and what is not achievable.  I know of no prison administration which has devised a treatment programme which will guarantee that sex offenders who participate will not repeat offences on release.  There appears to be a number of different approaches aimed at reducing recidivism but no one programme stands out as offering exceptionally good results.  The task is to evaluate what is available and, if practicable apply it to our situation.</P>
      <P>In fact, since last year a small specialist group in my Department has been carrying out a feasibility study of what may be available by way of a treatment programme which is practical, achievable, sustainable and open to evaluation.  I understand that the group's work is almost finished and that I may expect to have their reports in a week or two.  When I have assessed the group's recommendations I will make a further announcement.  I should like to emphasise again that while this study is in progress, prisoners continue to have access to a range of services including medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare, training and education on an individual basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Private Notice Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I agree that there has been much confusion created in various circles concerning the proposals received last Wednesday, 24 March in relation to the State's shareholding in Greencore plc.  I indicated last Wednesday, following expiry of the three week period allowed for the submission of proposals, that I had received two written offers to acquire the State's shares in Greencore; namely, ADM and Irish Life.  In relation to these proposals, I stated, and I am quoting my statement of that evening word for word:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ADM reaffirmed its interest in purchasing a stake in the Company and stated that at a minimum, its participation must exceed 25 per cent on a fully diluted basis.  Irish Life offered to purchase two million shares, conditional <Col N="1119" /> on the Government selling at least 20 million shares to purchasers including Irish Life.</P>
    <P>This statement would appear to have been misinterpreted in various quarters and speculation on the content of the ADM proposal even extended to an offer price being mentioned in some circles.</P>
    <P>On radio yesterday Mr. Allen Andreas, the ADM Vice-President and Chief Executive in Europe said, and again I quote word for word:</P>
    <P>It would appear that the newspapers reported as if there is a difference (between us) I personally do not feel that there is any difference.  I think that everything the Minister has said is consistent with my understanding of what the facts are with respect to this transaction.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Yates, the apparent contradiction between myself and ADM is entirely apparent and not real and ADM have not rejected but rather reaffirmed their interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates will be aware that under the Articles of Association of Greencore plc no one shareholder may hold more than a 15 per cent stake.  Any alteration of this limitation requires the prior consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as holder of the special share and the passing of a special resolution by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of the company.  The Deputy is reported to have suggested that the limitation on shareholding should be increased to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers it is mandatory for any person who acquires 30 per cent or more of a listed company to make a bid for the company on the same terms.  For this reason an increase in the limitation on shareholding up to 29.9 per cent is an option which I and the Government will be considering.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded by the golden share in this, and in all other respects, will remain fully in place irrespective of <Col N="1120" /> whatever decision is taken in relation to the State's shareholding.</P>
    <P>The Government's consideration of the proposals will take account of the recommendations of the Culliton report on the food industry and in particular the recommendation that the Irish food industry's performance could be significantly improved by a greater and selective involvement in the industry by multinational food companies with access to market and best industry practices. The report also recommended joint ventures and partnership arrangements with Irish food firms.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, as I have already explained to the House, I met Mr. Andreas on one occasion on 17 February this year, and I have not been in contact since then.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Malley, I do not believe that the confusion evident in certain circles will in any way damage Greencore and I can assure the House that the Government will complete their examination of options and reach a decision as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the statement made by Mr. Andreas is an attempt at <i>post hoc</i> justification on the Minister's part and that the attempted sale of the State's shares has been well and truly botched?  Will the Minister agree that serious damage has been caused to the interests of the State by mishandling this affair, that this is likely to have been caused by the divisions between the two parties in Government which are now being exploited by ADM and that Greencore will have no option but to do business with ADM on their terms?  If the Minister cannot even efficiently sell off the State's property, is it not time that he looked at the only honourable route now open to him?</P>

Whatever decision the Government takes will be implemented by Greencore and the Government will make that decision as soon as possible. In regard to what was said yesterday, Mr. <Col N="1121" /> Andreas and I are in agreement.  The Deputy is correct, however, when he says that some people, including himself, are trying to botch the deal but the Government will not allow this to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister now acknowledges that there was a misinterpretation why did he not take steps on Wednesday, Thursday or before the weekend to rectify and correct this given that the newspapers gave very detailed figures in regard to the value of the bid and the number of shares to be bought? Will he now accept that the reason he did not was that he wanted to create a bogus deadline of 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday last to exclude others from re-entering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because if there was no firm bid there was no deadline?  It suited him to exclude at least one Irish consortium because he and the management of Greencore wanted ADM only to buy the shareholding.  Did the Minister give his consent to the issue of a letter by management to the employees of Greencore that any Irish bid would, in effect, be hostile, therefore making such a bid impossible?  Did he know in advance about this and approve it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last question first.  I did not know about the issue of the letter.  The first I knew was when I heard about it through the media on the morning it was sent out.  There is no reason Greencore plc should consult me about any letter it would send to its staff, although I stated publicly afterwards I did not feel that letter was helpful.  In radio interviews on both Thursday and Friday I clarified that we were not talking about a bid but an offer. ADM had made it very clear that it saw a major difference between an offer and a bid.  When reaffirming its interest, ADM stated quite clearly it never got involved in auctions or bids.  Last week I made it <Col N="1122" /> clear in the Chamber that we were talking about expressions of interests.</P>
      <P>In response to the question on other Irish institutions, I am not too sure to which institution the Deputy referred but the position is that when this story broke two Irish companies asked for time, one company needed until Friday and the other until the following Wednesday to make a decision.  The first company had a board meeting on Thursday last and communicated to the Government and the Department of Finance in writing and verbally that it had considered the matter but had no further interest.  It made it absolutely clear it did not want to be involved in a hostile bid or take-over. The other Irish consortium was less clear. It stated it required a week but at the end of the period said it needed more time as it had not organised the money but wished to try to put a bid together.  When it was reminded, as everybody was, that the deadline was 5 p.m. on Friday last, it told us we would hear from it, but at 5.55 p.m. rang and said it was still interested. The following morning we received a letter from a financial institution, which did not purport who it was representing but we subsequently found out it was the Irish consortium.  It was to give further details but they still have not been given. However, if it puts forward a proposal, I will bring it to Government with any other suggestions.  The two Irish consortia were given every opportunity to make a decision.</P>
      <P>Let me make it abundantly clear there are no difficulties good, bad or indifferent between Mr. Andreas and me.  My statement of last week was factually correct. There never was a bid.  I did not ask for a bid.  As soon as the deliberations are concluded I will bring the full matter to Government for final consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the context in which we are speaking there is no difference between a bid and an offer for shares and that he is simply confusing the already confused matter by trying to make such a distinction? The newspapers reported in <Col N="1123" /> some detail last week a particular bid being made for shares.  The Minister said he gave two interviews, why did he not avail of the opportunity to contradict what was in the newspaper reports which went in to such details that they even included the price?  Why did he refer in his reply to the fact that the Government would be prepared to consider an offer for up to 29.9 per cent of the shareholding, which is an even larger share of this company and would give rise to more concern and on whose part does he see a shareholding of 29.9 per cent?  Finally, on what authority, expressed or implied, did the Greencore management seek a potential purchaser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question last week in the Chamber.  It did so on its own authority.  It is quite within their powers as a public limited company to seek proposals that are in its best strategic interest and then to put such proposals to the Government.  It is then up to the Government to decide in favour or against such proposals.  The distinction drawn between a bid and an offer was made by Mr. Andreas and not by me.  In his letter to the Government stockbrokers he expressed his indications of interest in the purchase of its shareholding in the company and reaffirmed ADM's position, which was expressed to me at the meeting of 17 February to purchase 29.9 per cent of the shares.  It is well documented policy of the ADM company &mdash; this has since been brought to my attention &mdash; not to get involved in bids but to put forward proposals and then negotiate from that position.  I think only one newspaper report mentioned a price per share and all the other newspapers' reports interpreted correctly what I has said; what Mr. Davy, who is acting for the Department of Finance in this matter said and what Mr. Andreas said.  Only one newspaper article I saw mentioned share prices and while I responded to that in a radio interview I did not pursue it any further as I did not believe there was any necessity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, Sir.  Is the Minister saying that he expressly approves of the decision of the Greencore management to tout the State's property in order to get purchasers without either the knowledge or the agreement of the Government?  Does he not admit that because of the botch made of this the proposed sale of our share holding should be called off?  Will he agree that, in keeping with the thrust of the Culliton report, we should retain it as a strategic interest in what has the capacity to be a major indigenous food company which can expand and create jobs in the Irish economy?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he is still open to offers from either of the Irish consortia.  Does he agree that such an offer is impossible as long as Greencore plc considers it a hostile bid because effectively it would have to acquire total control of Greencore to make it effective and this would cost some £200 million? What steps does he propose to take to allow an Irish bid so that the management and board of Greencore would not consider it a hostile bid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be difficulties. Deputy Yates is right in saying that some of those involved in putting forward proposals did not want to become involved in a hostile bid.  In fairness, however, Greencore plc has done an excellent job in difficult circumstances over the past few years.  It <Col N="1125" /> has sought the areas it believes to be of strategic advantage to it, particularly milling and malt, because it has reached its maximum potential in flour and sugar quotas.  No such proposals have come before the Government.  Only one Irish company said it did not want to get involved in a hostile bid; it discussed the matter with Greencore and came to its own conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the confusion that surrounds the proposed sale of these shares, does the Minister accept that he should meet the Greencore management before any further statements are issued to decide on a strategy for the sale of these shares?  In a very definitive way the Minister stated in the Chamber that he will decide who may purchase these shares; will he accept that the management should decide who is a suitable partner in the strategic interests of the company and who should purchase the shares?  The Minister is wrong to assert that he alone will make that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill which provides for the construction of the gas interconnector from the UK, from Scotland to Ireland.  The interconnector is very important because it will augment the gas being supplied by the Kinsale Head field which came on stream in 1978 and is nearing the end of its life.  It will provide security of supply to existing domestic, industrial, commercial and horticultural users and also for power generation.  Second, the interconnector should encourage a greater level of exploration for further gas finds as any promoter will have available to him markets not only in the Republic but in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and in Europe.  In relation to the security of supply, at present we have one pipeline from the Kinsale Head field, coming through Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Clonmel, and other areas where supply is available, to Dundalk.  A scenario too dreadful to contemplate is that in the case of sabotage or an accident serious disruption would be caused to domestic, industrial and horticultural areas.  It is vital that we have an alternative supply to the Kinsale Head field.  The interconnector will remove the threat of disruption that we face at present.</P>
      <P>The pipeline should encourage exploration. We want to see the greatest level of exploration of our own territory, both inland and offshore.  It is vitally important that we have terms and agreements that encourage exploration.  This pipeline will allow an alternative source of supply to the Irish market of 3.5 million people and will encourage any potential investors in exploration on the basis that they will have available to them an interconnector to a vast market beyond our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole exploration area has been <Col N="1262" /> dogged down the years by inadequate exploration terms.  I recall going into the Department of Energy as Minister in 1987 and finding the ludicrous situation that Marathon had not been allowed inside the door of the Department for many years by my predecessor.  Following negotiations, as they were our only suppliers, I encouraged them in every way possible and in 1988 they agreed an extensive programme and entered into new contracts.  Promoters can be encouraged to engage in exploration. Also in 1991 there was agreement that seven wells would be drilled over a five-year period.  The Finance Act, 1992, is designed to attract extra exploration here.  The interconnector project, costing in the region of £290 million, will help greatly to encourage exploration and give a greater sense of security of supply to those using gas in Ireland.  I welcome the provisions of this Bill which will extend the borrowing requirement, for capital purposes, of BGÉ to £350 million, thus facilitating the construction of the interconnector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the expenditure of £290 million, I am disappointed that only £20 million of that contract will have an Irish content.  I understand that the laying of an interconnector pipe under the sea is very specialised work but at the same time an Irish content of £20 million is a very small sum.  It brings up a general point, which it is no harm to raise at this stage about which I would encourage the Government to be very careful.  We have heard much about the £8 billion we are to secure from the European Community in Structural Funds over the next number of years.  The intention is that the £8 billion will be used to upgrade our infrastructure and to help to provide long term jobs, but it should also provide short term jobs in the construction phases of many of these projects.</P>
    <P>I have been disappointed to learn of two different projects in the past week which are using extensive public funding. One is the restoration of the B&amp;I vessel in the docks where much of the work is being done by a UK contractor using UK registered vans and workers.  I realise <Col N="1263" /> Irish workers have been well received in the UK in the past and of that I make no criticism, but at a time when we have an unemployment rate of 300,000 it behoves all State and semi-State sectors to ensure that the contracts are given, as far as possible, to Irish contractors using Irish workers and components.  It is vital that we tackle the unemployment problem. One way this can be done is through our use of Structural Funds and public contracts.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, to ensure that contracts which are open to public tender and to European tender, on the basis of their scale in many cases, remain with Irish contractors.  I want to ensure that not only are Irish contractors appointed but that professional teams of architects, engineers, structural engineers and all the various support staffs are Irish so that we can use this money, a once-off windfall, to get the greatest number of Irish jobs from any of these contracts.</P>
    <P>As we expand our economy, the interconnector will play a significant role in meeting our increased energy demands. At present, the potential demand is 3 billion cubic metres and is expected to grow to 4 billion cubic metres by the year 2000 and to 5 billion cubic metres during the next 20 years.  Gas is a clean, versatile and competitive fuel, transported by pipeline, available on tap, and requiring no storage.  It is vitally important to us as a fuel.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate BGÉ on what they have achieved during the past number of years.  They are a model operation.  In 1991 they declared a profit of £24.9 million on a turnover of £165.6 million and surrendered £31 million in dividends to the State.  They have 195,000 customers.  They represent 17 per cent of our primary energy demands and there are 22,500 new central heating customers per annum.  They are doing an excellent job in connecting gas to non-gas housing estates.  I compliment and encourage them to continue this work.  The use of natural gas has <Col N="1264" /> resulted in savings to date of over £2 billion in our bill for imported fuels.  BGÉ have paid in excess of £300 million to the State over a number of years and they should be complimented on what they have done.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Energy when Bord Gáis Éireann took over from Dublin Gas in 1987 and proceeded to take over other city and town gas supplies in the following years.  The success of BGÉ in securing thousands of new customers every year is based on the fact that they concentrated on a safety mandate I gave them in 1987.  When we came into office in 1987 approximately 800 holes per week were being dug in the streets of our city by Dublin Gas which was under examination by Mr. Somers at that time.  There were horrendous accidents and, unfortunately, safety was not a top priority. When I nationalised Dublin Gas and BGÉ took over responsibility I set it the task of coming to grips with the safety factor.  Dublin Gas used manufactured as distinct from natural gas, the composition of natural gas affected the various seals in the pipes causing serious problems. We all remember the position in the city at that time.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann rose to the challenge and I compliment it on its achievements. It has done a superb job which is reflected in the fact that it acquires 22,500 new central heating customers per annum and the demand in every housing estate to provide a gas facility.  Residents' associations and householders generally in my area of north Dublin want natural gas extended to their estates.  I compliment BGÉ and wish it well in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this project which has made it possible to bring gas onshore and the extension of the gas grid to Dundalk, a decision made by the Government in 1987.  The gas grid can be extended from Ballough in north Dublin to Drummaney in Loughshinny and from there to the United Kingdom.  A number of routes were considered by the Department before deciding on the Scottish one. There are some local concerns about that <Col N="1265" /> route, but in general, people welcome the proposals and the fact that natural gas will be available for our horticulture sector.  I would encourage greater expansion of gas at reduced rates to the horticulture sector so that horticulturalists can compete with their competitors in Holland and Spain.  It is important that the pipeline goes ahead.  I ask the Minister to also ensure that farmers affected by the pipeline will be adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>Construction standards are vital. There is some local concern in Loughshinny in regard to leakages from valves. The proposed pipeline will have a safety valve onshore at Loughshinny, but I would like the Minister's view on the possibility of having this valve placed offshore instead.  However, I do not know if that is technically feasible.  I do not want the Minister to give the exact details of the security arrangements for the protection of the pipeline but will he assure me that adequate security arrangements are in place for its protection from sabotage? This is causing some concern locally.</P>
    <P>This project will change people's lifestyles in Loughshinny, a quiet fishing village which has expanded in recent years by people working at Dublin airport and in the city setting up home there.  It is a delightful place to live and, as good corporate citizens, BGÉ should be involved with the community.  The pipeline comes onshore at a very historical location.  BGÉ has done a great job on a park at its headquarters in Cork and it should be encouraged by the Minister to get involved in similar projects in the Loughshinny area.  I am aware that it has set aside a small sum of £10,000 or £15,000 for pathway work in the area but that is a pittance in the overall contract of £290 million.  A number of projects need to be carried out in the Loughshinny area, for example, cliff walks and proper restoration of Drummona.  Such projects would cost BGÉ very little but would mean a great deal to the residents of the area whose lifestyles are being disrupted by this project.</P>
    <P>The gas pipeline will be a major boost <Col N="1266" /> to our economy.  I would encourage the Minister to re-enter negotiations with the ESB to ensure that it becomes a full partner in this project.  It is regrettable that, as our other major energy supplier, it is not involved at present.  Bad relations in recent months may have prevented such involvement but it would be in the national interest to encourage the ESB to get involved in this project with Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation, there has been general agreement from all sides of the House and with the Whips that we all welcome it.  Nevertheless, it is essential that it gets the approval of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible because the work outlined in the legislation, which makes it necessary in the first place, has started and is due for completion at the end of this year.  Some people doubt if Bord Gáis Éireann has the legislative power to work outside the jurisdiction on this project.  Legislation will have to be introduced to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>If we want to be outward looking and get involved in a Europe where there are no barriers or borders, it is essential that Bord Gáis is legally empowered to construct and operate pipelines outside this jurisdiction.  The Bill provides for an increase in BGÉ's borrowing powers from £170 million to £350 million.  This is necessary for the construction of the Ireland-UK gas interconnector, as it is called in the business.  It also provides for an increase in the limit on State guarantees of BGÉ borrowings from £80 million to £190 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of north County Dublin will be the initial beneficiaries of the interconnector.  Deputy Burke identified the benefits which can accrue to an area which has within its boundaries a tremendous natural resource such as gas.  The State undertook to reorganise the previous gas company and set up An Bord Gáis with the specific function and direction of improving the supply of natural gas throughout the country.  Until recently, most of that gas came from Cork.  The pipeline winds its way from <Col N="1267" /> Cork, through Munster and the midlands to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Concern was expreseed by the previous speaker about the need for sensitivity both in environmental and economic terms in areas where the pipeline has been developed.  Work on the construction of the gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin was undertaken expeditiously and with a degree of concern for rural Ireland and the rights of property and landowners.  There were intensive negotiations, debate and consensus in regard to compensation for landowners and a measure of agreement was reached to everybody's satisfaction. Anyone who traces the pipeline from Dublin, through the midlands and Munster to Cork will find that it has blended into the countryside.  One can say without contradiction that, apart from the construction period, there was little disturbance caused to the countryside in the construction of the pipeline.</P>
    <P>This pipeline also meant that towns in rural Ireland could benefit from a supply of natural gas.  In this regard the administrative capital of my constituency, Clonmel, is a case in point.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, a former Minister for Energy, was directly involved in the decision to approve the extension of the line to Clonmel. Clonmel Corporation took over the function of the gas producing corporation which, of course had used coal to generate gas.  The industries which have used this tremendous commodity have benefited enormously.  One need only look at the balance sheets of some of these companies to see how they have benefited from using natural gas.  Examples of this can be seen throughout the town of Clonmel.  The magnificently successful company, Tipperary Crystal, which is located halfway between Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel, has also benefited enormously from using natural gas.  The company, which has a major energy requirement, was almost unable to meet the prohibitive ESB charges.  If it were not for the advent of natural gas it is possible that that company would not be <Col N="1268" /> as successful as it is today.  The company is world famous for its wonderful crystal products.  The availability of natural gas has played a major role in ensuring the viability of Tipperary Crystal.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act gave Bord Gáis permission to extend its facilities to other areas.  In this context I should like to refer to the needs of towns which are located near the main pipeline.  We agreed at the time to extend the pipeline to Limerick city.  The spur from Mitchelstown to Limerick city passes near the town of Tipperary which is in my constituency.  The co-operative movement has indentified a need to extend the spur to Tipperary town.  In view of the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, all the changes in GATT and the attitude of the French to GATT, the co-operative movement knows that if it is to survive it, like other industries, will need to be able to avail of natural gas.  I suggest to the Minister that additional powers should be given to Bord Gáis to extend the pipeline into towns like Tipperary so that industries such as Tambrands of Ireland, ATARI Ireland Limited etc., can benefit from lower costs.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate when dealing with this legislation to commend Bord Gáis on its past achievements and its efforts to service the needs of industry and housing estates where the availability of natural gas was, in the past, beyond the wildest dreams of people.  Gas is a magnificent, environmentally friendly energy source, and one of which we should be proud. We have a certain knowledge about the time span of our existing gas fields.  In the context of a Single European Market, co-operation between nations and the elimination of borders throughout Europe and Ireland, the construction of this interconnector is an example of co-operation between two sovereign states.  I believe Members on all sides of the House will commend the construction of this pipeline for that reason and urge the Minister to proceed with all haste in enacting this legislation.  This Bill will give Bord Gáis statutory power to work inside and outside this jurisdiction.  This tremendous project is estimated to cost <Col N="1269" /> £300 million.  Construction on the interconnector has already begun and is due to be completed at the end of the year. Agreement has been reached between the Whips that we will be as forthcoming as possible in facilitating the speedy enactment of this legislation.  I fully support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome the fact that Bord Gáis are in the process of constructing a pipeline to connect us to gas supplies in the UK and in that context I welcome the Bill. However, I have some problems with it.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with its being brought forward out of the context of an overall energy policy.  It is well beyond time for the Department of Energy and the responsible Minister to come forward with an energy policy for the whole island instead of approaching it on a piecemeal basis, in effect carrying out the bidding of the major agencies who are charged with the supply of energy rather than having any overall policy directive that is identifiable as a Government policy in this respect.</P>
      <P>I also have a problem with the conditions in the Bill in respect of the borrowing to enable the capital to be put in place to pay for the construction work and, in particular, the levels of guarantees being requested from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to praise Bord Gáis for all the good work they have done over the years.  They certainly are a good company, a profitable company; they have added to the growth of the economy and to the facilities available for householders in terms of domestic energy supply, and central heating facilities and they have been of benefit to industry and to horticulture.  Pipelines extend extensively now since the first pipeline was constructed to bring the gas ashore from Kinsale Head field.  Deputy Ferris waxed lyrical about how the pipeline meananders through Munster and into Leinster and eventually gets to Dublin.  Bord Gáis had some difficulties taking over the clapped out facilities in the old town and <Col N="1270" /> city gas systems but they have done that effectively and should be complimented on now being a modern efficient supply company.  I wish them success.  They are also profitable and the profits are returned to the Exchequer periodically.</P>
    <P>This concept of linking into the UK gas system is quite clearly dictated, on the one hand, by the fear that the gas supplies at Kinsale will run out and, on the other hand, by the hope that as the pipeline goes in both directions we might be successful in exploration activity and be in a position to sell gas to the British mainland or even further afield if we were lucky enough to strike it rich between now and the end of the decade.  Be that as it may, it is certainly worth doing.  There is no point in having a very expensive facility for the distribution of gas around the country if there is no gas available after a certain point.  I would like the Minister to quantify, if he can, the life that is left in the Kinsale field at present draw down rates.  In this respect also I would like the Minister to comment on the efficacy of the new exploration provisions brought in by Deputy Molloy when he was Minister for Energy but presented to these Houses by way of amendment to the last Finance Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.  Very extensive amendments to the law governing the issue of licensing and explorations were introduced in June of last year and, so far as I can see, they have had little or no effect despite the optimistic prognosis about further exploration activity which they would generate.  I would like now, almost a year after the first announcement of the Minister's intent, if the Minister of State could give us an indication of how the new provisions were received by the industry and if they are likely to give rise to any activity in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, puts beyond doubt the issue of whether Bord Gáis has the right to construct the pipeline.  Any legal question should be put beyond doubt.  I have some concern about it, even though it is a minor enough Bill in a statutory context, and is underpinning a major infrastructural project.  In particular I have a <Col N="1271" /> problem with section 3.  I would like the Minister of State to explain again for us why he considers it necessary at this point to introduce a section which will allow conditions, which apply to Bord Gáis now, to apply in future times to another party or to any subsequent transfers.  Is this simply a piece of legal belt and braces engineering or is there an intent that the pipeline, or part of the pipeline, would be transferred to another agency?  Is there, on the one hand, an intent that the pipeline would be controlled, for example, by another commercial State body so that Bord Gáis would not have a total monopoly of supply of gas on the island?  The same question arises when we talk about an ESB interconnector. Bord Gáis now has a monopoly of Kinsale gas.  At the time when Kinsale gas and UK gas are both running into the economy, there will be a strong case to be made that the one commercial State agency should not have control over the two and that, in effect, there should be price competition put in place so that the consumers, whether they are commercial or industrial, will benefit.  The Minister would be familiar with this proposition and with the case that is being made in other countries that if there is an interconnector, if there is a pipeline bringing in foreign gas, the monopolistic supplier should not be given the monopoly control of the imported gas and that it would be impossible to have price competition if people had a choice as to whether to buy domestic or foreign gas.</P>
    <P>If this is not the intention of the section, will the Minister explain what he has in mind?  Is he thinking that sometime Bord Gáis will be privatised?  Is he thinking of a situation where the pipeline would be under the joint control of the British and Irish Governments?  Is he thinking of a situation where there would be some selling off of the assets of Bord Gáis?  What exactly has he got in mind? How is he going to answer the question that will be put again when arrangements are in place for an ESB interconnector? Will the monopoly State agency be given the monopoly over the delivery of the <Col N="1272" /> outside energy source as well as the domestic energy source?  If so, how does the Minister propose to get any element of price competition operating in the whole area of energy?</P>
    <P>The second area where I have a problem is on the level of State guarantees being sought here.  I can understand a situation where absolute State guarantees will be sought for borrowing, but that is not the case here.  Section 4 provides for an increase in the borrowing powers of Bord Gáis from an existing level of £170 million to £350 million.  This is fair enough if this is the amount of capital that is necessary.  However, section 5 provides for an increase in the limit of State guarantees on the borrowings from the existing level of £80 million to £190 million. I would like the Minister to justify the figures.</P>
    <P>Why does a profitable company like Bord Gáis need State guarantees at all for extra borrowing?  It is quite clear it needed them at the start because it had no profits, it needed the guarantee of the State to put in the original infrastructure. However, it is one of the big boys now; it is up and running and is returning very big profits to the Exchequer on an annual basis.  I cannot see why State guarantees have to be further extended at this point. If the Minister says they have, would he try to justify the exact provision here? Why guarantee £190 million and not £350 million?  Why guarantee £190 million and not £250 million?  Why guarantee £190 million and not £100 million?</P>
    <P>Now that Bord Gáis has become profitable, why not reduce the element of State guarantees?  Does a company like Bord Gáis need a State guarantee? Until the mid-eighties State guarantees were the norm, for all activity, even in commercial State activities that were profitable, but State guarantees should not be the norm now.  If a commercial State company is making a profit, is run efficiently on commercial grounds and is not carrying out a particular social mandate, which is the case with Bord Gáis, surely there is no necessity for a State guarantee?  I should like the Minister to justify State guarantees in prinicple and <Col N="1273" /> then to jusify the amount of guarantee being sought under section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke made an important point when he spoke about making sure that there was a significant Irish element in the construction work.  The Deputy quoted figures suggesting that the Irish element would not be significant and that the benefit to the economy in terms of jobs or investment in industrial firms would be small in relation to the total cost.  I had correspondence with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Molloy, when he was Minister for Energy, concerning the case of a firm in my constituency that had tendered to import the pipes from the United Kingdom, which would subsequently be laid to provide the interconnector. The pipeline contract required that the pipes would be provided to a certain quality and specification and delivered on site.  Therefore, the submissions made by the firm in my constituency was not entertained.  There was no opportunity for the involvement of an Irish transport company.  In that instance, one in which a significant number of jobs could have been provided, Irish companies were ruled out.  It is my understanding that the total contract went to a United Kingdom company.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure &mdash; if I am using the correct term &mdash; to be in east Germany in the first week of October.  It is recognised that that part of the Federal Republic of Germany is in an economic shambles, whole towns have closed down.  One striking aspect is that even though the east German Mark was given an exchange rate on a par with that of the former west German Mark and as a consequence pensions and all other social welfare payments are paid in the harder currency, money only stays in east Germany for about 48 hours.  What goes into east Germany in salaries and social welfare payments immediately goes out of the economy in west German or imported consumer goods.  Certainly the money has left the east German economy within a week and has little or no effect on that economy.  I am concerned that in the expenditure of the £8 billion Cohesion <Col N="1274" /> and Structural Funds expected in the next seven years something similar might happen.  If Ireland is involved in vast infrastructural projects for which contracts are offered on a European wide basis and overseas contractors come in, providing materials from overseas and expertise in design and construction, many of the benefits of the Structural and Cohesion Funds will not be retained domestically but will flow through the tender system to overseas contractors. The matter at issue here is a case in point.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state whether the figures given by Deputy Burke are correct and whether the investment stimulus to the Irish economy for the expenditure of £350 million, the capital sought and which, I presume, approximates the borrowing requirements, including the cost of laying the new pipeline, is as small as the Deputy outlined. It would be facile to think that the construction of major infrastructural works in this country would provide jobs and stimulate the economy if the providers of the infrastructure were basically overseas firms.  This issue has not been raised to any great extent in the past, for the simple reason that Ireland was always in a position to ensure that eligibility to tender was confined to Irish nationals.  The Minister will probably recall the water scheme in County Louth in which pipe specification became an issue before the European courts and the Irish Government lost the case.  From that point on, it was clear that the Government could no longer operate as it had done historically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The case referred to was taken by an Irish company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is correct.  Ireland has a free market and private companies cannot be prevented from seeking recourse to the adjudication process in Europe.  The fact that it was an Irish company which took the case to the European courts only reinforces the point I made.  That issue is no longer one for the courts.  Since 1 January, with the establishment of the free market and the various directives that govern matters <Col N="1275" /> such as that to which I referred, it has been a requirement for contracts to be offered on a European wide basis.  I remember the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, saying some weeks ago that the delay in the construction of the Tallaght Hospital was due to the fact that the tender had to be put out on a European wide basis.  I ask the Minister to examine the figures involved in this project, the first big one to come up under the regulations of the free market.  A major investment is being made by the State through Bord Gáis and I imagine that European funds will be used.  I should like the Minister to take account of the amount that will be spent in the Irish economy.  Very little can be done at this stage in relation to this project but maybe general lessons could be drawn from this experience.  However, one has to be optimistic and I hope that if exploration proceeds and a major gas find is again struck the gas will flow in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point concerns the Minister and his colleagues and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It would be economic lunacy for the authorities in Northern Ireland to proceed with the construction of another gas pipeline from Scotland into Northern Ireland.  I had the great pleasure of being on the negotiating committee when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was negotiated.  It was always intended that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would go beyond the realm of high politics and would also have a social and economic impact.  Will the Minister state whether the issue of supplying gas to Northern Ireland from the interconnector coming into north County Dublin has been put on the agenda for the Anglo-Irish Conferences? Has that matter been put on the agenda for any of the conference meetings by the Tánaiste since the change of Government?  Was it put on the agenda of any conference meeting before the change of Government by the former Minister, Deputy Molloy, who frequently attended the conference meetings? On Thursday this House will debate Northern Ireland and many Deputies will <Col N="1276" /> express their views.  I have no doubt that I shall agree with many of the views put forward because there is no huge divergence in the House on this issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to something that is not about the high politics of a thirty-two county Ireland but the idea of a single economy for the island.  It is well worth considering what the Government could do through the economic Ministers to provide a single all-island economy.  The provision of infrastructure is obviously one factor to be taken into consideration. What a great difference there would be if Belfast and Dublin were within an hour and a quarter of each other by road, which is the length of time that journey should take if there were a proper motorway between those two great cities.  The construction of a motorway between Belfast and Dublin would do more for the economic and physical unity of this country than much of the &ldquo;grá mo chroí&rdquo; talk by the &ldquo;wrap the green flag round me&rdquo; brigade.  North County Dublin is only a stone's throw from the Border and if gas is to be brought into north County Dublin it would be eminently sensible to lay the pipes north of the Border.  The pipeline is already designed to go as far as Dundalk and if the source is secure and there is no longer reliance on Kinsale there is no reason that the pipeline could not be used to provide gas to Northern Ireland.  I also cannot understand why arrangements with the ESB are not in place, if we brought in electricity from the United Kingdom &mdash; and I understand that a decision has been taken in principle to do so &mdash; electricity would be fed into an all-island grid rather than into a Republic of Ireland grid, with power being drawn down right across the island as required.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that in parts of Donegal and in some other Border counties electricity could be provided from Northern Ireland much less expensively than from here.  I understand that some arrangements are about to be put in place to supply electricity to parts of Donegal from the other side of the Border.  That would be a form of lunacy if we have an electrical interconnector, <Col N="1277" /> either along the lines of the gas pipeline, which I do not believe is feasible, but more likely across into Wexford, which could be fed into the national grid, now defined as a 32 county grid.  I should like the Minister to comment on this when replying.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that people who talk most about the unity of this country always have to be involved in high politics and can never do small little things that would unite people on a day-to-day basis.  While this is an aside, I hope you will forgive me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for pointing out that if you live in Dundalk and work in Newry, when your tax is adjusted for your Southern domicile you cannot obtain either a PAYE or PRSI allowance. Yet the patriots of our land will stand over this position.  I put this matter to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, a Fianna Fáil Member of this House, a representative of the Republican Party.  He still cannot do anything about it.  I cannot understand the mentality which says: we are for 32 county Ireland, but if you live in the South and work in the North we are going to penalise you; you will not get either a PAYE or PRSI allowance.  That is the kind of daftness underpinning policy in this country.  I hope it will not be extended in here as well so that for some kind of partitionist reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Of course it is a viable thing to do.  It obtains only because of a piece of bureaucratic nonsense.  There is no good reason whatever for not changing it.  I hope the same kind of idiosyncrasy will not be applied to the gas line so that when United Kingdom <Col N="1278" /> gas becomes available in Dublin it will suddenly be transmuted into green, Republican gas and that it will not be acceptable in Northern Ireland; or that when it comes across from Scotland into Northern Ireland it will be transmuted into orange gas so that we will not be able to use it down here.  This is what the Anglo-Irish Agreement was about &mdash; that there would be agreement between the two sovereign Governments whereby all issues in which there was a joint interest could be discussed.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to put this on the table, to ask his colleagues in Government, particularly the Tánaiste, to place this on the agenda.  The Minister will be aware that there were talks in the past about the supply of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland.  At that time a viable economic proposition, acceptable to the British Government and the people of Northern Ireland, was not feasible despite the best efforts of the people down here.  I contend it would be feasible now in conjunction with the interconnector. I should like the Minister to make every effort to place this on the agenda.</P>
      <P>Otherwise this Bill will prove to have been merely another great illustration of the process toward Dáil reform.  We should remember if we vote against this Bill that the pipeline is at present under construction.  Therefore, it is hardly viable for any Members of the Opposition here to endeavour to stop it when it is half constructed, when it is out to tender.  The pipes have been ordered and, I presume, some are being laid.  In addition I presume the on-shore stations on both sides are well on their way to being constructed.  Therefore, we are back to the pretence that this House is irrelevant to what happens in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that a Bill like this, which puts forward the issue of whether Bord Gáis has power at all to construct this pipeline, which allows the conditions being applied to Bord Gáis to be applied to any other owner of the pipeline subsequently, a Bill which raises the amount of capital Bord Gáis can borrow and <Col N="1279" /> which changes the amount of borrowings on the part of Bord Gáis to be guaranteed by the State &mdash; it is extraordinary that it should be introduced at a time when we are faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>, which means in effect that we have no say in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be afforded an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  With the development of the natural gas industry here it was inevitable that such a Bill would be introduced in this House.  To date it has been impossible for Bord Gáis to undertake work outside this State, the provisions of section 2 of this Bill will render such an undertaking possible.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that this project will cost in the region of £290 million.  That money will have been well spent if this investment is translated into a better, more reliable and cheaper form of natural gas in the future, whether coloured green, white or gold.</P>
      <P>I a familiar with the development of the industry here since the first natural gas was piped to this country in the early seventies via the Aghada power station in my constituency.  The Marathon company had acquired exploration rights and at that time considered selling natural gas in the greater Cork area.  However, in 1974, with the assistance of the Government of the day, some pipelines were extended to the new ammonia plant being built by Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta, the State fertiliser company, at Cobh as well as to the two ESB power stations in the Cork area.  I contend there is no reason natural gas should not be extended to the towns of Cobh, including the dockyard, as well as to Midleton, Youghal, Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy since the pipeline is located in that area and the people of the region could enjoy the benefits of natural gas at a cheap rate.  Indeed its supply should be extended to every other town nationwide. The extension of the operations of Bord Gáis outside this State should be carefully controlled and monitored at all times for the benefit of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome also the proposed project in that anything that can reduce the difficulties of our peripherality &mdash; a word very much in vogue at present &mdash; will have a lasting, worthwhile impact on our economic life. It is welcome that this project should be undertaken as a general principle <i>vis-a-vis</i> the resources needed to drive the engines of industry and maintain a reasonable level of supply in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>We are aware, to our cost in recent years, of the difficulties experienced through our being now the only country within the EC without a land link to the Continent.  This is always an important matter debated at numerous conferences in terms of our transport, telecommunications and energy costs. Within the context of this interconnector being put in place, at least we shall be able to maintain a guaranteed level of supply in the future, being linked into the European gas grid.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless this gives rise to a number of questions many Members have raised in the course of this debate with regard to who will be responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the gas nationwide.  With regard to both electricity and gas supplies, competition is badly needed in the marketplace.  I do not at all subscribe to the view that monopolies, whether obtaining in the private or public sector, represent a healthy way of conducting business. Indeed, all of the proof available from any industry we care to examine points to the fact that when competition enters in by and large it leads to greater efficiency, cost controls and more dynamic development of the business concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distribution network of gas and electricity should legitimately remain under State control but I believe there is room for competition from various sources in regard to access to the distribution grid.  However, I have seen no mention of that possibility in the Minister's remarks.  Given the lack of a clear statement from the Department of Transport, <Col N="1281" /> Energy and Communications I wonder what policy is being developed. It would be wise &mdash; this would be welcomed by industry in general &mdash; to enunciate a clear long term policy now.  One hopes that there will be other offshore gas finds and, consequently, other suppliers of gas to the system.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding who will control the gas supplies to this country through the interconnector, would we not be wise to look at the possibility of introducing competition in the market place?  This is not to suggest &mdash; I want to make this clear &mdash; that one should rush out to privatise Bord Gáis Éireann to achieve this; it could remain a State company.  However it could be forced to compete with other companies, if the distribution network was separated from the supply end of the business.  I am not necessarily saying that because a State company has a monopoly the only way to solve the problem is to privatise that State company.  I do not necessarily hold that view but what I am looking for is competition between the different companies that could contribute to the wellbeing of industry in this country.  I am disappointed that no policy has been enunciated in this area.  Experience in other countries clearly shows that where competition exists the consumer, particularly major commercial and industrial consumers, can benefit.</P>
    <P>There is much scope to get Irish industry to convert to natural gas.  Now that they can see that the supply of gas will be consistent and can be guaranteed into the future because of the interconnector we should encourage other industries to switch to natural gas, that is if there will be competition within the sector because competition will have a bearing on the cost of gas.  However, because there is a monopoly in existence one is left to the whims of one supplier which controls the market.  This is not a healthy way in which to develop a natural resource such as gas.</P>
    <P>I also note that there is going to be an electricity interconnector.  I welcome this.  However, having regard to the number of people and the equipment that will be available on site in constructing the gas interconnector would it be possible <Col N="1282" /> to undertake both projects in tandem?  Perhaps there is a sound reason this cannot be done but it strikes me that it would be a possibility having regard to the expertise that will be available on site in constructing one interconnector. Perhaps the reason is that one could not have a major electricity power line running alongside a major gas line, nevertheless, given modern technology and systems, this may be possible if some thought is given to it.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond to this point.  Given that resources are scarce there is no question but that there is duplication in this area.</P>
    <P>I rose specifically &mdash; Deputy Noonan dealt with this question succinctly &mdash; to deal with the question of separate economic developments in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  I attended a conference organised by the CII, as it was then known, within the last 18 months to two years when they spoke at length about the contacts that had been made with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  They clearly identified the need for cohesive economic development on the two parts of the island.  They argued that this would contribute far more than all of the words spoken by politicians to the process of finding a solution to the many difficulties that exist between the two countries on this island.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the European Community is supporting two projects involving two interconnectors to a small island &mdash; I presume that they will be located within 100 miles of each other. Surely, this will lead to more artificial economic barriers being created when clearly it is unnecessary to do so.  As I said, it is extraordinary that such a decision would be made for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Although there has been a fall-off in trade during the past decade are people not aware that much business is carried on on a daily basis between the North and South which is of vital importance? The new Europort in my constituency in Waterford is a case in point.  It is expected that there will be substantial traffic on the rail network to that port having regard to <Col N="1283" /> the fact that the most efficient and cost effective way of transporting goods to Europe is to use that port.  This is happening because business people can sit around the table without being hampered by politicians, can see the logic in economic development and do not have any of the political &ldquo;hang-ups&rdquo; or baggage which seems to accompany such developments.</P>
    <P>I understand that we are to have an interconnector to Northern Ireland and another to the South.  This is economic madness.  I do not understand why there cannot be two connections off the one pipeline.  It is extraordinary that this should occur, there is no logic to it other than political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps, but it is unacceptable and school-boyish in the extreme.  We are creating further economic barriers, unnecessarily, to co-operation between both parts of this island.  If work has not commenced on the other interconnector, and I do not believe it has, I urge the Governments involved and our own in particular to reconsider this matter as it is not necessary to have a second interconnector. That would be a welcome step forward for all those who live on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the question of State guarantees.  My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, has tabled a number of amendments in this regard.  It strikes me that it has not dawned on the banking institutes in this country and externally, in particular the European Investment Bank, that there is an economic basis to any project which may be undertaken in this country.  The banking institutions involved will take the simplistic approach, that there will be State guarantees. That is the simple way for them to issue the funding required, using the State as a guarantor in regard to any debts that may be incurred.  At present the State guarantees must be on the table before the banking institutions or investment <Col N="1284" /> companies look at the viability of a project.  Change is long overdue.  The banking institutions, not alone in this country but outside it as well have had it too easy.  We need to change direction and I urge the Government to do so.  I want to be very careful in the words I use, but because the lender has no concern about the use of the funding &mdash; his money is guaranteed anyway &mdash; a more diligent investigation of the viability of the project is not necessary.  I am not suggesting for one moment this has or is happening, but that possibility exists.  No matter what the borrower does with the money, it is safe, as the Government has given a guarantee.  That principle has existed for some time but it has to be seriously considered.  I have no doubt that the BGÉ project is viable.  It is a commercially successful company and I applaud it for that.  On merit it deserves not to be forced to provide State guarantees to the banking institutes.</P>
    <P>Government policy needs to be identified and clearly examined.  I am not aware of the fine detail but there seems to be some doubt in general about what stage of construction the project is at. Very substantial sums of money are involved with an increase in BGÉ's borrowing powers to £350 million and an increase in the limit on State guarantees to £190 million.  I hope we have learned from our experience in the past and that a wide range of submissions were sought for the construction of this project.  We know from past experience that prices can go askew if one does not look at a range of options.  Will the Minister indicate if a very full and thorough examination of the cost of the project was undertaken?</P>
    <P>I will be moving amendments in Deputy O'Malley's name to reduce the sums of money involved.  I understand the project cost ranges from £250 to £270 million.  We will be seeking to amend section 4 of this Bill by reducing the borrowing powers from £350 million to £300 million as this more accurately reflects the cost involved.  I think we are owed an explanation why the figure of £250 million was proposed.  We will be seeking <Col N="1285" /> also to amend section 5 of this Bill, which seeks to increase the State guarantees to £190 million.  We are not satisfied that the sums involved should be of this dimension.  If these moneys are not needed in the short to medium term but are contingency funds for some future date, I think it is a bad idea to allow for that funding to be made available now.  I think the company should be constrained in order to keep it on a commercial as opposed to the comfort route unless the Minister can outline the reasons from A to Z why these funds should be required to complete the project satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>If new sources of gas are not found in the short term and our existing resources begin to run down, where does that leave BGÉ in the light of the deal it entered into with NET and IFI?  I spoke at length about this before and I will not go into it in detail now.  Will BGÉ have to offer them the same deal when the gas comes from the interconnector?  I do not believe the same deal could exist if imported gas only is available.  There are welcome reasons for what is happening but we are not going far enough in deciding on the best policy for our natural gas and oil reserves.  We also have to decide on a policy for imported gas and whether it should remain under the control of BGÉ or whether there will be competition in this market.  Once the interconnector is in place the gas will be available indefinitely and therefore there could be an indefinite monopoly.  I would not like to see this as there should be real competition in the delivery of our energy requirements. Today we are dealing with gas, but I believe there should be competition for the supply of energy.  This would be healthy for State companies as well as for the private sector and there should be real benefits for the consumer, particularly industrial consumers, whom I have no doubt welcome this.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this Bill which will enable BGÉ to supply gas should our natural resource run out with the passage of time.  Naturally there is a cost involved <Col N="1286" /> in commencing the work and allowing it be completed.  There is also the need to ensure that legislative backing is put in place for work carried out outside the State before substantial work is carried out in this area.  The Bill is urgent.</P>
      <P>When I first looked at this Bill I assumed it was enabling legislation to allow the Ministers for Finance and Energy to increase the amount of funding available to BGÉ and to increase its borrowings to carry out the work.  However I am concerned that semi-State bodies are encouraged to extend their borrowings to carry out the job in hand and over the years we have seen that this approach is somewhat dangerous.  There seems to be reluctance to increase the equity in State companies and instead they are encouraged to increase their borrowings.  I do not think this has a beneficial effect on semi-State companies such as Bord na Móna, NET and indeed Aer Lingus.  The huge interest bill on borrowings may be very damaging for the company.  Indeed, the most recent case causing concern has been Aer Lingus, who must repay the heavy level of interest on payments for their extended borrowings over several years.  The level of £40 million per year increased interest repayments is causing the company considerable concern.  A profit is being made on operations and in various other areas but the level of interest repayments is crippling the company.</P>
      <P>We recently debated the NET Bill. That company must be reconstructed to provide special arrangements for interest accrued over the years.  The company has operated successfully since the reorganisation, nevertheless the general feeling is that it is a loss making operation because of its heavy interest repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go into detail regarding Bord Na Móna because its history is similar. State companies should not be allowed to borrow huge amounts for their activities, they should be examining more closely an increase in equity, which might be far more beneficial, and paying a dividend back to the State when they make a profit which would be preferable.  The hike in interest rates over the last few <Col N="1287" /> months was crippling many people not only in the semi-State area but in private business.  We cannot know when these interest rates will fluctuate to an extent where it will be beneficial to have borrowings rather than increased equity.</P>
    <P>Decisions made outside this country by the Bundesbank or other institutions, could mean semi-State companies being put in danger because of the level of interest rates.  This problem has bedevilled so many commercial semi-State companies that it must be reviewed by the Government as a matter of urgency, having regard to the way we fund our semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis, because of its monopoly, can and does make considerable sums of money.  In this respect perhaps they would be in a position &mdash; similar to the ESB &mdash; to make the repayments.  Their concern would not be the same as that of other semi-State companies where options are obvious and where there is competition from the private sector. Nevertheless, the point should be made.</P>
    <P>Over the years, and during the debate on NET, the hidden subsidy, as it was described, of Bord Gáis to NET was examined.  I defend that subsidy for the reasons I set out when we debated the Bill.  At that time some Members of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Cullen, considered it the most efficient and cost effective way of selling gas to the domestic user and in that respect would probably bring the greatest return. However, I do not believe Bord Gáis was established simply for the benefit of the domestic user.  It was obviously set up to benefit our industrial operations and to attract greater industrial activity to this country by making various sources of clean energy available.  It would also encourage indigenous companies to set up here.  Indeed, in accepting industrial development as one of the benefits of a gas supply, this Bill is welcome as it will ensure that there will not be an interruption in the supply.  It will have the effect of encouraging greater employment through setting up more indigenous and foreign industries here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> As other speakers said, the grid covered by Bord Gáis is very limited, although it may provide energy for the larger populated areas.  It will have the effect of concentrating industry in those areas it serves.  In that regard I make a plea for my own constituency of Wicklow east and Kildare with which I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree.  It is the responsibility of Bord Gáis to draw up a plan outlining where additional energy should be distributed.  In debating this Bill we should have some indication whether the gas pipeline will be extended to areas other than those served at present by the Kinsale gas supply.  Bray, part of my constituency, is connected to the natural gas supply and was traditionally supplied by the Dublin Gas company.  The people of Bray were certain that when natural gas became available in Dublin it would be extended to Bray.  I remind the Minister that the main gas pipeline to Dublin came through west Wicklow and east Kildare.  I wrote to Bord Gáis on one occasion and asked them if, having disrupted farming and other activities in west Wicklow, it would provide compensation for the people in that area by extending the gas supply to towns and villages there, but that was not considered to be practical.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be beneficial for the gas supply to be extended down the east coast through the large urban areas of Greystones, Kilcoole, Wicklow and Arklow which have an industrial tradition. Over the past ten or 15 years those areas have been devastated by the loss of traditional industries and if they are to be revitalised we must provide not only good roadways but the most efficient energy available for the setting up of industries along the east coast.  If those areas do not receive that energy supply they will be in competition for industrial development with other areas with a choice of energy supply.  I am sure the Minister, who represents a rural area, agrees that if we continue to supply a limited area with a choice of energy we will put the rest of the country at a considerable disadvantage.  Semi-State <Col N="1289" /> bodies have a responsibility to taxpayers to ensure that their money is used efficiently and that must be applied to all companies.  Competition between coal, oil, gas and electricity, the main energy providers &mdash; there are others such as bottled gas &mdash; provides a choice.</P>
    <P>People are concerned about the environmental effects of the use of these products.  It is interesting that in the past week the Environment Commissioner, Mr. Paleo Krassas, a Greek gentleman, extolled the virtues of an energy tax.  He pointed out what the great benefit of such a tax would be in the United States and said a similar tax should be introduced in the Community.  If any energy tax is applied in the Community it would be to the disadvantage of areas that depend on coal, oil and petrol.  It is vital that there be a level playing pitch before the introduction of an energy tax, which would impose an additional burden on those in rural areas.  I hope that at EC meetings on energy the Minister will emphasise the effects of an energy tax, particularly in rural areas.  Those areas would be at a disadvantage compared with areas with a choice of energy such as electricity, gas and oil.</P>
    <P>I am a traditionist in that I do not like any hint of privatisation in legislation, and section 3 leaves the door open for future privatisation of Bord Gáis.  I do not mind being at odds with my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats in saying that I hope the more lucrative end of the business will not be offered to the private sector while the State is left with the less lucrative sections.  It is not acceptable that the State simply owns the distribution network, the pipes and so on, while handing over the profit making section, the provision of energy to domestic and industrial users, to some agency in the private sector who would monopolise that area.  It should be ensured that the profits of a company almost guaranteed to make profit go into the State coffers.  In that way other semi-State bodies, which do not have a monopoly and which provide much needed employment, can be maintained.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give an assurance <Col N="1290" /> in regard to section 3 in terms of opening the door to privatisation, as is being considered in the case of Greencore. The profits of semi-State companies should be returned to the State for the benefit of the taxpayer.  Not all semi-State companies are in the privileged position of making a profit every year and as soon as they start making a loss it is felt that certain action should be taken to reduce the workforce or whatever.  Everybody agrees that employment creation is essential. This Bill will enable greater industrial activity, thereby increasing employment in industry.  For that reason I particularly welcome it.  Finally, I hope that as many parts of the country as possible are provided with a gas supply and that employment creation is spread as evenly as possible throughout the Country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, let me thank all Deputies for their interest in this Bill and for their contributions to this very important debate.  I appreciate the support given by the Members of the House to this Bill.  It reflects their recognition of the importance of the Ireland-UK gas interconnector to our security of supply and indeed to our overall future energy supply strategy.  This is a major and exciting project and heralds a new era in Irish energy policy.</P>
      <P>A number of points have been raised during the course of the debate, which I would like to address.  With regard to the number of Irish people employed on the project, I would like to remind Deputies that not all of the contractors on the project have yet been announced.  Those contracts which have awarded to date have resulted in about 180 Irish jobs. There may well be more as other contracts are awarded later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is attracting substantial EC grant-aid under the REGEN initiative. It is important therefore, that Bord Gáis, which is undertaking the project, is careful to comply with EC requirements such as those on public procurement.  For example, the BGÉ board took a commercial <Col N="1291" /> decision on the basis of cost to place the contract for coating the subsea pipe in Scotland.  Not to do so would almost certainly have been open to question by the EC and it would have increased the project cost.</P>
    <P>The provision of a large subsidy by the Government&mdash;because that is what it would have amounted to&mdash;in order to enable the work to be carried out in Cork would also have endangered EC aid as it would have placed other firms tendering at a disadvantage and would therefore be regarded as a barrier to trade.</P>
    <P>The economics of the project and the price of imported gas were mentioned. Let me assure the House that a comprehensive feasibility study of the economics of this project was undertaken by our Department.  This study was based on cost estimates provided by internationally respected consultants.  This again was examined by the EC Commission and in turn by their consultants, who professed themselves satisfied and they agreed to grant aid the project.  I am very pleased that the bids received from the contractors on this project bore out the estimates used in the feasibility study and the decision to build in 1993.  The quotations received have confirmed that the BGÉ budget figure of £290 million for the project was not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The project is currently on target and within budget.  This is the ideal year to build this pipeline.  Prices have never been keener.  Competition for contracts has been intense.  Deputies rightly pointed to the very good record there has been in the execution of gas infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>I can assure them that this project will be no exception and that costs are being tightly controlled.  I am satisfied that this is an excellent project, both from an economic and national point of view.  It will provide gas supplies during the 50 year lifetime of the pipe, and from the end of this year onwards will give us access to supplies in the event of any interruption to the flow of our own indigenous gas.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, mentioned <Col N="1292" /> in his introductory speech that Bord Gáis had entered into a five year security gas agreement with National Power in the UK.  It has not yet negotiated a long term gas purchase contract for the interconnector.  However, BGÉ are now back in the market for gas as are the ESB.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say what the cost of imported gas will be for BGÉ or the ESB, but it will be related to the market price in the UK, which is of course higher than the price of Kinsale Head gas now. I can assure Deputies that there will be no problem with supplies of gas for generations to come.  For example, Norway has over 60 years of reserves at current levels of production and Russia has 40 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, most of which is untapped. Some Deputies rightly pointed out that there is a global trend to link networks and it is not improbable that before long we could be buying gas from as far afield as Siberia.  I would like to allay any fear also that Ireland might be held up to ransom on price.  Gas will be available through the interconnector at open market prices.  Deputies should note that price is but one element, though very important, in a gas supply contract.</P>
    <P>It is not the cost of gas alone which dictates the retail price of gas.  It is sold by utilities everywhere on the basis that it must compete with oil, that is heavy fuel oil or gas oil, as the case may be.  BGÉ operates on the same principle and sells its gas in competition with oil products.  The profits arising from its operations are subject to the right of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to take a dividend for the State.  This dividend, which has amounted to over £300 million to date, reflects in part the relatively low input price of Kinsale gas in comparison with international gas prices.</P>
    <P>In addition, BGÉ has been required to operate its business and to make its investment decisions as if it paid import prices and has striven, with the encouragement of successive Ministers for Energy, to operate so as to ensure that a <Col N="1293" /> viable gas industry will survive beyond Kinsale, based on import costs and on the same retail pricing principles in the market place, that is, competition with oil products.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that that principle will continue to serve as the basis of gas pricing and that domestic consumers will not face price hikes only because gas is being imported via the interconnector pipeline.  It will mean however that certain bulk users may face some increase. Bord Gáis will still have to remain competitive with other energy sources.</P>
    <P>This will mean a tightening of the board's margins, improved efficiency and a big reduction in the amount of profit which can be transferred to the Exchequer by way of dividend.  The curtailment of dividends will be inevitable as indigenous supplies run out.  It would be unfair to blame the interconnector for this.  BGÉ's cash flow must inevitably reflect the expense of building this pipeline. If future profits allow the extraction of dividends that will remain an option.</P>
    <P>As regards private sector investment in the project, we would welcome an equity partner for Bord Gáis.  I recognise that this is a long term, infrastructural project which, while it is strategically important to us, may not give the kind of short term payback which would make it attractive to many private sector investors.</P>
    <P>The pipeline will probably be operated by a subsidiary of Bord Gáis.  I do not consider this to be unreasonable, given its importance to us, and the current stage of development of the Irish gas industry. Large users, such as the ESB, will be able to negotiate access to the pipeline to transport gas will be able to gain access for sales to large users or, indeed, for exports.  This represents a significant incentive for gas exploration offshore Ireland.  It has been suggested that the project could be postponed until about the year 2010 and that substantial savings in interest payments could be effected if BGÉ stopped supplying gas to the ESB and NET.  This is not a practical proposition under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis is contractually bound to <Col N="1294" /> take or pay for certain quantities of gas each year.  Even if it leaves the gas in the ground, it still must pay for it.  That is how gas fields are developed everywhere. Almost 70 per cent of all gas sold by BGÉ goes to the ESB and NET.  It quite simply would not make economic sense for BGÉ not to sell 70 per cent of the gas for which it has to pay the producer every year. The revenue shortfall would have to be made up by borrowings.  Deputies can imagine what the finances of the company would look like in a few years if BGÉ were to be restricted in its expansion programme.</P>
    <P>Every gasfield has an optimal production profile which enables the producer to maximise the amount of gas which can be recovered.  Leaving gas in the ground may mean that a proportion of it would be lost.  We also have to be aware of the operating costs of the field in its later years &mdash; they would be likely to be higher than the revenue.  Maintenance costs would also be very high on the platforms.  In addition, a reduction in the potential market for gas here would be likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on prospects for exploration in our offshore.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, Bord Gáis has contracts with both the ESB and NET to supply them with gas.  Both companies rely on the gas supplied by Bord Gáis.  If Bord Gáis were to be ordered to renege on those contracts it would call into question the credibility of any contract entered into by the State or by State companies.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the suggestion that the price paid for gas is anything other than an energy related one.  The ESB has not been sheltered.  NET is, of course, an entirely different matter, but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>The increased use of natural gas in the domestic sector is an important element in the improvement of air quality in our major urban areas.  Bord Gáis is currently engaged in a five year project to offer a gas suply to customers in non-gas estates where this is commercially viable.  Gas is already the most popular choice for new housing in the gas supply area and BGÉ <Col N="1295" /> has laid gas pipes in practically all the new housing estates in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>

      <P>In the gas supply area natural gas is already the dominant fuel for industry. The major future growth opportunities in gas sales will be in the domestic and commercial sectors.  These are now being targeted.  The board must view each housing estate on the basis of commercial viability, whether it is a private estate or a local authority one.  The question of a subvention for central heating of any kind in local authority housing would be more appropriately addressed to my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Energy efficiency is a central plank in the programme for Government.  It is our policy to use as little energy, per unit of GDP, as possible.  Deputy Sargent seems to be against increased use of gas, but I would like to hear what the realistic alternatives are.  The Deputy referred to Oilean Chléire.  The ESB wind power experiments there are now finished.  We have, in fact, established a new wind farm at Bellacorick in County Mayo.  We will continue to explore such possibilities, but in the meantime we must cater for our immediate energy needs.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that gas is not a suitable fuel for electricity generation.  Modern combined cycle plant operates at a highly efficient rate of around 55 per cent.  Gas is now recognised throughout the EC as the fuel of the future for power generation, so much so that the European Council has seen fit recently to revoke an earlier Directive restricting its use for that purpose.  Combined heat and power is also a plant of the programme for Government.  We are now beginning work on that aspect of the programme. The Taoiseach has pioneered this for a long period and totally supports it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of global warming, <Col N="1296" /> Deputies will be aware that the EC is committed to keeping Co² emissions to the 1990 levels by the year 2000. However, as a peripheral nation, Ireland has to ensure that its economic growth is not hindered.  Gas is the most benign fossil fuel and therefore figures prominently in our national strategy for Co² abatement to meet our EC commitment. As Deputy Owen rightly poointed out, gas does not contain Co².</P>
    <P>On tariffs, Bord Gáis already publishes tariffs for the domestic and small-to-medium industrial and commercial sectors. The majority of its customers are on those tariffs.  The board also makes returns to the EC Statistical Office on prices charged in the domestic and industrial sectors in compliance with the price transparency directive.  We are in favour of a more transparent tariff structure for industrial users.  We recognise that larger users can expect to pay less than domestic users reflecting lower unit costs.  We recognise also that competing fuels are not bound by published tariffs and could pick off specific customers.  Nevertheless it would be in the interest of all gas customers to have more comprehensive published tariffs.  We are having this issue examined.</P>
    <P>I am gratified by the favourable comments made about the environmental impact statement produced by Bord Gáis Éireann.  This was, strictly speaking, not a legal requirement, but it is proper that it should have been undertaken.  The work is of the highest quality and, in fact, in Scotland the Bord Gáis Éireann study was so well regarded it will now be used as a benchmark against which others will have to be compared.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is very conscious of its obligations in protecting the environment in north County Dublin and the archaeological heritage in the area.  In the past, where sensitive sites were uncovered, Bord Gáis Éireann has funded archaeological studies.  Bord Gáis Éireann will ensure that there is the very minimum possible disruption to local amenities during the construction of the landfall and onshore pipe, and will carry out a full re-instatement.  In particular, I <Col N="1297" /> can assure Deputies Burke and Ryan, that the boulder clay cliffs will be put back, as far as is technically possible, in their original configuration.  There is a right of way along the clifftop and the public path there will be restored.  I can assure the Deputy that the shore station will be screened and landscaped to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Landowners can also be assured of proper re-instatement.  Bord Gáis Éireann has taken pains to protect that land along the route of the pipeline and all topsoil, fencing, hedging and so on will be replaced.  The level of compensation to local growers will reflect the value of crop losses.  If landowners are not happy with what is on offer from Bord Gáis Éireann, they can, of course, have recourse to the arbitration process.</P>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Ryan with regard to one of his constituents is, I understand, being addressed by Bord Gáis Éireann who have been prepared to offer a compromise solution.  Discussions on this matter are ongoing.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Owen's explanation as to why Loughshinny was chosen as the landfall for the interconnector.  I should add that what was needed was a connection coming into Dublin from the northern end of the grid for the reasons, already explained, of security of supply to the largest market.</P>
    <P>Wexford was examined as a possible route, but was judged to be out of the question technically and environmentally. The British Gas transmission system does not come far enough towards the west coast of Wales, so it would have required a much longer onshore pipeline in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis has examined the possibility of a supply of gas to Wexford on a number of occasions but it has not been found economically viable to bring gas there, from Waterford because of the lack of large industrial customers to take the base load.  The Wexford Gas Company closed down about three years ago and, in fact, Bord Gáis Éireann assisted in the orderly shut down of the old town gas system.  The board also assisted in the <Col N="1298" /> provision of alternative cooking facilities for the customers of Wexford Gas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke inquired as to the location of the safety valve, offshore if possible.  This is not feasible.  As far as I am aware it would be counter productive because it would weaken the structural integrity where it is especially difficult to access it.  Deputy Burke also requested an assurance on security.  I assure the House that the main pipe, and the land based pressure reduction station at Loughshinny will be absolutely safe and fully secured.  As regards the involvement of the ESB with Bord Gáis Éireann in this and other projects, I assure the House that this will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Noonan who asked about an overall energy policy, I should say that this measure is designed to facilitate a very important project.  It is urgent and it would be right to leave it until a major national energy policy has been concluded.  The pipeline is being built in furtherance of our overall energy policy, that is to secure adequate energy supplies at a reasonable cost.  The Kinsale gas field has a life until circa the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Deputies Burke and Noonan spoke about the involvement of Irish companies and the need for Irish job opportunites. It is a fact that Irish companies are not generally involved in this very specialised area of sub-sea pipe-laying.  Even worldwide, a very small number of companies was competent for this job.  We are a member of the European Community and we benefit from European Community resources.  This project is also benefiting from European Community resources.  We are obliged by EC directives, and various trade agreements to provide opportunities for international competition in all contracts over a particular figure under public procurement rules.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Cullen referred to the Northern Ireland pipeline and put forward a very good idea.  However, it is primarily a matter for the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland authorities. They have found it suits them to do it their way.  We are facilitating them <Col N="1299" /> by sharing part of our pipeline in Scotland. There are advantages in both sides of the argument.  A Northern pipeline which may eventually enable us to connect up with the Northern grid would enhance security of supply.  We have collaborated with both the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland authorities on this project.  These matters had been discussed at Anglo Irish and other levels.  We will facilitate and are cooperating with them.  We are sharing part of our pipeline on reasonable commercial terms with them and will continue to cooperate.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Cullen asked, why not an ESB interconnector and a gas interconnector together.  These are very separate matters from both economic and technical viewpoints.  They should stand on their own merits.  There would, I understand, be technical difficulties and risks about running them together.  I understand the electricity interconnector is still under study regarding its feasibility. We have no problem with the notion of access to the gas network for large users and producers.  We must have regard to the security of supply and the capacity of the system.  The European Community has proposed third party access but without success so far.  Gas is sold in competition with oil in every market sector.  Gas <i>vis-à-vis</i> gas competition is a little further down the road.</P>
    <P>This pipeline will be operated by a stand alone subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann.  It will be at arms length, and transparently so, from Bord Gáis Éireann.  Large users, for example, the ESB, Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta and other producers will have access to the pipeline at a reasonable cost.  We welcome private sector investment in this pipeline.  Company joint ventures are not ruled out.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kavanagh and Mulvihill requested an extension of the gas supply to all towns where possible and feasible. Deputies can rest assured that Bord Gáis Éireann will always be anxious to extend supplies to domestic markets that are <Col N="1300" /> commercially viable.  It has a statutory mandate to do that but only where it is economic and practical to do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 29, to delete &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister limiting himself by inserting the words &ldquo;a condition&rdquo;.  Surely it would be more correct to substitute those words, as the amendment suggests, with the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; because of the eventualities that could arise.  Can the Minister explain the reason he is limiting himself by specifying &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; when it is obvious that a number of different conditions could arise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not visualise any difficulty with the terminology in the Bill. The Deputy will agree that the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; can include &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; or be comprehensive enough to include conditions or sub conditions.  The singular condition already includes the plural, conditions.  The words &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; are <Col N="1301" /> in themselves capable of being comprehensive. To insert the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; in paragraph (a) on page two, line 29, and have the words &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; in paragraph (b) on page three would be incongruous and conflicting.  We must be consistent in the words we use.  We have been consistent in what we have done and if we accept this amendment there will be conflict and inconsistency.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy would withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  It is a moot point.  The word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; better reflects what is intended in the Bill and would be more correct in its application.  The Minister's explanation is not satisfactory or correct and I ask him to reconsider this amendment. This is not a play on words but a question of getting the wording in the Bill as correct and as accurate as possible. The insertion of the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;a condition&rdquo; would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>There is a gap in that section and it would be more appropriate to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister will be able to accept this amendment as the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is common in most Bills in this context.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that if we include the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; the Minister would have to make a choice between the two paragraphs and that would be unwise.  We must allow for flexibility and the maximum consideration of any option or options that a Minister may wish to pursue.  I am satisfied that his amendment is not necessary. It could reduce the options available to the Minister, who may wish to send a notice dealing with the subject matter of paragraphs (a) or (b) or both.  It would be unwise to limit the options available <Col N="1302" /> to successive Ministers.  Consequently I regret I will not be able to accept the amendment and would be grateful if the Deputy would withdraw it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 4, to delete &ldquo;£350,000,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£300,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I mentioned my concern in regard to this matter on Second Stage and many other Deputies did likewise.  In the Minister's reply to Second Stage he indicated that the project will cost £290 million.  As yet I have not got a satisfactory answer from the Department of Energy or from the Ministers who have spoken on this Bill as to why the figure mentioned in this section should be £350 million.  An unnecessary amount of space is being created in the context of the moneys being made available and this is unnecessary.  Likewise in section 5 the borrowings that can be guaranteed by the State have been increased from £80 million to £190 million.  Will the Minister explain why those figures are necessary in the short to medium term?  They may be necessary in the long term, but I dislike the principle of making available massive State borrowings to companies in the first instance.  That is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I questioned also the matter of State guarantees, which is running a little awry.  There is a comfort factor involved for commercially viable companies who are legitimately involved in commercial projects and BGÉ and the gas pipeline project are commercially viable.  Here again the funding must be guaranteed by the State and that comfort factor has become the be all and end <Col N="1303" /> all of projects in this country.  This is unwarranted and a change of direction in this regard is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the figures in the Bill are what are required and the reduction proposed in this amendment more than adequately covers anything the Minister has said in regard to what BGÉ requires to satisfactorily complete this project.  The figures of £300 million and £150 million are substantial by any yardstick and the Minister should accept these amendments.  They have been put down in good faith and do not limit the scope of the company or the project.  Far too much room is being given for further borrowings which might not necessarily be questioned by this House and which would create a necessity for further enabling legislation to be introduced. This House should have the opportunity to discuss in detail any further projects or change in direction that BGÉ undertakes. I am concerned why the figures are so large.  The amendments should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must differentiate between what is proposed in these two amendments.  Amendment No. 3 allows Bord Gáis Éireann a borrowing capacity of £350 million and amendment No. 4 covers a State guarantee up to a maximum of £190 million.  Consequently, State exposure in regard to the £350 million borrowing would be £190 million, not £350 million and I do not believe one can say that figure is abnormal.  Bord Gáis Éireann must operate on commercial criteria and must have certain flexibilities. We must allow it respond to opportunities in the marketplace and operate under commercial criteria.  We cannot tie its hands whereby it is structured to a State guarantee of £190 million and allow it operate under commercial criteria.  The commercial criteria allow it to have a borrowing capacity up to £350 million and the State exposure is only £190 million. We are satisfied that Bord Gáis Éireann has no more leeway than it needs in regard to the figure of £350 million. This will be a fairly tight financial fit when <Col N="1304" /> borrowing for the interconnector is put in the context of existing borrowing and working capital requirements, even taking account of the European Community grants.  Bord Gáis Éireann must have room to manoeuvre in the event of those grants being late.  For example, if the total contract is £290 million, with a grant element of £90 million, and the contract moneys are due before the grant is sanctioned, the company will be exposed to honouring its financial responsibility and contractual obligations. This will lead to exposure in excess of £300 million at least and we must legislate for that.</P>
      <P>On the second amendment, I emphasise that the margin will be tight between what Bord Gáis Éireann will be allowed and what its exposure could be.  Bord Gáis Éireann has existing loan commitments and must deal with this major project.  When the devaluation of existing Deutsche Mark and ECU loans is added the total exposure would be greater than £180 million.  There is no further room for manoeuvre in this area.  We have to take into account existing commitments &mdash; the contractual commitments in regard to the gas interconnector and the commercial criteria under which the company must operate.  We have to allow the company the flexibility which is vital in regard to this major contract, a new dimension. The figures proposed are tightly based to allow the company flexibility, enable it to meet its contractual obligations and ensure that the commercial viability of the company is protected.  These figures have been recommended and agreed and, consequently, I regret that I will not be able to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily disagree with any of the remarks made by the Minister in regard to commercial viability &mdash; every company has to operate on the basis of commercial viability. However, the Minister seems to be saying that a company cannot be viable unless the State guarantees its borrowings.  In effect, that is what is being said here.  I do not accept this point.  It would be tremendous if every company operating <Col N="1305" /> in the commercial sector was able to make all its decisions based on the fact that no matter what it did the State would effectively guarantee a substantial portion, if not all, of its borrowing.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that the entire principle of State guarantees needs to be looked at by the Government.  It is clear from various pieces of legislation dealing with a whole raft of semi-State operations that before we know what has happened the borrowing limits have been reached. If the limits had been set lower in the first instance we may have had the opportunity, when things went wrong in various companies, of coming into the House at an earlier stage to look at the problems and perhaps have a better chance of solving them.  I am not suggesting that this is what is definitely going to happen in this case, but we have enough examples of where it has happened.</P>
      <P>We need to be very conscious of the scarce resources available to the State and seek at every opportunity to minimise State involvement by ensuring that the figures are cut to the absolute minimum. I do not accept that the State exposure proposed in the Bill is necessary. The figures could be reduced to those proposed in the amendments which are reasonable and would still allow for flexibility within the company, to which the Minister correctly referred.  I do not think these figures would hamper or hinder the development of the company or the projects in which it is involved.  I ask the Minister to think again about these figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures, which were suggested by the industry, were regarded as necessary if the job was to be carried out correctly.  It is appropriate that the <Col N="1306" /> State should be involved in this type of project.  Bord Gáis Éireann was set up by the State to do a particular job and it needs the comfort, as Deputy Cullen calls it, of knowing that it can do its job and that legislation is in place to protect it.  If the company overspends, the Bill will have to be brought back before the House.  The amounts proposed are regarded, optimistically, as those which will be required.  The logic put forward by Deputy Cullen in the House is contrary to what he has said in public at meetings of Aer Lingus workers and others.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with Deputy Cullen that we should come back into the House to consider the figures. Neither financial nor political management would allow for a situation where, if we were to restrict a company to a figure below that which is proper and required by it to carry out its mandate and carry out a major project, we would have to bring legislation back before the House to increase either the borrowing requirement or the State guarantee.  The financial markets would be dictating other types of policies, and we would not be giving flexibility to any company in terms of financial management if legislation had to be brought back before the House.  There is a clear demarcation between what is proposed here.  On the one hand, we are giving the company the right to increase its borrowing requirements up to £350 million, while on the other hand we are only exposing the State to £190 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is our record and if the Deputy looks back on our records both in the Seanad and Dáil he will see that we were able to do our business. The point is that where there is a State guarantee on the borrowing, the semi-State company involved can get major financial help from the European Investment Bank and others at very reasonable rates of interest.  If they have to come back to the House to increase that guarantee, it may be that the rates have changed, that it is not possible to do business or that the cost of the project has increased.  We have taken into account the cost of the contract, the company's present liabilities and operations, the major exposure it might have, its financial capacity and requirements and the necessity to guarantee the funds it needs up to a certain figure based on what we see as the maximum required at any particular time and taking that against the commercial criteria on which the company is based.  The two figures we have put up are prudent and reasonable for the commercial viability of the company. Contrast that with other semi-State companies here who have a 100 per cent <Col N="1310" /> State guarantee for their borrowing.  We have been very reasonable, very careful and we acknowledge the very great contribution made by the BGÉ in its very short life.</P>
      <P>In this new project it is extending its operations very much.  We cannot restrict those operations or leave the company with one hand tied behind its back.  This company will make a major contribution to our economic and energy policies in the years ahead.  It is necessary that we take these positive decisions and I would like the House to be unanimous on them so that we can give this company a clear vote of confidence in regard to what they are doing in the interests of our country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> This reminds me of &ldquo;Looney Tunes&rdquo; that are shown to fill in between the main programmes.</P>
      <P>Before I moved the Adjournment of the debate, I welcomed the change of direction in this budget, moving away from a conservative and even Thatcherite philosophy to a philosophy of investment for the future of the country, particularly in the social infrastructure.  I was interested to note the comments of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on the budget.  Those from Fine Gael were certainly contradictory.  On 5 January this year Deputy John Bruton said, on the nomination of the Taoiseach, that the Government had a mistaken belief in the virtue of State capital spending to motivate the economy.  He said that money would be poured into State originated projects and schemes which would create little short term employment and no long term employment.  On the budget debate, however, Fine Gael demanded more and more State expenditure without saying from where this money should come while at the same time attacking our proposed revenue sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time Deputy John Bruton, and his party, made their minds up on where they stand.  Deputy Bruton went on to ridicule public works programmes and those who devise and work on them.  He also attacked the Labour Party's commitment to public housing.  What does he want? Does he want to leave people in mobile homes and caravans?  I know that Fine Gael councillors down the country certainly would not like to do that.  Far from objecting to the amount of housing scheduled for the year Fine Gael were peeved it was not they who got to make the announcement.  It is time they made up their minds on where they stand.  They <Col N="1312" /> cannot have more expenditure without saying where the money is to come from.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the members of the Progressive Democrats they, at least, have a clear ideological position.  They believe in the much vaunted privacy of the market. However, our economic history since the foundation of the State shows just how well the market has worked.  We have continuing unemployment and poverty and this shows a further lack of economic understanding.  Those who have studied economics at even elementary level will know that in lesson one of the course they learn how the market works, and in lessons two to ten they learn what to do when the market does not work.  The budget shows a judicious mix of letting the market work where possible but taking steps to intervene where it fails.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister's attention the area of redundancy payments.  Too often redundancy is seen as the termination of a working life rather than as a step to further work involvement.  When people are made redundant &mdash; we have seen quite a large number of redundancies over the past number of years &mdash; they clear off financial commitments such as car loans and mortgages and then find, after a short period, that their income has reduced considerably, and are discriminated against if they have to claim social welfare.  Another problem is that the redundancy payments which are supposed to ease their transition into their next job are taxed by the State.  In effect, it is a form of smash and grab raid by the Government.  Redundancy payments should be treated in a much more favourable manner for tax purposes.  If the £3,000 limit which was introduced on non-statutory redundancy payments for tax exemption in 1964 was index-linked we would now have a situation whereby somebody could get a lump sum of up to £35,000 without having to pay tax on it.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the Minister to introduce this index-linking and link such improvement to the setting up of a special State gilt fund in which this money could be invested.  This would provide a source of investment for many of the <Col N="1313" /> small businesses which these people try to set up after they are made redundant. The fund could provide them with a monthly income and enable them to meet their ongoing commitments such as car loans, mortgages, educational loans and so on.  Such a fund should be set up to take account of the money for a five year period after which it would be paid back as a capital lump sum to the investor. In my opinion that would achieve two objectives: it would save the redundancy payments being used to the benefit of the State and to the benefit of the financial institutions and allow for an ongoing income throughout a defined long term period for the person made redundant; it would also make available to the State a large amount of money for use in job creation, particularly in small businesses. The amount of money involved is not inconsiderable.  In my own area of the midlands it is reckoned that up to £20 million was made available in Bord na Móna redundancies.  It is also reckoned that up to £78 million may become available in the west of Ireland through Digital redundancies.  I recommend to the Minister that he take this proposal on board and respond to the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the hardship that will accrue as a result of the recent significant increase in health charges in respect of hospital accommodation and out-patients services and having regard to the likely consequent increase in Voluntary Health insurance premia, hereby annuls the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, and the Health (Out-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, as such regulations represent an unwarranted and unacceptable attack on families, <Col N="1314" /> particularly those in the moderate income sector of the community.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the House, I should like to share my time with my colleague, Deputy John Browne <i>(Carlow Kilkenny)</i> and with my Cork colleague, Deputy Michael Creed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed to?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first major initiative in health care announced by the present Minister for Health after his appointment was a sudden increase in health charges.  It is only right, therefore, that the Dáil be called upon to discuss that callous act of the new Minister for Health and, even more important, that the effect and consequences of that decision be voted upon by this elected Assembly.</P>
      <P>The surreptitious manner of the timing of the increase is worthy of recollection. The hike was announced not, as one would expect, in the course of the budget speech of the Minister for Finance but on the evening before the budget, with no reference whatever to the higher charges being contained in the speech of the Minister for Finance the following day.  The fact that the Programme for a Partnership Government was silent on any health charge increase is one that may be understood, but the nature of the February announcement can be construed only as a deliberate and calculated move by the Minister to avoid adverse publicity and minimise criticism of what was in essence a shock decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in charges is significant and will add considerably to the annual household costs of many families, particularly those in the middle income and PAYE sector.  People opting for a public bed in hospital will now face an increase of 33 per cent in the daily charge, from £15 per day to £20 per day under treatment. Public patients will now pay fees to a ceiling of £200 in place of the £150 ceiling that operated heretofore.  Private patients will pay an extra £20 per day charge for a bed, or an extra £140 per <Col N="1315" /> week if a private or semi-private patient. Most hospitals now will charge the total sum of £728 per week for a semi-private bed and £924 per week for private care. The daily pay charges for in-patient services will now become payable not only for every day but for every part of a day, meaning that someone who is admitted late one night and discharged early the next day will be charged for two days instead of being charged for eight or ten hours, only one day.  The latter charge is a source of serious concern, having regard to the fact that it is advisable in most cases, and common practice in many hospitals, to detain a patient for a period of 24 hours, if only for observation purposes.  Every evening admission patient will be charged at a rate applicable for a stay of two days in hospital.  Out-patient services have not escaped the ministerial trawl either.  In that respect, however, the charge is reflected by virtue of a hidden increase.  As and from 1 March 1993 the £10 charge for treatment at a hospital has been replaced by a charge of £6 per visit, which in essence means that treatment by way of four visits for the same complaint will cost £24 instead of £10 &mdash; a hefty hike in any terms.</P>
    <P>The increases represent a tax on the sick.  They fly in the face of the reference contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government of a more caring attitude to the vulnerable and the weak in our society.  Is there a more vulnerable sector in the community that the ill, the weak and the old, those in society who are unable because of physical ailment to sufficiently care for themselves?  Since the present Government took office a few short weeks ago a package of higher taxes has been imposed on the ill and on the weak.  Disability benefit is now to be taxed; the increase the subject of tonight's motion refers specifically to the ill; the recent budget introduced a new tax on death, the new 2 per cent probate tax, which is a tax on widows and orphans.  Ireland is now the only country in Europe, possibly the only country in the world, in which a probate tax sits <Col N="1316" /> alongside an active system of inheritance tax, both in operation at the same time.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks, as news of the health charge increases has filtered through the community, many public representatives have expressed shock and outrage.  Representations have been made individually at clinics and advice centres and collectively at community level.  Concern at the charges has been expressed at local authority fora throughout the country.  The voices raised do not belong to Members representing Opposition parties; many Fianna Fáil and Labour Party backbenchers serving on health boards and county councils throughout the country have been public in their condemnation of the charges as being unacceptable.  Those Fianna Fáil and Labour Party Deputies rightly recognised the effect that the increases were having among the people they represent and with whom they have contact daily.</P>
    <P>In reply to concern expressed, many of those Deputies undertook to take up the matter with the Minister.  However, much more than that can be done.  The Dáil need not take up the matter with the Minister.  In this instance the Dáil can instruct the Minister what to do, and the Minister has no choice but to heed the Dáil in whatever action it might take in this issue.  On the issue of the increase, the Dáil, not the Minister, decides. Tonight's debate is in essence different from most Private Members' motions.  In the motion there is no mention of Dáil Éireann calling upon the Minister or calling upon the Government to act in a particular manner.  The motion is a simple and very effective device that, if successful, could overrule the Minister and have the charges scrapped.  The significant increases were ordered by the Minister under the 1947 Health Act, which contains a provision whereby Dáil Éireann has the power to render null and void the action of a Minister provided the order is made within 21 sitting days of the decree.  The regulations signed by the Minister on 23 February comprise Statutory Instruments Nos. 50 and 51, 1993.  I therefore call upon all Members of the House who are concerned at these <Col N="1317" /> charges, and particularly those who have voiced opposition to the charges at local level, to exercise their vote tomorrow night and reject the increase, with automatic effect.</P>
    <P>One certain consequence of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government increase in bed charges will be yet another increase in VHI premia.  The 20 per cent increase in private bed charges will, it is estimated, increase VHI pay-outs by up to £8 million.  I am amazed at a report in yesterday's paper wherein the Minister stated that he did not foresee an immediate increase in VHI premia as a result of the charges.  I put it to the Minister that there is universal acceptance that insurance premia will increase, and increase substantially.  The chairman of the VHI board stated within hours of the announcement of the ministerial hike that the implications of the increases in charges would be far reaching.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board sees the very essence of the company under threat because of its financial position?  Does the Minister accept that this year the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will suffer a loss on its insurance business of the order of £4 million, with projected losses next year of £8 million in its insurance business?  But for its very positive investment yield the solvency of the company would be seriously in question. For the period 1995-1998 the Voluntary Health Insurance Board estimates an annual deficit on its insurance business of £6 million per annum.  Indeed, if recent reports suggesting that the Minister is considering further increases in private bed charges in public hospitals are to be believed, the costs will have to be passed on to the consumer by way of an increase in insurance premia, all this against the backdrop of a statement on the part of the Minister that no increase was necessary. As it is, the recent in-patient increase will cost the Voluntary Health Insurance Board a substantial sum. Already this year premia have been increased by 4 per cent.  An application for a further increase of the order of 6 per cent has been suggested and appears <Col N="1318" /> likely.  I might remind the Minister that we will keep a close eye on that one.  This will represent a sharp increase for the 1.2 million subscribers to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board Scheme, many of whom find the annual premia a major burden on their family budgets.  These families represent exactly the same group from whom the 1 per cent income levies have been extracted, almost all of whom hold mortgages and suffered during the currency crisis over recent winter months.</P>
    <P>Health insurance costs will rise significantly as the Department exacts the full economic rate for private beds in public hospitals.  In turn, this will give rise to huge increases in charges for beds in private hospitals, adding substantially to VHI costs and pushing its insurance scheme beyond the reach of many.  If the present trend continue many subscribers will not be in a position to pay for any form of health insurance.  The biggest fear for those people will be falling ill, not an efficient health service over which to preside.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that one of the first acts of the new Minister was the introduction of the massive increase in charges which, when taken in the context of the many crisis in the health services, amounts to a shameless disregard for those thousands of people waiting years for necessary health treatment.  The allocation of an extra £20 million to clear the waiting lists within 12 months was lauded loudly when announced in the Programme for Government but action has been minimal.</P>
    <P>The full extent of hospital in-patient waiting lists could show that between 35,000 and 40,000 people await care. Because of the huge backlog in treatment many elective admissions have become urgent admissions.  Unless the matter is tackled comprehensively chaos will ensue.  For example, in excess of 10,000 people await treatment in the mid-Western Health Board area alone, the largest group of whom require orthopaedic procedures and hip replacements.  There are 2,000 people awaiting in-hospital treatment in Limerick Regional Hospital.  In <Col N="1319" /> my health board area, in the midlands the figures are even more depressing.  For example, there has been an almost 30 per cent increase in the numbers of people on waiting lists for in-patient services compared with those in 1992.  For ear, nose and throat services alone 750 people have been waiting an average of two and a half years for adenoid and tonsil removal.  I would remind the Minister that 450 of those are schoolchildren, many of whose studies and quality of life have been affected adversely over such a long waiting period.  In excess of 100 people have been waiting for full hip replacement for more than 12 months. Nobody needs reminding that anybody awaiting a full hip replacement is immobile and, at best, suffering a high degree of frustration as well as pain and discomfort. Thousands of pensioners await treatment for orthopaedic and sight-related conditions.  What better way to celebrate the Year of the Older Person than by relieving their suffering and clearing the waiting lists?</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that current lists are any less damning than those in the early months of 1992, contained in the results of the survey of waiting lists recently published.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, that list contains the following statistics: orthopaedics, 7,272; ENT, 5,497; surgery, 5,442; opthalmology, 4,100; gynaecology, 2,436; vascular, 2,334; plastic surgery, 2,192; cardiac surgery, 1,197; paediatrics 1,100, and so on giving a total, sorrowful list of approximately 36,421 people.  The evidence from the compilation of figures in the Department to date suggests that the figures for 1992 could be in excess of those I have just given.  These figures are shameful, they represent a damning indictment of the state of the nation's health services in relation to which any Minister for Health should hang his head in shame.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the waiting lists grow ever longer.  Elective treatment is being shelved as a result of a shortage of beds in many Dublin acute hospitals.  Many beds are being occupied by long stay patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> An increase in accident and emergency admissions has added to bed shortages. Neuro-surgery at Beaumont Hospital was hit recently as accident and emergency patients had to occupy beds designed for specialist treatment. Recently a non-emergency plan was imposed which will undoubtedly add further to the long lists of those waiting for elective treatment but every effort is being made at that hospital to manage bed places to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>Across the city at St. James's Hospital there is a serious shortage of bed places. In the area of urology the waiting lists for elective procedures have almost doubled within a period of six months.  One consultant has been quoted as saying that patients with cancers, on the waiting lists, are a source of particular concern.  Allowing for ministerial intervention in January last, the position remains totally unacceptable. In addition, in the Mater Hospital, many elective beds have been occupied by an increase in casualty admissions, automatically affecting the waiting lists.  The elective procedures lists are becoming longer and the position is deteriorating even further.  The position is particularly bad at the Meath Hospital where a senior consultant is reported to have said he has not had an elective patient admitted since the summer of 1992. He said they were living on a knife edge.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the problem obtaining.  Hundreds of beds have been taken out of use in all the capital's hospitals in recent years.  Will the Minister commit himself to reversing this trend and, if so, how?</P>
    <P>Before leaving the position in Dublin I might refer to the recent unfortunate &mdash; now happily ended &mdash; dispute within the Eastern Health Board area during which the former Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, denied having had any hand, act or part in the appointment of the person that gave rise to the dispute. Dr. O'Connell stated that he had not exercised any influence in the matter and I believe him.  I accept his absolute good faith in the matter.  I am satisfied that Dr. John O'Connell had no personal involvement in the appointment process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> However, the mechanism of ministerial direction under the Health Act, 1970, as deployed in the recent controversial appointment, must never be used as a device for abandoning accepted procedures of appointment as it would constitute a serious abuse and should not be tolerated.  In the light of the recent action firm practices must be established to ensure that strike action of the type we observed in the case of the most recent dispute, in the critical area of our health services, is no longer an option.  I am sure the new Minister will ensure that the type of mechanism that obtained, allowing such an appointment to be made, will not apply in the future.</P>
    <P>On the matter of waiting lists, I should remind the House that real hardship is being experienced by public patients unable to opt for private beds because they cannot afford to do so.  I have met many pensioners, I am sure every concerned Member of the House has also met them.  I am looking particularly at the benches supposedly occupied by the Minister's concerned backbenchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;many of whom have been strongest in their condemnation of the Minister's savage charges.  I have met many pensioners who have dipped into their life savings or who, in spite of having a medical card, have in their own words &ldquo;rifled the burial money&rdquo; in the interest of relieving pain.</P>
      <P>I have heard the Minister, since taking up office, speak on the matter of waiting lists and the need to pursue a line of positive action.  I accept that the Minister is not in office long, that it would not be fair to be unduly critical at this stage, that he is sincere but time is of the essence. People are demanding action but little is forthcoming.  There can be no honeymoon period when it comes to the treatment of the sick and the weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister demonstrate to the satisfaction of the House and, more importantly, to the satisfaction of the people generally that his effectiveness to <Col N="1322" /> date has been more than very limited? This matter must be taken in hand urgently and progress of some description must be seen to have been achieved if he is not to lose face very quickly. His plaintive cries from the Opposition benches, many of which are responsible for him being in the position he now holds, will return to haunt him in the night and at the same time of night as he announced the increase in health charges &mdash; close to midnight on the eve of the budget.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem has not yet been recognised.  We cannot deal effectively with the problem unless and until the extent of it is appreciated.  Announcements of the type referred to mean little unless they are accompanied by plenty of concrete action.  Besides the trauma, suffering and hardship being experienced by those who have been waiting years for hospital treatment, the costs of waiting must be borne in mind and appreciated in the context of the health service budget.</P>
    <P>The 1993 budget contained little to reflect the promises made either during the general election campaign or in the Programme for Government.  The £20 million injection is welcome if aimed directly at heart by-pass procedures, orthopaedics, ENT and urgent surgical cases.  In the £8 million allocation for services for people with disabilities the Government ignored the necessity to provide £14 million to honour commitments contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The Labour Party stands culpable on this issue as with many more.  The Minister's promise, in case he has forgotten it on the ascent to power, was to provide £25 million but the amount granted was considerably short of that figure.  The £4 million committed to subsidise nursing home costs for the old remains to be disbursed.  There appears to be no coherent plan in place and the extra £2 million for the public dental service is grossly inadequate in the context of the extremely long waiting lists for treatment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in spite of all the flowery rethoric about care, compassion and <Col N="1323" /> commitment we have yet to see any change from the dark days of the last six years when we had successive Fianna Fáil Health Ministers.  Admittedly, the Minister, apparently, has time on his side but not very much as people's expectations of his party's promises wear thin amid heightened cynicism throughout the country.  I hope he will not need to be reminded that two of the last three elections, namely those of 1987 and 1989, were triggered off, however technically, by health matters.  Tonight he can deliver on his promises to the needy, the sick and the vulnerable by revoking, his order to increase substantially the cost to families of health care before the Dáil tomorrow night, in true democratic spirit, declares that order null and void.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The 300 per cent increase in hospital out-patient charges and the 33.3 per cent increase in in-patient charges introduced by the Minister was a somersault matched only by the sneaky way in which it was introduced on the eve of the budget.  The introduction of these charges was a long way from what people had in mind when they thought they were voting for change. Having read the policy documents of the Labour Party which promised, under the heading of health &ldquo;to restore justice, concern and dignity to the way in which the State treats every member of our society irrespective of income&rdquo; I must say that I am baffled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there justice and concern when one asks patients to dig deeper into an already <Col N="1324" /> empty pocket to provide more money to run the health service?  What this means is that we are asking people who cannot afford to pay the present charges to cough up and look happy.</P>
    <P>The original charges were opposed with much vehemence in 1987 by Deputy Howlin.  In a debate on expenditure in the health services on 20 May 1987 he said and I quote from column 2588, volume 372 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The increase alluded to is the money that it is expected to collect from charges, £6 million from charges to outpatients and £6.5 million from charges to inpatients.  Those charges were levied by the Government with the collusion of Opposition parties. The Labour Party have resisted those charges and tabled a motion to rescind them because we consider them to be fundamentally unjust.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say merely that they were unjust but that they were fundamentally unjust.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> How can something that is fundamentally unjust, and which caused the Labour Party to howl in anger a few years ago, allow the same party to increase the charges to make them even more fundamentally unjust?  Is the idealism of ethics in Government just idealism or can the Labour Party rock and roll even better than the party it criticised so freely and later joined in coalition?</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin went on to say:</P>
      <P>Those charges were supported by the Progressive Democrats.  It is time all parties in the House behaved in a responsible manner rather than trying to have it both ways; supporting a general strategy while making political capital when the details are unveiled at ground level.</P>
      <P>Let me suggest that nobody more than the members of the Labour Party in the past election tried successfully to have it both ways by saying one thing and doing another.</P>
      <P>While I need not expand on Fianna Fáil's attitude to hospital charges &mdash; we all remember the slogan about health cuts affecting the old, the sick and the handicapped &mdash; it is only fair to quote what the then Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, said in the same debate: &ldquo;the members of our party are sensitive to the needs of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped.&rdquo; Obviously, the members of his party do not seem to be any more sensitive than they were when they used the sick, the elderly and the handicapped for cynical political purposes before the 1987 election.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin went on to say in the same debate:</P>
      <P>I now call on the Minister to take the action he urged a few short months ago to protect the basic fabric of our health services.  The issues we addressed are of prime importance.  Politics has been played with the health services and a cruel deception was perpetrated on the electorate by the Fianna Fáil in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Those words still ring true in 1993 except that the deception was not perpetrated by Fianna Fáil on its own but by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party in particular who conned the people in so many ways. What has happened to the idealism the Minister had when he was able to howl about the charges and describe them as being fundamentally unjust?  What has happened since he was elevated to the status of Minister that he can increase charges that were fundamentally unjust at a lower level and which are, apparently, not even unjust at an increased level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I have in front of me a copy of the <i>Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i> It is fast becoming a hallmark of debates of this nature in the Chamber that partnership goes out the window, that the Minister with a sticky wicket comes in to bat with one or two of his soulmates while his partners in Government wring their hands.  Indeed, the Minister's own colleagues wring their hands in condemnation of these actions at local authority meetings.  They are telling the public they are opposed to them and will take it up with the Minister.  It is high time that the hypocrisy referred to by the previous speaker, and the backbiting within the partnership ended.  These are Government decisions and the Government backs them.  The public at large are not swallowing the present posturing by members of the parties in this partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of raising £20 million by increasing the charges to shorten the waiting lists is admirable to the extent that we all agree that waiting lists for hip, <Col N="1329" /> cataract and ENT operations are too long and that people deserve attention immediately, but the Minister's logic is somewhat flawed in this regard.  I believe that those who will be hit most by the charges will find themselves on public waiting lists because they will be forced out of the VHI as they will no longer be able afford to pay for private care.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the charges introduced by the Minister.  It would be over the mark to describe the increase in out-patient charges as a sleight of hand but his presentation of the facts is close to it.  He alleges that the out-patient charge is being reduced from £10 to £6 with a maximum charge of £42.  The Minister is either promoting an out-patient service which is inadequate, because he is encouraging the patient not to return for treatment, or he has to accept that for full and proper treatment it will cost significantly more than in the past.  In this regard I refer the Minister to comments made by a member of the medical profession in the other party in Government, Deputy McDaid in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 28 February 1993:</P>
    <P>The ideal system is where a patient is charged a single fee for the first and later visits for the same condition.</P>
    <P>That appears to make good medical sense because there is the danger that patients who need follow-up treatment at out-patients will not return for financial reasons if they incur a higher charge than the £10 &mdash; in other words, they cannot return for the second visit.  That appears to be flawed on economic and medical grounds and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  In-patient charges have increased from £15 to £20 to a maximum of £200 and private and semi-private beds will go up by £20.  In this context we must ask who will be hit by these increases.  The following categories are exempt: infants up to six weeks, those on medical cards, pregnant women, which is very welcome. At the other end of the scale it will not affect unduly those who can easily afford VHI cover.  The VHI themselves estimate that costs will increase by £10 million and therefore premia will have to <Col N="1330" /> increase.  This will definitely hit those who can now marginally afford to pay their VHI premium, those who scrimp and save to pay their premium so that they are not a burden on the State.  The middle income group &mdash; those who get up each morning and go to work who are targeted already by the Government's 1 per cent levy &mdash; are again to be targeted by this increase in the VHI premia.  This sector of the population by and large fund most of the social services and to a large extent they are excluded from them, yet they are again being targeted by these proposals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan questioned these proposals.  The Minister made a statement over the weekend that there were no imminent increases likely in the VHI premia.  It will cost the VHI approximately &mdash; the Minister has research on this available to him &mdash; £10 million in increased payments.  This is a figure from the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i> I do not have a more informed source but I listened to the Minister with interest.  The VHI is in the process of preparing for competition, which will be welcome provided it is on a level playing field.  An article on the front page of the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, which comments on a Department proposal which is now policy, states:</P>
    <P>The Department confirmed this week that it is now public policy to move towards charging VHI &ldquo;the full economic rate&rdquo; for such facilities.</P>
    <P>These are additional cost factors which will inevitably lead to an increase in VHI premia, yet the Minister stated at the weekend there will be no increase in premia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have it both ways: either the commercial viability of the VHI will be undermined or there will be increases in VHI premia.  The Minister has to face this reality and tell us the true position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation poses serious problems for the patient and I believe it fundamentally undermines the commercial <Col N="1331" /> viability of the VHI.  The £20 increase in the charge for private beds will cost VHI approximately £10 million annually in higher payouts.  Coupled with the stated policy of charging them the full economic rate means an inevitable and unaffordable premium hike for their subscribers. It will also seriously impact on an already overcrowded and unde-financed public health service.  Those unable to afford the premium increase will opt out of the VHI and join the lengthening waiting lists which these charges were, ironically, designed to eliminate, I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion before the House and honour the commitments and the tone of contributions made by him in the last Dáil when he was in Opposition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in view of Government policy, not merely to maintain health services at their existing level, but also to ensure that the substantial developments provided for in this year's budget, for example, to reduce waiting time for admission to hospital and to provide additional services and facilities for persons with mental and physical handicap, are implemented, Dáil Éireann approves the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993 and the Health (Out-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. Nos. 50 of 1993 and 51 of 1993 respectively).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say at the outset that I have <Col N="1332" /> never made a secret of my opposition to charges where the aim is to limit access to services.  I have been opposed to such charges in the past and I remain opposed to them.  A limitation on access to necessary hospital treatment is both inequitable and, ultimately may be counter productive as it simply could lead to treatment being postponed when the costs of treating the condition might increase significantly.</P>
    <P>Health charges, of course, are not new to the health services.  Indeed, I am surprised that Deputy Flanagan and his Fine Gael colleagues, have seen fit to put such a motion to the House particularly in the light of the stance adopted by the Deputy and his party in the past on the question of charges.  When a vote was put to this House to approve the charges in 1987 Fine Gael abstained when they had the opportunity to defeat the Government on the issue and abolish the charges.  May I also remind the Deputy &mdash; this is interesting in terms of acrobats and alleged hypocricy &mdash; that when Fine Gael had the opportunity to abolish these charges at their inception, it failed at the first hurdle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy finds it hard to listen to the truth.  Medical card holders are by definition those who are unable to pay for general practitioner services and drugs from within their own resources without undue hardship.  Medical card holders are the poorest of the poor.  They are the most vulnerable group in our society.  Yet, Fine Gael saw fit to seek to impose additional hardship on GMS patients through the pursuit of a socially regressive policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised charges decided on by this Government have been introduced, not to deny services, but rather to maintain the principle of cost sharing in the health system.  The <Col N="1333" /> Government took the decision in the context of the problem, which exists universally, that costs of health services continue to rise inexorably and invariably well in excess of inflation.  Indeed, when I spoke in the House on 4 March in regard to the 1993 budget I emphasised that this would be a difficult year and that services will only be maintained at last year's approved levels if agencies meet specific targets on income and savings and if there is specific agreement on activity levels in major general hospitals.  There are no easy options left for any Government here or anywhere in the US or the Scandinavian countries who are much richer than ourselves, when it comes to dealing with the health services.  To impose all additional costs on the Exchequer is an option which, quite frankly, is not realistic and the Deputies opposite know that only too well.</P>
      <P>However, the Government's commitment to maintaining standards of care and treatment is clear from the level of resources it has decided to expend on the Health Estimate in 1993.  The funding agreed by Government for this year is more than £1,700 million and equates to a rise of 12 per cent over the original net Estimates for 1992.  This represents an increase of about £183 million over last year and underlines more than anything else the determination of this Government, and myself as Minister for Health, to provide resources to keep services at reasonable levels.</P>
      <P>The £1.7 billion provided also represents over one-fifth of all spending on supply services by the Government during this year, £1 out of every £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no increase in services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr Howlin Mr Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deny that the negotiations at Cabinet concerning the 1993 Estimates for the health services were tough and very detailed.  All areas were examined to see if savings could be made to better control increases in public expenditure and borrowing.  Neither I, nor any of my colleagues in Cabinet, were given all that we sought in our respective <Col N="1334" /> Departments.  However, my efforts at Cabinet have been successful in providing a satisfactory increase in the Health Estimate.  Nevertheless, agencies must anticipate 1993 as being a year that does require the utmost dedication in seeking out all opportunities for efficiencies whether it be in the areas of pay, non-pay or income.</P>
      <P>In essence, therefore, the decisions on hospital charges were taken by Government in the context of providing defined service levels in a year of tight restrictions on spending while at the same time ensuring that agencies are achieving all possible efficiencies.  While I have secured a substantial increase in funding for the services it is also necessary for the agencies, who are in receipt of that funding, to play their part in getting the optimum return from the very considerable investment by the State.  The income from charges represents a cost sharing approach towards meeting the expenditure incurred by agencies in providing the approved level of services.  However, the estimated additional income of about £7 million from the charges in 1993 &mdash; that includes all charges, in-patient, out-patient and the additional imposition on private patients &mdash; must be offset against the extra £183 million that I have secured for services.  Exchequer spending on health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The ever growing share of national wealth devoted to health spending must be contained if we are not to be faced at some point in the future with a crisis of funding and cost-sharing measures do have a role to play in containing Government funding.  All of us are familiar with <Col N="1335" /> the reasons health costs accelerate every year despite the best efforts of all concerned. We know that ever improving medical technology plays a key role in the increase of costs; we know that health is a demand led area, and we know that people's expectations rise not only yearly but monthly.  Nevertheless, the charges do not in any way imply or put into effect a means of denying persons access to treatment.  The services are there to be used by the community when it is necessary for them to do so and I could not, as Minister for Health, accept a situation where artificial barriers are erected to effectively deny access.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern expressed that the payment of the £6 hospital out-patient charge may provoke people to seek hospital treatment rather than attend their general practitioner.  Indeed, I have been attacked for reducing the charge too much, that £6 for an individual up to a maximum of £42, and £60 maximum for a family represents an incentive for people not to attend their GPs.  I am being attacked on both sides, some people saying it is too cheap and others saying it is too expensive.  It is very hard to get the balance right.  However, my objective is to develop services at community care level so that people are treated in the environment that is appropriate to their condition, not to force them into hospital or non-hospital treatment which may not be right for them.  I firmly believe that patients will want to get the treatment they need in the environment that is most appropriate for them, and a £6 charge at out-patient departments will not change patients' attitudes one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the relevant legislation substantial numbers of persons are not liable for hospital charges.  For a start, all medical card holders and their dependants are exempted and almost 36 per cent of the entire population are in this category. Women receiving services in respect of motherhood and children up to the age of six weeks are also exempted.  Children referred to hospital for services arising from examinations at child health clinics <Col N="1336" /> or in the course of school health examinations are exempted, as are children suffering from certain diseases or disabilities &mdash; for example, mental handicap, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy.  Persons receiving medical services in respect of certain infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Acts are not liable for these charges, nor are persons in receipt of long term care in geriatric, psychiatric or mental handicap institutions.</P>
    <P>In his motion Deputy Flanagan refers to the hardship that will accrue as a result of the recent increase in charges.  This brings me to a very important provision in the hospital charges legislation and, indeed, in the health services legislation generally.  Deputy Flanagan is failing to recognise this provision when he refers to hardship arising from the increases in hospital charges.  I am referring to the discretionary powers statutorily conferred on the chief executive officers of the health boards which enable them to waive these charges in any cases where they consider that payment of the charges would result in undue hardship for the individuals concerned.  I have already asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to be mindful of these hardship provisions, particularly in cases where a number of members of the same family may be subject to the charges in the same 12 months period.</P>

      <P>If the hardship provision is applied sympathetically, and I have no reason to think it is not, the payment of charges should not cause a serious hardship.  However, I want to emphasise to the House that I am fully conscious of the genuine concerns that are felt by people in regard to many aspects of the charges.  My Department will be continuously monitoring the implication of the charges to ensure that the hardship provision works satisfactorily.  My paramount concern, as I have indicated, is that access to services is not denied to those who need them and every other consideration, including financial, must take second place to that basic principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sufficient safeguards also exist in VHI cover to ensure that nobody is subjected to hardship as a result of meeting these charges.  For persons who are not in the exempted categories and who may not qualify for exemption from the charges on hardship grounds, private health insurance cover against the charges is available from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board at a very modest cost. The VHI offers subscribers an insurance plan &mdash; I want to underscore this because some people are not aware of it &mdash; which is called Plan P and is specifically designed for the purpose of covering liability for public hospital charges alone. The current rates of premia under Plan P are £11.60 per annum for an adult and £5.05 per annum for a child.  Premia are lower still for members of group schemes, the adult rate being £10.50 and the rate per child is £4.55.  If a person is not covered and is exempted completely by being in the poorest category &mdash; for example, a worker whose income does not entitle him to a medical card &mdash; he can insure himself for £11.60 per year.  Is that the terrible hardship the Deputies opposite are talking about?  Approximately 110,000 persons are in Plan P. I <Col N="1338" /> think it is fair to say that its existence is still not widely known.  It offers excellent value for money and I would like to see it promoted more widely to the general population.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by Deputy Flanagan of the adverse effects of the increases in charges on the premia paid by subscribers to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I want to assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the role played by the board in the health services of this country.  It is of course the main insurer of private medical costs here and is critical to maintaining the present balance between public and private care. Decisions which would destroy that balance could only lead to an impossible burden being placed on the public system.  Therefore, I am determined to see that the board will maintain its financial viability and its profile as a key player in the overall health system.  I am equally determined that the VHI provides a cost effective service to its members particularly in preparing itself for the Single Market in health insurance. This must come into being before July 1994 and my Department is preparing the legislation to give effect to the opening of the market.</P>
    <P>The Single Market will potentially present a very different competitive situation for VHI.  It must adapt from having a virtual monopoly of the insurance market to competing with other insurance companies for members. I want the VHI Board to be ready to compete in such an arena, and to do this it will be necessary for every part of its operations to be examined in detail.  I have therefore asked my Department and VHI to look at key areas of the board's work to see what issues should now be considered in preparation for the Single Market.  Pending the outcome of these discussions, it is clearly not possible to say what effect, if any, the revised hospital charges might have on premia.</P>

      <P>One issue of fundamental importance to any Minister for Health must be whether the charges made by public hospitals for accommodation in semi-private and private beds bear a reasonable relationship to the real costs of providing a service to VHI members. Maybe the Deputies opposite do not want that.  Maybe they want the public health service to cross-subsidise the private service to an unacceptable degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The true cost of providing those services is very much higher than the current rate, particularly in our acute hospitals.  Indeed the VHI has publicly accepted quite recently that the charges do not represent the true cost of the services provided by public hospitals. Furthermore, it should be noted that private and semi-private maintenance charges in public hospitals have not been increased since August 1991.  Therefore when account is taken of all the various expenditure elements in the major public agencies there is a level of subsidy enjoyed by VHI when their members are treated in public hospitals.  It is not my intention to eliminate that subsidy &mdash; that would be going too far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister is making people pay twice as much.</P>
      <P>I might also remind the House that the changes in health services eligibility in 1991 created a new situation where the entire population had eligibility for public ward services.  The result is that since those changes patients entering hospital have a right to decide whether they wish to be treated as public or private patients. If they choose the latter course then they have, of course, taken an explicit decision to be treated as a private patient.  The previous position was that those in the upper income category had to pay consultant fees if they wished to be treated on a private basis, but in many cases such patients were treated in public beds.  This meant that the hospital gained no income benefit from their being treated as private.  This has now changed and it is fair to expect private patients to pay a reasonable proportion of the true costs of delivering high quality services to them, particularly as they have taken an explicit decision to be treated in non-public accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes approved by the Government are basically a cost sharing approach to one of the most fundamental problems facing any society today, that is, how and to what level should health services be funded.  I have already set out the Government's commitment to the services, a commitment which is all the more significant given the economic climate that prevails here and abroad.  The <Col N="1341" /> implications of abolishing the charges or holding them at the present level are obvious and it would be dishonest of anybody in this House to say otherwise.  If decisions had not been taken by Government to increase the charges it would have seriously affected the possibility of the developments proceeding.  I will outline some of the developments.</P>
    <P>The House will know that a sum of £20 million has been set aside to reduce long waiting times for admission to hospital. That sum will fund a special action programme which will be targeted at waiting times where particular problems have occurred.  This programme will include action on orthopaedic services, cardiac surgery and, for children, the establishment of a maximum waiting period of six months for ENT or eye treatment.  I am sure all Deputies will welcome that.</P>
    <P>In the area of persons with disabilities, the Government has provided this year a special additional allocation of £8 million for a series of service improvements; I might add that the £8 million will be additional to the extra funding of £6 million made available in 1992 which is being repeated this year.  In accordance with the commitment under the Programme for a Partnership Government mental handicap services will benefit significantly from this extra funding, including 70 additional residental and 220 day places and extra home support for up to 900 families.</P>
    <P>There will be improved services for people with physical or sensory disabilities including more independent residential units and additional day care places.</P>
    <P>I am improving services for the elderly with the introduction on 1 May of provisions of the Nursing Homes Act.  The House will be aware that I have made a sum of £4 million available for their implementation.</P>
    <P>It was my aim during the discussions at Cabinet on the 1993 Estimates to ensure that these developments would be implemented with adequate funding.  I sought and got adequate funding in the teeth of the most difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> I have demonstrated to this House tonight that the fears expressed by Deputy Flanagan and his colleagues are unfounded.  There are safeguards to prevent hardship being experienced by individuals and families arising from payment of the charges.  Well over 40 per cent of the population are excluded or exempt and anybody with an income that does not exclude him can insure himself for £11.60 a year against those charges.</P>

I am sure that over the four and a half years of government the programme will be delivered.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has campaigned very strongly for medical cards to be dealt with on the basis of net income as the existing system was grossly unfair in not taking into account the substantial deductions from PAYE workers, many of whom found it more beneficial to leave employment to get unemployment benefits of one sort or another and to qualify for medical cards.

      <P>There was only one paragraph in three of the national papers on that issue, the most important single development in the health services.  That decision will have a very big bearing on what we are discussing tonight because medical card holders represent a large proportion of people who will need in-patient and out-patient treatment.  In my health board area, which is typical, as high as 35 per cent of all in-patients and out-patients are medical card holders, when we include their families.  That figure would increase to nearly 50 per cent, taking net income into account. <Col N="1344" /> Because of the lack of publicity, thousands of people do not know of this important development or that a Labour Party in Government initiated it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health is totally opposed to any move which would prevent access to hospital services and the revised charges will not have that effect.  The Government has decided on revised charges purely as a cost-sharing arrangement.  This is necessary to allow developments to proceed and to maintain services.  This Government is fully committed to maintaining standards in public hospitals.  It has increased Exchequer funding for health services by 12 per cent over the original 1992 figure and this demonstrates its determination to maintain service levels.</P>
      <P>The Government has made this commitment despite other pressures on the Exchequer and the difficulties in the general economy.  Health now consumes over one fifth of total Government non-capital spending.</P>
      <P>It is very important to note that there are a number of exemptions from the charges for instance medical card holders and dependants, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to six weeks are exempted, children referred to hospital for service, arising from examinations at child health clinics or in the course of school health examinations, children suffering from a number of diseases and disabilities, persons receiving medical services in respect of certain infectious diseases, persons in receipt of long term institutional care. These have not been mentioned by anybody so far.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister asking the chief executive officers of health boards waive the charge in cases of hardship.  Access to services should not be influenced by a person's ability to pay the charge.  The Minister referred to VHI cover, a very small premium of £10.50 for an adult and £4.50 for a child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to focus our attention on the general issue of the escalating costs of our health service.  As the Minister has said, the 1993 Health Vote is £1,700 million, an increase of £183.1 million or an increase of 12 per cent on last year's Vote, representing one-fifth of all Government current spending.  The allocation <Col N="1346" /> of such a large share of our natural resources can no longer continue without an ongoing evaluation analysis of whether we are getting value for money and, more importantly, whether we are achieving an efficient health service for all our people.</P>
      <P>The increases in hospital charges are depressing, but they represent life as it is.  The health budget is one of those areas of public policy which tends to eat up money and could go on forever unless we actually introduce strict cost containments. The Government must take stock and see where we can cut down and halt these escalating costs.  From the figures available to me much of the expense appears to relate to the very high running costs of our acute hospitals. Diagnostic equipment appears to be the main item of expenditure in our hospitals.  It is interesting to note that, on the non-capital side, spending is in relation to staffing.  Staffing costs are increasing continually and yet medical staff numbers are decreasing.  We must examine whether this is due to a very weighty bureaucracy and administrative system, and perhaps a review could home in on this aspect.  The budget failed to address the continuing rise in public service pay.  Those costs are increasing continually. We must examine where staffing costs are increasing.  I would ask whether our spending on staffing is in the right area?  For example, there is a massive overtime cost for radiographers which is due to a ban on recruitment.  Perhaps this is one area where we could look at reducing costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the profile of admissions to our acute hospitals, it has been pointed out to me that many of the waiting lists in our large acute hospitals are due to the fact that there may be inappropriate referrals and admissions of geriatric patients, some of whom may have been referred there by a locum during the weekend.  There may be a case to be made for a second layer of hospital which would provide the level of care required by these patients.  In many cases this type of patient is not in need of the very highly <Col N="1347" /> specialised care provided in our acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>In terms of cost reduction it is time to focus more on the enhancement of our primary care services throughout the country.  Because of the high cost of hospitals to the State and the knock-on effect to VHI subscribers it is time to resource our general practitioners and help them to enhance their practices, so that patients who turn up at a GPs practice can be dealt with conclusively at that point in the primary care system rather than using the hospital service, which may not be appropriate and is very expensive. Also, our community health services at primary level could deal with much illness.</P>
    <P>An item which amazed me recently &mdash; and on which I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister &mdash; was the high cost to the State of providing medical indemnity insurance for hospital consultants. Last year the cost was £9 million. We must examine whether we may be able to deal with that risk rather than pay the consultants premia, or deal with it in a different way.</P>
    <P>It is both unfortunate and inevitable that hospital charges will mean a 5 per cent increase in VHI subscriptions, which is in excess of inflation.  We have to presume those increases will follow.  That is hot on the heels of the 4 per cent increase in January.  It must be pointed out that, with 1.2 million VHI subscribers, this matter directly concerns 34 per cent of the population.  I realise the Minister said that 36 per cent of people in Ireland are exempt from the charges &mdash; and this is as it should be &mdash; but an unnecessary burden is all the time falling on the same sector or Irish society, the middle income sector.  The people who subscribe to VHI pay through the nose for everything else. If the VHI is to survive and provide a good service which is affordable and attractive to new members and also protect the balance &mdash; to which the Minister referred &mdash; between public and private care, we must be careful that those middle income families are not overburdened, because in the long term it <Col N="1348" /> may become a disincentive to do well and continue to get up every morning, go to work and pay taxes and do all the decent things one expects of the ordinary punter in the street who pays for everything.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that those who opt for private health insurance are already paying for the health services through their taxes in the ordinary way. Second, they pay through their health levy contributions, and many of them feel they receive nothing in return.  Third, they pay through their VHI subscriptions. The people who pay those subscriptions each year are already hard pressed with mortgage repayments and all the other things to which I referred earlier.  If they felt that the service in hospitals would improve &mdash; in other words, if those people who opt for a private room felt it was comfortable and that they were getting a very good level of care &mdash; they would not mind paying the increased charges.  These charges will not go back into improving hospital services or private facilities but will go into the Exchequer to fund the many excellent schemes which the Minister has planned for this year.  I am not taking away from that; rather I am delighted that more money is being ploughed into facilities for the disabled, people with a mental handicap and care of the elderly.  If we are to maintain that very important balance between public and private care we must ensure that the same people do not feel they have to take up the tab all the time. How can a hospital room be so expensive? In his contribution the Minister referred to the fact that the actual cost does not meet the real cost.  The cost is almost as expensive as a room in the Shelbourne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extraordinary, and it is all part of what we must examine. I telephoned the Shelbourne Hotel today and asked the cost of a standard room.  I was informed that it is £125 per day or, for a room with a view of St. Stephen's Green, £145.  Why should a room in a public hospital be so expensive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> We must have answers to those reasonable questions, otherwise people might opt to book into the Shelbourne Hotel and have consultants visit them there, perhaps in a room with a view of Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>The Government must continue to support the VHI.  The VHI has done remarkable work since 1987 and 1988 when it was losing £25 million per annum. Thanks to a very good recovery plan initiated at that time, and the introduction of cost containment measures with participating hospitals, the board operated so efficiently last year that the Government felt able to impose a levy of £3 million on it.  Much credit is due to the board for the advances it has made in the management of its service.  The VHI has a simple, straightforward and admirable objective, to give comprehensive cover at affordable prices which are attractive to new members.</P>
    <P>In its annual report to February 1992, published yesterday, the board showed a profit of £8.4 million and it is on target to achieve a minimum reserve of £37 million next year.  That was before the Government's charges were announced which, of course, will have an adverse effect on its profits.  I understand the VHI cannot increase subscriptions until renewal date and this is unfortunate as the board will have to pick up the tab from July for the increased hospital charges.  It is unlikely that the Minister will refuse to allow the VHI to increase its subscriptions, but if they continue to escalate in this fashion, which is much above inflation, there is a danger that many people will decide it is unaffordable, not worth it.  If they are healthy they may opt out of the system and fall back on the already over burdened public health care system.  We must ensure this does not happen.</P>
    <P>There is a danger with this partnership Government that the Labour Party will be driven only by the need to address the disadvantaged in society.  That is an admirable goal but on a range of public policy issues, such as education, health and social welfare there is a danger that in pursuing that goal the Labour Party <Col N="1350" /> may forget the large number of people who voted for it in the recent general election, the middle income sector to which I referred.  People regularly tell me they are worried that it will soon be a disadvantage to be a member of the middle income sector given the bias the Labour Party is showing towards tackling only the problems of the disadvantaged. We must have a balance which will not be unfairly harsh on that sector of society which pays for everybody else through their taxes.</P>
    <P>There must be an independent review of hospital charges.  Some effort is being made in this regard and a scheme has been set up to analyse the various hospital costs.  That is the way forward and I look forward to more of that type of good management of public finances in the health area.</P>
    <P>With an increasing ageing population we must plan now for the contingency that elderly people will live longer and need health care services.  For example, the cost per bed per annum in St. Camillus's city home in Limerick is £15,000. We must question whether such city and county homes are the appropriate places to care for our elderly, many of whom would prefer to be cared for in their community or in their homes by their relatives.  I ask the Minister to urgently review means testing of the carer's allowance. That scheme is possibly the best available in regard to the care of our elderly, the sick and the disabled and is the way forward to reducing the cost of institutional health care for geriatric patients.  We should facilitate such old people by allowing them to be cared for by their relatives.  As the Minister is aware, the carer's allowance has been taken up by only 4,500 people because of the strict eligibility rules that apply to means.  I urge the Minister, and the Minister for Social Welfare, to devise a more responsive and realistic means test for this valuable service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment that the money from those increased charges is to be focussed on waiting lists and the care of people with a mental handicap.  This is long overdue.  I appeal <Col N="1351" /> to the Minister to keep us informed of the measures the Government will undertake to stop the escalating costs of health services. I urge him to look to where savings can be made because the present costs will not be sustained for much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to a thoughtful contribution from Deputy O'Donnell.  The only option she did not suggest was the opening of an out-patient's clinic in the Horseshoe Bar. That begs the question about the cost in real terms of hospitalisation which is astronomical and should be avoided if possible.  Of course health board members will demand the building of exclusive hospitals at every crossroads in the country, but if funds are available in the Department of Health they would be better spent on primary care.  Patients could be cared for at home at the least possible cost to the Exchequer by liberalising means testing for the carer's allowance thus giving people the satisfaction of remaining at home instead of becoming institutionalised.  If primary medical care was available at little or no cost to as many as possible in the community, the savings to the Exchequer would be so great that we could devote much of this massive health Estimate to many other priority areas.  If people did not have the worry of paying £10 or £15 each time they visit their doctor, I am sure more hospital beds, which cost thousands of pounds per week, might be available whether in the Blackrock clinic or a county hospital.  That is the way I would like to see some of the health services devolved.  Countries which devote most of their efforts to primary care costs have found that this is the best value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity <Col N="1352" /> to raise this issue on the Adjournment. It is with a sense of regret and sadness that I find it necessary to raise the matter of the sudden and rather abrupt closure of Tipperary textiles in Thurles with a loss of 64 jobs.  This news has shocked and devastated the very loyal and dedicated workforce.  They are disillusioned and demoralised and find it difficult to accept that their livelihoods and future have been swept from them in an unexpected swoop.  Many of them with young families have heavy financial commitments, including mortgages. They are now to become an anonymous statistic with the other 300,000 unemployed. Their future is dark and bleak as alternative employment is not available in the locality.</P>
      <P>This is a further hammer blow to an already depressed local economy.  Thurles town has endured an alarming level of closures, job losses, rationalisation programmes and industrial stagnation. For 32 years Tipperary Textiles was an integral part of the commercial and economic life of the area.  The loss of a £10,000 per week payroll, together with the impact on local supply and service companies, is substantial and significant. Thurles is fast becoming an industrial wilderness.  It has paid a heavy price for Government neglect and indifference.  Its commercial base has been eroded to such an extent that it cannot absorb blows like this without suffering permanent damage.  The basic fabric of our town is now threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to realise and accept the seriousness of the situation. The people of Thurles are tired of false and broken promises and the announcement of phantom jobs.  They are jaded from soft talk, pious platitudes and ministerial humbug.  They demand, and are entitled to, positive corrective action.  They want their share of viable and sustainable job opportunities. Despite having so-called Ministerial clout, proposals for the provision of a third level institution in Thurles have been ignored.  The proposal for the designation of Thurles under the urban renewal scheme was dismissed and, <Col N="1353" /> despite its geographic location and general suitability, the town has been overlooked under the Government's decentralisation scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the closure of Tipperary Textiles, I ask that priority be given to protect and honour the entitlements of the workforce.  I am also disturbed about and conscious of the immense damage which can be inflicted on the suppliers of services and materials who are owed substantial moneys by the company.  Failure by the liquidator to raise sufficient funds from disposable assets to provide for these creditors will put other companies and jobs at risk.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister in the first instance to mobilise all relevant State agencies to ensure that every effort is made to sell Tipperary Textiles as a going concern.  Its product is excellent, the expertise and skill is available and the markets are sufficient to sustain a scaled down operation.  It is imperative that, before final decisions are taken, an exhaustive study is carried out to ensure that all company property, plant and material are at the disposal of the liquidator in a concerted and determined effort to get the best deal possible for the despairing workforce and unfortunate creditors.  I wish to place on the record of the House my intention to monitor the sale of the assets, the identity of the purchasers and the location to which the plant or equipment will be redeployed.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that the Minister's Department should have in place a formula and code of conduct which would apply to closure announcements.  At present communication with the workforce on such serious and far-reaching decisions is haphazard and insensitive in many such instances.  It is totally unacceptable that a worker can one minute be diligently performing his duty and minutes later be outside the door, locked out without a full and reasonable explanation for that decision.  To be told one is no longer employed is a shattering and traumatic experience.  It is a sad reality that all too often managment ignore the tragic and human consequences of their decisions and are more interested in conducting <Col N="1354" /> and implementing the economic and logistic diktats of their superiors.  It is a deeply disturbing time for a workforce who deserve to be dealt with in a caring and sympathetic fashion.</P>
    <P>The experience of Tipperary Textiles will be repeated throughout the country in the coming months as a result of Government policy and inaction.  The textile industry has been mortally wounded by the impact of the currency crisis. My party Leader, Deputy John Bruton, was the only politician with the courage and vision to propose a devaluation of the Irish punt as a solution to the crisis. His sound advice was ignored by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste.  Textile workers are now paying the penalty for this fiasco.  To compound the problem, the Minister for Finance has imposed a further 5 per cent VAT penalty on the textile sector.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this matter on he Adjournment. I share the Deputy's concern that the workers should be treated in as sensitive and caring a manner as possible.  One would hope that all employers in similar situations would conduct their business in this way.  I do not know enough about the way the workers were treated in this instance to comment on the matter, but I would be glad to speak to the Deputy about it.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy will be aware of the background to Tipperary Textiles.  On occasions like this Ministers are given endless pages of background information which is of little relevance, because the person who raises the matter and the other Deputies from the area know much more that I would ever know about the background to the case.  I am aware of the move from Rathdowney to Thurles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the currency crises.  The Government &mdash; I was very much involved in this &mdash; set up the market development fund.  This is not to say that the fund on its own would have been able to work all the miracles one would have wished, but many firms were helped <Col N="1355" /> during that difficult period.  The Deputy refered to Deputy John Bruton's call for devaluation &mdash; late in the day, I might add.  He was trounced by his Finance spokesperson at that time in regard to the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, an official liquidator will be appointed at 6 April meeting. There will be various options before the liquidator at that time.  I will ask the IDA, with whom I have been in contact today, to look at every aspect of Tipperary Textiles in the lead up to that meeting to see if any aspect of the company's activities can be retained.  I will also speak with the Deputy and the IDA in an effort to monitor how the workers have been and will be treated.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for coming in to reply in person.</P>
      <P>Alcoholism and alcohol-related problems make a very heavy demand on our psychiatric services.  Three years ago alcohol abuse accounted for 24 per cent of all admissions to health board psychiatric hospitals.  In total there were 6,608 admissions to public psychiatric hospitals in 1989 and of these 2,234 were first admissions.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this month the Minister hosted a conference under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board and delivered an excellent address.  The conference was attended by experts in this field from Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe, certain differences of opinion were evident and this is the reason I raise this matter.</P>
      <P>In the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; it was stated that the trend in Ireland was towards greater specialisation in the management of alcohol-related problems, that this approach often involved costly in-patient care which tended to separate the treatment and management of alcohol-related problems from the community, medical and social services. The report questioned the wisdom of this approach on the grounds that there was no evidence that intensive high cost in-patient treatment was in any way superior to simple, inexpensive community-based intervention, which is much more cost effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider all the options available.  Each should be considered and should not be exclusive of another.  We should have a national policy on the treatment of alcoholism and alcohol abuse.  In the Minister's own constituency of Wexford and in mine of <Col N="1357" /> Tipperary, Sister Eileen Fahy of Aiseiri is giving a tremendous service in a drug free environment to people from all walks of life.  Her service has been recognised by an award of Tipperary Person of the Year and by a civic reception by the chairperson and members of Tipperary South Riding County Council.  She has been recognised by all the State and semi-State agencies such as Telecom Éireann, An Post, the ESB, the Garda Síochána and the prison officers.  All her ideas have been used for the benefit of these major employers.  She has now commissioned an independent survey by an eminent professor from one of our leading universities. I am sure this report, when completed, will confirm that there is merit in her system and that it is indeed cost effective.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will avail of an early opportunity to meet people like Sister Eileen Fahy and to talk with her and the other experts in the public service with a view to approaching this major problem in a rational and structured way; this problem has been the cause of many man hours lost to industry, broken homes, crime, rape, incest and many others.  Much of this comes down to the abuse of alcohol and there is a responsibility on all of us to try to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Ferris for raising this important issue and allowing me the opportunity to address the House on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of alcohol dependence in this country, as in many others, developed within the psychiatric services. Information on those treated for alcoholism is available only for those treated in psychiatric hospitals and units.  In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 6,608 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units with the diagnosis &ldquo;alcohol related disorders&rdquo;. This number of admissions represented a rate of 186.6 per 100,000 and was the second most frequent reason for admission to our psychiatric hospitals and units.  Of all admissions for alcohol <Col N="1358" /> related disorders, 2,234 or 29.5 per cent were first time admissions and the remainder were on their second or subsequent admission.  Between 1980 and 1989 there was a slight drop in the number of admissions and admission rates per 100,000 population for alcohol related disorders.  This fall is probably due to the growth of alternative treatment centres outside the psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>The report of a study group on the development of the psychiatric services, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; published in 1984 questioned the need for so many persons with alcohol related disorders being referred for treatment to psychiatric hospitals and units.  This approach often involved costly in-patient care which tended to separate the treatment and management of alcohol related problems from community and social services. The report questioned the wisdom of this approach on the following grounds.  First, there was no evidence that intensive, high cost in-patient treatment was in any way superior to community based intervention. Compared with the latter form of management, the intensive approach was not considered to be cost effective. Second, the over specialised approach to alcohol-related problems was also a separatist approach.  It drew the problem away from the community and family and tended to exclude the contribution of primary medical and social services from the management of the problem.  To that extent, it ran counter to the general principles of the delivery of health care which stress that help to individuals and families should be as near to their communities and homes as possible.</P>
    <P>In accordance with World Health Organisation opinion, the report recommended that alternative services be developed for the treatment of alcohol related disorders on the following lines: Each sector or district of the psychiatric services to develop a local alcohol-drug service which would be community based, with the emphasis on out-patient treatment; each sector to have access to a small number of beds to treat patients who could not attend on a day basis <Col N="1359" /> because of long distances or for social reasons; the sector service to act as a resource centre for all the services and personnel concerned with alcohol abuse in the sector; one consultant psychiatrist in each catchment area of the psychiatric service to be assigned responsibility for the organisation and operation of services for persons with alcohol-related problems in the area; the psychiatric team to provide a consultation service to general practitioners and other primary care personnel concerning treatment of persons with alcohol-related problems.</P>
    <P>A recent publication, a &ldquo;Directory of Alcohol and Drugs Services in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; provides useful information on the treatment services currently available to people with alcohol related disorders.</P>
    <P>The directory lists 74 centres where treatment is available for people with alcohol related disorders.  These include the psychiatric hospitals, residential centres, day services and &ldquo;halfway&rdquo; houses. Thirty-three of these centres provide in-patient services, reflecting the move in the eighties and nineties from residential treatment programmes.  The common denominator in the majority of treatment programmes is counselling and advice.</P>
    <P>The concept of treatment does not fit easily with the process involved in helping a person to overcome his or her dependence on alcohol.  There is no medical procedure or pill that will cure an alcoholic of his disease.  The Government is particularly concerned about the problem of alcohol abuse generally and by young people in particular.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that every effort will be made in my Department to provide adequate services to cure this social problem.</P>

      <P>Second level pupils from Dunboyne basically have nowhere to go as no school will guarantee access to second level schooling for them.  Traditionally, <Col N="1360" /> Dunboyne students attended either the community college in Dunshaughlin or the second level school in Maynooth.  However, Dunshaughlin community school is no longer accepting Dunboyne pupils because they are outside the catchment area, the same applies in the case of Maynooth.  Dunboyne children sat the entrance examination for Maynooth but when the authorities there found they had enough children from Maynooth they simply turned the Dunboyne students away.  In the past Dunboyne students used to attend the second level school in Coolmine but it is no longer accepting Dunboyne students either unless they had relatives there prior to 1989.</P>
      <P>Until very recently the Dominican Convent in Cabra was accepting Dunboyne pupils, but I now understand that of the 22 Dunboyne pupils who have made application to the Dominican Convent the school will be able to accept only ten.  Likewise, there is a problem for Dunboyne pupils trying to obtain entry to Corduff.  I gather also that St. Declan's school on the Navan Road is no longer accepting Dunboyne students.  Basically, no school is obliged to accept Dunboyne students at present.  Dunboyne families have been divided in the sense that older children have gone to one school, younger children have gone to another school and children now coming up to second level do not know where they are going to go.  From the point of view of developing parent-school links, which are very important in education, the position is impossible.  There is no school to which Dunboyne families can give their loyalty or support in terms of extra curricular activities or in which adult education facilities can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 the Minister for Education of the time, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, sanctioned the provision of a second level school in Dunboyne and her successor, Mr. Pat Cooney, initiated negotiations to purchase a site in 1986.  In 1987 the incoming Minister for Education, Minister Mary O'Rourke, cancelled that decision.  Seven years later, Minister O'Rourke's successor, Deputy Noel <Col N="1361" /> Davern, reversed that decision and agreed that a second level school should be provided in Dunboyne, thereby reinstating the original 1985 decision.  Deputy Davern said that in that general area a post primary school would first be provided in Hartstown, to be followed by the provision of a school in Dunboyne. The school in Hartstown has been provided &mdash; initially in temporary accommodation, I understand, with permanent buildings to be provided.  Virtually no progress has been made in the provision of a school for Dunboyne, however.  The former Minister last replied on the matter on 10 February, indicating that his Department was examining the suitability of a particular site in Dunboyne and was awaiting a valuation report.  I am not aware that any progress has been made since then.  In the meantime, however, the bishop, Dr. Michael Smith, offered to be the patron of a diocesan mixed secondary school in Dunboyne on that site, adjacent to the community centre, where it would use facilities.</P>
    <P>The site is at present owned by the diocese and would be made available free of charge.  The bishop also offered the provision of a local contribution of 10 per cent.  My understanding is that the Department has been reluctant to accept this offer, notwithstanding considerable financial attractions and the ability to bring forward the project much faster than might be the case if additional help from the diocesan authorites were not available.</P>
    <P>The critical position now is that parents literally have nowhere to send their children. The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Minister Aylward, is in the Chamber and I wish to ask him three questions.  First, what school will guarantee places for second level Dunboyne students who are leaving primary school this June?  Second, when will the second level school be built?  Third, what is the Minister's view of the offer made by the diocesan authorites of a free site and a 10 per cent contribution for a mixed secondary school on that site?</P>

      <P>I thank <Col N="1362" /> Deputy Bruton for raising this matter.  I have been aware for some time of his personal interest in this issue.  The Deputy has given me an opportunity to outline on behalf of the Minister the present position on second level school places for post primary pupils in Dunboyne.</P>
      <P>Dunboyne is located within the greater Dublin post primary catchment area for accommodation and full transport purposes. In general post primary pupils from the Dunboyne area attend Dunshaughlin Community College, Coolmine Community School and Maynooth Vocational School.  Other second level schools which currently cater for pupils leaving primary schools in Dunboyne are the Dominican Convent, Cabra, St. Declan's CBS, Navan Road, and other schools in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in August 1991 consultants from Service Industries Research Centre of UCD were commissioned to undertake an independent study in the Huntstown/Hartstown/Dunboyne/Castleknock areas in order to determine whether or not a new second level school was required in the area and, if so, the required size and most appropriate location.  Incidentally, that study was commissioned by the former Minister, Minister O'Rourke, now in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study indicated that there was an immediate need for a new post primary school in Hartstown, to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne. Accordingly, priority has been given to the new school in Hartstown, where accommodation for approximately 100 pupils was provided last September. Architectural planning of Phase II of this project, to cater for 850 pupils, is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that the ministerial sanction for the provision of a new school in Dunboyne remains in place.  The up to date position is that a site adjacent to Dunboyne Community Centre is currently under consideration as a possible site for the proposed new school.  An updated valuation is awaited <Col N="1363" /> for the proposed site from the Valuation Office.  When this is received the Department's architect will consider the matter further.</P>
    <P>The type of management structure of the proposed new school will be determined in the light of the publication of the White Paper.  The provision of a new school building will be dependent on the availability of capital, irrespective of the type of management it will have.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to the Department, orally and in writing, that some Dunboyne parents are having difficulty in securing places for their children in the post primary schools of their choice.  In this regard I would like to explain that intake policy is primarily a matter for individual school authorities, subject to acceptable criteria being applied.  The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that overall there is adequate accommodation to meet the needs of any given post primary centre.</P>
    <P>Two of the schools which traditionally cater for Dunboyne pupils &mdash; Dunshaughlin Community College and Maynooth Vocational School &mdash; are presently negotiating with the Department on the matter of the provision of additional accommodation.  It is hoped that a satisfactory solution to the accommodation problems at these schools will shortly be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 March I tabled 25 questions to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in relation to the partnership schemes set up throughout the country last year before the general election. Altogether my questions merited a two-paragraph reply, which stated very little other than that the Department was funding administrative staff for the pilot schemes and the development companies but that there was nothing in the way of grants or finance to subvent companies willing to try to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>Previous to the general election the schemes were announced amid great fanfare. I remember the day that the Taoiseach came to Cork.  Every person of consequence in Cork was there &mdash; 400 people &mdash; when the Taoiseach announced the formation of the North Lee development company.  That company, and similar companies elsewhere have administrative staff.  The experience of people who have dealt with some of these companies is that they constitute another layer of bureaucracy, another hurdle of frustration, to be overcome, another vehicle of confusion for people endeavouring to provide employment in areas of high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister establish clearly this evening what interlink there is between FÁS and the IDA to get to grips with the appalling unemployment problems in those areas?  Will the Minister state positively whether her Department hopes to go beyond merely providing advice?  I would remind her that people can obtain advice from existing State bodies without <Col N="1365" /> the Minister putting in place a further layer of bureaucracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat perplexed because the question tabled by Deputy Allen referred to:</P>
      <P>the failure of the Department of Enterprise and Employment to adequately fund the local pilot schemes for job creation such as the North Lee development company.</P>
      <P>Unless I misunderstood the Deputy, in his question this evening he appeared to say he did not want projects such a the North Lee development company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy described it as an extra layer of bureaucracy which would hinder job development.  I am genuinely puzzled.  I want to help the Deputy but I do not know whether he believes in the project being put forward.  Certainly we do.  I should say that the Taoiseach's announcement was quite correct, in that the North Lee is one of the 12 area-based partnership committees established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991 to monitor the area-based response to long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should tell the Deputy that administrators have been funded.  The global grant allocated will be administered during 1993 to the different area partnership committees nationwide.  The purpose of projects such as the North Lee one is that they will &ldquo;energise&rdquo; local communities and groups to come forward with ideas for job creation.  The firm hope is, now that they have been established, they will act as an energiser or catalyst for such funding.  The only moneys committed and expected were for administrative overheads.  A global grant of £4.2 million will be disbursed via the 12 area partnership committees between late 1992 and late 1993.  Each partnership committee has received approximately <Col N="1366" /> £100,000 with more to follow.  They have their administration in place and will be funded when proposals for such funding are deemed adequate and correct.</P>
    <P>I do not have intimate knowledge of the North Lee project, but if it is locally based, aimed at enterprise &mdash; that is anything creating activity whether in jobs, social training or education &mdash; it will be examined in relation to the schemes proposed.</P>
    <P>Knowing Deputy Allen's commitment to Cork, I am sure he would be in favour of the North Lee project receiving that type of special attention, which was the remit of the area partnership committees. I wish to dispel the notion that it is just another layer of bureaucracy.  It is an energiser and catalyst for local community groups to work towards and see to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The absence of a national waste management policy has demonstrated that the Government is very undecided on how it proposes to tackle the major and ever-growing problem of waste management and disposal.  Indeed, we have been promised such a comprehensive policy by the Department of the Environment over many years. However, its absence has affected job creation in a major way.  Jobs are being lost, especially within the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, because of the fuzziness of the Department's attitude to this ever-growing problem.  In addition, it hinders our overall approach to the major problem presented by Sellafield since we are dependent on Sellafield for the disposal of much of our radioactive waste.  Neither have we any policy for the disposal of hospital and clinical waste, or chemical and toxic or radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told over the years that the Department has undertaken studies and prepared reports.  Yet we still await a comprehensive policy statement in relation to this growing problem.  The Minister should put such a comprehensive policy in place as quickly as possible.  I would prefer that we, as a nation and the Minister's Department, would have control over this issue rather <Col N="1367" /> than be dictated to by the inevitable regulations to be introduced by the EC.  The absence of such a policy is costing us dearly in terms of jobs and hinders the IDA in its quest for jobs abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating that Deputy Allen has raised this question.  I must reject his contention that my Department does not have a firm waste management policy.  However, I do support part of Deputy Allen's contention in that fairly difficult decisions must be taken in relation to this matter.  Judging by what the Deputy said, it would appear he is prepared to grasp this nettle in the way we all feel it should be grasped.  Current Irish policy in relation to wastes rests firmly on the strict enforcement of relevant EC and national legislation in accordance with waste management plans prepared by local authorities. Policy is not, and should not be, static and is constantly being developed and reviewed.</P>
      <P>The enhancement of economic performance and employment, through sustainable growth and development is a fundamental Government objective.  As the Culliton report emphasised, a sound natural environment is essential not only to the quality of Irish life but as a resource base for continued growth in employment-intensive sectors of the economy. Waste management policy is a significant element of this strategy.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving arrangements for waste planning, recovery and disposal.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a clear commitment to the early introduction of a waste Bill, which will provide a full and comprehensive framework for the evolution and implementation of future waste management policies.  The Bill will address not merely the question of waste disposal, but how best to achieve a balanced approach to the various and complex management issues arising, not least of which concern measures and policies to prevent and minimise waste generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> In prospect of the new Bill, last year my Department published an informal discussion paper seeking views on certain key issues of waste policy, and subsequently held a two-day seminar for interested bodies.  A study on means to promote greater utilisation of clean technologies by industry has been commissioned. Only today, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Browne, published a major study on recycling waste in Ireland, with a view to obtaining an input from industry and the consumer in the development of this important policy area.</P>
    <P>While this strategic work is in progress, practical measures are also being taken in support of industry.  For instance, my Department provided direct funding, and is seeking further EC funding, towards the establishment of a clean production promotion unit in UCC which, together with the Clean Technology Centre of Cork regional technical college, will be of major assistance to manufacturing industry.  And, of course, the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency will assist industry in realising improved economic performance and benefits through better environmental management.  In carrying out its primary task of regulating activities which pose a high risk of pollution, the agency will be obliged to have regard to the need to promote sustainable and environmentally-sound development, processing and operations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have taken important steps, in the context of the new Cohesion Fund, to establish more secure financial support for the provision of waste infrastructure. A number of local authority proposals of this kind feature in the recent submission made to the EC Commission.  I am confident of continuing EC support for such projects in line with the stated EC objective of establishing suitable national and Community networks of waste management facilities.</P>

      <P>Work on Rathkeale sewerage scheme is progressing at present at a cost in excess of £2.3 million. It is regrettable that Castlematrix in <Col N="1369" /> Rathkeale is not included in the scheme as in excess of 20 houses would be accommodated, with the possibility of other houses being connected in the future.</P>
      <P>Due to the density of houses in this area the residents are having difficulties with their septic tanks.  A feasibility study has been carried out and I understand that it may be necessary to cross the river to accommodate the residents and to complete the pumping station.  I look forward to the Minister for the Environment indicating the timescale he has in mind for this area to be connected to the sewerage scheme.  I extend a welcome to him to visit Rathkeale next Friday to see what we have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for his premature welcome and I look forward to seeing him and his colleagues in Limerick on Friday.  I am aware that Limerick County Council have requested that extensions costing almost £0.5 million be added to the Rathkeale sewerage scheme and I am glad of the opportunity to outline my approach to such proposals.</P>
      <P>In the last five years over £16 million has been invested in the provision of water and sanitary services in the Limerick area.  In addition to the £2.7 million being invested in the Rathkeale scheme a further £11 million is being provided towards the construction of a sewerage scheme which will serve the Castletroy area.</P>
      <P>The Rathkeale sewerage scheme involves the laying of separate foul and storm water sewers and the provision of pumping stations and secondary treatment facilities to serve the existing population. Work is due to be completed in May 1993.  The need for the scheme arose from the inadequacies of the existing treatment works and the danger of the pollution of the River Deel, which is used extensively downstream for water production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning and development of water and sewerage schemes is, in the first instance, a matter for local authorities. The design of schemes should be such that it adequately caters for the <Col N="1370" /> urgent needs of an area at an economic cost.  The question of extending the design and scope of a scheme to cater for additional areas on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis is unacceptable in terms of planning and financing of schemes.</P>
    <P>In August 1992 Limerick County Council sought approval to a number of extensions to the Rathkeale scheme to serve the Kyletaun, Ballywilliam and Castlematrix areas at an overall cost of £474,000.  The extension to Castlematrix was to serve some 14 existing houses &mdash; currently served by septic tanks &mdash; at an estimated cost of £138,000.  This proposal was fully examined in my Department and could not be approved, given the substantial capital investment already committed to this scheme.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Finucane however that the merits and demerits of all proposals are fully considered in my Department and that, despite the concerns and comments expressed by him, I do not feel that the extension of the Rathkeale sewage scheme to Castlematrix is justified. It would however be open to Limerick County Council to provide this extension from their own resources if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that the estimated cost of each house is in the region of £9,000.  We try to set a norm nationally with regard to the resources that are available to us in order to spread these as efficiently as possible.  Deputy Finucane will appreciate that by any standards it is beyond our ability to meet that cost per house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This second matter concerns a group water scheme which embraces the Meenoline, Sugarhill and Tullis areas, which lie between Templeglantine and Abbeyfeale.  I understand that £2.5 million has been allocated this year for group water schemes and that of this amount £1.5 million has been carried forward from last year, leaving a total of £1 million.  I also understand that 89 schemes are awaiting approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme has been approved by the county council and it is awaiting final documentation for the scheme.  The <Col N="1371" /> assurance I am looking for on behalf of the people of that area &mdash; this scheme will serve about 98 houses, if approved &mdash; is that funding will be provided at a future date, given the size of the project. In saying this I am aware that there are constraints at present.  Perhaps the Minister could at least reassure the people of those areas, who badly need a water supply, that some funding will be provided when all the documentation is finalised at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992 ten group water schemes were completed in County Limerick, serving a total of 223 houses and 84 farms.  A further ten schemes are nearing completion and will serve an additional 367 houses and 209 farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1991 the organiser of the scheme submitted completed group water scheme survey forms to my Department's group schemes section in Ballina. These forms showed that up to 89 potential members were interested in forming a group scheme which would serve 85 houses and 45 farms in the townlands of Meenoline, south Keale, Tullig, <Col N="1372" /> Sugarhill, Doonakenna, Glendarragh and Ballymurragh.</P>
    <P>My Department subsequently advised the group to prepare a detailed design for the proposed scheme and to submit this for examination and approval.  So far there has been no response from the group to this request.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that this scheme cannot be progressed any further until such time as the plans and design data have been received and examined.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall resources that are available for group water schemes, to which Deputy Finucane referred, there will clearly always be constraints; but the Deputy should not underestimate my ability and ingenuity to get the most resources I can to promote as many schemes as possible this year, including those in County Limerick.</P>

    <P>The provision of facilities for the hearing of family law cases is a matter of priority in all courthouse refurbishment projects.

In so far as practicable suitable facilities will be provided in all future court accommodation projects.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that much of our courthouse accommodation throughout the country is inadequate.  This is due in part to the design of our courthouses, the majority of which were built in the last century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is perhaps right that I should begin by explaining that temporary release which may be granted by the Minister for Justice under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 is subject in all cases to certain conditions. In the first place before the Minister grants temporary release she or he will have regard to certain factors including the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody and, above all, the safety of the public.  Release will not be granted in any case where the expert advice available to the Minister is to the effect that it would constitute a serious threat to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If temporary release &mdash; sometimes referred to as &ldquo;early release&rdquo;&mdash; is actually granted it is always subject to conditions. In all cases there is the condition that the person released must continue to be of good behaviour and other conditions may also be applied for example <Col N="1130" /> that the individual concerned would be subject to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, that he or she should report at regular intervals to a Garda Station etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any of these conditions are breached and the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.  These temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole which is a feature of prison systems worldwide and is regarded as an element of positive sentence management.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable, as a matter of policy that there should be as much consistency as possible within the sentence management system &mdash; for example that an offender in one institution whose offence, behaviour, sentence, etc. are comparable to those of an offender in another institution should stand an equal chance of benefiting from temporary release provisions.  A review of the situation within my Department suggested that offenders in Cork were not faring as well as others in this regard.  One result of this was that there was extensive overcrowding within the institution.  The judgment following a review of the situation was that a significant reduction in numbers was warranted &mdash; in fact from 253 to 225.  Even at a figure of 225 there would continue to be a substantial level of doubling-up in single cells within the institution but it will nevertheless produce marked improvement and should allow for a much better level of service to be provided to the prisoners that remain.</P>

      <P>I am aware of an article in the most recent issue of the Garda Review regarding the condition of the Garda car fleet.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Garda fleet is in poor condition.  There is a total of 1,498 vehicles in the Garda fleet at present as opposed to 1,250 in January, 1989.  The mileage profile for the fleet at 1 January 1993 shows that 52 per cent of the fleet has under 40,000 miles recorded while vehicles with more than 100,000 miles recorded comprises less than 9 per cent of the fleet.  It has been Garda policy to replace vehicles with over 100,000 miles recorded.  However, a small number of cars have been retained over this limit because the vehicles concerned were continuing to give good service.  I have asked the Garda authorities, however, to review their policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>The tendering process for 1993 purchases is underway at present and high mileage vehicles will be replaced when the new deliveries arrive.  As an indication of the strength of the Garda fleet there were 33 new vehicles held in stock at Garda HQ at the beginning of this month in addition to a number of used cars which are also held as spare stock and can be used as replacements as the need arises.</P>

      <P>Ministers for Justice and the Interior of member states of the Community, meeting in the Hague in December 1991, agreed on a work programme for discussing, and where appropriate, harmonising policies in the areas of immigration and asylum.  That work programme <Col N="1132" /> was noted by the Maastricht European Council which considered that it constituted an adequate basis for measures to be taken in those areas.  In addition, the Treaty on European Union provides for co-operation between member states for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the Union, including co-operation in the areas of immigration and asylum policy.  Co-operation in these areas takes place with due regard to our obligations under international conventions.</P>

      <P>The hearing and disposal of civil cases in both the Circuit and High Courts is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts.</P>
      <P>Over 50 per cent of all civil bills or summonses issued are subsequently not pursued through the court system.  Of those that are, no case is listed for hearing until a notice of trial is lodged by the parties involved.  The time that elapses between the issue of a civil bill or summons and the lodgement of a notice of trial is entirely in the hands of the parties. Once a case is listed for hearing it is subject to applications for adjournment from either party.  However, I am aware of and am very concerned by delays in the hearing of civil cases in some Circuit Court venues and in the High Court.</P>
      <P>I am committed to using the resources available to me to ensure that the service provided by the courts is both efficient and effective.  A review of activity levels in the High and Circuit Courts to assess the impact on these courts of the alteration in the court jurisdiction levels introduced by the Courts Act, 1991 is almost completed.

      <P>The Single European Act inserted a new Article into the Treaty of Rome, Article 8A, which implied the free movement of goods, people, capital and services throughout the Community after 1992.  At its meeting in Edinburgh in December 1992, the European Council took note of the fact that free movement of persons within the European Community in accordance with Article 8A could not be completely assured on 1 January 1992 because of political differences between member states.  They took note also that the work necessary to achieve this result without creating dangers for public security and compromising the fight against illegal immigration, <Col N="1136" /> although having progressed, was and is still under way.</P>
      <P>The European Council did, however, note that certain changes would occur during 1993 and that EC member states had made known their intentions to take various measures to lighten controls at borders on nationals of member states of the Community.  They invited the competent Ministers to accelerate this work and decided to return to the issue at their next meeting on the basis of a report from Ministers.</P>
      <P>The precise implementation of passport controls in the member states is a matter for the appropriate authorities of each State.  In so far as Ireland is concerned, since 1 March 1993 there has been a reduction in controls on nationals of the member states of the European Community.  Special immigration channels have been introduced to facilitate European Community nationals travelling from member states to Ireland. While there is no systematic check on European Community nationals, there is a requirement that they display their passports to immigration officers to show that they are entitled to use the special channels.  Existing controls on non-nationals of member states of the Community travelling to Ireland from Community member states are being maintained.</P>

      <P>I am, of course, very concerned at the level of suicides within prisons and all reasonable steps will continue to be taken to avoid them altogether.  Given the random and unpredictable nature of suicides, whether within prisons or outside them, this is clearly a difficult task.  The recommendations of the advisory group on prisons deaths published in October 1991 is now the framework for our suicide prevention strategy.  Of the 57 recommendations 33 have been implemented and arrangements are in train to implement a further 17.  The remaining recommendations are more long term in nature and will be implemented over a period of time.  I am satisfied that implementation of these recommendations offers the best hope of success in the future in avoiding suicides.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the provision of additional courtroom space in Cork City is that a number of premises are being considered.

      <P>A contribution of £2 million was made by the associated banks to the Exchequer in 1992 towards the costs of security services, such as cash escorts, provided to the banks by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  The Minister for Finance announced in his recent Budget Statement that he would be seeking a similar contribution from the banks in the current year and that he was making a provision of £2 million in 1993 for this purpose.</P>

The Director of Public Prosecutions is by statute responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences and prosecutions are initiated by the Garda Síochána acting on his advice.  As the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his functions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any advice given by him in relation to the initiation of prosecutions.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that proposals on family reunification as described by the Deputy were vetoed by Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that Ministers with responsibility for immigration considered <Col N="1150" /> proposals in November last concerning non-binding principles in this area.  The harmonisation principles are confined to family reunification in respect of persons who are not nationals of a member state but who are lawfully resident within the territory of a member state on a basis which affords them an expectation of permanent or long term residence.</P>
    <P>I should make it absolutely clear that the Government favours the concept of family reunification for non-community nationals living legally in the Community. The then Government's concerns, expressed against the backdrop of mounting unemployment figures both at home and throughout the community, related to inclusion of a reference in the non-binding principles of a right of access to the labour market to those covered by the resolution without mention of any access to other social facilities such as education, social welfare payments, language training etc.  The Government did not veto the resolution and it is incorrect to say that it did.  My predecessor merely expressed concern along the lines outlined above.</P>

      <P>The Cohesion Fund as agreed at the European Summit at Edinburgh in December, 1992 is intended to provide EC financial assistance to projects in the environment and transport areas.  The aim is to provide aid to assist member states in meeting EC environmental requirements and in financing the provision of trans-European transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Pending ratification of the Treaty on European Union which provides for the Cohesion Fund, it is intended that an interim instrument be established to provide EC financial support to projects eligible for Cohesion Fund assistance.  This instrument was agreed at the EC General Affairs Council on 8 March subject to the views of the European Parliament.  The aim, as agreed at the Edinburgh summit, is that the instrument be adopted by 1 April, 1993.</P>
      <P>Proposals for investment of Cohesion Fund aid in 1993 were included in my Financial Statement to this House on 24 February, 1993.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.  EC assistance is available to former customs clearance agents under three headings:</P>
      <P>&mdash;existing programmes funded by the European Social Fund;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Council Regulation 3904/92 on measures to adapt the profession of customs agents to the internal market;</P>
      <P>&mdash;INTERREG, which is a joint cross-border programme with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the case of existing programmes the full range of FÁS services is available to former customs clearance agents. Arrangements have been made to ensure that Live Register requirements can be waived in the case of customs clearance staff so as to facilitate immediate access to FÁS training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Council Regulation 3904/92, some £415,000 is available to provide assistance to Irish firms with diversification <Col N="1155" /> plans, principally by way of training and retraining measures.  Under this Regulation suitable projects must be submitted to the European Commission by 31 March, 1993.  To date, applications in excess of our allocation up to 31 March have been submitted to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Assistance can be given under INTERREG to persons affected by changes in border-related activities arising from the establishment of the Internal Market. This programme is confined to the border counties.</P>
    <P>Regional Directors of FÁS in the areas most affected (Dundalk, Dublin and Rosslare) are coordinating training/retraining activity for firms and individuals affected.  Meetings have taken place since July 1992 with representative bodies of customs clearance agents to discuss the training requirements of firms affected by the Single Market.</P>
    <P>As the financing measures involved under the three headings are provided for under the European Social Fund, applications for assistance are being processed through the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>The national debt is valued in Irish pounds but part of the debt is denominated in foreign currencies.  The Irish punt value of this part of the debt was increased as a result of the devaluation and the national debt increased accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The end-year national debt figures for each of the last five years is as follows:&mdash; 1988, £24,611 million; 1989, £24,828 million; <Col N="1156" /> 1990, £25,083 million; 1991, 25,391 million; 1992, 26, 345 million (provisional outturn).</P>
    <P>It is assumed that the reference by the Deputy to mortgage repayment on the national debt relates to interest payments on the national debt.  Expenditure by the Exchequer in 1993 on interest on the national debt is estimated at £2,260 million. This estimate includes £52 million in respect of the additional cost in 1993 arising from the devaluation.</P>

      <P>As matters stand, the Exchequer receipts of European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Funds are specifically identified in the <i>Summary of Capital Budget Requirements</i> on page 31 of the Principal Features of the Budget circulated on Budget Day.  Receipts from the Social Fund and FEOGA attributable to Exchequer-funded programmes are allocated in the Estimates Volume against the expenditure service to which they relate.  Other information, including the EC Budget contribution, is given in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published on the weekend prior to the Budget.</P>

      <P>Only farmers who have opted to register for VAT are obliged to account for the tax.  Such registered farmers are normally in a net VAT repayment situation, as the VAT incurred by them on their purchases, which is deductible, normally exceeds the VAT payable by them on their sales of goods and services.  Details of the amounts payable and deductible and the net repayments for the years 1987 to 1992, are set out in the table below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> Unregistered farmers do not account for VAT.  They are compensated for VAT incurred by them on their purchases, by means of the flat-rate system and through repayment by the Revenue Commissioners for VAT incurred on expenditure on building and land improvement.</P>

    <P>(1) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are to some extent estimated.  The figures shown are the tax paid by <i>full-time</i> farmers together with estimated tax paid by <i>trader-farmers</i> on their <i>farming profits</i> only.</P>
    <P>(2) Of the £82 million amount paid in 1988, some £38 million was a once-off payment of tax arrears under the tax amnesty.  In effect, the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; yield in 1988 was £44 million.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the answer do not include the PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and it is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax years 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90, the latest available, indicates that the following amounts of tax were paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for those years:</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 75, 76 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The numbers of individuals with income from farming who made income tax returns in respect of the three years ending on 5 April, 1991 is estimated at 71,100 for 1988-89, 66,800 for 1989-90 and 59,700 for 1990-91.  The apparent fall in the figures over the last two years is due to a combination of factors, namely, an increase in the number of cases who were notified by inspectors of taxes after 1988-89 that a tax return are not required until their position was further reviewed and the relatively shorter period of time which has been available to allow a build up of returns for 1990-91.</P>
      <P>A corresponding estimate is not available for 1987-88.  Self Assessment returns for the year 1991-92 were due at the end of January, 1993 and are still being processed.  Accordingly, figures for that year are not yet available.  The additional numbers of individuals on tax record who were notified by inspectors of taxes that a tax return was not required from them until their position was further reviewed has increased over time from approximately 8,000 in 1987 and 1988, to 15,600 in 1989, 16,900 in 1990, 17,600 in 1991 and 18,100 in 1992.</P>

      <P>Persons who are ill and who do not have an entitlement to disability benefit may apply for a basic weekly payment of supplementary welfare allowance. The determination of applications for supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for each health board.</P>
      <P>In general, the applicant is required to produce medical certification in support of his application and the health board must be satisfied that his means are insufficient to meet his needs.</P>
      <P>There are no time limits governing issue of payments, which are normally made within days of application.  In urgent cases health boards may make payments immediately.</P>

      <P>Widowers with dependent children <Col N="1164" /> may be entitled lone parents allowance which covers the various categories of lone parents looking after children.</P>
      <P>There is no specific provision under the social welfare system for financial assistance for widowers who are unable to carry out household work.  However, where a person is unable to look after children, assistance may be provided by the health board, through the provision of support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards are obliged to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and to promote child care and family support services to those who require them.  These services will be developed as the various provisions of the Act are brought into operation.</P>

      <P>Ireland is not a party to the Schengen Agreement and the reference to Schengen is, therefore, not relevant. As regards CELAD, it is appropriate that questions in this area be addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the various other fora mentioned by the Deputy, in general they have been in existence for many years. In those circumstances, it would not be possible to compile information of the type sought by the Deputy without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time.  It would require an inordinate amount of research of an historical nature which would not be confined to issues of current administration and which could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Deputy is clearly interested in formal agreements, resolutions and so on, I should explain that much of the intergovernmental work at a European level is confidential in nature and concerned with practical co-operation in such areas, for example, as the <Col N="1171" /> fight against terrorism and serious crime, drugs and illegal immigration.  The compilation of the information sought, in other words, would not present a complete picture of the very valuable body of work produced by the various groups mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that during the Irish Presidency in 1990, a detailed and comprehensive programme of action relevant to these areas was approved by Ministers of the Twelve and published. It provided for the enhancement of police co-operation generally and included specific measures designed to reinforce and build on existing co-operation in the fight against terrorism and serious crime, drugs and illegal immigration.  Work on the implementation of this programme and a consequent increase in co-operation in all of these areas has since taken place.</P>
    <P>In addition, during the debate in the House in May 1992 on the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, to provide for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the then Minister for Justice, in the course of his contribution, set out in some considerable detail the background to the co-operation which has been taking place in the area of justice and home affairs for many years on an intergovernmental basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure the House that when and if it is necessary to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for any changes in our legislation or in our existing rules and practices arising from decisions in these fora then that, of course, will be done.</P>

      <P>The EC is party to the Multifibres Arrangement (MFA) which regulates access to the Community market for textiles and clothing from Third Countries.  Ireland has obligations <Col N="1180" /> under the MFA by virtue of our membership of the Community.</P>
      <P>The MFA, as a derogation from general GATT rules, has been in operation since the early 1970s and has been renewed on a number of occasions since then.</P>
      <P>The latest position is that, in accordance with the Mandate given by the Council of Ministers, in October, 1992, Agreements have been concluded with many supplier countries for the next 2/3 years or until such time as eventual agreement is reached, overall, on the Uruguay Round.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the Community are fully aware of the obligations to provide special treatment and market access for least developed countries and this is taken fully into account in Agreements with these countries.  For example, Bangladesh is dealt with as a least developed country and is treated in a very favourable way by the Community in the Agreement signed in mid-December, 1992. There are no quota limits in this Agreement but a number of sensitive categories are subject simply to surveillance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has given consideration to the need for low cost finance to be made available to people establishing new small businesses; and the proposals, if any, he has to recommend the availability of a low cost funding package for small businesses with the requirement of capital under £10,000 which would employ four or fewer personnel in recognition of small local enterprise.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly aware of the high cost funding difficulties which face small businesses in their attempts to develop into larger more viable entities.</P>
      <P>A number of low cost funding initiatives are currently in place which are specifically intended to provide assistance to the smaller business operations. In particular I would mention the following initiatives which provide varying forms of relatively low cost funding for the smaller business operations.</P>
      <P>
        <i>IDA Interest rate subsidies:</i> Under the IDA Industrial Development Act 1986 the IDA can provide grants for the reduction of interest payable on a loan in the context of providing working capital in the establishment of small business operations.  These facilities are largely administered under the Enterprise Development Programme of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Bank of Ireland Enterprise Support Unit:</i> The Bank of Ireland Enterprise Support Unit was established in 1989 following an initiative from the then Minister for Finance.  The objectives are to lend funds to business start ups, backing <Col N="1185" /> up such lending with financial management assistance.  Such funding is generally provided on the basis of AA interest rates without normal risk loading, and without personal guarantees. The initiative has already provided support to over 80 enterprises with an associated increase in employment in such enterprises.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Area Based Partnerships:</i> The main contribution of the 12 Area Partnership Companies established under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been in promoting a community-based response to longterm unemployment at local level.  There have, however, also been some significant developments in promoting smallscale investment in indigenous industry within those areas.  Most Partnerships have drawn upon the EC Global Grant for Local Development to set up some form of revolving loan fund to assist business start-up and expansion.  These low interest loan funds have helped to overcome difficulties which unemployed people encounter in accessing funding for enterprise through conventional funding institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>BES:</i> The Business Expansion Scheme has in the past made a significant contribution to the funding of small businesses, and earlier this year the Government extended the scheme for a further period of three years while at the same time removing the lifetime investment cap on individual investors.</P>
    <P>The Business Expansion Scheme continues to be a valuable source of low cost equity funding for small manufacturing operations, which would otherwise find difficulty in raising the necessary capital to operate and develop their business enterprises.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Innovation Fund:</i> The Business Innovation Fund under the aegis of the Business Innovation Centres provides seed capital finance for small business projects at the start up/early stage development in their business life.  This fund which has been in operation since December 1991 is currently seeking to expand its investment base, and this fund will continue to develop as a source of <Col N="1186" /> seed capital for early stage funding of Irish business ventues in the future.</P>
    <P>Besides the above measures there are also:</P>
    <P>(A)  the International Fund for Ireland which has provided support for small business initiatives in the more restricted border county area and</P>
    <P>(B)  The Recent First Step Fund &mdash; a private sector initiative intended to provide support for early stage business requirements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to emphasise that I am committed to the development of local enterprise within the context of promoting the real strengths and potential for development of each area and which stimulates effective action to promote economic development and employment creation.  In the context of the arrangements to establish County Enterprise Partnership Boards, at present under way, I would envisage a range of different approaches to enterprise promotion including the provision of workspace, the establishment of loan funds and the identification of gaps in the market being pursued at local level.</P>
    <P>Given the recent reductions in Irish interest rates and the expectation that this downward trend in the cost of debt funding will continue I would hope that the cost of funding for Irish business will continue to reduce throughout the remainder of 1993, allowing Irish business to compete more effectively in the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I indicated in the House on 11 March 1993, that I was reviewing the whole question of extensions for participants on the Social Employment Scheme.</P>
      <P>That review is now complete and as and from the beginning of this week FÁS has responsibility for processing applications for participant extensions on the basis of the following criteria:</P>
      <P>1.  Where a project would have to stop because a replacement could not be found for a &ldquo;key&rdquo; person.</P>
      <P>2.  Where completion of a project has been delayed for a short time for reasons outside the control of the sponsor e.g. disruption due to bad weather.</P>
      <P>3.  Where a suitable replacement cannot be found for a participant despite the best efforts of sponsors and FÁS.</P>
      <P>Applications for extensions should be made to FÁS only where at least one of the agreed criteria is met.</P>
      <P>Extensions for participants on the Social Employment Scheme are now a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <P>Irish Steel has not been directly affected by the recent US imposition of countervailing duties on steel from the European Community as the company has not been exporting steel to the US.  Nevertheless, a potential closure of traditional US outlets for Community steel could further aggravate the oversupply situation in the Community market on which Irish Steel depends for 90 per cent of its sales.</P>

      <P>The official source for the information sought by the Deputy is the Central Statistics Office, but I am informed by the Office that the information is not yet available for 1992.</P>
      <P>However, for the Deputy's information, I understand from the IDA that the total value of investment in manufacturing industry grant aided by the IDA in 1992 was £284,772,906.  The figure would be considerably less than the total value of investment in manufacturing industry overall.</P>
      <P>IDA operates to targets for first-time jobs, rather than targets in relation to investment; the level of IDA investment in individual projects, and the total investment in each case, would thus vary very substantially, depending on the assistance package negotiated in individual cases, whether the IDA's assistance was related to fixed asset investment, employment grants, equity stakes and so on.</P>

      <P>Under the third EC Framework Programme in Research and Technological Development 1990-1994 the EC funds research under six main headings as follows:</P>
      <P>Information and Communications Technologies</P>
      <P>Industrial and Materials Technologies</P>
      <P>Environment</P>
      <P>Life Sciences and Technologies</P>
      <P>Energy</P>
      <P>Human Capital and Mobility</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transnational consortia, which may include Irish organisations (companies, <Col N="1191" /> universities research agencies), and organisations from other EC member states and EFTA countries can compete for project funds under these programmes. The allocation is decided on the quality of the scientific proposals made.</P>
    <P>To date, 96 Irish organisations have participated in the specific programmes of the framework programmes and have secured 435 awards with a total estimated value of 65 million ecus.  Of this amount, decisions were made to award approximately 5 per cent in 1990, 28 per cent in 1991, and 67 per cent in 1992.  Details of awards to date in 1993 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Most of the original budget for the third framework programme has already been allocated.  However, additional moneys (made available through supplementary funding) has recently been approved by Council and will begin to become available towards the end of 1993.  On the basis of decisions taken to date, Irish organisations can expect to secure further projects in the period to 1994 should they compete for these.</P>
    <P>In addition to the framework programme, Irish organisations received 145 awards to a value of 22 million ecus for participation in related programmes outside the framework programme (for example, Thermie, Sprint, STAR, Comett etc.).  Of this approximately 21 per cent was awarded in 1990, 26 per cent in 1991 and 53 per cent in 1992.  Details are not yet available in relation to 1993.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me in relation to the position at the UCG shellfish research laboratory at Carna, County Galway.</P>
      <P>From 1988 to 1992 the Department contributed financially to some research projects into new aquaculture species at the shellfish research laboratory.  I would point out that the Department has at no stage exercised direct control over the staffing resources and programmes of the laboratory.  The responsibility for the research programme undertaken by the shellfish research laboratory and the employment of staff engaged in research work at the laboratory rests solely with the management of the laboratory and the college authorities at UCG.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the Department, as an exceptional, interim measure, agreed to renew funding of some research projects at the shellfish research laboratory.  Formal notification was given, however, to UCG that decisions about project funding for 1993 and future years at the shellfish research laboratory would be a matter for the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>The board of the institute considered the question soon after its establishment late last year and decided, as an exceptional measure, to continue to contribute to the costs of certain research projects at the laboratory for the first quarter of 1993, pending further consideration in the context of priority areas for 1993 and future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, having considered the matter further in the context of the <Col N="1200" /> overall priorities of the institute and of the funding currently available to it, the institute has decided that it is not in a position to continue the funding of projects at the laboratory beyond 31 March 1993.</P>
    <P>It remains for University College Galway, as the authority responsible for the shellfish research laboratory, to determine priorities for the research programme at the laboratory, including related staffing level, in light of available budgetary resources.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently implementing the final year of the Fishery Harbour Development Programme 1989 to 1993. Under this programme provision was made for dredging of the harbour at Burtonport. To this end, hydrographic and probing surveys were undertaken to determine the bed level and extent of rock present.  A site investigation was undertaken during 1992 in advance of the detailed planning of the dredging.  It is intended to undertake the dredging during this summer.</P>
      <P>There are no definite plans at present to extend the pier at Burtonport.  A fishery harbours development programme for the 1994 to 1997 period is, however, currently being drawn up by the Department of the Marine and proposals for the further development of Burtonport have been submitted by Donegal County Council for possible inclusion in the programme. Pending finalisation of the programme and clarification of its funding, I am not in a position to say what further works, if any, can be undertaken at this harbour.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Angel dust&rdquo; is a non scientific term colloquially used to describe a substance used illegally to promote growth in beef cattle.  Considerable seizures of the substances referred to as &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; have been made and in all cases the active ingredient involved was clenbuterol.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive range of measures are in place to detect the use of clenbuterol in cattle production.  Random monitoring of live animals and meat for the presence of illegal subsances is carried out under an EC approved programme. Additionally, authorised officers inspect and sample live animals and carcases on suspicion that clenbuterol may have been used.  Authorised officers have extensive powers to (a) lock up and sample herds where it is suspected that prohibited substances may have been used, (b) to seize and detain for testing animals or meat which are suspected of being illegally treated and (c) to condemn as unfit for human consumption meat derived from animals treated with clenbuterol.  The test of live animals is carried out on urine samples and of meat on liver samples.</P>
      <P>Of 12,377 animals tested to March 1993 1,108 animals have tested positive for the presence of clenbuterol.  Virtually all of the positives were from animals of carcases tested on suspicion.</P>

Inquiries have been made of the relevant statutory bodies, and of organisations representing the insurance industry, as to whether members of the travelling community may experience particular difficulties in obtaining motor insurance.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that there is no evidence to suggest that travellers are subjected to discriminatory treatment as regards motor insurance.  My information is that any difficulties affecting travellers in that respect are no different from those encountered by members of the settled community in meeting the criteria on which insurance business is transacted.  If an individual has a particular problem in obtaining motor insurance he-she can contact the Irish Insurance Federation's declined cases committee.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to national monuments which are either privately-owned, or can be visited only by crossing private property.  I understand that the liability for accidents occurring on private property is primarily a matter between the injured party, the landowner, and the landowner's insurance company&mdash;where a relevant policy exists. I understand also that some landowners have closed off public access to national monuments on their lands because of the danger of accident claims. The closures are taking place on the advice of solicitors and insurance companies who are unhappy with the current law on occupier's liability.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission is examining the occupier's liability issue at present and I understand that a White Paper will be published subsequent to the commission's report.  I hope to be in a position to give a further response at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objectives of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 is to introduce a more equitable system for the payment of subventions to persons in private nursing homes.  The Act will remove the distinction between homes approved by the Minister for the purposes of health board subventions and those not approved. When the Act is commenced, all nursing homes registered with a health board will be entitled to admit patients who qualify for a subvention from a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not intended, nor would it be appropriate, to compensate homes which are not approved under existing legislation for the payment of subventions. The exact way in which registration under <Col N="1225" /> the new Act will be implemented in relation to approved and unapproved homes is a matter for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations with nursing home interests.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the existence of retirement and rest homes for the elderly.  The Health (Nursing Home) Act, 1990, will not apply to retirement and rest homes where the residents are independent. However, any home in which more than two dependent persons are cared for and maintained must be registered as a nursing home with a health board.  A person found guilty of operating an unregistered nursing home will be liable on conviction to a fine of up to £50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the clinical assessment of the suitability <Col N="1226" /> of residents of private nursing homes.  As far as persons who fund nursing home care from their own means are concerned, individuals and their families will decide when admission to a nursing home is required.  In the case of persons applying to a health board for a nursing home subvention under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, it will be the responsibility of the health board to carry out an assessment of the dependency of the applicant.  This assessment will be carried out by professional staff skilled in the assessment of dependency.  Health boards will be recruiting additional staff to carry out the assessments which will arise when the Act is commenced.</P>
    <P>Health board staff will be involved in the assessment of persons already resident in nursing homes who apply for the new subvention.</P>
    <P>I hope to commence the Act on 1 May provided there is agreement on the new system of subvention.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to have rates of subvention related to levels of dependency, under the new Act.  I am not yet in a position to inform the Deputy of the value of the new subvention.  Formal discussions will begin shortly with nursing home interests and groups representing the elderly concerning the details of the new subvention scheme, including the way residents of nursing homes or their represenatives may apply for a subvention.</P>

      <P>The identification of staffing needs at Cork Regional Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  Proposals for the filling of new and replacement posts in a permanent capacity are reviewed on a monthly basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>Under existing personnel policy it is, therefore, the responsibility of each health agency to submit prioritised manpower proposals to my Department, including details of service requirements and proposed funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>Proposals in respect of the post referred to by the Deputy have not been included by the Southern Health Board in its most recent manpower submission to my Department.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 16-25 (including students) who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders.  Those who are financially independent of their parents have their income assesed in their own right.  The decision on whether a person should be regarded as financially <Col N="1228" /> independent is a matter for the health board.  A student is assessed for a medical card by the health board in whose area he or she is attending college.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to, the person in question had previously been financially independent of her parents and had qualified for a medical card from the Southern Health Board in her own right. As she has become a full-time student in Galway, her eligibility for a medical card is now a matter for the Western Health Board to determine and she should therefore make an application to that board.</P>

      <P>The current reporting system in respect of cases of AIDS does not present data on a county basis.  However, the National Aids Strategy Committee in an intermim Report on HIV/AIDS Surveillance in April 1992 has recommended that the current HIV reporting system operated by the Department of Health through the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, should provide data on a county basis without prejudice to the confidentiality of individual cases.  Since then, the laboratory has indicated to the Department that no positive HIV tests have been notified in respect of County Kerry.  The HIV Surveillance System is being augmented by an anonymous unlinked system under which antenatal bloods taken for routine clinical purposes are tested for HIV.  This system is designed to monitor more comprehensively the spread of the infection and will provide more focused data regarding the infection throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The increase in allocation to the Board arose from expenditure incurred by the Board for which provision had not been made in its original allocation.  Such expenditure arose from the implementation of general and special pay increases approved for certain categories of staff during the year, the provision of additional mental handicap and child care services as well as services for the physically disabled, as provided for in the 1992 budget.  In addition arising from the Supplementary Estimate passed by the Dáil on 5 November 1992 additional funding was provided to the Board to meet the increased cost of the General Medical Services Scheme, the increased cost of community drug schemes and the Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance, the increase in the cost of medical indemnity for medical staff employed by the Board and other miscellaneous costs such as HIB vaccines.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.  For the past number of years Health Boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand lead system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention.  Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in specific classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  The children in these classes are screened, and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been <Col N="1236" /> specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
    <P>The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment etc. is provided as necessary.</P>
    <P>An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
    <P>Statistics available to my Department show that the number of children treated in the years referred to by the Deputy were as follows: 1987, 330,000; 1988, 350,000; 1989, 207,000; 1990, 247,000; 1991, 260,000 (currently being finalised); 1992, n/a (being collected).</P>
    <P>Reductions in the number of children treated since 1988 is considered to be attributable to a decline in the prevalence of dental caries in the school population, a fall in the school population and the success of preventive approach adopted by the Department and the Health Boards to the provision of dental care.</P>

      <P>The extension of eligibility for dental services to children, initially to those up to age 14, is being implemented as part of the package of provisions for the development of the dental services contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 million is being provided in 1993 towards the implementation of these provisions.  These additional resources will enable each health board <Col N="1237" /> to fully implement the planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to all eligible children.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment where necessary.  It ensures the optimum use of dental resources and that all children have equal access to the same level of care.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>Dental services for adults with medical card eligibility are currently provided by health boards through the board's dental services or through the choice of dentists scheme.  Under the choice of dentist scheme private dental practitioners provide services for eligible persons in accordance with <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements made with the local health board.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains provisions for the development of the service provision to adults.  All newly-qualified dentists will provide one year of community vocational service to the public dental services.  This will significantly improve the existing service provision and reduce adult waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The process to put the necessary framework in place for the introduction of vocational training for dental graduates will commence later this year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that it would cost about £20 million per annum to operate a choice of dentist scheme for all adults with medical card eligibility.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of services in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Following an allegation that some patients with mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital were receiving improper care, an inquiry team was established by the Eastern Health Board to investigate the specific allegations made.  My Department was informed on 11 February that the inquiry had concluded that practices in some parts of the hospital were a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>As I was gravely concerned that the interests of patients would be protected I met with the Chief Executive Officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the matter with him.</P>
      <P>The board has appointed a full-time Director of Mental Handicap Services to St. Ita's Hospital.  Changes were also made at medical management level and nursing and other care staff were re-assigned, within the hospital.  I understand that the patients to whom the allegations referred have been moved to new accommodation on campus and that the parents of the patients have been informed by the board of developments and of the reasons for the service re-organisation within the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been assured by the board that while the initial inquiry failed to substantiate the specific allegations made against individuals, the inquiry is continuing and will be pursued with the utmost vigour.  The board has prepared a draft plan which addresses the future needs of patients with mental handicap at St. Ita's Hospital.  This plan is currently <Col N="1239" /> being examined in detail by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will be remaining closely involved in all aspects of the situation, and any further action considered necessary will be taken.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware a special additional allocation of £8 million was made available to my Department in the budget to provide significant improvements in services for people with disabilities including mental handicap.  This extra allocation is the largest additional allocation ever made in this area.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to implement a package of measures which will address the most acute needs for services mainly for people with a mental handicap.  The actual services to be provided will be agreed in each health board area by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees, which are representative of the health boards, voluntary agencies and parents, and approved by the Department. St. Joseph's Mental Handicap Service, St. Ita's Hospital is represented on the planning committee for the Eastern region.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position shortly to give details of the allocation of this additional funding.</P>

      <P>With regard to student support I would like to refer the Deputy to the range of significant improvements which was introduced in 1992 to the Higher Education Grants Scheme.  These improvements included special provisions for mature students and the exclusion of payments under the Lone Parent's Allowance Scheme from reckonable income for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
      <P>On the question of child care facilities I understand from the Higher Education Authority that all the universities provide créche facilities.  Furthermore the Dublin Institute of Technology has introduced a subsidy scheme for students using a créche.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government has indicated its intention, in the context of anticipated extra resources under the new Structural Funds to wider access of all students to third-level education. Against this background I will keep under ongoing review the need for further initiatives to improve access for students, in the context of the overall development needs of the sector.</P>
