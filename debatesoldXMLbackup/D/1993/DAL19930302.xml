      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of meetings which have taken place of the Partnership Programme Managers under the chairmanship of the chairman of the group; and if he will give an up-date on the progress of those meetings.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first meeting of the partnership programme managers is taking place today under the chairmanship of the programme manager in <Col N="126" /> my Department following the appointment of all the programme managers.</P>
      <P>The full group will meet regularly as required and programme managers will be responsible within their Departments for ensuring progress on matters arising from the Partnership Programme for Government as it relates to their Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise the justifiable public anger and revulsion at these appointments, particularly the naked hypocrisy, extravagance and nepotism of the Labour Party? Does he realise that this will be heightened by virtue of the fact that the programme managers will receive £40,500 each and that annually they will cost £500,000, and, despite the fact that the Government has been in office for two months, they have not had one solitary co-ordinating meeting until today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that there are guidelines in place for the appointment of people to Ministers and their Departments when they come into Government.  The position is that just one partnership programme manager has been appointed in addition to what is provided for in the guidelines. It is not true to say &mdash; as Deputy Higgins tries to portray &mdash; that what they get is 10 per cent over the salary they had in whatever position they held before being appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that while Fianna Fáil, as a major partner in Government, has appointed people from the Civil Service whose salary has required additional topping up, in the case of the Labour Ministers their partnership programme managers have come from the private sector?  Therefore, we are talking about £40,500 minimum, plus expenses.  May I also ask the Taoiseach whether this is a new concept of Government and whether these appointments are superfluous?  If one wants to monitor a programme for Government, and assess it, the most effective way to do so is to bring together the heads of the Civil <Col N="127" /> Service who are well qualified, financially rewarded and have the experience to do the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of from where the partnership programme managers came, the same principle applied whether they came from the private or the public sector.  There is nothing wrong with having a good mix of public and private sector people ensuring that the programme for Government is carried through.  That is the priority for the Government and that is the priority for the people outside.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, when the Deputy will see the results.  He should not jump to conclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has admitted that the first meeting of this group has only been arranged for today. I wish to ask him two questions.  Will he confirm that the arrangements to hold the first meeting were only put in place following the tabling of the question by Deputy Jim Higgins?  Will he say whether these programme managers are operating on a solo basis or will they be supported in their respective Departments by secretarial and other assistants, thus leading to further costs and expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that the first meeting was called following the tabling of the question by Deputy Jim Higgins.  I know that Deputies O'Keeffe and Higgins would like to think that when they say something the Government jumps to attention.  That is not the position. The Government is quite capable of running the country and will continue to do so.  The sooner the Deputies opposite realise that they are in for a long haul on the Opposition benches the better it will be for them.  They should not be jumping to any conclusions.</P>

      <Qid>2</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. Deasy</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will explain the concept of open Government as enunciated by him on his elevation to the office of Taoiseach; and the way in which he has promoted this concept during 1992.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would define open Government as a commitment to consultation, to partnership and participation, and to greater accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, for example, the people were consulted on two major issues in referenda, the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, and the question of the right to life, the right to travel and the right to information.  Further consultation of the people on the question of divorce is planned by 1994.  I have instructed all my Ministers to give the <Col N="131" /> maximum possible amount of information in reply to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>I consulted with the other party leaders on a number of important occasions.  I have had prepared a radical programme of Dáil reform, which will improve openness and accountability and the role and effectivenes of the Dáil as a control on the Executive.  I am the first political leader to have given a comprehensive public statement of my financial interests. There has been a continued open commitment to social partnership with trade unions, farmers and employers, which is now complemented by partnership in Government with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Government buildings have been opened to the public.  I have ensured that all Government records are fully open to historians after 30 years, in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>I and the Government are committed to a comprehensive and enlightened programme of social reform and equality which will open up opportunities for disadvantaged groups in our society.  I made it clear from early last year that I want nothing to do with closed or golden circles, and that Government should be accessible and open to all.  I am satisfied that I have made some progress towards creating a more open Government and society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that reply.  The reason I put down this question is because of the Taoiseach's evasion of questions.  Three weeks ago the Taoiseach refused to give a straight answer to a question about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Two weeks ago I put down a specific question to him about a meeting or meetings he may have had with Chancellor Kohl and he transferred the question to the Minister for Finance. I do not call that openness; I call it the very opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I always give straight answers to straight questions.  I always give long answers, for which I have been accused from time to time in the House of using to waste time.  I give answers which I believe are correct and if Deputy Deasy is not satisfied with this I am sorry but I cannot help him any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my disappointment at the limited nature of the Taoiseach's interpretation of openness. Would the Taoiseach agree that openness which depends on Government is selfdefeating and that for it to have any meaning openness should have a statutory basis, for example, a public information Act which would have a statutory basis so that the public, rather than just Members of this House, would have a right to information?  Would he agree that what is required is that the ordinary citizen should have a statutory right to information from Government Departments, local authorities, semi-State bodies and other organisations?  That is what is meant by openness, as is the case in other countries, rather than the limited <Col N="133" /> openness which the Taoiseach has trotted out and which is meaningless?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Enda Kenny on 10 February, I stated that arrangements were being made for a meeting between President Clinton and myself in Washington on St. Patrick's Day, subject to the President's availability.  I also stated that at the meeting I would update the President on the position in relation to the serious situation in Northern Ireland, in relation to the development of investment and trade between Ireland and the United States and other relevant matters that are of interest to our two countries.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to announce that the meeting with President Clinton has now been confirmed for St. Patrick's Day. The agenda for the meeting has not been finalised but I would hope to discuss with the President matters such as those already mentioned as well as the need for concerted action to promote international economic recovery, the Uruguay Round, EC-US relations &mdash; which would cover the matter referred to in Deputy Allen's question &mdash; European Union, Somalia and other matters of mutual interest.</P>

      <P>Now that Prime Minister John Major and the UK Government have had their say in relation to President Clinton's peace envoy proposal, could the Taoiseach enlighten the House as to what his reaction is to that proposal? There have been different views as to whether such a peace envoy should be a mediator or someone with a fact finding role or even an economic role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We value the concern and the interest shown in relation to Northern Ireland by President Clinton. We believe that constructive interest and support of the United States has the potential to be uniquely helpful.  I will be discussing with the President the proposal about a special envoy.  In latter days we are reading about the possibility of a <Col N="137" /> fact finding mission but the priority of the Irish and British Governments is to get the talks process resumed so that we can bring them to a successful conclusion.  I will be listening to what the President has to say about whether he has in mind a special envoy or a fact finding mission.</P>

      <P>Now that it is clear that the Taoiseach has no settled reaction to this proposal let me raise another issue with him.  Has he any concrete proposals to put to President Clinton to improve economic links between the United States and Ireland so that we could have a reversal of the recent trend of lost jobs in the major American multinational company in Galway and have some prospect of greater prosperity as a result of improved economic links between our two countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally separate question altogether.  The matter of tax legislation has been going on since about 1986 and various aspects of it are still matters for discussion between the revenue administrations.  There are certain aspects of that legislation which would certainly be helpful to US investment in Ireland but I am not so sure that they are totally helpful to the US administration either.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all the Deputy should make himself aware of what is the true cost, that most of the staff there are coming from within the Civil Service and consequently are already being paid for out of other payrolls but are being divided into a subhead in relation to the Tánaiste's office.  Of course, I know Deputy Durkan, like his colleagues opposite love to misrepresent and give the maximum hype to any situation. However, I would advise Deputy Durkan and others that the tours are very successful. The public have shown a deep interest, as evidenced by the numbers <Col N="141" /> who have turned up every Saturday since last June when the practice was introduced &mdash; another aspect of open Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to voice my concern at the Minister taking three Priority Questions together.  I am particularly concerned that Questions Nos. 8 and 11 are being taken together.

      <P>The Deputy will be able to deal with his concerns by way of supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the tourism task force, which addresses all of the issues raised in these questions, is currently under examination in my Department, having particular regard to the tourism section in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993 to 1997.</i></P>
      <P>Consultations are underway with relevant Government Departments, representative bodies and agencies and among the issues being examined are recommendations in relation to: a tourism council; future of the regional tourism organisations; registration and expansion of accommodation; and a national entertainment committee.</P>
      <P>I will be formulating my proposals on each of these issues as soon as I have completed these consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, Bord Fáilte has been instructed to begin the process, where feasible, of introducing co-operative <Col N="146" /> marketing along the lines of the task force's concept of product development companies and I understand one such company, to market golf products, is already in place and that the board plan to establish others in the course of the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Tourism and Trade and on this, his first day in the House answering questions in that capacity.  I welcome the fact that on the face of it the Government appears to have realised the importance of tourism in the economy by at least initially giving an indication of upgrading the Department from its former role.  However, I wish to put it to the Minister that the report of the specially commissioned tourism task force, published in October, has in effect been buried by the Minister.  I should like to put it to him that reference to the report of the task force in the Programme for a Partnership Government specifically states that key elements of the report will be acted upon.  What are those key elements?  I should also like to put it to the Minister that the report was buried by him because its key elements were an embarrassment to the Government in relation to the compulsory Shannon stop-over, State funding for Aer Lingus and the future of the regional tourism organisations, all of which elements are contrary to the policy of the previous Government and have not been reversed by the present Government.</P>

That report should be read in conjunction with the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The matters raised by the Deputy will be considered by me in due course.  The Deputy made reference to the regional tourism organisations.  I have already met the regional tourism organisations and I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce my proposals in that regard.  The other matters referred to by the Deputy, in relation to the compulsory Shannon stop-over and so on, are matters for another Minister and I am delighted to be able to leave them in the hands of another Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to make a commitment on the setting up of an overall national tourism council to bring together the various tourism strands within the State, having regard to the realistic targets that have been set, particularly in the light of job creation projections?  Does the Minister envisage such a council as being important to allow for the creation of 30,000 jobs over a five year period and an increase of up to 50 per cent in tourism revenue?  I wish to put it to the Minister that unless an overall body in the form of a tourism council as envisaged by the task force is set up, Ireland will lose a tremendous opportunity for job creation in the next five years.</P>

      <P>The matter of a tourism council is mentioned in the report of the task force.  It is also referred to in the Programme for a Partnership Government which states that the establishment of a tourism council will be considered in the light of the role, function and scope of the new Department of Tourism and Trade.  I am willing to consider the setting up of a tourism council.  The Deputy would agree that there will be conflicting views about this matter as between various <Col N="148" /> organisations and bodies involved in the tourism sector.  Since being appointed Minister for Tourism and Trade, I have come to the realisation that one could fill at least half the Chamber with all the reports on tourism that have been written in the past decade.  It would take a whole class of PhD students to go through all the reports on tourism that have been written down through the years.  I am willing to consider the question of the establishment of a tourism council in the light of the report of the task force and in the light of the commitment made by the Government.  We need action in this regard and a number of umbrella bodies are willing to look after these interests. I have an open mind in regard to the whole question.  However, we have had many recommendations and reports from the Government, State and semi-State organisations and private individuals and it is time to implement some of them.</P>

Can he now confirm that these bodies have, in effect, been abolished in accordance with the Taoiseach's statement to that effect last October?  If not, what is the status of these bodies?  They appear to be in limbo at present.  Will the Minister agree that they have been abolished?  What is the status, if any, of regional tourism at present?  Does he consider the county enterprise board scheme satisfactory in so far as he accepts that there will now be 27 different bodies throughout the country marketing Irish tourism abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not evade the question, Deputy.  I said I met the regional tourism organisations shortly after my appointment as Minister.  I met the chairmen of those bodies as well as the chief executives of each regional tourism organisation and I think they would say that the meeting was quite fruitful.  I said I would come back to them when I had considered the matter further.  The Deputy is correct in saying it was proposed previously that the regional tourism organisations would be disbanded but, in the negotiations on the formation of the Government, a commitment was given in the programme for Govenment as follows: the new county enterprise partnership boards will have a significant role in tourism promotion in each county; the continued need in addition to a regional co-ordinating mechanism for tourism will be reviewed in the light of the task force recommendation.  As Deputies know, with regard to setting up the county enterprise partnership boards, it is intended that one arm of the county enterprise part of the board will deal with tourism.  Since my meeting with the regional tourism organisations I have had discussions with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and I hope to announce, in the near future, plans regarding regional tourism organisations.  I am conscious of the benefits of having a regional co-ordinating mechanism referred to in the programme for Government and I hope to be in a position soon to alleviate any worries Deputy Flanagan, and other Members, may have in that regard.  I hope it will be a satisfactory outcome for all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27, 31, 36, 42 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The dramatic fall in the value of sterling, coupled with the ongoing turbulence in the currency markets since September 1992, created serious difficulties for Irish firms in a number of overseas markets. Firms exporting to the UK market saw their cash receivables in Irish punt terms fall by over 10 per cent and in certain third markets, which take a high proportion of Irish exports, firms have faced serious price competition from UK companies.</P>
      <P>The very difficult trading environment which faced many firms in the country required a flexible and constructive response on behalf of all arms of the Government involved in industrial promotion and development.  The response of the Government was swift and realistic and was widely supported by industry and across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Within my area of reponsibility, additional finance was made available to An Bord Tráchtála to help firms with the additional marketing costs involved in maintaining existing business and in securing new orders.  I understand from An Bord Tráchtála that a special fund of £800,000 helped more than 540 companies to visit their target markets in the UK or Europe before the end of 1992.  A further £1 million has been allocated to this scheme by the board for the first three months of this year and I understand that there is a very strong demand from industry for support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála also initiated a number of support measures to help exporters including a 1-800 freephone help line to give exporters advice on the new and intensified programmes available to them to assist with difficulties in the marketplace; 40 market specialists <Col N="152" /> from An Bord Tráchtála offices in Europe, the UK and the US were recalled to Ireland to meet companies throughout the country and advise them on specific difficulties and opportunities and, where appropriate, set up market visit programmes and An Bord Tráchtála accelerated its inward buyer missions programme bringing overseas buyers to selected companies in the regions to discuss business opportunities.</P>
    <P>In September last year the then Government recognised that a redirection of programmes by agencies would not in itself be sufficient to meet the immediate difficulties of firms affected by the fall in the value of sterling.  On 29 September the Government established a working group to look at the nature and content of the problems arising for firms as a result of the decline in the value of sterling and to make recommendations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The working groups report was considered one week later by the Government on 6 October and an immediate decision was taken to allocate £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the turmoil in exchange rates.</P>
    <P>The result of his initiative was that through the operation of the market development fund, and through various schemes operated by other State agencies, the Government has been successful in helping companies to maintain employment during a very difficult time. Many companies have indicated that the support that has been available to them has made the difference between shedding labour or maintaining employment; between closing down or staying in business.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that there are no problems.  The Irish pound is still trading above parity with sterling and interest rates remain a burden on business.  Nonetheless the recent realignment of the Irish pound, while unwelcome and not the Government's preferred policy option, has nonetheless provided many of our exporters with a significant competitiveness injection in certain markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> In 1993 the Government is allocating a grant-in-aid of £37.82 million to An Bord Tráchtála to provide for its marketing support measures.  This allocation is 11 per cent higher than the 1992 outturn and will enable the board to introduce new schemes to help the export effort of indigenous industry.  One example of such new measures is its Europlace scheme which was launched yesterday and which plans to increase the number of full time sales people on the ground in continental European markets from the current 60 to 150 in three years.  I see the acceleration of that shift as a key objective for my Department and An Bord Tráchtála over the next four years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take <Col N="154" /> Questions Nos. 12, 14, 22, 24 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>On 6 October 1992, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce announced that the Government had decided to make £50 million available over a six month period to help firms whose employment and output were under threat due to the currency crisis and in particular the devaluation of sterling.  An allocation of £1 million was made to a number of marketing bodies &mdash; An Bord Tráchtála, CBF and BIM &mdash; to assist with increased activity under existing schemes.  The remaining £49 million was initially earmarked to finance the market development fund.</P>
      <P>The approval of the European Commission for the market development fund under Article 92 of the Treaty was sought and obtained.  In giving its approval, the Commission imposed certain conditions on the operation of the scheme.  The effect of these was that while the market development fund scheme could deal with approximately 75 per cent of applicant companies, a number of applications, particularly from larger firms had to be turned down.</P>
      <P>These companies were, however, free to seek assistance from the industrial development agencies under existing approved schemes and I understand that quite a number did so.</P>
      <P>The day to day operation of the market development fund has been handled by a special management team led by an assistant chief executive from An Bord Tráchtála and drawn from a number of State bodies.  Grants approved by the team are paid by An Bord Tráchtála from its grant-in-aid.  In 1992 a total of £8.882 million was paid out and the allocation in the Book of Estimates for 1993 is £18.088 million.</P>
      <P>When the then Minister announced the establishment of the market development fund, he indicated that the scheme would last for six months until March 1993.  The temporary nature of the scheme was a major factor in obtaining the European Commission's approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary criterion which applicants for assistance were required to meet was <Col N="155" /> the provision of an action plan which would demonstrate how the firm proposed to maintain and improve its competitiveness and to adjust to the recent significant changes in the marketplace. The Government has consistently indicated that assistance provided by the market development fund would be of a short term nature and in no way relieved firms of the need to make the necessary adjustments to their operations to ensure their long term survival.</P>
    <P>The Government at present has no plans to continue the scheme beyond the announced expiry date.  Any continuation of the scheme would require the allocation of additional funds from the Exchequer and the approval of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The situation is being kept under continuous review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That information, although it has taken the Minister some time to impart it, is not very meaningful unless he can give a breakdown of the number of firms and the average number of employees that have benefited.  For example, were the larger companies excluded from funding because of European Commission intervention?  Will the Minister agree that, in practice, the usefulness of the market development fund fell a long way short of what was intended?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The daily operation of this fund is carried out by a special management team.  The details requested by the Deputy will be given in the annual report of An Bord Tráchtála.  However, the Deputy can take it that the £50 million provided by the Government has been spent by a number of State agencies alleviating the problems arising from the currency crisis.  It is not my function to provide the figures now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I recall, the original decision to set up the market development fund included the provision of moneys from Europe specifically for the purposes of marketing products from <Col N="156" /> indigenous companies.  What proportion of those funds were used for that purpose? Were companies turned down because they did not have their tax affairs in order and, if so, were those companies given the opportunity to put their affairs in order.  Will the Minister give a response to complaints by some small companies that they were unable to comply with the bureaucracy and timescale imposed in the administration of the scheme?  The Minister stated that it is not his intention to extend the fund. Will he acknowledge that the same need which existed on 6 October last in regard to the purpose of this fund is still relevant today?  If the Minister does not intend to extend the fund, how does he propose to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised four questions.  In regard to EC funds, the £50 million market development fund was a Government initiative financed by Irish taxpayers.  The Deputy may be confused about this.  The marketing development fund was financed by taxpayers' money from the Exchequer.  In the initial stages of this fund some business people reported that there was a level of bureaucracy thay did not anticipate, but the Government, and the then Minister, must be complimented on the speed with which the fund was set up.  The management team must be complimented on the flexible approach which it adopted. The Government was conscious that it should involve a minimum of bureaucracy and that speed was of the essence in assisting firms.  Firms which applied to the marketing development fund would, in the main, say that the efficiency of this scheme and the speed with which it was set up was outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the extension of the fund, when this fund was set up it was made clear that it would expire on 31 March 1993.  In fact, it was one of the conditions in our negotiations with the European Commission &mdash; which were long and difficult &mdash; that the scheme would not be extended beyond that date.  Therefore, there will be no extension of the fund.  I appreciate the difficulties Irish firms are <Col N="157" /> experiencing at present, particularly those depending on the British market, because of the way sterling continues to trade.  The situation will be kept under review, but there are no plans to extend the marketing development fund beyond the end of this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister again whether companies were refused funding because their tax affairs were not in order and, if so, were they given a reasonable opportunity to put their affairs in order?  There have been complaints that some companies were not given such an opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question because the day-to-day operation of the fund was a matter for a special management team.  However, if the Deputy wishes, I can have the matter referred to the team and ask them to contact the Deputy directly.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent statement made by the outgoing chairman of Bord Fáilte (details supplied) in which he said that Bord Fáilte needed an extra £45 million in marketing support from the Government between now and 1997; if it is intended to provide these funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reported statement referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present examining proposals from a number of representative bodies and agencies, including Bord Fáilte, on the preparation of a new plan for the tourism sector up to the end of 1997. Among the issues being considered is the appropriate level of marketing assistance to be provided from the Exchequer, and <Col N="158" /> other sources, including EC Structural Funds, and the effort required from the industry over that period, in order to meet the targets set out already in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the view of the chairman of Bord Fáilte that this area of tourism provides one of our best prospects for job creation?  Have the remarks by the chairman, to the effect that the increased provision for job creation in the budget will be eroded by inflation and if the set target is to be met there will have to be a substantial increase in his allocation, been brought to the Minister's attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, I recognise the importance of tourism to job creation in the coming years and this is also recognised in the programme for Government. The targets set may look ambitious but worthwhile sustainable jobs can be created in this industry.  I am aware of the statement by the chairman of Bord Fáilte in this regard but I consider the amount of money provided by the Exchequer in these stringent economic times as sufficient.  The Deputy should bear in mind when speaking about the marketing fund for tourism that in addition to the sum provided by the Government in grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte, there is funding for tourism from the tourism operational programme of the EC, which in 1992 provided £4.4 million; an allocation under the INTERREG programme of £320,000 and funding from the International Fund for Ireland totalling £764,000.  In the Estimates, £21.5 million is the Government grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte and Bord Fáile's own resources amount to £4.3 million making a total of £31 million.  The chairman of Bord Fáilte would not be doing a good job if he did not look for more money from the State before decisions are made on the Estimates.  I am sure the Deputy will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that <Col N="159" /> the moneys being provided are adequate. Would the Minister agree that the moneys provided for marketing &mdash; I agree there are many different sources of funding &mdash; are the life blood for developing the tourism industry?  Without increased funding specifically for marketing we will not attract the required numbers of tourists to sustain the jobs that have been created.  In his reply the Minister referred to the tourism development plan which is largely based on the regional development plans which have been prepared over the past number of months.  Would the Minister accept that we will not reap the benefit of the national tourism development plan without the regional tourism organisations as the strength of the regions is fundamental to the implementation of that plan? Would the Minister accept that we need more money for marketing from all sources and that the regional tourism organisations are important for the development of tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is self-evident that every State and semi-State body could do with more money.  I agree with Deputy Cullen when he said that marketing is the key to attracting more tourists.  I have been impressed by the level of infrastructural development in the tourism sector over the years.  I accept that now is the time &ldquo;to put bums on seats&rdquo;, to borrow a phrase.  We have created a viable product which is up to international standards and I accept that marketing is the key to selling that product. However, the allocation for tourism promotion and marketing will be sufficient for the coming year.  I answered a question on the regional tourism organisations and I will be making a statement on them shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, and the Deputy should not try to imply it. The chairman of Bord Fáilte, like any chief executive of a State body, will want more money, but it must be remembered that if one State organisation gets more money it must be taken from some other body, be raised by increased taxation or borrowed.  The budgetary package announced last week is correct.  No money is falling out of the sky for us.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree, in retrospect, that it is unfair to dismiss the views of the chairman of Bord Fáilte as just another chief executive of a State enterprise doing his job?  The Minister must be aware that in the speech in question delivered at Dún Laoghaire, the chairman of Bord Fáilte said that even if he were denounced for treason he felt the situation was so compelling that he had to engage in open lobbying of the Exchequer for additional funding.  Has the Minister any plans to deal with the undoubted negative impact of devaluation, especially in regard to our expectations from the British market this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of Bord Fáilte has reached the targets set by the Government and, by any standards, he has done an excellent job. I do not criticise him for making the statement.  My job as a Minister is to use the funds made available to me in the best possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate question has been tabled on the effects of the exchange rate on Irish tourism.  There will be pluses and minuses in this regard.  Over the past year the growth in tourism has come from what is termed the &ldquo;non-UK area of Europe&rdquo;.  Due to the devaluation there will be a substantial benefit for people from those countries because their money will go a great deal further.  With regard to visitors from the United States, it must be remembered that in mid-August last year, the high point of the tourism season, the Irish pound was trading <Col N="162" /> at US$1.83-$1.84 and it is now trading at US$1.48, which gives us a competitive advantage.  The recent devaluation should have a positive impact on tourism this year.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Molloy's question, that decision is being considered in my Department.  However, it is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  I do not see it having an impact on the tourism sector this year.  I am sure people in County Galway, and elsewhere, will find ingenious ways around the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a satisfactory answer.  Would the Minister accept that the way we calculate tourism numbers is out of date and very suspect?  This is highlighted by the fact that business people who travel to the United Kingdom &mdash; some may do so up to three times a week &mdash; on each return journey are counted as a tourist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a farcical system and is grossly unsatisfactory.  It is because of the way we compile our statistics that we are unable to categorise tourists. Would the Minister accept that it is important that we do so so that we can tailor our tourism product and our infrastructural development?  We should know why we are attracting certain categories of tourists and we should also be able to analyse where we are weak.  We should match the product development to the categories of tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> This is a very important issue.  Would the Minister agree that some other method should be found for analysing tourism statistics and that this should be treated as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I stated that this is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office who keep the system subject to continual review and refinement. It may surprise the Deputy to know that since I became Minister for Tourism and Trade I asked how these figures were compiled.  Over the years I would have treated some of the figures given by the Central Statistics Office with disbelief.  A similar parliamentary question was tabled in 1990 and an interdepartmental committee comprising the then Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, CERT, Bord Fáilte and the Central Statistics Office was set up to look at how the figures were being compiled. That interdepartmental committee concluded that the compilation of these statistics was satisfactory.  However, I will have a further look at the matter.  I did raise it in the Department shortly after being appointed and the information I received then was that it had been investigated and that the inter-Departmental committee was satisfied with the compilation of statistics.  I can give details to the Deputy as to how the figures are arrived at by the Central Statistics Office. It operates a country of residence survey and a passenger card of inquiry, and thousands of people are surveyed.  This is a matter on which I have not a closed mind but I was somewhat taken aback that some years ago an investigation was made into this matter by high powered people who concluded that it was satisfactory. There is not much point in carrying out another investigation so soon again.  However I will have another look at this method, which was regarded three years ago by the committee to be fool-proof, because I am interested in getting the information in question.  I believe strongly that if you do not have the <Col N="164" /> market figures, whether you are in the car business, the insurance business or whatever, you will not operate satisfactorily, The data must be available in order to avail of the markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to commit himself to doing a little more than having a look at the matter again.  I put it to him that in order to prepare plans it is most important for a Minister for tourism to be able to identify who is and who is not a tourist.  Perhaps the Minister would commit himself to reporting back to the House on this matter within a defined period of, say, six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the methodology used by the Central Statistics Office, which is not part of my Department, is the passenger card of inquiry by which respondents are asked to indicate, by ticking the appropriate box on the inquiry card, the reason for their journey, be it business, visit to relatives, as a tourist or other.  A country of residence survey is also carried out and a couple of hundreds of thousands of people are surveyed in this regard, which in statistical terms is a very high ratio.  The Central Statistics Office which is not under my remit has statutory responsibility for compiling figures.  As I said earlier, I was surprised that some years ago this matter was investigated and was found to be satisfactory.  Therefore, when all the experts agree in this regard there is not much point in the current Minister carrying out another investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this attitude in relation to the matter and I hope he considers seriously how we can best use the available information.  I do not doubt the accuracy of the Central Statistics Office figures in terms of body counts and movements.  I think everyone would agree that these figures are accurate but we do not know what they are telling us.  It is essential that we break down the figures, particularly as they relate to Irish emigrants &mdash; a matter which is a bone of contention &mdash; with <Col N="165" /> what we may be providing in this area and how we will develop the plan the Minister spoke about in his previous question.  We should have specific information on the number of tourists coming here as well as trying to ascertain why people choose other destinations.  It is only then we can begin to build a proper basis for the development of the tourist industry.</P>

The matter of the independent assessment can be considered also. However, the Central Statistics Office is responsible for the overall compilation of national statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mandatory United Nations trade sanctions are currently in operation against Iraq, Libya, Serbia-Montenegro and South Africa.  In accordance with its international obligations, Ireland, along with our European Community <Col N="166" /> partners, has taken steps to give effect to these sanctions.</P>
      <P>There is a total trade embargo in effect against Iraq with the exception of medical goods, foodstuffs and certain goods for essential civilian use.  There is also a trade embargo against Serbia-Montenegro which affects all sectors other than medicine and food.  In the case of South Africa, UN sanctions remain in force in relation to the supply of military goods and services.  In addition, there is a complete embargo on the supply of arms to Somalia and Liberia.</P>
      <P>United Nations Resolutions No. 748 of March 1992 prohibits the export to Libya of arms and aviation equipment and services including the provision of engineering and maintenance servicing of Libyan civilian aircraft.</P>
      <P>At no stage did my Department have any discussions with, or contacts from, TEAM Aer Lingus concerning the negotiation of a possible contract to service Libyan aircraft.  The question of intervening to prevent such a contract simply never arose, therefore.  In this regard I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the statement issued by TEAM Aer Lingus on 15 February which pointed out that any suggestion that the company was being so prevented was inaccurate and &ldquo;utter nonsense&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the sanctions concerned directly affect the ability of this State and companies within it to trade with other companies, surely the Minister's Department must have an interest in the effect of such embargoes and sanctions.  Are there any procedures in the Department for main taining contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs with regard to reviewing <Col N="167" /> these matters?  Will the Minister indicate to the House whether there is correspondence from the trade section of his Department, which I understand has been transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to this section, with Mr. Grimes concerning a proposed contract with TEAM Aer Lingus to service civilian Libyan aircraft?  Will the Minister confirm that that is the case and that his denial that his Department had any knowledge of this matter is not quite true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered a question about the review of sanctions.  We are party to various UN treaties and it is a matter for the Government to decide on these matters at any time.  My Department has had correspondence with the aforementioned Mr. Grimes but as I pointed out in the reply the correspondence with Mr. Grimes implied that he was dealing on behalf of TEAM Aer Lingus and there was a contract in their remit.  As the TEAM Aer Lingus statement of 15 February pointed out, there was no contract whatsoever.  They said that the fact that the Government was preventing them from dealing in this matter was utter nonsense. I have some very interesting correspondence from the aformentioned Mr. Grimes &mdash; I will refer to some of it which might give an idea of the type of approach being adopted by that gentleman. As I said in my reply, TEAM Aer Lignus had no negotiation concerning a possible contract to service Liyban aircraft. Therefore, how can Mr. Grimes purport to be acting on their behalf?  They said he was not, and that the matter had nothing to do with them.</P>

Does the Minister or the Department have any procedure for monitoring the breaches of these sanctions by other countries, particularly when it is possible that we may be <Col N="168" /> losing contracts because of our adherence to the UN sanctions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that what the Minister is saying is that his Department has no means of monitoring or reviewing the application of the sanctions, trade sanctions in particular, as they affect other countries and as they affect trade in the State?  I put it to the Minister that one of the reasons for the virtual panic evident in the TEAM statement has as much to do with the restrictions which the US itself places on its <Col N="169" /> manufactured aircraft as it has to do with UN sanctions, because it states quite specifically in its statement that all its aircraft types are US, and that if it does not comply with US regulations as regards dealing with Libya, it simply cannot trade?</P>

      <P>I will quote the kind of stuff my Department got from Mr. Grimes, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain to you that if you don't mind your own business then we will consider publicly naming you on all the bus timetables &mdash; we print the latest scandal and name erring civil <Col N="170" /> servants on the bus timetables on the bus stops &mdash; and let the public know who is aiding and abetting the removal of jobs in Ireland.  We will consider issuing a press release announcing that we have the Ministers approval for the jobs &mdash; which if he denies, will embarrass him as he will then be seen to be against employment &mdash; and should any members of the Gardaí appear out here at our overhaul factory then we will make sure they get ejected and notify the Press and TV to show how stupid Dublin civil servants are.  No Garda of any kind will enter our overhaul factory, your orders, court orders or anything else.  If we find any member of the Garda inside in our factory they do they will be ejected unceremoniously in full view of the press and you can consider the consequences of that.  Face facts.  You cannot stop it so you might as well give in with a good grace and stay out of it. Its a good job that it is possible to monitor correspondence between your department and the Gardaí so we know what you get up to.</P>
    <P>I seriously advise Deputy De Rossa to take that kind of correspondence into account when he is dealing with Mr. Grimes again.</P>

I should like to know from the Taoiseach &mdash; I seek your guidance as to whether I can ask this question &mdash; whether he will initiate an examination and report to us as to how the medical and social services were unable to deal with this terrible tragedy during the long period in which this violence and incest took place?  Is there any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some time since the debate was adjourned last Thursday to reflect on what is contained in the budget.  It is fair to say that all independent commentators regard the budget as a damning indictment of the Government. It offers nothing to the two major sectors in our society which need assistance. It is ironic that after such a short time in Government the Labour Party should, in one fell swoop, be capable of disenfranchising the employed and the unemployed at the same time.  The budget offers no hope to the unemployed of gaining employment in the months ahead and it has substantially increased for those who have jobs the burden of being employed.  For example, the 1 per cent employment levy speaks volumes about the typical attitude of the Labour Party in Government.  The Government has taken this option in the hope that somehow or other it will be acceptable to those who are employed and that the money can be used in some way to satisfy some need the Labour Party has, without in any way thinking through the consequences it will have on employment. The Government increased employers' and employees' PRSI, and did not reduce the base or the higher rates of income tax.  Indeed, one could fairly and safely say there have been increases in all areas of taxation in the budget.</P>
      <P>How can the Government be serious about the creation of employment when the fundamentals are not right?  Many Members recognise that certain areas must be addressed if jobs are to be created.  Instead of decreasing PRSI, the Government has increased it.  Instead of lowering taxation to make employment more attractive, the Government has done nothing, except introduce the 1 per cent employment levy on gross earned income.  That represents a substantial increase in direct taxation.  It is clear from what the Minister said that this 1 per cent levy is not a once off measure &mdash; I believe it is here to stay.  The Minister in his Budget Statement said the yield from this levy would be in the order of £78 million this year and £130 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> That is too big a carrot for the Government to resist in future years.  That is what the Irish people have to look forward to.</P>
    <P>Already the signs for the Government are ominous.  I am surprised at the speed of the mismanagement by the Government. It usually takes a year or two before the full extent of the Labour Party mistakes in Government are clear for all to see.  However, we have seen within six weeks the approach to be adopted by the Government over the next four years.  If the Government remains in power for the next three or four years the consequences will be catastrophic.  We cannot afford the luxury of the policies which have been enunciated by the Government for the next four years.  We know what happened when the Labour Party was in Government from 1973-77 and again from 1983-86. What has happened in the early days of this Government and the contents of the budget would lead one to believe that it will not be any different.  The Labour Party will follow the same well worn path. It is obvious that Fianna Fáil is happy to be back in power after a devastating election for them.  The party is happy to leave its policies to one side in an effort to hang on to power and do the minimum required of it.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Looking through history books one can see the measures taken in other countries during major national crises.  I am referring to crises such as the arms crises in the First and Second World Wars, when Governments and Opposition politicians joined forces.  We have such a crisis here now; we have a major economic war on our hands.  If this is left in the hands of the two parties in Government to deal with the results will be catastrophic.  In the budget, the Government has indicated to all sectors that it has nothing to offer the unemployed and is going to further burden and drive out of employment those who have jobs.  When one breaks down the figures for those who are employed, the unemployed, those who depend on the State for part of their income and the farming community who depend on Brussels for so much funding, one can see that approximately 550,000 people are supporting a seriously and <Col N="295" /> desperately creaking ship which will be scuttled by the Government unless something radical is done.</P>
    <P>I should like to analyse one of the nuggets of this Government, asset disposal or asset sales.  In Opposition in the past seven years, the Labour Party berated the Progressive Democrats for bringing that concept to the fore.  It brought the wrath of Cain down on us and anyone else who attempted, in their words, to sell the family silver.  The Government has a new phase for privatisation, &ldquo;asset disposal&rdquo;.  There is not a murmur from the Labour Party benches about this issue.  The Progressive Democrats welcome this real conversion on the road to Damascus by the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties who were not helpful in this regard.  They should have been more determined to pursue, with the Progressive Democrats in Government, this very useful programme.  This conversion opens up many possibilities to us.  I welcome the possibilities opened up by this. I see that these funds are to be used to inject some capital equity into Aer Lingus.  That amounts to £68 million on the sale of the Greencore shares but we are a long way from clarity on that matter as evidenced by the reluctance of the Taoiseach and others to deal with it when it was raised by my colleague and party leader, Deputy O'Malley, today.  Many questions remain.  Are we to take it from all of this that there is a possibility that aspects of the business of Telecom Éireann will be privatised?  Are we to take it that there is a suggestion that areas of public transport are to be privatised? Are these issues now on the agenda?  Is there to be any honesty on the part of the Government in laying down a policy? They need not be afraid of those on the Opposition benches.  We would be only too willing to support realistic well thought out policies that can bring real benefit.  There are opportunities in this area but they cannot be dealt with in a sly way, in a way that causes confusion in the markets and to those that are involved directly in running the State companies.  That is no way to enunciate <Col N="296" /> a policy at such a crucial time in the economic life of this country.</P>
    <P>We are facing one crisis after another largely brought about by this Government's inability to deal with matters when they arise, and matters were allowed to slide since the beginning of the elephantine gestation of the formation of this Government.  That is not acceptable.  It is causing a loss of jobs in the country, uncertainty in the markets, confusion and lack of confidence both in the private and in the public domain.  That is the kind of Government that this country cannot afford.  We must divest ourselves of the type of &ldquo;non-policy&rdquo; that has been enunciated by this Government up to now. Otherwise, we are facing catastrophe.</P>
    <P>The Government pretends that the Culliton report is to the fore in its thoughts.  It is not.  Let that lie now be exposed.  It is not to the fore of this Government's policy because every action it has taken since they came into office, particularly in this budget, totally undermines the thrust of the Culliton report in terms of developing indigenous industry and creating employment here.  Nothing this Government has offered over the last number of weeks would lead one to any other conclusion but that there has been a reversal of what one hoped for, a radical Government in the weeks and months ahead.  We will pay a terrible price if this Government is not forced, whether from within or without, to change its ways in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to participate at this early stage in the debate in support of a budget which is well balanced and right for our present economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since EC and world market developments are of crucial concern to Irish farmers <Col N="297" /> I would like to introduce my contribution by laying particular stress on those two aspects.</P>
    <P>The past year has been a very eventful one for EC agriculture.  In June last the Council of Ministers agreed sweeping reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I have no doubt that the Common Agricultural Policy support arrangements needed to be adjusted and I am satisfied that the results achieved in those negotiations will benefit Irish farmers not just in the short term but for some considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>I had been concerned for some time that the increased expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy had not been finding its way through to farmers. Farm incomes were actually decreasing while expenditure has soared.  Too much support was being dissipated among processors, cold store operators and various middlemen.  Under the partial switch agreed last June from market price supports to direct payments, more EC support will go directly into the pockets of farmers.</P>
    <P>I know well that farmers want to make their living from the sale of their produce. However, producing without regard to the needs of the market is a recipe for disaster in the long term.  We have to export the bulk of our agricultural produce, about 75 per cent in the case of many of our products.  While our exporters have been gaining an increasing share in the relatively high priced EC market, we still have a strong dependence on third country markets and on the intervention outlet.  The institutional price reductions which will flow from Common Agricultural Policy reform will make us more competitive on Community and other markets while the compensatory payments in the reform have been put in place to ensure that farmers will not lose out.</P>
    <P>By the end of the three year reform period direct payments to Irish farmers will have increased by at least £420 million and will be in excess of £700 per annum in 1995.  It is vitally important that farmers optimise the benefits from the various compensatory payments.  In <Col N="298" /> order to help farmers in this endeavour, my Department has held numerous information seminars on both the livestock and crop sectors.  I have attended some of these myself and the size of the attendance and the interest shown at the meetings are a clear indication of the importance of such payments to our farmers.  To further aid farmers, I recently launched a special Teagasc Common Agricultural Policy reform advisory service and I would urge them to avail of this service to maximise their payments.</P>
    <P>This year's price proposals which were introduced by the EC Commission at the Agriculture Council in February are mainly the confirmation of the first stage of the agreed reforms.  I am having them examined at present in my Department and that examination will be completed in good time to allow me to respond to the proposals at the next Council.  I can asure Deputies of my determination to safeguard the interests of Irish farmers in these discussions both as regards the proposals themselves and in areas not covered by the proposals.</P>
    <P>Another issue which will have a major positive impact on farm incomes is the recent devaluation of the green pound. This will mean an increase of almost 9 per cent in all support prices and in a range of market related premia and subsidies. The estimated full year effects of the devaluation should be in excess of £150 million.  This will be of substantial benefit to farmers not just this year but also for the future.  In order to maintain the increased competitiveness which agriculture-based industries gained by the devaluation of the Irish pound, I have not sought a fully matching devaluation of the green pound.  I will, of course, keep the position on this under close review over the coming months.</P>
    <P>There is a number of matters developing in the European Community and worldwide which will impact on Irish farmers' incomes and agriculture gen erally.  They relate to the Single Market and GATT negotiations which were the subject of a debate here only last week and I think they were adequately deal <Col N="299" /> with.  I will therefore move to matters in the budget which are of direct concern to farmers and agriculture.  There has been a significant change in capital acquisitions tax for both inheritances and gifts.  For gifts, agricultural relief has been increased from 55 per cent of eligible assets with a maximum relief of £200,000 to 75 per cent of eligible assets with a maximum of £250,000.  This move will substantially reduce or even eliminate the gift tax burden for many farmers.  The new probate tax of 2 per cent of all assets over £10,000 in value is, potentially, a significant burden for many people. However, this probate tax can be avoided, any CAT liability reduced by 25 per cent and the new higher agricultural relief availed of by passing on the property as a gift rather than as an inheritance. There is, therefore, a substantial tax incentive to give the family farm to the younger generation of farmers during the life of the owner.</P>
    <P>Although the VAT refund for unregistered farmers was adjusted from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.  I believe that this will continue to fully compensate farmers for any VAT paid on inputs.  It should be noted also that this new rate of refund is still substantially higher than the 2 per cent rate which operated at the end of the eighties.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a system of delegated administrative budgets was introduced into most Departments from 1 March 1991.  These budgets comprise the costs of running Government Departments and offices.  I have already indicate some of the changes which will arise from Common Agricultural Policy reform and the Single Market.  There is also a continuing need to implement the information technology plan of my Department and to improve where necessary the management and control of existing schemes, both EC and domestic.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I am particularly appreciative of the additional resources which have been made available to me by the Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In relation to Common Agricultural <Col N="300" /> Policy reform alone, the measures agreed in May 1992 involve a major overhaul and improvement of existing livestock premium arrangements and the introduction of new compensation measures to offset support price reductions in the livestock/cereals sector and to compensate producers for &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo;.  The number of livestock premium applications to be dealt with annually will, for example, increase from 236,000 at present to 420,000.  A further 180,000 applications will arise under the headage payments scheme, while it is expected that all arable producers, who number 30,000, will participate in the arable crops scheme.  In addition, the schemes are far more complex, due to the introduction of stocking density criteria, quota rights, national reserves, leasing and an integrated system of management and control.</P>
    <P>Under the Single Market, the current system of frontier controls is, as I have mentioned, being replaced by veterinary checks and health certification at places of origin and destination of animals and foodstuffs.  If my Department could not undertake these revised and new functions, Ireland would be unable to export live animals and animal products because the long-standing worldwide acceptance of our high animal health status would be put in jeopardy.  Our animal health status has always been an important asset for this country.  It is all the more important in the Single Market with the removal of frontier controls.  The practical aspects of the implementation of the new regime are proceeding satisfactorily and provision has been made in this budget to provide extra staff resources to cope with the more extensive checks and controls which will be required.  Our animal health advantages will be further enhanced by our recent attainment of Leukosis-free status, which will mean less restrictive requirements for our exporters.</P>
    <P>The TB eradication programme continues to be a very expensive scheme and a provision of £43.5 million has been earmarked for the scheme in 1993.  This is based on the normal contribution from disease levies.  The position in regard to <Col N="301" /> the availability of funds from the Community is not yet finalised.  I am making a very strong effort to have the level of the veterinary fund in the EC budget increased in order that the resources will be available to fund the re-vamped eradication programme which was agreed with the various interested parties during a series of discussions last year.  I am particularly anxious to clarify the position with the Commission with the minimum of delay in order that we are in a position to put a coherent and properly structured programme in place for the next three or four years.  In those circumstances the Estimates of my Department at this stage do not make specific provision for substantial EC receipts.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the total eradication of bovine TB is a more difficult task than originally envisaged.  There are many difficult and complex matters appertaining to the problem.</P>
    <P>The existing EC support arrangements for Irish agriculture will remain in place. As these arrangements are funded by direct borrowings in foreign currencies by my Department, it has been necessary to make provision of £25 million this year for exchange losses arising from the recent devaluation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to specific matters in the budget.  I am pleased, as I am sure are all Deputies in the House, that there is budgetary provision of £1 million to assist potato growers in County Donegal, which has a long tradition in that industry. I am also seeking to have that aid augmented by an appropriate contribution from the EC Structural Fund and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement about that at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the maintenance of an effective advisory and research service in the agriculture and food sector.  In the 1992 budget the Government provided a sum of £1 million to Teagasc to create the small farm development programme.  I am delighted that the 7,000 people who benefited under that programme will be augmented.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that research and <Col N="302" /> testing services have gained under the budget and that the Government has provided a special allocation to facilitate the introduction of a much-needed pig evaluation programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has further emphasised the importance of food research in the context of job creation by allocating £250,000 to provide for new research in the food area.  This is intended to stimulate the development by our food research institutions of joint projects and collaborative programmes which would be of wide benefit to the general food sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to Common Agricultural Policy reform and accompanying measures, I am delighted to be able to give a start to the farmer retirement scheme.  My Department is at present drawing up detailed rules for that scheme.  Provision has also been made for the agri-environment element of several other schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the provision for livestock headage scheme payments in 1993 in the Abridged Estimates for agriculture and food is £85 million.  That figure is additional to the provision by way of Supplementary Estimate of December last which allowed headage payment of £20 million scheduled for 1993 to be brought forward to 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition to those payments, I am delighted to be able to restore grants amounting to £76,000 to various voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>These and other aspects of the Estimates of my Department and of the Estimates for Forestry, for which I now have responsibility, will, of course, be dealt with in the House in the coming months in the context of discussions on the individual Estimates of the various Government Departments and offices.</P>
    <P>In summary, I regard this budget as a positive one from the agricultural viewpoint. It contains a considerable number of beneficial changes, changes designed to meet the needs of farmers, to contribute to structural improvement and to the needs of the food industry and, in general, to help in meeting the challenges <Col N="303" /> posed by Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>I propose to allow the remainder of my time to be taken by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and to wish you every success in that position.  I thank the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry for allowing me to use some of his time, and I congratulate him, too, on his appointment to Government.</P>
      <P>As this is my first speech to the House on economic matters, I should like to put on record my full and total support for the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I particularly welcome its provisions that relate to the tackling of the unemployment problem, which has such serious consequences for our society today.  I also fully support the budget policy and the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, which are set out very clearly in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I particularly note my full support of the provisions for social partnership and consensus in relation to the management of the Irish economy.  There is no doubt that the Programme for National Recovery and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were a success in the management of our economy.  Although not supported by all economists, in particular those from the far right, the consensus approach is the only way forward.  I believe in the mixed economy concept and in a socially caring approach.  It is my belief that all of those aspects are fully catered for by a consensus approach and by a social partnership approach.  The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects traditional Fianna Fáil policy and the 1993 budget is the first step in the implementation of many of its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget of 1993 has received unfavourable comment from several commentators and economists.  It is important to establish, however, where that criticism comes from.  It has been said that the budget does not do enough <Col N="304" /> for job creation.  The budget does tackle the unemployment problem but it can be expected to do only so much.  The Finance Bill is yet to come before the House, a new industrial policy embracing many aspects of the Culliton report is yet to be fully debated and brought forward and the provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government, as I mentioned earlier, have yet to be acted on.  The budget is only a small part of overall economic strategy.  Unemployment is a major priority of the Government.  It must be remembered that the Government had very little room in which to manoeuvre on this occasion and was this year severely curtailed by the enormous scale of the public service pay bill and by the high costs of the Department of Social Welfare.  Criticism of the budget is, therefore, unfair.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, the 1993 budget is a socially caring budget.  Perhaps that is the real reason it has been attacked by the <i>laissez-faire</i> economists writing in our newspapers.  The provision of social welfare increases in line with inflation demonstrates that the budget is a socially caring one, despite the budgetary pressures faced by the Government.  Social welfare payments were not always increased in line with inflation, in particular by non-Fianna Fáil Governments. In this budget child benefit is being substantially increased, £20 million is being provided for the reduction of hospital waiting lists, £16 million for remedial works, £1 million for the renovation of flats for the elderly in Dublin's inner city while there is a substantial increase in the number of local authority houses to be built in the coming year.  There is a housing crisis at present and I appeal to the Minister for the Environment in particular to make sure that the local authorities implement the plan for social housing.  They are proceeding with too much caution in this regard and many of the provisions of the plan for social housing are not being operated effectively by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make a case on behalf of widowers and separated fathers.  At a critical time the system <Col N="305" /> treats these people unfavourably.  It is unjust to means-test the lone parent's allowance, whereby men can end up being taxed as single people, leading to a drop in salary and very often a decrease in mortgage interest relief.  In addition I believe that tax concessions for expenditure on child care for this category of people is needed.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to review the plight of widowers and separated fathers as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the budget which encourage a community response to job creation: £25 million has been allocated to the county enterprise partnership boards.  The current structures stifle community initiative and enterprise; many people with good ideas come up against a brick wall when they seek financial assistance, ideas which would create local community jobs.  This is particularly true with regard to the service industries.  Communities can identify local niches in the market more readily and local initiative is the key; small scale, indigenous projects at a community level have a vital role and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The budget has been imaginative in relation to overseas development assistance, the plight of mortgage holders and in its provisions for mortgage interest relief.  It has also been imaginative in relation to the tourism industry and especially in regard to the car hire industry. The same applies to the VAT provisions in regard to flour, confectionery, car and hairdressing services.  Above all, the budget is socially caring.  The Government is giving job creation top priority and doing everything possible to bring about an adequate industrial policy and to implement measures to tackle the very serious crisis of unemployment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Bhí eagla agus sórt gliondair ar a lán daoine roimh an cháinaisnéis seo, mar cheap siad go mbeadh tairiscintí nua inti.  Tá Rialtas nua againn agus daoine nua sa Rialtas, ach tháinig an rud céanna leadránach faoi mar a bhí ann leis na blianta.  Níor deineadh <Col N="306" /> athrú dá laghad; agus ní aontáim ar chor ar bith leis an chainteoir deireanach.</P>
      <P>If that was Deputy Haughey's first speech on economics I should hate to hear his first speech on fiction.  He views the budget through rose-tinted spectacles. He said it was important to identify the sources from which criticism of the budget came but if that is the case we should also identify the sources from which priase for it comes.  I have come to bury the budget, not to praise it.</P>
      <P>The budget is the greatest non-event since I became involved in politics.  It reminded me of my very young days when the discussion on the budget always concerned whether there would be 1p to 2p on cigarettes and the pint.  In fairness I acknowledge that the children's allowance has been raised but it will mean very little to those depending on it.  It was the same kind of budget as that introduced by Mr. de Valera in the good old days when he worked with a small group of advisers.  Now there are Ministers, Ministers of State, advisers to the Minister and special advisers to individual Ministers. People were falling over themselves to give advice but they did not come up with one new idea in all their thinking and planning.  It was the same old mish-mash at a time when we were looking for guidance and when the 350,000 unemployed were looking for a ray of hope.  They wanted to see something happening which would give them encouragement. While there is an undoubted wave of cynicism towards politics at present it is very difficult to be surprised or amazed when one considers what was served up in the budget.  At a time when the unemployment rate is going through the roof a routine budget was introduced which might have been all right if the country was booming, if a small number of people were unemployed and if we did not have to deal with so many problems.  Unfortunately, there is massive unemployment and many problems, and unemployed people in particular deserved a better approach to solve their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that if the Minister for Finance came up with a crazy idea and announced that he would put a tax on <Col N="307" /> working people to build a replica of the Tower of Babel he would get thousands of people walking up to Heaven every day and coming down again, if they were foolish.  That kind of idea&mdash;mad as it is &mdash;would almost be accepted; people were longing for something which showed a specific effort to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to the farce of the Tánaiste's office because it has been highlighted by many people.  However, I object to the kind of double talk about the cost of these advisers.  Today I asked the Taoiseach a question about costs and, in reply, he said that advisers were getting 10 per cent more money.  Was that 10 per cent added to their salaries and did those people have to be replaced?  I cannot understand this: if advisers have been taken from the Civil Service will they be replaced by someone else and, if so, will it be an extra salary?  If they do not have to be replaced and have been paid in the Civil Service over the years, then there should be a sworn inquiry into what they were doing.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In speaking about the church, I heard some unfair criticism on a radio programme in regard to the amount of ashes displayed by some Deputies in the House last Wednesday.  Some of the people who made such criticisms might be better off it they attended church.  I wonder about the question of Civil Service pay and so on.  The delusions of grandeur suffered by some of the new Ministers are far removed from the delusions of reality they should have.  There are many problems to be faced and there should not be self-glorification.  I hope the new Minister present is noting my comments.  Despite the long negotiations between Fianna <Col N="309" /> Fáil and Labour they made one mistake. They should have appointed a Minister for arrogance and there would have been great competition for that position.  I would love to have been laying a bet on it.</P>
      <P>The budget was a non-event, a lazy man's budget.  The imposition of a 1 per cent levy was the easiest tax measure for a Minister for Finance.  It will affect those earning more than £9,000; a married person with 15 children earning £10,000 will be liable to pay the levy.  This is a tax and should be regarded as such and nobody knows for what purpose it will be used.  Originally we had a &ldquo;one page&rdquo; Taoiseach and now we have a &ldquo;1 per cent&rdquo; Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance took the easy way out.</P>
      <P>The adverse effects of the imposition of 21 per cent VAT on clothes have not been carefully thought through.  Anyone dealing in the real world will be aware that clothes shops have been experiencing difficulties mainly because of the activities of one chain store which have caused havoc for other clothing outlets. The 21 per cent rate on clothes is our highest VAT rate.  For climatic and other conditions clothes are essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I referred also to other conditions.  I do not want the Minister to get carried away.  It is a scandal that a 21 per cent VAT rate should be levied on clothes.  The tax on essential clothing is the same as that on luxury materials such as fur.  There was a great rumpus some time ago about clothes and it is wrong that the VAT rate on essential clothing such as a suit or a shirt is 21 per cent.  The question of employment is involved in this.  Many shopkeepers have given a lifetime of service, often carried down from their fathers and employ people on a full time basis, will have serious problems retaining staff.  Some of the chain stores employing part time staff will have great fun counting their money but this <Col N="310" /> increase will add to the unemployment problem.  People in the clothing trade have told me that business has declined in the past number of years.  A suit of clothes costing £200 will cost £42 more when the 21 per cent VAT is added. I hope the Minister will reconsider the imposition of a 21 per cent VAT rate on clothes because it will lead to difficulties for many people.</P>
      <P>Most people expected encouragement for employers in the budget.  I accept it is difficult to come up with a solution to the problem of unemployment at more than 300,000.  Everybody expected the PRSI rate to be cut.  My party suggested this cut and many experts accept that a cut in the PRSI rate would encourage employers to employ more people.  It is really a tax on employers for providing employment.  They have to pay PRSI, collect income tax and VAT and employ people to do the work of the Government. Instead of giving employers an incentive which would encourage them to create more jobs, the Government is asking them to pay PRSI on an extra £1,000.  I know employers who ceased trading because they were fed up with the worry of keeping accounts, VAT returns and so on.  If we do not facilitate business people who employ small numbers of people, we will have major problems.</P>
      <P>I know what the loss of 110 jobs means to a community from what happened in Carlow.  It is a shock to any community when 110 people lose their jobs, but job losses in two's and three's across the country can quickly add up to 110.  The Government should have made some effort to deal with devaluation rather than talking about patriotism and the value of the punt for three or four months before devaluing it, by which time the damage had been done.  Many business people, and industrialists who compete with British firms are in difficulty and the question is, how long can they continue in business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greencore in Carlow is experiencing problems at present and answers cannot be got to the question of the golden share. Can the beet quota be sold off by a foreign company if it takes over?  A statement <Col N="311" /> should be made to allay the fears of the workers in Greencore.  Some 20 years ago there was a march in Carlow demanding quotas for beet and it would be dreadful if something happened now to decimate that quota in the one industry that seems to be succeeding here.  I hope, despite the silence of the Taoiseach today and the sparse information given he will let us know what is taking place and ensure that the hard earned quotas are not decimated for the farmers involved in the sugar industry.</P>
    <P>The sneakiest and meanest measure of all was announced on the eve of the budget when health charges were increased.  One should not forget the fire, passion and absolute detestation displayed by Deputy Howlin, in Opposition when Fianna Fáil introduced health charges.  It is unacceptable that on the eve of the budget the Minister for Health should introduce further health charges, making it more costly to get treatment. It is an amazing turnabout for the Minister for Health to defend such charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is shaking his head, but he must accept there has been an increase from £10 to £15 for hospital visits and from £150 to £200 for a stay in hospital.  It is, therefore, more costly to get treatment when ill under the Labour/Fianna Fáil Government than it was under Fianna Fáil when Deputy Howlin did a song and dance about the introduction of the £10 charge. That £10 charge for a casualty visit covered a person if they had to return to the hospital but that has been changed and now ranges from £6 to £42.  Those who opposed the introduction of health charges under the previous Government should be answerable to the public for this turnabout.</P>
    <P>Increases of 3.5 per cent have been given to some social welfare recipients and the rate of inflation is expected to be 3.75 per cent.  People should not get excited about this increase because it is a farce at a time when the rate of inflation is expected to be 3.75 per cent and people will be expected to pay an extra 5 per cent VAT on clothes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> A great deal of money could be saved and allocated in different ways.  The increase of £6.50 in the carer's allowance was generous, however the only problem is that it is almost as difficult to qualify for that allowance as it is to become a Minister.  Generally, it is the wife who looks after the elderly but she is assessed on her husband's income and is only allowed to earn £2 in her own right, before deductions are made from the allowance straight away.  The carer's allowance is one of the really good innovations and people should be encouraged to take it up.  Many people are doing great work in caring for the elderly, thereby keeping them out of hospital, yet find it almost impossible to qualify for the allowance.  Those who qualify for it get the increase but there are many who cannot avail of it.</P>
    <P>The elderly get a raw deal.  I was amazed that a member of the European Parliament, a former Minister, hit the newspaper headlines when he warned Europe that there was a danger the elderly would be forgotten.  I could do nothing but smile because nobody gets as raw a deal as do the elderly in this country. There is such a demand for hospital beds that pressure is put on the family of elderly patients to take them home even though they may still need hospital care. There should be beds where these people can be transferred from the general hospitals to other hospitals where they can be cared for.  It is reprehensible that the elderly are not cared for.  Those people stood by the country when we did not have very much, they worked hard for low wages and the least we can do now is look after them.</P>
    <P>Alzheimers disease is on the increase but unfortunately nobody wants to admit victims of the disease to hospital because they demand a great deal of care.  Such people must be taken care of.  Any Minister worth his salt should have this whole area of care at the top of his agenda.</P>
    <P>There is to be a probate tax of 2 per cent.  However, if goods and chattels are handed over during the lifetime of the person concerned and inheritance tax is <Col N="313" /> paid, probate tax will not apply.  Unfortunately not everybody lives to a ripe old age.  People die in middle age and early old age.  Even the dead are not escaping so far as this Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the payment of a £200 grant on the birth of twins.  The money could be of some help to the parents involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Mr. Walsh, spoke about the early retirement scheme for farmers. If he does not get to grips with this issue we will have another shambles on our hands.  So far as I can see the scheme will not be of benefit to most farmers though they think they can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on this final point: if one is in the best of health, a parent of twins, not unemployed and, above all, lives in a nudist colony, this budget is not too bad; otherwise there is very little to be had from the budget.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are not interested in having solid progressive social development.</P>
      <P>The difficulties facing the Government in planning this budget are well known&mdash; high unemployment, high interest rates, adjustments required on foot of our entry to the Single Market, and so on.  However we must look to the future rather than lament our difficulties.  We must have confidence in ourselves, confidence in our country, and the confidence to build a better future for ourselves and for our children, using all the resources we can bring to bear and all the assistance we can expect from our European partners. In short, we must invest for the future.</P>
      <P>That is why last week's budget, as well as providing for the continuation of essential current services, provides a very large increase in funds for capital projects. The expanded capital programmes and projects are vital for the growth of the economy and they will lead to a large increase in employment, directly and indirectly.  I propose to devote the remainder of my remarks to these capital programmes.</P>
      <P>The allocation of nearly £90 million of Cohesion Fund expenditure to roads, sanitary services and environmental services will bring spending in these areas to record levels in 1993.  I will give details later of how the additional spending will be applied, and how it will improve levels of service.  But first, I want to draw attention to the immediate impact on the construction industry and on jobs.</P>
      <P>Investment and employment in construction is determined in large measure by the general economic climate.  But the Government still plays a significant role in encouraging activity in the industry through the financing of a diverse range of public projects and by influencing the overall level of private sector investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Public Capital Programme expenditure on construction activity is estimated to be £1,367 million this year, an overall increase of over 22 per cent on last year's outturn.  This increased investment <Col N="315" /> should generate a substantial increase in the number of direct jobs in the industry and thousands more in ancillary industries.  In housing, for example, the 3,500 new starts which have been authorised should lead to about 2,000 direct on-site jobs and as many more off-site.  The £117 million extra to be spent on roads and sanitary services should lead to some 2,300 extra jobs, and many more in ancillary activities. Overall, on the basis of the increases in investment provided for in the case of my own Department's services, I estimate that up to 4,500 extra jobs should be provided directly, with possibly as many more being supported in ancillary industries and activities.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for the construction industry has been broadly welcomed in the industry itself.  The unavoidable increases in VAT rates will have some effect on output but this will be more than compensated for by the impact of the extra funds provided for the housing sector and other services. The extension of the time limits for urban renewal projects and the revision of stamp duty on houses over 125 square metres will also benefit the industry.</P>
    <P>The large increase in capital spending this year puts an extra onus on all of us to ensure that the funds available is spent in the most efficient and effective manner.  The funds must not be wasted. I expect local authorities to ensure that proper procedures, from the initiation of a project to its completion, are in place to ensure that value is got from the resources available.</P>
    <P>Every organisation, whether in the private or public sector, must continue to seek ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and the delivery of its services.  Consequently, I have decided to establish a value for money unit in my Department to assist local authorities in the provision of services in the most efficient and effective manner.  The new unit will be integrated with the financial and regularity audit of local authorities but its work will be reported on separately.  It will operate in <Col N="316" /> consultation with local authorities and the local government audit service.  I will be contacting the city and county managers shortly to set out the basis for this initiative and to stress the benefits it can bring to all parties.</P>
    <P>With the support of funding committed under the Opertional Programme on Peripherality and new funding anticipated under the Cohesion Fund, investment in the improvement of the national primary and secondary road network will total £242 million in 1993, compared with over £167 million in 1992.  The introduction of the Cohesion Fund is responsible for £40 million of this total increase of £74.5 million. The new funds will enable us to further accelerate the pace of construction and improvement work on our national road network and to bring forward a significant number of desirable projects.</P>
    <P>However, I can say that I intend to transfer a number of high profile major schemes to the new Cohesion Fund.  The schemes involved include the Lucan-Kilcock Motorway, Contract 2; Setrights Cross, Clare; Drumsna-Jamestown, Leitrim; Sliabh Riach, Cork; North Road Finglas, Dublin; the northern section of the Dublin Ring Road; and the Belview port access road, Waterford.</P>
    <P>The release of major schemes from the existing Operational Programme on Peripherality will enable me to bring forward under that programme a substantial number of new major improvement schemes spread throughout the country. These will include major pavement improvement works at locations such as Shannon-Limerick; Grange-Piltown, Kilkenny; Enniscorthy-Edermine, Wexford; Kilbeggan-Rochfortbridge, WestMeath; and Fermoy-Mitchelstown, Cork. Projects of this nature will have highly visible and tangible impacts and enhance the overall road network by improving significant sections of road between other major completed projects.</P>
    <P>Additionally, work will start this year on major projects at Broomfield-Castleblaney, Monaghan; Bolton Hill, Kildare; Minish-Curraglass, Kerry; and the Sweep Extension, Waterford.  Overall, <Col N="317" /> the substantial resources now being provided will make it possible to continue, or to commence, over 30 major road improvement projects throughout the country in 1993.  In addition, with the level of funding now available, it becomes possible to put the emphasis on a network approach instead of concentrating on individual isolated schemes.  In effect, we can now begin to put together a coherent package of measures for each priority route, combining by-passes, major improvement schemes, widening, lining and pavement improvement projects, which will, over a reasonable period, provide for the full development of the route to the established national standards.  That approach will respond to the criticism of the lack of uniform quality and standards along particular routes and the problems created by moving from improved road sections to unimproved sections.</P>
    <P>Despite the very severe financial difficulties which we face, the Government is again providing substantial funding for non-national roads in 1993 and local authorities will also be devoting funds from their own resources to this purpose. I have spoken on many occasions of the need to ensure that the greatest possible value for money is secured from this investment.  In the last four years, the Exchequer has provided over £250 million for works on regional and county roads and returns to my Department indicate that local authorities have invested almost the same amount.  It is important that this investment continues to give results.</P>
    <P>A key concern for the Government is the creation of employment and road investment is making a major contribution to this on two fronts.  First, investment in this vital part of our national infrastructure provides support for the productive sectors of the economy, including industry and tourism.  It helps to sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs by reducing transport costs, improving reliability of journeys, and improving competitiveness.  Road investment also creates significant direct employment spread throughout the <Col N="318" /> country and has a significant impact on local economies.  I estimate that an additional 1,400 man-year jobs, at least, will be generated in 1993 arising from the increased investment.</P>
    <P>The increased provision made for the ongoing water supply and sanitary services programme this year allows for continued progress to be made on the construction of new and improved water and sewerage schemes throughout the country.  A significant proportion of the expenditure relates to schemes that attract Structural Fund support under the Operational Programmes for Water and Sanitary Services and under the Envireg and Interreg Initiatives.</P>
    <P>New sewage treatment plants are to be provided under the Envireg Programme at a number of coastal towns, including Wexford, Bantry, Greystones, Letterkenny, Dingle, Killorglin, Kenmare, Caherciveen and Tralee.  I have instructed the local authorities in these areas to expedite the planning of these schemes with a view to getting them to construction stage as early as possible in 1993.</P>
    <P>The budget allocates an additional £42.4 million for water and sewerage schemes in 1993 on foot of the new Cohesion Fund.  The overall provision for 1993 will, therefore, total nearly £120 million which is by far the largest ever provision for this programme in any one year.  This level of funding demonstrates clearly the Government's commitment to &ldquo;build on and speed up implementation of the 10 year National Environment Action Programme&rdquo; in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund will particularly support the objectives of the Government's Environment action programme and of the EC Urban Waste Water Directive in relation to better sewage treatment and termination of sewage sludge dumping at sea.  The design and management of coastal sewage treatment systems will be a particularly challenging feature of this programme.  We will need new design concepts and and new technologies to deal with coastal discharges <Col N="319" /> and the new volumes of sludge that will be generated by treatment systems.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward to the EC for approval projects to serve Dublin, both Ringsend and Howth, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford, Waterford, Westport, Drogheda, Dundalk, Wicklow and in 15 other locations spread throughout the country.  In addition, major water supply schemes to serve Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire, Galway, Tuam, Limerick, Thurles and three other areas are included.  EC approval is necessary before these individual projects can be included in the programme and I will be seeking that approval without delay. Some of the projects are at an advanced stage of planning and it is my intention to see that they get to construction as early as possible in 1993.  This investment will create this year up to an additional 900 jobs directly in construction as well as additional jobs in ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>Housing is another of the high priority areas where the Government's twin concerns of directly addressing social needs and employment creation can be tackled together.  The changes in mortgage interest relief announced are a well targeted response to the present level of mortgage rates.  Despite the severe budgetary constraints, the Government was anxious to ensure that those most in need, namely first-time purchasers and existing borrowers with average sized mortgages, got the maximum benefit. The measures in relation to the first-time purchasers will do much to ease, in the critical first three years, the affordability problem caused by high interest rates. The new arrangements will ensure that a couple purchasing their first house, with a mortgage of around £35,000, will get increased mortgage interest relief amounting to over £700.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the stamp duty position of new houses is a welcome move.  The impact of a full stamp duty on new houses which exceeded the limit of 120 square metres for new house grants has been a source of grievance for new house buyers and builders of larger family houses in recent years.  The new <Col N="320" /> measures announced in the budget provide important concessions in this area. All new houses over 125 square metres will now attract stamp duty on the site value only, taking 25 per cent of the total value of the house as the minimum site value for this purpose.  The benefit of this concession will amount to £5,000 on a £100,000 house which would have attracted full stamp duty prior to the budget.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to start 3,500 houses this year has been well recorded.  This will provide up to 4,000 jobs, direct and indirect.  With the major expansion of the house building programme I wish to see special emphasis being placed on inner city housing needs and on the importance of avoiding large greenfield estates. Detailed guidelines have been issued to local authorities to assist them in meeting these aims.  Taking account of the full range of social housing measures, including local authority housing, voluntary housing activity and the measures introduced in the Plan for Social Housing, I expect that the housing needs of almost 7,000 households will be catered for in 1993, an increase on the figure of 6,200 in 1992.  In the next couple of years we should be catering for the housing needs of 9,000 households per annum.</P>
    <P>As regards remedial works, a major advance has been made by the Government in recent years.  The budget in this area has been increased by £1 million which will not only provide essential employment but will go towards the refurbishment and renewal of existing schemes.</P>
    <P>This is a good budget, good for employment and good for meeting urgent social needs.  It strikes the right balance in meeting these objectives as well as in regard to managing the national finances.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me and allowing me to make my first contribution to the House in this important debate.  The 1993 budget was framed in the context of a difficult international economic situation. <Col N="321" /> The main characteristics of that budget, namely, keeping our public finances in order, specific provision for much needed job creation, and maintaining and safeguarding the position of those on social welfare, are a welcome and necessary response to the many problems and issues facing us.</P>
      <P>There appears to have been a view among some commentators that the national purse strings could have been opened more.  That was not a realistic option when one considers that the public sector borrowing requirement rose to 4 per cent.  I welcome the increase of £500 million in the public sector investment. The Government has maintained the necessary financial discipline to ensure that we have one of the lowest Exchequer borrowing requirements in the European Community.  I trust that the financial disciplines continued in this budget will lead to economic and employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, a set of measures in one budget will not adequately address the scourge of unemployment and the social deprivation and hardship that follows from lack of jobs.  Past responses to unemployment are not sufficient to tackle today's problems.  As a trading nation we are particularly vulnerable when the markets of our nearest neighbours are hit by a prolonged international recession. Regardless of international recession there is always room for improvement in home production and in subsequent marketing abroad.  A person need not travel abroad to identify possible improvements in a range of our products. A look through the shelves of any of our supermarkets will highlight the many inadequacies in our food processing industry.  As a representative of a Border constituency with a very important agri-business I urge the Government and the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry to substantially increase investment to properly fund research and development in food processing.  There have been some major successes in producing and marketing new food products but that success has been limited when one considers that employment in the food industry declined by 10,000 between 1980 and <Col N="322" /> 1990.  By its nature, the agri-business has a regional spread and it can contribute significantly to arresting the serious decline in our rural population.  In the context of Cohesion and Structural Funds I would urge the Government to give priority funding to this industry which is based on the natural strengths and raw materials of our country.</P>
    <P>The budget provided extra funding for housing and for the improvement of our transport links.  This is welcome and necessary from a social and economic viewpoint.  The serious difficulties with county roads, particularly those in County Cavan, must be addressed.  I urge every member of the Government to support the Minister for the Environment in his efforts to secure funding from the Cohesion and Structural Funds for this purpose.  Access to farms, to small industries and to our tourism product, especially our lakes and rivers in Cavan and Monaghan, is being hindered by poor road conditions.  Substantial progress is needed to improve regional and county roads.  We are not looking for a social handout but for equality of access to our homes, to farms and to places of employment. The people of County Cavan who have a strong work ethic are concerned at the damage being inflicted on the economic life of the county by the inadequate transport infrastructure.  I trust that the Minister for the Environment, through future additional sources of funding and possible reclassification of roads in the county, will be able to substantially improve the outlook for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Special schemes can contributed to job creation.  I favour the provision of such schemes on area-based needs and opportunities with a mix between public and private sector participation.  There is enough initiative and enterprise to devise public works schemes for people who want employment.  That would eliminate many of the deficiencies throughout the country.  It is evident from the Budget Statement that the next tranche of Structural and Cohesion Funds will be of crucial importance to the development of our economy.  I appeal to the Government <Col N="323" /> to discriminate positively in favour of the North-West because it is at the extreme periphery of the European Community and needs special assistance.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Smith on his first contribution and I share his disappointment and the disappointment of the House that because of the time restriction he had to rush his contribution.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of personality politics and I never have been.  Politics is about ideals and policies.  Therefore, I find it a bit stomach-churning to read some of the hypocrisies expressed by the media last weekend, concentrating on the personalities rather than on the policies. I tend to think it is the old story all over again: what they build, even if it is built with straw, they also feel a necessity to pull down.  There are, however, members of the Government who have contributed to this and have brought it upon themselves by what I can only describe as a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude, by the adoption of a high moral tone, pointing the finger at everyone else.  Any sympathy I may have for individual members of the Government is balanced by the reflection that the critics are only applying the standards and judgments which the same Government Ministers would apply and did apply when in Opposition and which they have sermonised about in the past. Unfortunately, it is not only members of the Government who suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overwhelming cynicism among the public in regard to the hypocrisies affects all of us in public life irrespective of parties. I have, on a number of occasions, referred to that public cynicism and I have expressed my fear that it is a threat to our democratic institutions.  In recent times that cynicism has increased substantially. Recent antics have had the effect of increasing it.  Public indications of it are already all too obvious and I fear that that criticism represents only the tip of the iceberg.  I am reminded of Thomas Hardy's reference to the <i>Titanic:</i>&ldquo;As this smart ship grew in stature, grace and hue, <Col N="324" /> in shadowy silence grew the iceberg too&rdquo;. I am very much afraid that that is what is happening at the present time, that the cynicism we recognise as being there is only the tip of the iceberg and it is growing almost daily.</P>
    <P>It has been the almost universal response that this budget was one of the worst ever.  That is not the judgment of political opponents but of impartial and independent commentators and economists. This was a budget not with a bang, but with a whimper, it was an elephant that laboured long and in the end produced only a mouse.  As the creation of jobs has been recognised as our top political priority, and as we have the worst unemployment record in the history of the State, this budget must be a colossal disappointment for all of us irrespective of party.  It is not in the interests of any of us that so many people should be unemployed.  Except for the social services here and in other countries there would be revolutions.  People would not be prepared to tolerate the unemployment which is their lot except for the caring and social services.  I do not understand how anyone in Government can pretend that this budget did anything for jobs.  The Fine Gael policy did not go down too well with the electorate but it made sense.  Fine Gael policy was that it should be profitable for an employer to create a job and made worthwhile for an employee to accept that job.  That was the basis of creating a climate for job creation.  That has not happened in this budget.  There is nothing in it which is pro-jobs.  Indeed, everything in it, particularly the 1 per cent levy, is negative in relation to jobs and to that extent it is an anti-jobs budget.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the partnership concept. This is supposed to be a partnership Government.  We have a Programme for a Partnership Government and, on an idealistic level, it is a concept I entirely support.  It is a concept of the haves and have nots getting together and of the powerful and the powerless getting together creating a bridge.  The concept, for example, that Fine Gael put forward that every person counts, emphasising <Col N="325" /> the importance of the individual in society but also emphasising the importance of those who are in a position to do something for those who have little in society, is one of partnership.  During the election campaign we heard much about the necessity to empower those who were powerless, were alienated, were marginalised, the disadvantaged, and to give them a say in society, to make them believe that they counted for something, that it should be power rising from the bottom up.  What is in the budget for those people?  Where is the concept of partnership or power sharing between the haves and have nots?  Where is the concept of empowering the powerless, the disadvantaged, the marginalised and the alienated?  There is nothing in the budget about that.  There is not even a promise in it in that regard.  For those who put their faith in those concepts in the election campaign the budget must be a huge disappointment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, is in the Chamber at present.  I welcomed her appointment, as a colleague from the constituency of Dublin West, as Minister for poverty.  I am not sure if she objects to that description but I would not object to being described so if I were in her position because the job facing her is to tackle the problem of poverty in our community.  In a statement I issued on her appointment I said that it was apt that a TD from Dublin West should be Minister for poverty because we have much poverty, in north Clondalkin and in the greater Blanchardstown area in particular.  I suggested at that time that if she could find a solution to the problems of poverty and disadvantage in her constituency, she would have found a solution to the problem nationally.  I wished her well as, indeed, I continue to do but I will judge her by results.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign a north Clondalkin plan was launched in Neilstown and we were honoured to have the then Leader of the Labour Party, now Tánaiste, Mr. Spring, present.  I hope the promises made on that occasion by Deputy Spring will be implemented.  If <Col N="326" /> they are we will have a solution to the problem of poverty in north Clondalkin and elsewhere.  That area suffers from serious deprivation.  Up to 90 per cent of the population is under 44 years of age and more than 60 per cent of the population falls into the category of manual rather than skilled worker.  In 45.9 per cent of cases the source of income of the principal earner in the family is unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  The area is physically, economically and socially marginalised.  In educational terms it must be given the greatest priority.  I hope that will happen. The standard responses from the Government will not be adequate.  North Clondalkin has been designated a pilot area and I envy the Minister of State the responsibility she has been given to tackle the problems in her own constituency and elsewhere.  It is a responsibility, but also a privilege to address problems in an area which, in so many respects epitomises the problems of poverty throughout the country.  I hope the Minister of State will be successful in her task and I encourage her in that respect.</P>
    <P>Members of the House received correspondence last December from Mr. David Kingston of Kerry Road, Cork. There was much publicity in the newspapers at the time concerning this matter. Deputies received copies of articles printed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and other newspapers in which the plight of this unfortunate individual was highlighted. In his letter to Deputies, David Kingston explained that his wife, the mother of five young children, had died three months earlier and referred to the understandable effect this had on him and the children.  He went on to deal with the circumstances of his case, that he was now to be taxed as a single man, despite having five children.  He said:</P>
    <P>I will now be taxed 48 per cent after £7,400 instead of £14,800 when my wife was alive.  The net drop in my salary is £1,500 p.a.  At the same time I employ a housekeeper in order to keep my family together without any subvention/tax concession of any kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> Adding insult to injury, my mortage interest relief decreases from a maximum of £3,200 to £2,320.  The State has willed that in my hour of greatest need the State takes at an increased rate.  So much for the family being a core value in the Constitution:</P>
    <P>In writing to you and all TDs in the Dáil, on behalf of all widowers/widows so affected, I ask you to adopt these issues as your own.  With your support they will be addressed in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>Minimum changes and improvements were made in the budget but what has been done in relation to the plight of this individual and many like him?  If we are a caring society, which we purport to be, and if we have a caring Government, which it purports to be &mdash; particularly the Labour element &mdash; what has been done for this individual and many like him in society?  Those of us who are fathers should take a personal interest in this matter because no one knows how many of us will be in the same situation as David Kingston in the future.  At some stage someone should tell me what has been done about this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new housing proposals outlined by the Minister for the Environment. However, I am also concerned about another aspect of housing.  I tabled a question to the Taoiseach on 23 February last seeking information about the number of private households and dwellings in permanent housing units, distinguishing those with no inside toilet, those without the use of a fixed bath or shower and without a hot and cold water supply.</P>
    <P>I found the reply extremely worrying. I accept that the figures I was given relate to the 1981 census and I hope the situation has improved since then.  The 1991 census of population should be available soon.  Those figures are very disturbing and other inquiries I have made suggest that the position has not improved much over that period.  Indeed, because of the passage of time other houses which were in reasonably good condition ten or 11 <Col N="328" /> years ago have now deteriorated.  Houses that had a hot water supply still have a hot water supply but they have deteriorated in other respects.</P>
    <P>The Government ought to pay more attention to the condition of houses in both the public and the private sector. The Minister talked about what they were doing in the public sector.  If a proper house condition survey were to be carried out, as is done in other countries within the European Community, I think the position would be extremely disturbing. Indeed, Members of the Government ought to be particularly disturbed. I notice, for example, in the Taoiseach's constituency that in 14.78 per cent of local authority houses, at the time of the last census, there was no inside toilet, that in 19.78 per cent of public authority houses there was no fixed bath or shower, that in 18.56 per cent there was no hot and cold water while in private houses 26.25 per cent had no inside toilet, that 28.8 per cent had no fixed bath or shower and that 26.98 per cent had no hot and cold water supply.</P>

I hope something will be done on this matter in the near future and that priorities will be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to one other matter, that is, the VAT of 12.5 per cent on newspapers.  This is a disgrace.  From the time Caxton first set up a press, a tax on knowledge has been something that responsible politicians have always abhorred.  It is disgraceful that rather than reducing VAT on newspapers it has been increased.  As a spokesperson on communications for my party, I emphasise the importance of a media policy rather than a broadcasting policy.  The <Col N="329" /> decision by the Minister to remove the cap on RTE advertising without taking into consideration the position of other sectors of the media was a bad one, a decision taken in isolation.  I hope this tax on knowledge will be the first item to be removed.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether the economic content is all that high but in any event I welcome the general thrust of the budget.  A week or two before the budget was introduced, the media gurus reported that it would be tough, that the Minister had very little flexibility having regard to the economic background &mdash; over 300,000 people unemployed, currency instability and high interest rates. It was being said that in effect we had to baton down the hatches.  However, I am delighted that the Minister has been able to introduce a budget which in the main has been welcomed by the people we represent.  It was not the disappointment or the hairshirt budget we had come to expect from the media economic writers. I am delighted that they have been proved wrong particularly so far as last Sundays papers, etc. were concerned. The commentators got it wrong and they could not swallow their medicine.  In fact the Minister did an excellent job in introducing a budget which was fair, the economic thrust of which was right for the time having regard to the financial constraints under which he was operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome particularly the social content of the budget.  Having regard to our <Col N="330" /> inflation rate the social welfare increases were practically within a point of a decimal place equivalent to the inflation rate. That is worthy of comment because we have many people in Ireland who depend on social welfare for the basic necessities of life.  I am delighted the Minister had the flexibility to ensure those people got the necessary increase to maintain a decent living standard.</P>
    <P>There are many worthy aspects of the budget which have to be reiterated.  Far too often we are inclined to point to what may be perceived as negative aspects on a budget.  As public representatives we have a responsibility to be constructive and to give encouragement to the people who have elected us to this House rather than being negative and opposing all the time.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal first with the new jobs fund for which £260 million is to be made available, made up mostly of Cohesion Funds.  I understand this is the first time the Cohesion Fund is available for distribution in Ireland.  We have had Structural funding in the past but we now have both Structural and Cohesion funding. I welcome the £148 million worth of Cohesion funding which is available for infrastructural expenditure to lift what is best described as a depressed building-engineering industry here.  In looking through the programme of proposed expenditure for the Cohesion Fund I regret that little or none of it is being spent west of the Shannon, that most of it is being spent east of the Shannon on roads, water, sanitary services, ports and CIE.  If that trend is continued in 1994 and for subsequent years I will have something to say about it.</P>
    <P>As a country we are on the periphery of Europe but is there anywhere more peripheral than the west coast of Ireland where there has been an ever increasing fall-off in population and where a large number of people have emigrated to the east coast of Ireland because of the perceived job opportunities here.  Deputy Gilmore will appreciate that such job opportunities do not necessarily exist on the east coast.  I regret that the west is sometimes seen as a problem area rather <Col N="331" /> than an area of opportunity.  I would like to think that in 1994 there will be a more equitable distribution of the Cohesion Fund west of the Shannon.  In regard to my own constituency I will be asking for a capital allocation for the Westport regional water supply scheme.  The Minister in a speech in the House some time ago referred to this scheme.  I look forward to it going ahead in 1994.  The jobs fund will give a necessary economic boost to the country.  The Minister gave a figure for the number of jobs which the fund will create.  I hope they will be divided equally throughout the country though job creation in any part of the country is welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the county enterprise boards.  I think there are more Leader programmes &mdash; five or six &mdash; in County Mayo than in any other county.  The programme for south-west Mayo is operated in my area.  I do not have the same faith in county enterprise boards as other people seem to have as I am afraid they will not get the amount of funding they appear to be entitled to, having regard to the faith we are attaching to them.  The Leader programmes in County Mayo receive considerably higher funding at present than the new county enterprise board there can expect to receive.  If one takes a national allocation of £2.5 million for the county enterprise boards, each one will receive less than £1 million.  Under the Leader programme, south-west Mayo receives £2.5 million in funding which is rapidly being taken up under the various categories.  In fact, there is not enough funding for tourist related projects. It is expected that the entire funding which is in excess of £2 million will be taken up.  Hopefully, the Leader programme, which is only a pilot programme, will be continued in 1994.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are a worthwhile mechanism but they have to be adequately financed.  I note that there is provision for approximately £100 million from financial institutions, but obviously &mdash; we do not have the full details of this &mdash; that money will not be given to the boards without some strings <Col N="332" /> being attached.  From reading the Minister's Budget Statement, I can only presume that the £100 million which will be made available from financial institutions will be by way of loans rather than grants or otherwise.  The seed capital, the grant element, to create small enterprises is, in effect, the £25 million.  The Minister responsible for the county enterprise boards should look again at the representation on those boards.  As a public representative and county councillor, I have no objection whatsoever to community and business groups and the social partners being represented in the main on those boards but I believe there is room for more public representation on them.  We are the people who have to stand for election and we can be elected or rejected as the people see fit.</P>
    <P>I am extremely critical of one aspect of the budget, that is the increase from 16 per cent to 21 per cent in VAT on adult clothing.  This is totally unnecessary.  If the Minister wanted to introduce a budget which was directed towards the creation of jobs he should have kept that rate of VAT at 16 per cent whereas it is now at the luxury rate.  To suggest that clothing is a luxury in this day and age is only playing into the hands of the Taiwan and Hong Kong manufacturers and the multi-nationals who have decimated small shopkeepers throughout the length and breadth of this country since last November.  The Minister has misjudged the strong feeling being generated within that manufacturing sector which employs between 16,000 and 25,000 people.  At the Futura Fair last Sunday, Irish manufacturers complained loudly and harshly about the small number of orders being placed with them.  Those orders equate to half their production for the year and that fair is held twice yearly.</P>
    <P>There are two factors which have militated against Irish manufacturers since the start of the Single Market.  A person who imports clothing from abroad does not pay VAT at the point of entry, they only pay VAT as a retailer on their sales, and some clothing may not be sold for six months.  However, if they buy from an Irish manufacturer, apart from paying <Col N="333" /> VAT at the increased rate of 21 per cent, 5 per cent more than they are used to paying, they must pay VAT to the Irish supplier within 30 days, the normal credit limit.  Accordingly, people who are sourcing clothing have a decided advantage and incentive to purchase from manufacturers abroad.  This will add to our balance of payments problems and put at risk our clothing industry, an industry which has been put at risk anyway as a result of the strong exchange rate for the Irish pound over the past four or five months.</P>
    <P>I have with me a fax message received from Gaeltarra Éireann.  I will not read out the contents but, for the first time since it was set up, that company makes an appeal to have this VAT increase reversed.  I support this call and I hope I get the opportunity to impress on the Minister why I believe this increase is unnecessary and will raise only a small amount of money.  This is a traditional indigenous industry, supported by the thrust of Culliton, and we should give every possible support to it, having regard to the small sum of money the VAT increase will bring in.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to keep a very close eye on the market development fund. This issue was discussed at Question Time today.  It would appear that a small number of companies which heretofore exported into the English market in particular, managed, as a result of the Exchange rate imbalance to successfully argue that they were worthy of funding under the market development fund. That small number of companies sold a large percentage of their exports to the large multi-national type shops in England, and were quite successful there. Because of the currency imbalance, their operations became increasingly more unprofitable.  They received a weekly subsidy for each of their employees under the market development fund.  However, with the help of a Government subsidy, some of them turned around and dumped their manufactured products on the Irish market at a reduced rate, thus putting at risk profitable clothing firms which were not eligible in the first place to receive <Col N="334" /> assistance under the market development fund as they were profitable and were in the main gearing their market approach towards Irish companies.  The Minister, in funding these companies, should, on a bi-monthly basis, check that the percentage of exports of these companies is continued at their previous level.  If there is an increase in the level of goods they supply to the Irish market, the subsidy given to them should be cut immediately. It is wrong to subsidise companies which put other native industries at risk.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the general thrust of the budget, particularly the very substantial boost which is being given to the building industry.  That industry was very depressed, not least because of the uncertainty in relation to the interest rate market.  I am delighted that this market has now stabilised &mdash; the rate is between 14 per cent &mdash; 15 per cent and one would like to think it would come down further.  In this regard, the lending institutions and, in particular, the building societies, who are the big players in this field should be congratulated for supporting the Government and not raising their interest rates immediately rather they suffered a loss over a period of a few months and ensured that they played their part, thus helping the building industry.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's initiative to build 3,500 new local authority houses this year.  This initiative is long overdue. I believe all of us would agree that the housing lists were increasing all the time, they were getting out of hand, and were causing extreme hardship.  Local authorities were unable to do anything about this problem as the social housing programme did not meet all the needs and cater for all the categories of people who required housing.  This initiative is only a start but I am satisfied that it will be continued.  If it continues at the same level in future years, it will make a substantial impact in reducing local authority housing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the new house grant from £2,000 to £3,000. Unfortunately, what was given with one hand was taken back with the other <Col N="335" /> through the increase in the rate of VAT on the building industry.  I believe the building industry should have been given the opportunity to get up off its knees. That industry employs many thousands of people, as Fianna Fáil have always recognised, and it has been proved right. We should continue to support the building industry which supports many subcontractors and service-type industries. Perhaps we should be more restrained in seeking a VAT increase there.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we retain in Government budgetary strategy the incentive to work.  I welcome the increase in social welfare but it is important that there should be a reasonable gap between social welfare payments and the take-home pay of those who are fully employed.  There are people for whom it is more worth while to be in receipt of social welfare payments than to work. There are factories in my town which continually advertise vacancies, particularly for females, but they cannot attract applications.  That is because they cannot provide the necessary return for 38 or 40 hours' work.  More restraint could have been shown in the budget to ensure that those at work get the maximum return. It costs an employer £2.59 for every £1 given to an employee by way of wage increase.  That is a large amount of money, made up of many different elements &mdash; not least the various levies. We now have a new levy of 1 per cent on salaries over £9,000.  A single person who earns £10,661 pays the top rate of tax. That is the lowest salary in Europe to be taxed at the highest rate.  We must continue the trend towards lowering tax rates and widening the tax bands in order to encourage people to stay at work and to enable them to have a decent take-home salary.</P>
    <P>I come from the west and it is important that there is equity in the division of Cohesion and Structural Funds.  That has not been the case this year.  I look forward to seeing what the Minister for the Environment will do regarding the distribution of road grants.  He has given us the global <Col N="336" /> figure but not the distribution on a county by county basis.  Regarding the discretionary road grant which covers main and county roads, County Mayo has 7 per cent of the roads in that category and last year we got 5.9 per cent of the funding.  That was not an equitable share and the Minister must make up that ground, especially since we have not received any Cohesion Funds in my county.  I look forward to the Minister's ensuring that we get our fair share.  We have problems, particularly because of the number of people migrating from the west to Dublin and elsewhere.  It is important to keep the higest possible population in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Hughes on what has been described as his first economic speech in the House and on making a very eloquent case for County Mayo.  His first contribution was to congratulate his former colleague, Mr. Flynn, on his appointment as EC Commissioner. I do not know what the former Deputy Flynn did with all the roads money available to him as Minister for the Environment.  Many of us thought that it was spent in Mayo and I am disappointed to hear that there would appear to be some inadequacy in that area of spending.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie referred to the growing disillusionment and cynicism with regard to public life.  He returned to a theme he has repeatedly dealt with &mdash; his concern about the effect of that on democratic politics.  I share that concern.  During the week I received a letter from a constituent who had fought fascism in Belgium during the war as a member of the resistance.  He expressed in the course of his letter the same kind of concern as Deputy Currie about the growing cynicism and alienation of the public and the consequent dangers for social and political life.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; was used during the week in two different but related contexts.  In its commentary on the 1993 budget the Conference of Major Religious Superiors stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> The 1993 Budget has failed to produce a comprehensive integrated programme to tackle the exclusion being experienced by large numbers of Irish people.</P>
    <P>The same term was used in a somewhat different but related context by the EC President, Jacques Delors, when he talked about the increasing level of unemployment in the EC, the implications of that in terms of social exclusion and its effect on society generally.</P>
    <P>In addressing this budget we would do well to reflect on the problem of exclusion.  One third of the population are living in poverty, by any of the objective criteria.  They are, by definition, excluded from the material benefits of what should be a prosperous State.  One in every five is out of work and by definition excluded from a meaningful role in the day-to-day working of society.  Many of the people who in the election expressed a wish for change in political life now feel excluded from political representation as they find, with each passing appointment of cousins, brothers and party hacks to the new inner circle, that they are excluded from access to the political system.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Digital debâcle and of the humiliation we experienced with the devaluation of the punt, the entire country feels excluded from the concept and type of European union and solidarity that we were promised last June during the Maastricht referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>The budget can be considered at a number of different levels.  It is the most directionless and most timid budget that has been presented in many a day.  It is a failure on a number of levels.  First, it is a failure because of the high expectations of many people with regard to this budget.  Many people who had been depressed by the economic circumstances of the country, by the poverty and unemployment I have described, and by the behaviour that they had seen in public life, had very high expectations of the new Government.  We were told that the programme for Government would be <Col N="338" /> the most radical one ever presented to this House.  I felt, not withstanding many of the elements of the programme with which I agreed, that the advanced billing that that programme got was somewhat of an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>We had high expectations that we were going to get open Government but, even within the last two hours, we have had yet another example of how that expectation of open Government has been shattered.  Today on the Order of Business, a number of Members raised questions about the Government's intention with regard to Greencore and whether it was the Government's intention to sell its share in Greencore.  At the very least the response was evasive.  If my memory is correct, it was to the effect that the Government did not have an intention to dispose of its share in Greencore.</P>
    <P>In his response to a direct question the Taoiseach stated that no legislation was promised.  By implication he said there was going to be no change in the status of Greencore and that the Government had made no decision on the matter. Within one hour the Minister for Finance announced that the Government had decided to sell its shares in Greencore. One question must be asked in regard to this.  As we consider a budget which has been described as one that fails to address exclusion, and as Members express concern about what is happening to politics and to accountability here, we must ask, when was that decision made.  If it was made before the Order of Business today, then the Taoiseach should explain to the House the reason for giving the misleading impression that he gave this House about Greencore.  We are owed that much at least.</P>
    <P>We were led to believe that very high standards would be set by this Government. The best that can be said about the Government's behaviour over the past few weeks is that it has sunk to the shoddiest, grubbiest kind of jobbery that this country has seen in a long time.  It may be argued &mdash; and no doubt members of the Government will argue &mdash; that they are being judged very unfairly and superficially on some of the matters that have <Col N="339" /> been the subject of public controversy in recent times.</P>
    <P>I took the view that the Government should be given some opportunity to show what its real intentions are.  My attitude was to wait until the budget to see whether the Government had any kind of a strategy to lead the country out of its difficulties.  I expected to see in the budget some strategy, some leadership and some indication that the Government knew where it was going.  Unfortunately, all we find in it is a recipe for drift.  It fails to tackle the problems of poverty and unemployment and fails to set out any kind of strategy to take this country out of the depression.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the various elements in the budget.  For example, 1.4 million people here are dependent on social welfare. The basic increase given in the budget amounts to a little over £2 per week and that will not benefit people until the end of next July.  Already that small increase has been eroded.  Many local authorities notified their tenants of increases in rents in the course of the past couple of weeks.  In my constituency people on pensions, those on the lowest incomes, have been notified of rent increases which fully erode the social welfare increases announced in the budget. Therefore there is no increase for people on social welfare.  That is all the more regrettable given that the Government did have an opportunity in the budget to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Government has simply passed on it.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about employment and we have been told that the central aspect of Government policy has been and is to create employment. Again, there is no evidence in the budget of how that is to be done.  The budget anticipates that there will be 26,000 extra people on the dole by the end of this year.  Within 24 hours of the budget speech being delivered, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment made significant changes to the community enterprise development programme which many of us believed would replace the <Col N="340" /> social employment scheme and that it would operate on a more flexible basis, would allow more people participate in worthwhile work than the present social employment scheme.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has effectively frozen the community enterprise development programme and has put it on hold until 1994 when, presumably, he believes he can fund it with some of the European money.</P>
    <P>We heard about the county enterprise boards on three or four occasions.  Those boards were promised almost 12 months ago and have still not been established. In my constituency a man who runs a small metal fabrication business, employs himself and one other full time and a third person part time, needs some working capital.  He has all the orders in the world that he can fulfil.  There are no problems in the area and there is a demand for the product he is making.  However, he needs some working capital.  I explained to him a couple of months ago that the new county enterprise boards seemed to be the solution he had been looking for.  He asked me how they would work and I explained that they had not been set up yet, that first a board would have to be established, that a manager, director or chief executive would have to be appointed and then, presumably, some staff would have to be appointed.  I told him he would probably have to make an application, that it would go before the board and, eventually, he might get something.  That man said he would probably be out of business by the time all of that happened.</P>
    <P>On foot of that I wrote to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and asked him if there was any interim measure that could be taken to give some assistance to somebody who was providing three jobs and who could not continue in business without assistance.  The Minister kindly agreed to send out an official from the IDA to talk to the man. The official explained to him that there was nothing the IDA could do for him as he was not producing an import substitute. He is, therefore, back to square one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> While the Government are dithering about establishing a method of providing assistance to people who are trying to create employment many of those people are going out of business.  If the Government wishes to commit itself to the county enterprise board format, which is a doubtful solution anyway, it should get on with the work rather than indulging in the kind of dithering we have seen over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>There has been great talk in the House about the question of tax.  I agree with what Deputy Currie said on the David Kingston case.  Mr. Kingston also wrote to me.  I would like the Minister for Finance to have a serious look at the problem Mr. Kingston raised when he is formulating the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like him to address the problems cohabiting couples are experiencing. The Department of Social Welfare considers them to be a couple for the purposes of the social welfare system and regards one as dependent on the other but, unfortunately, the tax system does not regard them in the same light and insists on taxing them as if they were single people.  If those involved, very often people in long term relationships, are both out of work they are treated as a couple but if in work they do not get the taxation benefit of the married allowance.</P>
    <P>Housing has been referred to.  I certainly acknowledge that the 3,500 house starts promised for this year are a significant improvement on the number of houses built in past years, but this has to be put in context.  There are to be 3,500 house starts, yet we have about 30,000 people on housing waiting lists throughout the country.  I must also express considerable disappointment at the manner in which those 3,500 house start allocations were made.  The whole of County Dublin, with a population of 500,000, was allocated 270 house starts.  My own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was allocated 110 house starts, yet that area has 1,300 people on the housing waiting list.</P>
    <P>This country had been expecting some leadership from this Government.  The <Col N="342" /> people wanted to know that the Government had some idea for leading the country out of its economic difficulty.  We had expected the Government to show in its budget that it had a strategy but, unfortunately, that has not happened.  It is my belief that the people would have been much happier with the budget had the Government taken firm decisions and shown that it had a strategy to deal with the economic problems.</P>
    <P>The old idea of the redistribution of income has gone very much out of fashion in recent times but it is an idea that will have to be put firmly back on the political agenda.  No matter how one looks at the issue, the levels of inequality that exist both on a global level and on a more local level cannot be sustained.  At a global level the gap in incomes between north and south cannot continue to be sustained. Jacques Delors has already spoken about the difficulties within the European Community that are being produced by inequalities of income.  Here at home the inequalities that exist in our society cannot be sustained.  The question of the redistribution of wealth and income in our society will have to be faced up to and tackled.  Those of us &mdash; and I deliberately say &ldquo;those of us&rdquo;&mdash; who enjoy marginally better standards of living than the rest of society will very soon have to come to terms with the necessity to reduce our standard of living in order to bring about a redistribution of income and the development of a fairer and more equitable society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I am very disappointed at the standard of contributions coming from the Opposition benches in this debate.  Some of the cynical remarks and the complete lack of positive contributions must come as an even greater disappointment to so many people who do not have a job.  Perhaps the Opposition can find no real fault in the budget and instead has to resort to attacking personalities, in particular those in The Labour Party.  The sooner the Fine Gael Party realises that The Labour Party will no longer be used as its mudguard &mdash; or, indeed, anybody else's <Col N="343" /> mudguard &mdash; the sooner that party might start to act as a constructive Opposition.</P>
      <P>As with every budget, this budget has its share of winners and losers.  The winners in this budget have had to be the most vulnerable in our society, and there are clear indications that a genuine effort has been made to ensure that and to implement the first stages of the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>The decision to build 3,500 new houses will be welcomed by many families on local authority housing lists.  Of course that number is not big enough, but it represents a more than 300 per cent increase on the number built last year or in the past few years and is a clear indication of the Government's intention to tackle the housing problem head on. Is the main Opposition party saying that those houses should not be built?</P>
      <P>The Government proposes to provide £20 million specifically to reduce the waiting lists in our public hospitals.  I have no doubt that the measure will be welcomed by the many people who have been waiting for years, some of them in constant pain, for hip replacement operations and other elective surgery.  Do Opposition Members say that that is wrong, or is it that the people they represent are able to avail of private services and therefore do not have to wait &mdash; in other words, that it is just tough luck if one cannot pay?  The provision of an extra £8 million for additional services for the mentally handicapped will go some way to help those in need and is clear recognition of the Government's commitment to handicapped people and their families.  Perhaps if the Government's critics were to visit some of this country's institutions they would acknowledge how unsuitable and how inadequate the facilities are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The severe shortage of geriatric facilities for the mentally handicapped, above all, is causing considerable stress to the parents of mentally handicapped children whom they look after in their own homes. Along with the stress of the day-to-day care of their children, they have the continual worry of what will become of their <Col N="344" /> children when they themselves pass away.</P>
    <P>The £2 million committed to the public dental services will be welcomed by the health boards as an opportunity to improve their facilities and to help reduce the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment, to ensure that no child will be at a disadvantage when they get older.</P>
    <P>The shortage of geriatric beds has caused great hardship to many families who are forced to avail of accommodation in private nursing homes they cannot afford.  The £4 million provided in the budget for the elderly will help in some small way to subsidise those payments. The need to increase the daily payments in public hospitals and to change outpatient charges is disappointing. However, I wonder whether the Opposition and some sections of the news media are more concerned at the £20 per day increase for private beds than they are at the increase for public beds.</P>
    <P>Even in a tight budgetary position money was found to increase social welfare benefits in line with inflation and, in many cases, above that rate.  The increase of 27 per cent in the child benefit is the first child benefit increase in years and is another concrete indication of the Government's concern for families and delivery of part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The child benefit was increased in just one budget from 1987 to 1992, by 3 per cent.  In this budget the present Government has increased the benefit by nine times that amount. The 11.7 per cent increase in the carer's allowance is welcome.  However, I ask the Minister to examine means of extending the scope of that scheme to more people who devote themselves to caring. The most severe cuts contained in the Social Welfare Act, 1992, have been reversed and a commitment has been made to introduce major changes to minimise the effects of other cuts.</P>
    <P>In a year in which it seemed impossible to make any adjustments to relieve the income tax burden on the pay-as-you-earn sector, some changes are made that will help those on low incomes, and these changes come together with the increase <Col N="345" /> in the personal allowance and the widening of the standard tax band.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to help those most affected by mortgage interest rates has been honoured and first time and recent buyers have been given most help. Indeed, the grant to first time buyers has also been increased.  In the recent election we gave a commitment to lower interest rates, below 10 per cent, which will be honoured despite the difficulties caused by the Bundesbank policies on interest rates.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the temporary levy of 1 per cent is not welcome.  However, the £9,000 exemption limit, and the increase in income tax allowance, will help to avoid major hardship.  Despite all the cries from the Opposition they did not make one suggestion as to where extra revenue would be found although there was a veiled suggestion with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>In education, the sum of £3.3 million directed towards the disadvantaged is another example of a caring Government. There was also the major increase in the capital programme.  I thank the Minister for Education for providing funding for the Ashbourne second level school and Kilmessan national school, which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Opposition that an insufficient amount has been allocated in the budget to create jobs.  There will never be enough &mdash; in any budget &mdash; to satisfy me while so many of our people are unemployed.  The Opposition's failure to put forward constructive suggestions is even worse and their inept contributions were a disgrace.  It is time that Fine Gael came clean and spelt out what their income policy really means. Are they saying that wage agreements reached with workers in the public service should not be paid?  Are they saying we should welsh on those agreements?  If that is not the case they should say so. Are they saying that local authority, hospital and Office of Public Works employees, the Garda, the Defence Forces, civil servants, teachers and health board workers should not get an increase?  Fine Gael has a proposal to <Col N="346" /> halve the employers' PRSI contribution but we have not been told from where the £500 million would come to fund a social welfare scheme.  Are they saying that the people dependent on social welfare payments will have their benefits cut to make up the shortfall?  If that is the case, they should say so.</P>
    <P>I worked for many years in the private sector and over the past number of years I represented workers employed in the public and private sectors, where I learned a great deal.  On many occasions I was told by employers in the private sector that there is neither a moral nor a social obligation on them to produce jobs, that their first and only obligation is to earn the maximum profit for their shareholders.  They will reduce costs wherever and whenever necessary and if that means reducing the number of people employed, so be it.  They will only take on workers when they feel it is necessary to increase production to fill additional orders.  I know that the major advances in technology and mechanisation have not been matched by the necessary reduction in the average working week, thereby resulting in thousands of job losses.  These two critical areas are totally ignored by many when they talk about the jobs crisis, this applies particularly to those on the Opposition benches.  I do not intend to be negative and I suggest that other areas must be explored in the short term.</P>
    <P>The increase of £500 million in the capital programme should create 3,500 additional jobs.  The proposed enterprise boards, with a £25 million budget, should be able to identify areas of expansion in small indigenous industries and create local jobs.  The veiled suggestion that unemployed people should be made do environmental work for their dole money is not only an insult to those unfortunate enough to be unemployed, it is an even greater insult to the many local authority workers who do this work at present and appears to demean the quality of their jobs.  Unemployed people want the dignity which a job brings and do not want to be marginalised even further.  The social employment schemes may seem, on the <Col N="347" /> surface, to make a contribution in the short term but my experience tells me that they merely provide a ready-made pool of workers in many cases for the black economy.  After one year the participants are back on unemployment assistance.  These schemes are not an answer to long term unemployment; more than 175,000 people have been unemployed for over six months or more and they need permanent, not temporary, work.</P>
    <P>There must be a radical new approach to the jobs crisis which the Government, employers and trade unions must recognise. I suggest the following measures as part of the solution to give unemployed people a proper job with benefits, good conditions and a reasonable degree of security: a voluntary job-sharing scheme should be introduced whereby every four workers would agree to share their jobs and gross income with one other person, thereby working four days per week and creating one extra job for a suitable, unemployed person.  The Government should be required to introduce a once-off net payment as an inducement to workers to participate in such a scheme. If even 20 per cent of the workforce participated it would create 40,000 jobs immediately and provide employment in a wide range of areas in the public and private sectors.  It would also help to expand the ever growing leisure industry. Tax incentives should be given to employers and employees to offset some of the loss in their incomes; also all replacements could be based on the same formula in addition to any new industries setting up.  In many areas in the public service a scheme of composite jobs could be created, for example, local authorities, forestry, vocational education committees and the Office of Public Works require additional workers at certain times of the year, but, unfortunately, those bodies are not in a position to employ them for the full year.  If a combination could be agreed between the various bodies permanent jobs could be created for many more workers.</P>
    <P>This Government will not be judged <Col N="348" /> on the number of their advisers, as some people believe, but on the number of people who obtain employment during their period in office.  If that requires the best advice available to reduce substantially the numbers unemployed it will be seen for what it is &mdash; money well spent.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the budget debate.  However, I am in two minds in regard to the whole exercise because of the recent leaks to the effect that the finances of the State are not what we thought they were.  We have been told that further black holes have been discovered and that countless millions are being taken out of the country and are not accounted for.  The budget has been built on figures which were not relevant on budget day or in the weeks leading up to it.  We were told that the economy is healthy and that gross national product in relation to our debt ratio was excellent.  Ordinary people were wondering if this was the case why so many people were unemployed.  It is not fair to blame officials when &mdash; as the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle often said &mdash; they are not here to defend themselves.  It is really the Minister who is to blame.  An American President said that the buck stopped with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that successive Ministers for Finance were negligent and we now know that there was a rip-off by multi-nationals who understated the unit cost of the product they were producing here to increase their profits, thereby gaining more from our generous tax concessions given to multi-nationals to encourage them to come here.  Nobody seemed to be able to detect this and we do not even know the amount of the rip-off. There were generous tax concessions, rates remissions and other incentives given to encourage these people here to create jobs while local employers, people with an idea who wanted to do something, were not given any money to create employment. Budget calculations were based on figures that do not stand up and we do not know the real position.  I do not know if <Col N="349" /> these figures are accurate or if the true figures are higher than those stated.  In 1979 92,000 people were unemployed and the national debt figure quoted was £6.5 billion.  Perhaps the number out of work then was 100,000 and the national debt figure was higher than £7 billion.  I presume that must have been the case if the figures quoted now are so understated. Obviously, the figures in 1979 were also understated, as it has been the trend here to try to paint the best picture. I do not disagree totally with that aspiration, as I am not a pessimist and I do not believe in gloom and doom.  We must look on the bright side but, at the same time, we must accurately state the facts because if we do not know the real figures it is impossible to assess the effect of the budget.</P>
    <P>In 1992 there were 269,000 people out of work and the national debt was £25.3 billion.  Perhaps £26 billion or £27 billion would be more accurate for our national debt.  There are now more than 300,000 people unemployed, perhaps 310,000 or 320,000.  Nobody can say definitely what the real figure is because we do not have a system for compiling accurate figures even though we are a small country with a population of only three million, or perhaps less than three million.  We are discussing a budget and a strategy for the next 12 months built on figures that we cannot be sure are accurate.  The national debt has increased by £5 billion or £6 billion since last September because of an indecisive Government which did not have the ability to make decisions.  It tried to defend the punt which was obviously overvalued and in the meantime destroyed many good businesses in my region, all for the sake of waving the green flag and being seen to defend to the bitter end, even to the point of spilling blood, the interest of the Irish nation. When the Government claimed that &ldquo;we will defend the punt&rdquo;, who was it referring to?  One would imagine that the money was coming out of the pockets of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste &mdash; who was then in limbo &mdash; or the Minister.  Those defending the punt were the ordinary householders, the people in the street, <Col N="350" /> business people, people with mortgages and overdrafts and people with accounts here who were hard pressed by creditors and who were paying high interest rates. They were penalised because of the Government's foolish policy which put an extra £5 billion, £6 billion or £7 billion on to our national debt.  Nobody knows the real figure because our accounting system is totally out of line and we are not in a position to give factual figures on a daily or even on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The budget is anti-agriculture, anti-employment and anti-Border regions.  It is pro-social welfare and I welcome that. I welcome any benefits that assist the less well off.  On my way to Dublin this morning I noticed a very sad sight in the town of Kells.  There were approximately 30 or 40 young men queuing on the side of the street waiting to get into the local social employment office.  It was snowing and bitterly cold and those men were hopping from one foot to the other in an effort to keep warm and some were dragging on a cigarette.  Those were fine young men, clean shaven, well dressed and willing and anxious to work.  Instead they were in the degrading position of queing along the main street of Kells waiting for a handout from the State and none of us know how to go about providing jobs for those people.  I am sure the same can be seen in every town throughout the country.  I have brought the question of queuing outside social welfare offices to the attention of my leader.</P>
    <P>Could we not introduce a better system for these payments?  Must we humiliate the unfortunate people who have to queue for handouts from the State when we are unable to create employment or a mechanism by which they might secure employment?  It is not their fault that they do not have employment.  It is a sad reflection on this country that the Leader of the Labour Party &mdash; a party which claims to represent the under-privileged and the working class &mdash; surrounds himself in grandiose accommodation with plush carpets, swivel chairs and all the comforts of the day, while the people he claims to represent queue along our <Col N="351" /> streets for a meagre handout.  Could we not use our community centres or parish halls for this purpose?  That would mean that people would be in from the rain and cold.  Is it believed that if this humiliation continues some of them might stay at home and go hungry?  I hope this situation will be improved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in the area of social welfare.  Any assistance which can be given to those people and to those who are incapacitated or in any way dependent on health board contributions is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The only substantial increase in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is that for afforestation and the buzz words in agricultural circles at present are &ldquo;plant the land.&rdquo;  The perception is that our land and climate is ideal for afforestation and that ten or 20 years from now farmers will have a gold mine.  That is ideal for bureaucrats in Brussels because when the land is planted the problem of the family farm is over, the gate is closed and the people are gone.  Anyone travelling around the country at this time of year will see new forests coming up through the rotting grass.  In five years' time such forests will be well developed on many acres of arable land.  I am not anti-afforestation on poor land.  Such afforestation should be encouraged but farmers should not be encouraged to plant good agricultural land.  The afforestation trend seems to be penetrating into other areas.  Many urban Deputies may not understand the reasoning behind this trend, but when 30 or 40 acres of forestry develops in an area, the land alongside it is rendered useless.  The only alternative for neighbouring farmers is to plant their land.  In this way, afforestation gradually spreads; more land is planted, more farmers are driven off the land and the family farm disappears, as will life in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have been seeking an extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme in counties Cavan and Monaghan since our accession to the EC in 1973.  I see no reason why the entire counties of Cavan and Monaghan could not have been <Col N="352" /> classified as severely handicapped at that time.  In the meantime small portions of the lands in that area have been included in that scheme, but a large portion of the two counties is still excluded.  Yet, in the neighbouring counties of Roscommon and Longford, where the land is much better and easier to manage, all of it is considered severely handicapped.  I know one farmer in that disadvantaged area who has a milk quaota of 420,000 gallons, he is an excellent farmer and I congratulate him.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, decided that that man, and his neighbours, needed support from the EC and declared their area severely handicapped.  Those people are now eligible for headage payments on top of the income from his milk quota of 420,000 gallons.  Neighbours of mine have milk quotas ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 gallons but the present Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste decided they were well off.  I would like somebody to explain that to me.  Can it be explained to those unfortunates who are trying to survive on very low incomes?</P>
    <P>There has been talk about raising incomes to a national or European standard. The average income on the small family farm in my region is £2,400 per annum, which is less than £50 per week. These are not my figures but were compiled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The national farm income at £5,500 is nothing to write home about either.  The Minister for Education described her secretary's income of £8,000 per annum as a mere pittance but farmers and others in my constituency are getting by on this level of income. Many farmers are not getting any aid or social welfare because when the social welfare officer calls he tells them they do not qualify.  Many people are expected to live on much less than the £8,000 which the Minister for Education described as a pittance.</P>
    <P>I am not anti-urban &mdash; indeed everybody came from the land &mdash; but many urban dwellers say that farmers are not paying enough tax, are getting away with millions and it is time to go after them. Where is all this money?  I have given <Col N="353" /> the figures but nobody is listening.  When everybody is driven off the land and rural Ireland is depopulated perhaps they will be happy then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe appears to understand what I am saying.</P>

      <P>The budget is anti-Border region as is the Government.  The area from County Louth up to County Donegal has no Minister and one Minister of State, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Mr. Gallagher, a very capable man.  I congratulate him on his appointment.  He visited my county recently and he was made very welcome.  The Government decided that it was not worth giving representation at ministerial level to our area.  What has the budget done for people in the Border areas?  Extra VAT on building materials will have a greater impact in the Border region than on the rest of the country.  It will be devastating. We talk about creating jobs and the most positive way to do that is to get the building industry up and running.  Everybody recognises that.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate how desperate the problem is.  Some substantial builders have said that development here is nearly over, that there is not much left to do. Ireland is twice the size of Denmark and we have approximately half their population. Denmark has a population of five million.  People who are ambitious are desperate, they think there is nothing left to do.  This country has not been developed.  We have massive potential if only we had a Government willing to lead us and generate the activity.  Putting VAT on building materials was not the road to go down to create jobs.  In towns within 50 miles of the Border this will have a devastating effect on people in the block making business, those producing lintels, cement and so on.  These commodities can be bought in Northern Ireland at a fraction of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> Before the present VAT increase competition was keen but was beaten off thanks to the industry of the local people. I suggest that Members read the <i>Sunday Press</i> of last Sunday which paid tribute to my county and its industrious people. But for those people there would not be any level of employment in the area.  The Minister should bear in mind that it is easy for people living within 50 miles of the Border who intend building a house or an extension to get a quotation in counties Fermanagh, Tyrone, Down or Armagh.  The work can be done at a fraction of the cost on this side of the Border.  How can we compete with that?</P>
    <P>We will have the same problem in regard to clothing.  People will flock to Northern Ireland as they did when petrol prices were so out of line that it was worthwhile to travel distances of 30 or 40 miles to fill the tank with petrol.  People are being encouraged to travel across the Border to buy their hardware and clothing.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the growth potential in jobs at present is in tourism. We have much to offer and my region, the lakeland region, has a great deal to offer.  Many small farm enterprises were able to keep up to six tourists but the Government has decided to tax this enterprise, thus increasing unemployment. It is generally accepted that to get people to give up a bad habit like smoking you price the commodity out of their reach.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude of the Government in relation to job creation, it is taxing people to prevent them getting work.</P>
    <P>We had great hopes for tourism.  We printed brochures to attract visitors from England, France and other continental countries but they are out of date because the Government did not see anything wrong about increasing the VAT on small enterprises that were being developed. That is a blow to tourism promotion in my region and to the county development team which, I understand, will be replaced by county enterprise boards. There will be other occasions when I will develop those points.  Many people will <Col N="355" /> be saddened by the budget and the statistics published in the past two days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody was geared for a savage budget but what emerged was anything but savage.  Unfortunately, the attitude at present is to knock everything. The knocking starts on a Monday morning at 8 a.m. when &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; comes on air and lists the bad news about anything and everything.  We seem to be concentrating only on the bad news and to be oblivious to the fact that the world is going through a great recession, that jobs are being lost in the Community and in the United States. Markets are dwindling and we have done extremely well to have increased our exports.  When we were told that our exports were up on last year, were in the region of £16 billion and that we can look forward to an increase of £1 billion this year, in spite of our setbacks, we should have heard people saying, &ldquo;well done Ireland, you are doing very well in difficult circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I look forward to having an opportunity when this debate resumes to develop those thoughts.  I will wind up by saying that we have a lot of work to do. The unemployment issue is a priority for all of us.  We are all conscious of this problem.  Recently we received a letter from the St. Vincent de Paul Society expressing their concern about unemployment. No-one is more concerned about unemployment than are the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for not opposing the First Reading of this Bill, thereby giving us an opportunity to have it debated in Private Members' Time.  Before I deal specifically with this long overdue measure which seeks to update criminal law and order to allow it to deal effectively with the epidemic of crime prevalent in society I want to pay tribute to Garda Agnes Reddy for her painstaking and caring investigative work in uncovering the dreadful treatment of a 27 year old County Kilkenny girl by her father.  I pay tribute to the garda for rescuing that girl from the nightmare of sexual and physical abuse to which she had been subjected.  If it is possible to honour Garda Reddy in any way for her efforts, we should ensure that is done.  In saying that I think I speak for all Members of the House and for the community at large.  Never has a case so shocked, horrified and upset so many people, not just women and young girls but men also, as has this one.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the garda concerned.</P>
      <P>Ireland has become a society of home alarms, steel shuttered businesses, neighbourhood watch and community alert areas, all desperate moves by a society under siege from the epidemic of crime and vandalism that is making people prisoners in their own homes and seriously undermining public confidence in the capacity of the State to maintain the basic elements of law and order in our society. Successive Governments, particularly Ministers for Justice, belie this reality by maintaining that crime is under control or that the incidence of particular crimes is decreasing.  To the extent that crime figures are falling it is simply because people are increasingly losing confidence in even reporting crime, particularly crimes whereby their property is interfered with or stolen from their homes, because they know, unfortunately, that the chances of the culprits being found are negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various reasons for the <Col N="357" /> deterioration of law and order in our society.  There can be no doubt that there are major socio-economic factors involved, particularly the problem of poverty which stems from mass unemployment. There are also the glamour demands and appetites stimulated by our consumer society.  There is a breakdown in values such as parental responsibility, family cohesion and individual responsibility for one's behaviour.  In addition, our laws are totally out of date.  The net effect of all these and other factors is a serious imbalance between the rights of the ordinary citizen and the virtual impunity now enjoyed by people intent on criminal behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe it is time to cry stop to this perversion of rights.  We believe it is time to effectively restore safety and security of home and property to every citizen.  It is about time the Garda were given effective powers to tackle the criminal, the thug, the unruly gangs and individuals, and to enable them to effectively carry out the job they are charged with doing.</P>
    <P>It must be one of the first duties of any civilised democratic state to uphold law and order and to ensure the personal safety and property rights of every citizen. In this context we have brought forward this measure to address a series of particular defects in our criminal law.  We have done so because the existing law for dealing with matters such as riotous and unlawful behaviour and tackling racketeering and demands for protection money is, in part, 150 years old.  Much of the relevant law in this area goes back to the Dublin Police Act, 1842.  In our period in Government, and through the Programmes for Government negotiated in 1989 and 1991, we sought to commence the codifying and updating of the criminal law, but unfortunately we got a negative response.</P>
    <P>The Bill &mdash; I will outline its provisions shortly &mdash; does not deal with all the defects in criminal law, nor could it.  It seeks to deal with a number of specific matters, matters that refer to public order.  It seeks to reform our criminal law in respect of certain public order offences <Col N="358" /> and to put certain common law offences onto a statutory basis.  In relation to violence in public places the Bill creates a number of offences of graduated seriousness from riot to affray.  It creates a new offence of unlawful loitering in public places.  It gives local authorities power to regulate behaviour in specified public places in their functional area such as streets, laneways, open spaces and so on. The Bill gives new statutory powers to the Garda to enforce the law by power of arrest in relation to public order infringements.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill I will refer to the Minister's comments in the Dáil last week when answering questions to her Department. She went to great lengths to tell us that the latest crime figures indicate a decrease in crime and that if there is not a sufficient number of gardaí on the streets resources would be made available for that purpose.  She also said she would accelerate the level of recruitment to the Garda.  There are approximately 800 fewer gardaí on the streets at present, at a time when we all agree the incidence of crime has increased out of all proportion, than was the case in the mid-eighties. On the Minister's own admission, given the retirement figures for this year of approximately 400 gardaí and the level of recruitment which is about 200, there will continue to be for the foreseeable future fewer gardaí than was the case in the mid and late eighties when the incidence of crime certainly was not as great as it is today.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that there are many socio-economic and other reasons that crime is so serious and I do not wish to take from them in any way but a two-pronged approach is needed to deal with crime. We need the fire brigade measures I am proposing to introduce this evening and we need a slower, more gradual approach which I accept takes perhaps generations to bear fruit, particularly as regards dealing with young offenders given that almost 40 per cent of crime is committed by juveniles.  I accept that to deal with that matter in a preventive way would be <Col N="359" /> much slower and would not bear fruit for perhaps a generation.</P>
    <P>However I would say to the Minister of State that money spent and decisions made now will bear fruit.  Considering that it costs £65,000 a year to keep one young person in Trinity House all of us must realise that it is in our financial interest as much as in our security interest to ensure that we apply the resources to combat crime in an effective manner.  In that regard I am pleased that the Garda Síochána is about to employ some new research facilities.  Although we may have many reports about the defects in the system more research needs to be undertaken, particularly into the incidence of juvenile crime, pinpointing the specific causes and outlining the measures that might lead to success in the future.  I welcome the proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the first duty of the State is to protect public order.  The State claims a monopoly to use force.  The media attention and the recent concern in the community is not just as a result of hype by a small group.  It is very real when people are afraid to use public transport, to walk down the street where they live or to cross a footbridge at night. This is a very serious crime problem. Most people accept that the balance is now very much in favour of the criminal. The Garda accept that, and they have become virtually helpless.  The community feel that it is hopeless.  Above all else, we in this House have a responsibility to provide the kind of laws that can give the Garda and the public the kind of reassurance they need that their personal safety will not be put at undue risk.</P>
    <P>The civil liberties of every person are very important.  When one talks about stronger powers for the Garda, longer prison sentences, more uniformity in prison sentencing and more custodial places for those who commit serious crime, it is assumed that this is a right wing reaction from somebody who is not concerned about civil liberties.  We can only show our real concern for civil liberties when we can show that ordinary <Col N="360" /> citizens are free and feel safe walking down the street at a reasonable hour of the day or night.  Without that assurance the ordinary person does not have civil liberties.  Our laws can ensure that we take care of those taken into custody and those who are questioned by the Garda, that appropriate procedures are in place and that, where there are miscarriages of justice, we can put them right and pay the compensation necessary.  That does not contradict the policy of having tough sentences to deal with the kind of problems I have outlined.</P>
    <P>For as long as crime pays criminals will engage in it.  There are far too many people in our society who have had a lifetime of crime.  It is a full-time job.  I realise that in many cases people engage in crime in order to feed a serious drug habit.  Garda sources estimate that there are about 1,500 serious drug abusers in Ireland at the moment and they tell me that that habit costs between £40 and £60 a day.  To feed the habit, the addict steals money, robs a handbag or carries out a burglary.  If he is caught and is in possession of drugs when taken to the Garda station, the drugs are taken away and the addict is charged; the next morning he is out on bail and goes back to the same habit again.  It is a vicious circle.  I accept that there were 43,000 visits last year to Trinity Court in Pearse Street but that service is not a sufficient response to the drug problem.  Until we have an adequate response to that drug problem we will have the vicious circle of people out on bail or out of jail having to get £40 or £60 a day to feed the habit.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill is the short title and citation section.  Section 2 puts the offence of rioting on to a modern statutory basis with powers of arrest.  The Bill defines rioting as where 12 or more persons carry out threats or unlawful violence and convince a reasonable person that his personal safety is in danger.  We are proposing that the penalty for that offence should be up to ten years or a fine or both.  The Garda will be given powers of arrest without a warrant. Section 3 creates a lesser offence where there are between three and 12 persons <Col N="361" /> involved in similar behaviour.  The penalty for that is up to five years or a fine or both, with the same powers of arrest being given to the Garda Síochána. Section 4 replaces the criminal law offence of affray with a modern statutory offence and it relates to one person being involved.  In relation to these three offences the powers that we are suggesting here are similar to the powers being given in the British Public Order Act, 1986, in intent and in suggested penalties.</P>
    <P>Section 5 introduces a new offence of unlawful loitering and it gives the Garda the power to disperse and prevent persons from unlawful loitering in public places.  This is of particular significance in many urban areas.  We know from many communities that gangs of youths, sometimes as few as two or three people, can hang around a bus stop or a public place and terrorise people.  I know from my contacts in suburban Dublin that people have to travel home at reasonably early hours of the evening by taxi because they are afraid of gangs that hang around bus stops and so on.  The Garda are powerless to act at the moment.  Despite the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in their Report No. 11 we need to introduce a new offence of loitering.</P>
    <P>Section 6 creates a new offence of criminal trespass.  It is proposed that where somebody is found in suspicious circumstances, for example, if somebody is found in the DPP's office reading files or is found in a bank or in an office of any kind for no particular reason in suspicious circumstances they can be charged with criminal trespass.</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces a new offence of racketeering.  The purpose of this is to criminalise acts of blackmail and protection rackets with regard to business. This is a very serious problem in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  As the Minister of State may be aware a very young businessman in Dublin has just come out of hospital, having been shot by what the Garda believe is a criminal gang, because he refused to pay protection money.  It is a disgrace that it is <Col N="362" /> not an offence to pay protection money and that we do not have adequate laws to deal with racketeering.  As early as the 1960s in the US authorities introduced very tough measures to deal with racketeering. This crime is placing a dreadful burden on business people many of whom cannot get insurance because their premises are constantly being burned and their windows being broken or they are being burgled.  They are being terrorised and being intimidated by well organised Dublin gangs.  Despite the best efforts of the Garda through surveillance and otherwise under existing legislation, it has not been possible in recent years to bring the leaders of some of these gangs to justice.  It is causing great distress to many people.  It is putting their businesses, their lives and their families in grave danger.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill creates an offence of possessing material or information for the purposes of committing an indictable offence.  It would cover the possession of disguises, detailed plans of buildings such as banks and notes of victims' movements and so on.  Proof of the exact nature of the indictable offence is relaxed where possession of the items is clearly related to the commission of some indicatable offence.  It is extraordinary that gardaí can come upon a group casing a bank for what they know is a robbery and can find all the documentation in relation to particular details about a bank and the activities of the bank manager or whatever and yet that is not an offence at the moment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives local authorities the power to introduce prohibition orders to prevent people loitering around back lanes, parks, laneways and so on.  This is an important power.  In many urban areas, these famous laneways are a source of a lot of trouble and crime because gangs and individuals constantly hang around them.  They are a source of nuisance to the community.  Why should a resident of a corner house have to put up with constantly having people loitering around intimidating him?</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the Garda the permanent power to put in surveillance <Col N="363" /> equipment, video cameras and so on in public places with a view to investigating crime.  It is proposed that this power be given to the Garda subject to the approval of the local authority who can revoke the power at any time.  This is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Minister's approach to the serious crime that has occurred in certain parts of suburban Dublin and in O'Connell Street.  The view tends to be taken that if crime becomes prevalent in some streets the solution is to deploy more uniformed gardaí there.  That is often the cry from the community but what happens is that when more uniformed gardaí are deployed the criminal activity moves to another area.  It is similar to a business situation where products can be easily stolen.  The owners of the business instal camera equipment to catch the culprits, it becomes known that in business X there is a possibility of being caught and so the criminals move to another business. Instead of deploying 50 or 60 uniformed gardaí to police the streets &mdash; I accept this measure may make the public feel more secure &mdash; it is much more important and would be more effective if crime could be targeted to ascertain who the culprits are.  That can only be done through underground surveillance methods by non-uniformed gardaí penetrating those areas where crime is rampant. I have strong views on this matter. I have spoken to many gardaí about it and they hold the same view.  The Garda view the deployment of uniformed gardaí, gardaí to be seen walking up and down the street, as a PR type response to an immediate problem but it is not a long term or effective one.</P>
    <P>We could continue to debate this matter forever.  It is of concern to all Members of this House as the balance has been turned around because almost all people or members of their families have experienced in recent years what they would regard as a serious crime. Such crimes may include motor car thefts, house break-ins or personal attacks.  As the level of crime is so high <Col N="364" /> the community feels that politicians must legislate for stronger measures to combat crime and give the Garda stronger powers.  Deploying extra gardaí will not be a sufficient measure if it is not accompanied by giving them powers.</P>
    <P>I accept in the short term that it will not be possible to increase the number of gardaí but the Minister might consider extending the Garda retirement age, from 57 to 60, as was done on two previous occasions.  This year 400 gardaí will retire while about 200 will be recruited. That will mean a further deterioration in numbers.  One per cent of the Garda pay bill is allocated to pensions.  It would cost approximately half a garda's salary in pension terms to keep a garda in the force, who would otherwise be retiring, and more importantly more experienced members would be retained.</P>
    <P>As has been the case in Britain and other European countries, we also need to examine the possibility of bringing in some voluntary assistance for the Garda Síochána.  There are many retired people who would be pleased to work on specific tasks assisting the Garda Síochána in a voluntary capacity.  Such assistance would free up many gardaí to participate in protection and detection work.</P>
    <P>I hope that in line with all the change we have been talking about, in regard to broadening our democracy and to Dáil reform, the Government will accept this Bill and not oppose it on Second Stage. The Minister of State, who is a lawyer, is aware that our law is seriously outdated in many respects.  Our criminal law is urgently in need of being codified and updated.  When parties go to the bother of preparing Private Members' Bills &mdash; I am not suggesting this is a perfect Bill but it can be worked on &mdash; I hope they will not be opposed on Second Stage.  On the contrary, I hope the Government will give encouragement to the introduction of Private Members' Bills by not opposing them on Second Stage and allowing them to proceed to final stage and become law.  The measures in this Bill are reasonable in the serious circumstances in which we live.  They are measures that are demanded by the <Col N="365" /> enforcement authorities and ones that would be supported by most reasonable people at this time.</P>

      <P>If a survey was carried out today and people asked what were the two concerns uppermost in their minds, I am sure the finding would show that the first would be unemployment and the second the rising crime rate and breakdown in law and order.  It is true in some cases, though not in all, that there is a direct link between the two.  It is true also that there is an obligation on all of us to address those concerns, particularly the problem of teenage crime, to address that by way of our social legislation &mdash; by the provision of better educational, recreational and housing facilities.  I am sure those issues will be addressed in the forthcoming and long promised juvenile Justice Bill.  There is an obligation on us, as legislators, to put in place the kind of law that protects our citizens, even in times of high unemployment.  We can no longer hide behind those who seek solely to find explanations or excuses for the rising rate of crime, vandalism and lawlessness; that is not enough any more. There is an obligation on all of us to find solutions to those problems.  There is a specific and direct obligation on all of us here to put in place a law that will deal effectively with the rising rate of crime, vandalism and lawlessness and make this once again a country where we can all live &mdash; as the Taoiseach said on the day he took up office &mdash; at peace with one another.  That is a fine aspiration but it is a long way from reality.  It is the first duty of any democratic state to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Article 40.2º of the Constitution states that:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to read that Article to those whose houses have been repeatedly broken into, whose property has been stolen and who have waited in vain for a <Col N="366" /> thorough investigation of those crimes or any return of their property, they would fully acknowledge that the aspirations of our Constitution are very much at variance with the reality of life today.  Indeed, the reality for a great many people and the view they have of law and order in this country, is that in too many cases crime goes unpunished and the victim is not compensated.  That is the area we are trying to address in the context of this Bill.  We are trying to put in place a law that will address newly emerging nuisances, menaces and threats of all kinds to the wellbeing and peace of our citizens and to the protection of persons and property.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this Bill is to put in place law that will restore some semblance of civilisation to our streets, our housing estates, to public parks and other public places.  The relentless breakdown in public order in such places and the growth in threatening, menacing and criminal behaviour has reduced the quality of life and peace of mind of our citizens and has made life a misery for so many, particularly the old and the frail, women living on their own and young people.</P>
    <P>It is not long since the women of Ireland were forced to march the streets in public protest to, as they put it, reclaim their streets, thereby giving a message to the legislators that they wanted put in place the kind of law that would make the streets of our towns, cities and villages safe to walk in at night.  That was a very modest request but one that has not yet been met.  It was a deep cry from the heart of our female citizens for some action, the type of action we are proposing in the context of this Bill.  The behaviour of rowdy, boisterous gangs collecting in housing estates and driving terror into the hearts of families, many of whom now are forced to lock their doors at night and are rendered, as Deputy Harney said, prisoners in their own homes.  That behaviour must and is being addressed in the context of this Bill.  I know a number of young people who are precluded from attending night classes &mdash; a very basic right &mdash; because <Col N="367" /> they are afraid to return home on their own or in small groups.  They are afraid to travel by public transport because there are small gangs lurking in corners, waiting to confront them and to strike terror into their hearts; many cannot afford to take taxis.</P>
    <P>What care do we have for the civil liberties of such people?  What civil liberties have young people who cannot attend night classes because they are afraid to go out on their own?  What civil liberties have people who are forced to lock their doors from the inside at nightfall and remain inside, prisoners of their own homes, afraid to go down to the local shop for a bottle of milk or a newspaper after dark?  What are we doing to restore their civil liberties?  These are the issues that concern our party.</P>
    <P>The general response to the breakdown of law and order invariably is calls for more gardaí on the street as it will cure all ills.  In the case of loitering and gang behaviour, a fairly modern phenomenon, all the gardaí in the world would not cure it.  Simply put, the gardaí do not have the power to disperse those gangs or remove them from bus stops, street corners, housing estates or many places where they congregate to strike terror into the hearts of ordinary citizens.  This Bill seeks to give such power to the Garda so that we will not be asking the Garda on the one hand to control these gangs and, on the other hand, tying their hands behind their backs by not giving them powers to do so.  The Garda will have to be given the power to move on those people.  Those young people must be given the option either to go home, take themselves off the street, or accompany a garda to the station to account for their behaviour.  That is the only way to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Garda, even with those enhanced powers, can deal with the problem successfully.  There is a need for a response from parents, particularly in the case of young people.  Parents will have to be required by law to take some responsibility for the behaviour of their children.  Where children <Col N="368" /> offend parents will have to be required in law to involve themselves in the rehabilitation of their children so that young people can be diverted from taking the first step to what may lead to a lifetime of crime.  One good deterrent &mdash; from the experience of my childhood &mdash; is to have in place a law that addresses the problem directly.  The implications for those who break that law should be communicated to young people.  They should know how far they can go and the line beyond which they cannot cross.</P>
    <P>It is important also that education should immediately address the problems of vandalism, petty crime and lawlessness. There is a remarkable absence of the teaching of civics in our schools. Many young people have no sense of identification with many of the public buildings in their cities, their villages or in their communities.  They do not realise that these buildings are theirs, that they were erected for them and that they, in turn, have an obligation to protect them and pass them on to the next generation. That is no longer an inbuilt part of their education.  That will have to be addressed if we are to get young people away from those practices which are making life difficult for so many people.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Bill requires to address the question of damage by vandals to public buildings, such as schools and public libraries.  In many cities persistent attacks on schools are leading to enormous insurance costs.  This money which could be better spent on building recreation centres or public libraries for young people, is being spent on restoring and repairing the damage done by vandals. We have got it all wrong, we must start all over again and put in place the laws and the system that will help prevent this type of carry on and will, as Deputy Harney said, make this country a place of which people can be proud and where tourists can walk the streets of our cities, and public parks without fear of attack.</P>
    <P>We must reclaim our public parks for the general public, for whom they were provided and not leave them for rowdy gangs who have taken them over.  Elderly citizens like to sit and linger and speak <Col N="369" /> with each other in those parks.  We must introduce the laws that will restore those parks to the purpose for which they were originally provided.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be one of a series of initiatives to solve the problems.  I ask this House, and the Minister in particular, to take on board the provisions of the Bill. Very often it happens in life, and in law, that the simple solutions are best.  We should not allow ourselves to be like Hamlet, &ldquo;sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought&rdquo;, waiting for something better to turn up.  While we are waiting much havoc is being visited on decent law abiding citizens.  We should not allow that to happen.  At the start of a new Dáil we should grapple with the problem.  We have the basis of good law in this Bill.  If it is passed without too much delay and if resources are made for the implementation of its provisions we can look forward to a better life for our citizens.  If that is not done the position will get worse rapidly and the legislators of this generation will have a case to answer.  I hope that will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I always welcome an opportunity to debate law and order in this House and for that reason I welcome this Bill.  However, the movers of the Bill know full well that the Minister has almost completed legislation, made up to some degree of the suggestions put forward by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. While this Bill is useful in many ways it only deals in a partial way with some of the major law and order problems in our land.</P>
      <P>While very often we express ourselves in different ways, our thoughts are the same.  One of the expressions I have alway used when debating issues of law and order is that people should have the right to walk through the streets of their cities, towns and villages without fear of attack.  Unfortunately, nothing has changed in that respect.  I am on record during the seventies as stating that &ldquo;the hooligans of today will be the gunmen of the eighties&rdquo;.  That has been borne out. The hooligans of the eighties will be the gunmen of the nineties and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our society has sunk to such a worrying level of depravity in terms of the kinds of attacks being perpetrated against citizens that our judges need to be given some form of training so that there is some consistency in sentencing.  Members of the public will tell you they are disgusted <Col N="371" /> at the sentences given to some criminals. The person sentenced for six or seven years for the dreadful incestuous rape of his daughter should have got two years for every year of misery, agony and pain he inflicted on that young person.  Sadly, there is no justice in our legal system. Something has to be done about that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the intimidation of witnesses.  Sometimes people from my constituency who want to go to court to give evidence but who are afraid to do so ask me what they should do.  I tell them that they must go to court so that the culprits may not go free.  However, even as I tell them this I fear for them and hope nothing happens to them because if it should I would feel in some way responsible.  In cases of intimidation and in cases where people who give evidence are afraid of revenge attacks, we should provide by way of legislation that there is a tripling of the sentence for someone who is subsequently found to be guilty of such conduct.  We hear much about civil liberties but the civil liberties of the victims of crime do not seem to come into the equation at all.</P>
    <P>It has been argued in some quarters that the severity of a sentence should be greater if the victim is an older person but I would not differentiate between older and younger victims.  Young people who are brutally attacked on their way home after a night out are entitled to the same justice as an older person might expect.  In my discussions with them over the years, the Garda have told me about the frustration they experience in endeavouring to move people on.  There is a need for a loitering Act.  There is no doubt in my mind that there is a need for legislation which would empower the Garda to move people who are sitting on walls drinking cider.  In this regard, the Act which was introduced to deal with abuses of cider drinking has been found to be flawed in many respects.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping young people in prison, £2,000 or £3,000 a week or whatever, has become almost a deterrent to putting people away.  There is plenty of <Col N="372" /> room in the Curragh to open up an Army type camp&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think Deputy McGahon and I agree very much on the type of measures which should be taken: we are very compassionate people but we are on the side of the victim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will have one later.  As of now, there are people loitering in the Phoenix Park.  These people do not intend to rob people; they go there to pick up young boys.  I understand this problem is very prevalent there and I know the rangers who work there are very worried about it but the culprits seem to escape supervision by the law.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday, driving through Mary Street I noticed that all the windows on the shops had shutters.  Dublin has become a shuttered city.  If I was a potential investor and saw all these shutters I would immediately think that something was wrong and would be reluctant to invest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the new threat of people being held to ransom by criminals with syringes.  These criminals draw blood from themselves and then threaten to inject people with it.  That is a separate offence which the Minister should cater for.  If, when they are subsequently arrested, these criminals are found to be HIV positive they should be put away and never released.  They are a walking timebomb.  A person who is jabbed by one of these needles may be receiving a <Col N="373" /> death sentence.  The perpetrator should get life in prison.  That would act as a deterrent.  I am not saying we should do what is done in many other countries.  I understand that in Argentina criminals with the HIV virus are chained to their beds so that they cannot escape.  I am not suggesting for one minute that we should do that; what I am saying is that people like the drug addict who broke into the Shelbourne Hotel and threatened some guests with a syringe before robbing them should receive a life sentence.</P>
    <P>Far too much emphasis is placed on the causes of crime.  We know what causes crime.  During the thirties Ireland had a worse level of poverty than any other country in Europe.  For example, in the case of 18,000 families in Dublin there were six to 14 people living in a single room.  The only city Dublin could be compared with for misery was Calcutta, where people actually died on the streets, and still do.  However, the crimes committed then were not as vicious as those committed now.  Maybe this was because people did not have anything to rob in those days.  The types of crime being committed today are vicious in nature and there is a complete and utter disregard and disrespect for the law.</P>
    <P>A year or so ago I helped in the arrest of a young fellow who was caught robbing a car.  The inspector who made the arrest said that the young fellow did not worry about going to jail.  When I asked if he was not worried about going in and out of jail every so often for the rest of his life he said no, he did not think beyond today.  That is the mentality of some of these people.  I acknowledge that some of them may have been abused and that their parents have come through the same cycle of crime but how does one break the cycle?  We can use all the means we like, for example, social workers can be used in helping to solve crime until one is blue in the face.</P>
    <P>When Loughan House was opened I was very anxious that there would be a secure detention centre for young people under 15 as we did not have one.  I accept that Letterfrack and Daingean reformatories should have been closed but we <Col N="374" /> only had open institutions.  When we visited Trinity House we were told that two or three of the young boys there were psychiatrically disturbed and that it took the staff all their time to look after those boys to the neglect of the other people there.  We must have a place where we can put psychiatrically disturbed youths, and there are such people in our community. It was a dreadful mistake to take responsibility for this issue from the Department of Justice and give it to the Department of Education who were not geared for the kind of criminal with whom they then had to deal.  There are three Departments involved in dealing with youth crime &mdash; Justice, Education and Health.  We need some Department to which these problems can be channelled. Bureaucracy drives everybody insane.</P>
    <P>I have a jaundiced view of some social workers.  Many of them are straight out of the universities.  I agree with Deputy Harney about the supposed drop of 2 per cent in the crime statistics.  It is hogwash. We know crime is increasing.  People are fed-up reporting crimes because they have been burgled and robbed so many times.  The gardaí know the people who are committing these crimes.  One superintendent told me that there are about 120 ringleaders throughout the city and that if he had the power he could take all of them off the streets within 24 hours. I would make apologies to nobody for taking those people off the streets.  They cause misery by leading gangs of young people into careers of perpetual crime.</P>
    <P>Some drug addicts need to rob £800 a day to feed their habit and some have no difficulty in doing so.  People do not argue with such people.  Parents should be held responsible for the actions of their children. We introduced a Bill providing for the imposition of penalties on the parents of children who commit crime, but it has not become law.  We must make parents pay if their child is responsible for burning a car.  This may have to be done by deductions from social welfare payments or otherwise.  The public are demanding it.</P>
    <P>People are getting nearer to taking the <Col N="375" /> law into their own hands.  If they do so, they may develop a taste for it and accost a person, demanding to know his business. That person might or might not wake up in a hospital a week later.  I agree the older gardaí should take over some of the softer jobs, such as delivering summonses, thus allowing younger personnel to play a more active role.  We need young gardaí on the streets and they must have the back up.  Every time a garda makes an arrest he is the one who is on trial, not the person arrested.  The legal system works to get people off on technicalities and the general public are sick and tired of it.</P>
    <P>There is a growing mafia-style protection racket.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Harney say there is no law against protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That astonishes me and something will have to be done about it. The IRA is very much involved in mafia-type activities such as dealing in angel dust.</P>
      <P>I refer to the blocking of the road by residents of Neilstown some time ago when one of their community was killed by a hit-and-run driver.  The blocking of a main road is not the answer and I would criticise the gardaí for not telling those people to move.  People have a right to travel to and from the city and they were prevented from doing so for three days because of this blockade.  The line of least resistance was taken.  The then Minister went out to meet the residents.</P>
      <P>Communities must regulate their own affairs and they need backing.  The neighbourhood watch scheme has worked very well in many areas but it needs to be developed.  Communities must take responsibility for their own members, but when they cannot prevail on people to behave the State must step in.  Perhaps a system of local magistrates courts could be established in these communities where the magistrates would know the people with whom they were dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> That is an idea for the long term.  We need instant action.  Crime is getting worse and people are very frustrated.  There is no use in throwing money at this problem. We should consider opening the Curragh. This is not a new idea.  We opened Spike Island some years ago, but I do not know if it is still in operation.  I would not be worried about supplying these people with televisions and three square meals a day.  I would give them very plain fare.</P>

      <P>No, I am not going back to that.  The crimes I have in mind are those involving violence against the person, bag snatching, breaking car windows with a crowbar.  People who carry out such crimes should be dealt with in a very substantial way.  As a youngster I cut turf and it was hard but clean work. A little hard work might give these fellows the work ethic and I think the public would support it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to make a brief contribution.  The issue of law and order and the high level of crime is of concern to every Member and I congratulate Deputy Harney on giving us the opportunity for this debate.  It is well known, however, that the Minister is bringing forward legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with victims of crime.  We read about them in the newspapers, see them on television and meet people who have been affected in one way or another by crime.  Our instance reaction is to ask what should be done with those who inflict hardship on the old by attacking them and damaging their property and those who attack gardaí in the course of their duty.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the current level of crime in our society is a matter of grave concern to every person.  For those of us involved in the legislative process there is a solemn duty to ensure that all possible steps are taken to ensure maximum efficiency of our laws and our law enforcement agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to preface one's remarks <Col N="377" /> on this topic by acknowledging that a major increase in the rate of crime, often of an extremely violent and appalling nature, is unfortunately a feature of modern life in practically all developed and developing societies.  The reasons are many and include rapid, and often uncontrolled, changes in the basic structures of society and exposure to violence on various media such as television, films and books.</P>
    <P>In relation to society, more and more young people are committing very serious crimes.  Family life has broken down for many of them.  Problems in the home have driven many of them out of their homes.  We read in the papers, and we have all received correspondence from some of the organisations such as the Simon Community, about the 4,000 or 5,000 young people sleeping rough having left their homes for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the major problems in the community today which indicates that parental responsibility is non-existent in many areas.  We cannot just walk away from this problem.  We must approach it in a very mature and positive way.  For that reason I was pleased at having met the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, some weeks ago and outlined to her the very serious problems in Cork in the context of Garda numbers, increasing crime and the concerns of many people in the community who feel they do not have the protection of the State when walking the streets of that city.  The responsibility to protect the community rests not alone with the Minister. Every Member must play his or her part to assure people that they can walk the streets of Cork, of Dublin, or of any other city, town or village and be assured that they will have the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>However, that is much easier said than done because of changes in our society. Deputy McGahon has articulated his views in the past about what our young people see on television and not always on foreign television stations.  I know we have no control over some television programmes because they are broadcast via <Col N="378" /> satellite.  We see such programmes on our own television channels.  There is a responsibility on people in authority.  The finger is always pointed at Members of this House who are fair game for everybody outside.  There is much greater responsibility on society, on the media, those in the communities, the Judiciary, and the legal profession.  Everyone has a contribution to make in approaching this serious problem which applies not just to Ireland or Dublin or Cork but to the Community and the world.</P>
    <P>We continue to work on improving our legal framework in order to make it more effective in dealing with crime.  We must make every effort to learn from the experience of other countries.  In principle I am in favour of incorporating the best elements of other legal systems into our new legislation.  However, it is equally important to stress that quality legislation is only possible after substantial preparatory work.  This preliminary stage must include a number of steps.  The most acute problems concerning this legislation must be clearly identified.  A comprehensive range of possible solutions must be drawn up and carefully assessed.  Factors which must be examined include the potential to make a significant difference and feasibility in terms of implementation and the need to maintain the rights of the individual. Because of the fundamental importance of our laws it is vital that new legislation is only brought forward when all of the preparatory stages have been completed. While there is an understandable anxiety to do something about crime every time we hear of a particularly vicious assault, we must resist the temptation to develop our legal framework as a reactive process. Such an approach is simplistic and very unlikely to be of significant benefit in the long term.</P>
    <P>The development of laws in the modern world is not a matter of simply refining existing legislation.  Rather it can only be properly undertaken if one adopts an integrated approach.  In particular one cannot isolate law-making from a detailed analysis of the underlying social factors which are heavily influencing the tendency towards crime in our community.  When preparing new legislation <Col N="379" /> it is vitally important that the views of all relevant agencies be taken into account when attempting to design the most effective innovations.  For example, I know that the Minister is involved in an ongoing series of discussions with the Commissioner and senior Garda personnel in order to be fully informed in preparing legislation.  I have no doubt but that these discussions will play a substantial part in focusing attention on the aspects of current legislation which are most in need of enhancement.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the vital importance of this phase of development of legal change.  While the precise details of law are undoubtedly extremely important, it is very naïve to think that major progress in crime reduction will take place simply through the introduction of more draconian laws.  In the United States where there is drug trafficking and murder, and where there is execution for the most serious crimes, their problems have not been solved.</P>
    <P>This debate has given us an opportunity to discuss this matter.  We have a very serious problem.  We must reassure the people.  We need not divide on this Bill tonight.  We must ensure that whatever legislation we bring in is effective. Far too often the law is not implemented and the course of justice is thwarted.  We do not want that to happen again.  The person we are all concerned with is the victim.  I fully support this move but the House should take its time on this and give the Minister an opportunity to introduce her legislation.  I am confident that this House will then play its part, with the other outside agencies, the Garda and the community groups, to make our cities, urban and rural areas alike, better places for us all to live in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to thank Deputy Harney for giving the House the opportunity to discuss this vital matter in <Col N="380" /> Private Members' time.  The Bill has great merit.  I hope the Bill will be the basis for legislation to be put on the Statutue Book and, second, that it will focus peoples' attention on this vital national issue.  I agree with those who say that there has been no reduction in the incidence of crime, regardless of what might show up in statistics.  It is a fact that there is a serious crime problem and it is getting worse annually.</P>
      <P>I have the height of respect for the present Minister for Justice, and the Minister of State at that Department, and I have no doubt that they intend to do everything possible to ensure that the problem is dealt with and that our streets and public places are made safe for people to go about their business. However, I would have serious reservations if they were to repeat the performance of the previous Minister for Justice.  I can recall, not so long ago, the previous Minister intoning gently to the nation that great things were about to happen and that our capital city, and its main street, were about to become havens of warmth and companionship where everybody could walk peacefully and safely by day and by night.  Unfortunately, not only did the previous Minister not deliver on that promise but tragic incidences took place as a result of his failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that at a time when we are supposed to be an enlightened, developed and civilised society in western Europe we have one of the most dangerous public thoroughfares in the world. That is a sad reflection on what we are supposed to be doing about the administration of justice.  People who visit the main street in our capital city, O'Connell Street, associate it with violent, horrendous crime.  If I were a teenager visiting this country I would be wary about visiting the capital city and I would certainly be wary about visiting the Phoenix Park or any other place by day or by night.  Likewise, if I were a teenager today I would be worried about going to a disco, a football match, a rock concert or anywhere else on my own.  I would not feel safe unless I was in a group among whom I could feel at ease and protected. Even in the open spaces there are predators <Col N="381" /> who prey upon young people regularly, first by feeding them on and encouraging them to take drugs and then to resort to violence.  We are doing little to deal with that problem, and I shall say more about that in a moment.  If I were a middle aged or elderly person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; who would, no doubt, have equal trepidation about walking the streets by day or by night.  I speak in a physical sense and not metaphorically.</P>
      <P>Crime in our society is an issue of desperate urgency.  Perhaps the environment of crime can be gauged from the reaction of an elderly person to a knock on the door at night.  Elderly people on hearing a knock will wait and, if they can do so, will look out the window to see who is there.  Before opening the door, they will call out to ask the caller to identify himself. People are terrified to open the door at night because they are afraid of what they might find.  How many times have elderly people opened the door only to be beaten up and robbed?  How many women in town and country areas have been raped under horrendous circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason no public attention was focused on such an important issue during the recent general election campaign, although I do acknowledge that there were one or two notable exceptions in that regard.  I am sure the issue of crime was raised in the constituencies of Deputies Harney and Michael McDowell, it was certainly raised in my constituency.  I do not understand why the main party in Government, and the previous Minister, did not focus on crime.  There must have been recognition within the Fianna Fáil Party of <Col N="382" /> what was happening and that it was time to do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the elderly but there is no crime that is specifically related to young people or to old people. It is an awful reflection on our society that the crime of rape affects people aged from nine to 90.  I identify entirely with the remarks by Deputy Harney in relation to a most recent horrendous incest crime that has been the subject of much discussion.  It is very sad that in that case the authorities were not alert enough to react quickly enough to avert what happened.  In my opinion, to a great extent the same could be said about the way we are now dealing with crime.</P>
    <P>A great many young people are unemployed. It does not follow that because young people are unemployed one expects them to kick in the doors of elderly people, steal motor cars or beat up people.  The majority of them do not do so, they are law-abiding citizens. However, it is a fact that if a large number of people are unemployed for a long time and have not known a different lifestyle, they tend to get involved in gangs and roam the streets, thus being led towards a life of crime.  From small beginnings comes serious crime.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty that someone brought to justice, if that is the case, might get away with little or no punishment. The Government could and should do something by way of the appointment of extra junior liaison officers.  The Minister told the House only a week ago during Question Time that there are two junior liaison officers for both counties Kildare and Carlow. County Kildare has a population of about 126,000 and County Carlow has a population of between 40,000 and 50,000.  It is hypocritical to expect two liaison officers to be able to deal with a population of that size, especially in an area that has a large young population.  It simply cannot be done and there is no sense in trying to deal with the problem in that way.  I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister will come to grips with that matter and will do something tangible about it; take action.</P>
    <P>The issue of bail also needs to be dealt with, and I have said that in the House <Col N="383" /> repeatedly.  This issue relates to both petty and serious crime yet it is not referred to to any great extent, although Deputy Harney, and other speakers, have made reference to the matter.  Notwithstanding the fact that an accused person is innocent until proven guilty, I make no apology for saying that if an individual were caught carrying a sawn-off shotgun or a knife of the type used in street offences that person should be remanded in custody rather than released on bail.  It seems that for as long as individuals are on bail they have no difficulty going about their criminal activities, repeating a crime as often as they like to achieve whatever results they wish.  Why can we not address the problem of the person who carries offensive weapons and repeats a crime again and again, thumbing his nose at the forces of law and order?  Gardaí tell us about the people they have repeatedly brought before the courts &mdash; some of them are later found guilty of more serious offences &mdash; and were remanded on bail.  The gardaí point out that, because of the revolving door syndrome, some people are back out on the streets and repeating the same crimes shortly after their arrest.  That must be soul destroying for the gardaí as they attempt to deal with such a problem.  In the past couple of years I have had occasion to attend some of the courts to observe the way the system works.  That can be an extraordinary experience for somebody who does not have any experience in legal matters.  Certainly, I felt that it must be soul destroying for the Garda who were obviously dealing with some of the same people, again and again, over a period of months, indeed years, to know that the criminals would get bail or that even if they did get a sentence they would not serve it all.  I hope the Ministers opposite are taking note of the problems and that they will do something about them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Harney said, extra gardaí on the streets will not necessarily solve the problem.  However, there are new areas in which there are no gardaí and other areas have, at most, one or two. In Leixlip we were fortunate to get two gardaí on a community Garda basis about three years ago although the population <Col N="384" /> of the town is 15,000.  In other parts of the country there are established Garda stations in towns with a population of fewer than 500.</P>
    <P>There are Garda stations but there is also a new phenomenon &mdash; the &ldquo;green man&rdquo;.  It is not a sexist remark; anyway I do not understand why it is called a &ldquo;green man&rdquo;.  It is a machine to be used in an emergency.  If someone is robbing your house or beating your next door neighbour you are supposed to go along to the local station if you do not have any other means of communication and speak to this machine by pulling down a handle. It is highly unlikely that there will be an immediate response from the machine and I would have thought, in the light of today's telecommunications, it should be possible to devise a more responsive system.</P>
    <P>The criminal of today has moved with the times and has all the communications necessary to keep afloat for the foreseeable future; despite our best efforts, the Garda are lagging behind.  I am sure that the Ministers opposite will recall an episode in the Dublin mountains a couple of years ago when a set piece was arranged enabling a certain criminal group to outstrip, upstage and sting the forces of law and order.  This was because they had telecommunications of a more sophisticated nature than those available to the Garda.  Incidentally, those same sophisticated items of technology &mdash; which Members in this House have often declared as the type that should be declared illegal &mdash; are available to the criminal.  This should not be the case as the Garda should have the most sophisticated and up-to-date methods of communication and the fastest system of response.  Whether we like it or not, the public still want to see the gardaí in the streets because their presence reassures them, even though they may not be the answer to all their prayers.  It would also be reassuring to know that the Government will respond favourably to this Bill and that they will not oppose it.  I also hope that it will be incorporated in legislation and that we do not get the kind of woolly response we have repeatedly heard over the last couple of years in this House.  It is an insult to people's intelisticate <Col N="385" /> ligence to hear their worthwhile suggestions from the Opposition benches &mdash; born out of experience or knowledge &mdash; rejected out of hand by people on the Government side who seem to be in possession of superior, celestial knowledge which the rest of us do not have.  Yet the crime rate rises and the people get more desperate, they have the impression, justifiably, that it is safer to be a criminal than a law-abiding citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and congratulate Deputy Harney on bringing in this practical Bill and for illustrating many of the adjustments we need to make.  It will come as no surprise to Members to hear that I am a hardliner and a right winger in regard to law and order; I make no apology for it because law and order has, in effect, broken down.  I do not believe that unemployment is the most serious problem we face, the public have accepted that no party, despite the glossy literature at election times, have any answer to unemployment and the advances in technology.  However, the main priority of our citizens is reinstatement of law and order, which cannot be done even if the Government accept this Bill, although it would be a help.  The question of law and order needs to be radically reappraised and draconian measures should be implemented.  Despite the platitudes expressed in this House over the years law and order have continued to deteriorate and there are many cases of elderly women locking themselves into their homes at 4 p.m. on a winter's evening.  Is that a normal society or one we want to sustain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law has gone soft on criminals. There is too much law and not enough order.  Last week John Major said that we must show more concern for the victims of crime and less consideration for those who engage in crime.  That is a relevant statement and I hope he acts on it, it was made in reaction to the murder of the little boy.  We also had a horrendous case here this week, to which Deputy Harney referred, the unspeakable crime in Kilkenny.  I advocate chemical castration for crimes of that magnitude.  That girl is not the first to <Col N="386" /> have had a child by her father, it is yet another layer of our society which has recently been unveiled.  Animals of that nature should receive the treatment to which I referred and life imprisonment &mdash; and I mean life.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the retention of elderly gardaí due for retirement.  Many of the young gardaí coming out of Templemore are inexperienced in the ways of the criminal but a 57 year old garda is not.  He is not old at 57 and the three years &mdash; until he reaches 60 &mdash; would be invaluable in keeping crime at acceptable levels &mdash; if one can use such a phrase.  Policies of containment and appeasment in relation to criminals are inadequate and are one of the reasons for the frustration in the Garda Síochána. I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Government in this regard, I indict my Government for their failure to implement radical measures in the years when they were in office.  The fact remains that crime has grown to totally unacceptable levels and the criminals are winning.  The Garda are fighting a losing battle, they freely admit that in private.  There is no point in blaming parents for the misdemeanours of their children, society is responsible and we as legislators are responsible for society in creating the conditions in society.  There are criminal classes and many thousands of people have joined them.  The level of statistics of recidivists show that jailbirds and convicts offend against society time and again.  They are not getting the message. The old adage that crime does not pay has been turned on its head.  Crime does pay and, as Deputy Briscoe stated, drug addicts can freely earn staggering sums of money per day by their nefarious acts. We as legislators, must accept that war must be waged against criminals.  Fine words will not improve the position.  The judicial system must be radically overhauled and mandatory sentences must be imposed on criminals.  Also due to the rise in the graph of murders as can be seen from the daily newspapers reports of gruesome murders, the question of the restoration of capital punishment should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important topic.  It is seldom that matters pertaining to Wexford town are brought to my attention because, for the information of those who are interested in the political geography of Wexford, I tend to get more generous support in the Enniscorthy, Gorey and New Ross areas.  However, sometimes matters get out of hand and despite the fact that there is a high profile of female and male Members and Ministers in the town there is a need for me to intervene to try to get sanity to prevail.</P>
      <P>For the past decade there has been a problem in Wexford town as six buildings have been used by various units of the tax office, officials of the Revenue Commissioners and by people working in Wexford employment exchange in Anne Street.  Successive Governments have failed to do anything other than approve in principle the provision of a building but in terms of acquiring a building, constructing a facility or giving some sign of a JCB being dusted off in Wexford town nothing has been done.  The problem is so serious that the Civil and Public Service Union has been obliged to consider forms of action to highlight this matter, which they would prefer to avoid.  First, there was a dispute in regard to no telephone representations being entertained.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that phones would be busy because of the high level of unemployment under this Government with people, such as myself, making representations in regard to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits.  While some of the staff have been extremely helpful this was the first difficulty which was experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, recently there was a half day industrial dispute involving cessation of activities.  While there has been a flurry of activity in regard to the Office of Public Works, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, there has been nobody to pull the strands together and to bring the matter to finality.  Since 22 February the Civil and Public Service Union members have begun a series of <Col N="388" /> half-day strikes.  As this problem has been ongoing since the eighties, I have no doubt that this dispute will escalate unless the Minister can give me a meaningful response.</P>
    <P>There were high hopes in Wexford now that we have a senior Minister and a junior Minister with responsibility for environmental protection, that this matter would be resolved.  I tabled a Dáil question on 10 February to ask when provision would be made for a new centralised building and to ascertain if there was any provision in the Estimates for this.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, stated that a decision has been made to provide centralised offices in Wexford town.  Discussions which are ongoing, between the Commissioners of Public Works and Wexford Corporation, on the location of these offices must be completed before a programme time-frame for building operations can be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Health is as concerned about this issue.  The staff have put up with atrocious conditions; there is nowhere to interview people in regard to private matters and, therefore, I ask the Minister to give a commitment and a time-frame in regard to the provision of this building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for taking an interest in the affairs of Wexford town.  I am aware that he has many commitments in the northern part of the constituency and it is nice to see that he is taking an interest in the southern part as well.  I want to put on record that both the Commissioners of Public Works and myself are aware of the inadequacy of the accommodation provided for the Civil Service staff in Wexford.  Apart from the shortcomings in the accommodation, staff are dispersed over a number of buildings most of which are rented on short leases and some of which are of poor quality, but all of which are unsatisfactory.  For that reason there has been a campaign for some time to bring all the staffs together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners have been making every effort to reach a permanent solution to the problem and I am pleased to <Col N="389" /> report that they recently secured sanction in principle from the Department of Finance for the provision of new centralised offices in Wexford to accommodate all local Civil Service staff, together with Revenue staff.  The Deputy may be aware that the original decision was to have decentralised offices but because of the delay I was anxious that the initial sanction would be for centralised offices so that work could begin immediately.</P>
    <P>In order to give immediate relief to the overcrowding in the accommodation occupied by staff of the Department of Social Welfare, the commissioners offered to take a short term letting of additional space.  I understand, however, that until a definitive time commitment for the provision of the new offices is given, staff involved are not prepared to accept this proposal.  I have spoken to the staff on a number of occasions and I understand their frustration.  They are happy to accept the alternative accommodation which, for the Deputy's information, is in the ACC House formerly in George's Street, but only on the commitment that a definite commencement date will be given for the new building and I have worked incessantly to ensure that.  As the Deputy rightly said, no time date has yet been given but I have spoken to all concerned, including officials in Wexford Corporation who have a responsibility to provide a site.  The Deputy may be interested to know that I have arranged a meeting tomorrow afternoon with the Wexford Town Clerk in Leinster House and with officials of the Office of Public Works to bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The commissioners' proposals in this regard are being considered by the corporation. When agreement is reached between the commissioners and the corporation, the commissioners assure me they will seek sanction from the Department of Finance to provide the offices as soon as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that I have pursued this matter with the Minister for Finance, with the Minister for Social Welfare and with the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I am determined to arrive at a speedy and acceptable conclusion which will meet the requirements <Col N="390" /> of the long suffering staff in Anne Street and I hope that a significant part of that solution will be arrived at in tomorrow's discussions.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy appraised of all developments.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of bringing the matter of the future of Irish Steel before the Dáil. I raise this matter, not to cause alarm or to spread feelings of gloom and doom further across our country, but to secure the maximum support for the Irish Steel plant, not only from the Irish Government, but also from the European Community.</P>
      <P>I make this speech at a time when the terrible news from Digital in Galway is still hanging over us.  I do not want to see another Digital type situation at Haulbowline, County Cork.</P>
      <P>There are 560 workers who earn their living at Irish Steel and they are very concerned about their jobs and about the future of the plant.  What has been described as &ldquo;crisis talks&rdquo; between EC Industry Ministers on the future of Europe's ailing steel industry are at present taking place.  We await the outcome of these talks, but it is vitally important that Irish Steel not be put at risk.</P>
      <P>In this context, I would like to welcome the recent statement of Ireland's EC Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, when he stated that the threat to jobs in Irish Steel was non-existent.  The Commissioner said that there was no question of Irish Steel closing and we must ensure that this guarantee is maintained.  I also welcome the assurances given by the Ministers of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputies O'Rourke and Brennan.</P>
      <P>However, despite this firm undertaking from Commissioner Flynn, I must confess that I am greatly concerned about the veil of secrecy surrounding the EC's plans to re-structure the European steel industry.  Unfortunately, history has all too often shown that the word, &ldquo;re-structure&rdquo;, means redundancy and unemployment for workers who find themselves trapped in these situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> I decided to raise this matter in the Dáil after reading a publication from the Commission of the European Communities. I wish to place the following brief quotation from this document on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>EC TO CUT STEEL: The European Commission said on Wednesday that Community steel producers must be prepared to accept deeper cuts in capacity in return for EC aid to re-structure the industry.  The Commission has proposed a financial package ... to alleviate the economic woes facing steel-makers.  The industry is suffering from over-capacity and increased competition from cheaper steel imports from central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposal was considered at a meeting of industry ministers last Thursday with a view to a final decision in May.</P>
    <P>The tragic Digital story must not be allowed to be repeated in Cork.  As well as the threat to the Irish Steel workers, there is also the failure of the Cork dockyard in Cobh, beside the Irish Steel plant, to create any real sustainable employment. This is not good enough, and does not measure up in any way to the promises and commitments given two years ago, when this dockyard re-opened.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this House must do all in its power to ensure the viability of Irish Steel.  The Irish Steel workers have already made great sacrifices and I do not know what more is expected of them. However, I believe it is time to end the uncertainty hanging over their jobs.  I ask the Government to guarantee these men their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mulvihill for raising this issue.  I fully understand his concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wish to confirm the Government's full and wholehearted commitment to the future of Irish Steel Limited.  Next I want to make it clear that, although there was never any pressure from the European Community <Col N="392" /> to secure the closure of the Haulbowline plant, at a meeting of Industry Ministers in Brussels last Thursday I pressed for and secured formal recognition of Ireland's special position as a country with only one small steel firm.</P>
    <P>Following that meeting I issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>At the meeting of Industry Ministers called to discuss the crisis in the European steel industry, the Minister for Commerce and Technology, Seamus Brennan, pressed for Ireland's special position as a country with a <i>single, small</i> steel plant to be recognised in the restructuring of the European steel industry.  The Minister's intervention met with a positive response from the Commission and the Member States. This will ensure that the restructuring of the steel industry in Europe, which aims to eliminate 30m tonnes, poses no threat to the 550 jobs at Haulbowline in Cork.</P>
    <P>The meeting of Industry Ministers had been called as the Deputy said to discuss plans for the rationalisation of the Community steel industry which is estimated to have overcapacity of more than 30 million tonnes of crude steel.  We considered a progress report from the EC Commission on their approach to secure the definition by the steel industry before September 1993 of a precise programme for capacity reductions over the next two years &mdash; a programme sufficient to permit a lasting reorganisation of the Community steel sector.  The essential basis of this programme which was endorsed by the Council will be the voluntary closure of mainly uneconomic plants by the industry itself.  There is no compulsion involved and there is no question of Irish Steel participating in this programme.  I am satisfied that is the case after last Thursday's meeting.  The EC Commission for its part proposes to support the industry in its restructuring efforts mainly by financial measures aimed at helping the 50,000 or so workers who will be affected.  The Commission will also propose to ensure through a balanced package of external trade measures that the restructuring in the Community is not <Col N="393" /> negatived by low priced imports from outside the Community.</P>
    <P>It was clear to me from last week's meeting that although we will not be contributing to the cutbacks in capacity it was very important for us all to show solidarity in this matter and I think a very clear signal went out from the meeting to the industry.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel, with 90 per cent of its output sold in Europe, is very much part of the Community industry.  It is not, and indeed cannot afford to be, immune to the difficulties in the Community market. It has already taken a number of measures funded from its own cash reserves in order to improve its competitiveness. A staff rationalisation programme involving 90 redundancies at a cost of £1.75 million was implemented, restrictive working practices were abolished and an £8 million capital investment programme was undertaken.  However, the continuing decline in European steel prices, which have dropped 30 per cent since 1989, has nullified efficiency gains and the company's performance has been further affected by currency losses and market difficulties from the devaluation of Sterling, the Lira and the Peseta.  After recording trading profits, before depreciation, for the three years ended 30 June 1991 totalling £16 million, Irish Steel had a trading loss of £1 million in 1991-92 and is facing a substantial trading loss for the current year.</P>
    <P>By European standards Ireland's steel production at 300,000 tonnes annually is minuscule at 0.25 per cent of total Community production.  Irish Steel has a modern efficient steel plant and under normal trading conditions has operated profitably.  Indeed, with almost 90 per cent of its output exported to Europe, it stands to gain considerably from a recovery in the market.  I have to say, however, that the companies which will emerge from the current restructuring will definitely be leaner and Irish Steel will have to fight for its share of this more competitive market.  I have said this to the company and I wish to reiterate it here that Irish Steel's future can only be safeguarded by continuing efforts on its part to maintain and increase competitiveness.  There will be no further threat from the capacity <Col N="394" /> cuts advocated by the European Community, however, that does not take the pressure off the company itself to continue to perform competitively.  The State aids code applied to the steel industry is extremely rigorous and it is simply not open to the Government to provide additional funding at will for the company.</P>
    <P>There are already some signs of a faint recovery in steel prices which if maintained might soon restore the more efficient companies to profitability.  Irish Steel is well placed to benefit from a recovery in the marketplace and I have every confidence that with the co-operation of its workforce the present crisis in the industry can be survived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me to raise this very important local issue on the Adjournment.  I am glad the Minister for Health is present as this is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>As a public representative for the north Kerry area it has recently come to my attention that the waiting list for the surgical department of Tralee General Hospital is now between 12 and 18 months long.  I believe this is the longest waiting list in the country.  It is totally unacceptable and leaves a lot to be desired.  The waiting list in Limerick Regional Hospital is between two and three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be acceptable to have an 18 month waiting list for some routine conditions but such a waiting period constitutes a danger to patients with relatively minor symptoms associated with underlying serious diseases, such as cancer.  While the two resident surgeons at the hospital, Mr. McCormack and Mr. Spillane, are extremely good about seeing patients with known serious disease, at short notice, the fact that serious disease which is less obvious can progress for up to 15 months before appropriate attention and treatment is received is totally unacceptable.  I would like to pay <Col N="395" /> personal tribute tonight to both Mr. McCormack and Mr. Spillane.  They are extremely hardworking people who get through huge volumes of work both at outpatient and inpatient levels.  The out-patient attendance and operation rates are well above the national average. Despite this, the waiting list continues to grow.  I am calling on the Minister to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to enable the Southern Health Board to appoint a third surgeon at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board decided at its meeting in December 1991 that a third surgeon, with a special interest in vascular surgery, should be appointed to Tralee General Hospital.  However, this appointment has to take its place in the queue of priorities for the hospital. Unless the appointment is placed on top of the priority list and the surgical resources and back-up staff, including anaesthetists, nurses, theatre beds and so on are made available, the waiting lists will get longer and waiting times will increase.</P>
    <P>I accept that the in-patient waiting time at Tralee General Hospital is in the region of three weeks.  A recent initiative from the Government concentrated on reducing the waiting time from the date a patient sees a consultant in an out-patient clinic to the date he is admitted to hospital.  However, the Government has not addressed the delay in getting an out-patient appointment following a referral from a general practitioner.  As the Minister knows, it may take up to 18 months, as in the case of Tralee, from the time a general practitioner writes to a consultant to the time the person gets an appointment.  In the meantime, the person could have lost contact with his or her general practitioner and a minor ailment could turn into a tumour or other such serious illness.</P>
    <P>It is time the Department of Health focused on out-patient waiting times, particularly waiting times at Tralee General Hospital.  I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal will visit the hospital shortly and no doubt they will confirm the need for a third surgeon.  In view of the facts I put before the Minister tonight <Col N="396" /> and the urgency of this case I appeal to him to give the matter serious attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising, and giving me the opportunity to respond to this matter and also for his kind comments on my appointment as Minister for Health.  I greatly appreciate it.</P>
      <P>In relation to Tralee General Hospital, there is a three to five week waiting time for patients awaiting admission to the hospital for surgery.  The waiting list of 1,100 referred by the Deputy relates to out-patient appointments and, of course, not all of these patients will require admission as in-patients to the hospital. Last year, laparoscopy equipment was purchased by the hospital from voluntary funds and its use is now established.  This equipment will enable the surgeons to carry out more procedures on a day basis and thus relieve some of the pressure on the out-patient waiting list.</P>
      <P>In May 1992, my Department issued financial clearance to the Southern Health Board to proceed with arrangements for the appointment of an ENT consultant at Tralee General Hospital. Comhairle na nOspidéal subsequently approved the post and the Southern Health Board is proceeding with arrangements to fill the post.  The filling of this post was the Southern Health Board's top priority in respect of new consultant posts at Tralee General Hospital.  I understand that interviews for this post have recently taken place.</P>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of a third general surgeon, I would like to let the House know that Comhairle na nOspidéal has established a committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the consultant manpower requirements of the Southern Health Board area.  The question of the appointment of additional surgeons will be addressed by the comhairle in its review.  It will be a matter for the Southern Health Board, in the first instance, to determine its priority requirements for additional consultants in the context of the comhairle review and the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the in-patient waiting lists generally, I wish to confirm to the House that the Government have allocated <Col N="397" /> £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times for patients awaiting certain surgical procedures. My Department will be discussing this programme with the Southern Health Board in the coming weeks and I can assure the Deputy that, in allocating these funds, I will consider the position of the Southern Health Board and indeed, Tralee General Hospital, as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two-minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Finance. I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Nealon and Deputy Deenihan. Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each of the statements will be followed immediately by a two-minute reply by the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>On previous occasions when I raised the matter of the arterial drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow rivers I did so with a certain optimism, hoping that there would be good news, that I would hear of a plan or a time for starting the work.  This time I am raising the issue in the hope of warding off what would be a disaster, a decision by the Government to totally turn down the scheme, but I fear we have reached that position.</P>
      <P>In answer to a Dáil question from me on 16 February, the Minister for Finance indicated that the vital decision would be made shortly and that &ldquo;the current position is that the prospect of devising a viable drainage scheme is not good&rdquo;. Such a statement from the Minister responsible sounds very like a softening-up process for a total rejection of the scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this is not the sad end to a fight that has gone on for 50 years, at the very time when the Owenmore and Arrow project has finally come to the top of the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the cost-benefit analysis is not favourable.  Anyone familiar with this area is at a loss to know how <Col N="398" /> that can be so, especially as the cost-benefit analysis was favourable for the Bonet-Boyle scheme.  I question whether the rule has been changed.  I am appealing to the Minister to take other factors into consideration, for instance, the effect of a rejection of the scheme on farming in a vast area of south Sligo and the effect on the population that remains there after successive waves of emigration. If we are serious about sustaining the west, the drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow rivers is the kind of work that must be done.  We must try to help the farmers there to make a half decent living.  We must seek to keep the smoke coming from the chimneys, as they might put it locally.  If the Government is serious about the west it cannot let farming die in the Owenmore-Arrow valley on foot of a very doubtful bottom line, a cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are empowered by the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to undertake arterial drainage for the purposes of preventing or substantially reducing the periodic flooding of lands, or of improving lands by drainage.  It is clear from the various provisions of the Act that it is envisaged that arterial drainage schemes would be prepared and undertaken only where their execution would result in an improvement in drainage conditions conferring benefit on the affected lands.  It is a well accepted principle that benefits cannot be considered in isolation from the cost of creating them.  The cost-benefit analysis is a recognised objective for the assessment of the benefits of any scheme in relation to their associated cost.  Arterial drainage schemes have for many years been subject to such analysis and indeed they were required by the EC Commission when the EC funds were available for arterial drainage schemes some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that in deciding whether to undertake the arterial drainage of any catchment area, including the Owenmore-Arrow area, there are other factor which have to be considered, some of which can be assessed objectively, such as, for example, environmental impact <Col N="399" /> and others such as social considerations which cannot be assessed objectively.  It is, however, an inescapable reality that the cost-benefit analysis must be a major factor in deciding whether to undertake an arterial drainage scheme, particularly at a time when all schemes are in competition for extremely limited economic resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Owenmore catchment drainage scheme, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has undertaken to meet with the four Deputies from the Sligo-Leitrim constituency to discuss the matter, as soon as the cost/benefit analysis report is finalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious siltation problem on the Cashen River between the ferry bridge and the mouth of the Cashen.  This is causing major flooding problems for the farmers who have land in the catchment area of the river right back to Croughcroneen and Ballinaghar five miles from the mouth of the Cashen.</P>
      <P>The problem was identified more than 12 years ago when the area was surveyed by the local office of the Office of Public Works. Since then dredging work has not been carried out and the problem has accelerated.  Thousands of acres of land are flooded for long periods and is rendered less productive.  Sluice gates are being blocked and many are no longer in use because they have been silted over. When the tide is out it is almost possible to wade across the river at several locations between the ferry bridge and the Cashen mouth.  If the bed of the river rises by another foot the townlands of Derryra, Derrico, Leigh and Mweevoo will almost certainly be under water for many months during the winter and at other times during heavy rainfall.  This problem demands major action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial amount of money must <Col N="400" /> be spent.  The present allocation for maintenance works on the river Feale/Cashen catchment area can only pay the wages of the staff.  Maintenance and dredging work of the order required will require a special financial allocation. I appeal to the Minister to consider the siltation of the Cashen as a priority, otherwise the river will rapidly return to the way it was before the Cashen drainage took place in 1950.  I would like the Minister to bring this problem to the attention of his leader and Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who also represents this area and who I am sure shares my concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cashen river forms the main outfall channel of the Feale river catchment area on which a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme was carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1951 and 1959, which benefited 26,500 acres of damaged land.  The Commissioners maintain the completed works of the Feale catchment drainage scheme on an annual basis from the money provided in the Vote for the Office of Public Works for arterial drainage maintenance.  A provision of £4.3 million has been made for this service for 1993.</P>
      <P>Siltation is an ongoing problem on the Cashen river and, while there is no evidence that it has deteriorated to any significant extent recently, the position is kept under continual review and maintenance is undertaken as deemed necessary. We do not have any evidence that there is urgent need for the removal of silt from the Cashen river and, accordingly, no funds have been allocated for major drainage works this year.  In view of the Deputy's comments, I have no doubt that the Tánaiste will inspect the river to ensure that the situation does not deteriorate.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3 March 1993.</P>

      <P>My Department, by which I mean the International Trade Division of the former Department of Industry and Commerce, and An Bord Tráchtála have co-operated closely for many years with the Department of Foreign Affairs and its Embassies in the task of promoting Irish exports and I am happy to say that they have always enjoyed full support from that Department.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent establishment of my Department, personnel from the Foreign Earnings Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been assigned there so that a singular, concentrated effort can be made to develop our foreign earnings potential.  This reorganisation will, under the transfer arrangements agreed with the Department of Foreign Affairs, create further opportunities for involving Embassies in <Col N="173" /> operational work initiated by my Department and connected with Irish commercial and business interests abroad.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report stated that Ireland's overseas embassies could make a stronger contribution to trade promotion and recommended that the staffing of Embassies in Ireland's overseas markets should be strengthened in order to achieve this, using personnel with professional knowledge and experience in business and trade promotion.  The Moriarity Task Force considered this recommendation and its report is being considered by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on the implementation of Culliton.</P>
    <P>In the belief that all of Ireland's overseas representative offices can make an even stronger contribution to promoting our foreign earnings potential and the attraction of foreign investment here, I am restructuring the Foreign Earnings Committee &mdash; an inter-departmental and inter-agency committee set up in 1991 to provide for the co-ordination of the overseas activities of Departments and agencies engaged in the promotion and development of Ireland's foreign earnings. At the same time I am commissioning consultants to report to the Committee on the possibility of putting enhanced and more effective representative structures in place to permit a single-minded pursuit of our interests by all parties, including the diplomatic service.</P>

      <P>The Government is preparing a National Development Plan for submission to the EC Commission in the context of the next round of EC Structural Funds.  It is my intention to have proposals for the further development of Irish tourism incorporated in this Plan.</P>
      <P>The seven sub-regional review committees at present helping to monitor expenditure from the current round of EC Structural Funds have already prepared proposals for the further development of their respective areas, including suggested tourism measures, for consideration by Government.  No decisions have yet been taken, including decisions on the manner in which future EC Structural Funds for tourism development will be disbursed.  However, in so far as the Border areas are concerned, it appears likely that there will be a further INTERREG Programme which, I hope, will include the promotion of this region for tourism purposes.</P>
      <P>The development of tourism continues to be a priority in the Programme for a Partnership Government which identifies this sector for further growth.  The tourism industry is well aware of the important role envisaged for it in the programme for Government and many interested bodies have already made their views known on future strategy.

      <P>In addition to benefits from advances made under consumer legislation in recent years, the position of the tourist will be further clarified and strengthened with implementation later this year by my colleague the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications of the EC Directive on Package Travel.  This will offer the tourist greater protection against non-performance of contract for package holidays incorporating transport, accommodation etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>One of the primary objectives of the EC funded Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993, is to provide a range of tourist amenities and products which may be enjoyed and sold throughout the year, such as facilities for conferences, cultural pursuits, angling, golf, horseriding, language learning etc.  To date over £300 million has been invested in all weather developments at some 300 locations throughout the country. Around £84 million of this investment will be by way of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Another £34 million will be spent over the programme period to enable the tourism industry to market Ireland as a holiday destination on a year round basis.</P>
      <P>In addition, Bord Fáilte will this year be spear-heading a special £2 million marketing campaign aimed at generating new business in the shoulder and off-peak periods.  The board has informed me that extensive advertising campaigns for spring weekends, city breaks etc. have already taken place in Britain and other European markets, and further initiatives are planned for autumn and the following spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am currently in the process of preparing the next national plan for <Col N="177" /> the further development of the tourism industry over the period 1994-1997, and further measures to extend the tourism season will be among the priorities in that plan.</P>

What is certain is that these foul crimes serve not only to increase human suffering but, more than any other factor, contribute to a deepening of divisions on this island.  No effort must be spared to prevent them, and to ensure those guilty of them should be brought to justice.  The perpetrators stand condemned and rejected by the vast majority of the Irish people.  Violence breeds only further violence. Nothing would be more helpful to the promotion of a lasting solution with regard to Northern Ireland than that the paramilitaries on all sides should realise the futility of their campaign of violence and immediately desist from their murderous activities.</P>

      <P>On 18 December last, Ireland and our partners in the European Community condemned Israel's decision to deport more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon.  We urged the Israeli authorities to allow the deportees to return immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, I have written to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shimon Peres, making clear my great concern about the <Col N="180" /> deportations; and I repeated my views to him at our bilateral meeting in Brussels on 1 February.  I stressed that the deportations, which took place without prior recourse to the Israeli legal system and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Resolution 799 of the Security Council, are contrary to international law and humanitarian principles.  Moreover, they have the political consequence of serving the interests of extremists who are seeking to destroy the Middle East Peace Process.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Israeli Government has decided to permit about 100 deportees to return to and reduce the deportation period for the others.  This is a step in the right direction.  But it is entirely insufficient.  We shall continue to press Israel, bilaterally and through the European Community, to comply in full with Security Council Resoluton 799.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the Irish tax treatment of an individual who comes to Ireland for employment will depend on a number of factors including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;whether the individual is resident in Ireland for tax purposes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;whether the individual is domiciled in Ireland; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the existence of a Double Taxation Agreement between Ireland and the country from which the individual has arrived.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex area and that it is difficult to provide general information which will suit all circumstances.  However, the following is the position in the case of certain categories of individuals who come to Ireland for employment:</P>
      <P>&mdash;individuals who are resident in Ireland but not domiciled here are taxable on Irish and United Kingdom income and on remittances of income arising from securities and possessions outside the State;</P>
      <P>&mdash;individuals who are non-resident in Ireland are taxable on all income arising in Ireland: income arising from securities and possessions outside the State is exempt from Irish tax; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;individuals who are resident in Ireland and are domiciled here are taxable in full on Irish and world income.  Their liability on income from an employment exercised wholly outside the <Col N="186" /> State may be reduced to the amounts remitted to Ireland.</P>
    <P>An individual who is resident in Ireland for tax purposes is entitled to full tax free allowances and reliefs.  A non-resident is normally not entitled to any personal allowances or reliefs.  However, certain individuals may be entitled to a portion of personal allowances &mdash; these include Irish citizens, certain British subjects and residents or nationals of a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement which provides for such allowances.</P>
    <P>Ireland has double taxation agreements with 22 other countries.  The provisions of a double taxation agreement will have implications for the taxation position of an individual who comes to Ireland for employment, provided the individual comes from a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  Where a double taxation agreement exists, double taxation is avoided by</P>
    <P>1.  exempting the income from tax in one of the countries; or</P>
    <P>2.  allowing a credit in one country for tax already paid on the same income in the other country.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to provide detailed information on the manner in which other EC member states tax visiting foreign executives.  This is a complex subject which involves the domestic taxation rules of each of the states and the provisions of each of the bilateral double taxation treaties signed by each of those states.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a specific query relating to the taxation of a certain individual, the Revenue Commissioners will be happy to provide whatever assistance is possible in that matter.</P>

    <P>As VAT returns are not completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular items to be identified, the VAT yield included in the net receipts figures above has been estimated.</P>
    <P>As for cross-Border price differentials, the position is that, as price controls do not operate on motor vehicles here there is no information available on which such price comparisons could be based.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, Vehicle Registration Tax replaced the border-related excise duty on motor cars on 1 January last.  The indications are that, in the majority of cases, the tax charge on new vehicles is lower under the VRT system than under the excise system thereby providing scope for dealers to reduce their prices.  I have no plans, at present, to make any changes in relation to the taxation of new cars.</P>

    <P>The general position is that deer are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  They may be hunted during the open seasons by a person who has a deer hunting licence and who has the shooting rights or the permission of the owner of the shooting rights to the lands over which hunting is to take place.  Deer can be controlled outside the open seasons <Col N="191" /> where they are causing damage to, for example, livestock, agricultural crops or woodland, but a licence under Section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, is required. Application for this licence can be made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>No order for supplies for the Army was transferred from the company named in County Dublin to a Birmingham based company.</P>
      <P>Following a tender competition, a contract for the supply of 18,000 Army badges was placed with a Birmingham firm on 5 February 1993 as their bid was the most economically advantageous having regard to price, quality and delivery.  This contract was subsequently determined void when the firm advised that they were no longer in a position to meet the terms of their bid.</P>
      <P>To meet the immediate requirements of the Army, a contract has now been placed with the Dublin company for 6,000 badges.  The balance of the requirements will be the subject of a fresh competition later.</P>

      <P>Any person who satisfies the <Col N="195" /> relevant statutory conditions is entitled to receive social welfare benefit or assistance in their own right, regardless of their sex or marital status.  However, in assessing means for social assistance schemes, including unemployment assistance, the income of a spouse is taken into account.  The same arrangements apply in this respect to men and women applicants.</P>
      <P>Receipt of a social welfare payment is not a prerequisite for entry to FÁS courses designed to prepare people for returning to work.  The information supplied by the Deputy indicates that, in the particular case brought to his attention, the person concerned who was not entitled to a social welfare payment had already completed a six-month FÁS course and wished to go on to a social employment scheme.</P>
      <P>Social employment schemes are specifically designed to help the long term unemployed to re-enter the active workforce and the rules of the scheme include a requirement that the person be in receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 12 months.  I understand that, in the light of the priority which has been given to the long term unemployed there are no plans to change the rules of eligibility for these schemes.</P>

      <P>Bartering networks in the United Kingdom are organised by groups of individuals who come together to pool their skills, services, products and facilities. Such networks operate on a co-operative basis whereby members offer their services or facilities which they have and can avail of services or facilities provided by other members of the group.  Transactions <Col N="196" /> within the scheme are non-commercial in nature and do not involve the exchange of cash.  The schemes are organised privately by the groups concerned and there is no involvement by Government agencies in their operation.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the unemployment payments schemes are as flexible as possible in helping unemployed people to improve their situation and their prospects of returning to the workforce. In this connection I have over the years introduced a large degree of flexibility into the system to enable unemployed people to engage in a range of activities, such as second-chance education, voluntary work within their communities or part-time employment, without affecting their entitlements.  I would be prepared to look at any proposals for bartering networks in this context.</P>

    <P>Comprehensive details of rates of payment are not currently available on a nationwide basis.  However, from some sampling of claims in payment at computerised offices in January of this year, it would appear that the numbers receiving less than £10 or between £10 and £20 are relatively small.  The sample suggests that of the 191,057 persons being paid unemployment assistance slightly more than one third of 1 per cent of claimants were receiving less than £10 and just over 1 per cent were being paid between £10 and £20.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free telephone rental allowance scheme is to encourage elderly or disabled persons, who are living alone and who are dependent on social welfare type payments, to have a telephone in order to be able to summon help in an emergency.  The allowance is not payable where the living alone condition is not satisfied, for example, where there is another person living in the household who is capable of seeking help in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>However, I should mention that the living alone condition continues to be satisfied if there are children under 15 years in the household or if there is someone living there who is permanently incapacitated.</P>
      <P>Some 105,000 recipients are currently getting the free telephone rental allowance; 2,751 allowances have been terminated since 1 November 1992 on the grounds that the living alone condition was no longer being satisfied.  Expenditure on the scheme will be around £18 million in 1993.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question was convicted of indecent assault and sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment.  His release date with remission was 16 January 1993.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to comment on decisions in individual cases and I do not propose to do so in this instance.  I should say, however, that when deciding on applications for temporary release regard is had to many factors including the nature of the offence, length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody and the possible risk which a release may pose to the community.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice of the Minister for Justice to comment on media statements regarding an individual's dealings with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to clarify the matter of Garda certificates of character I should point out that the Garda authorities do not provide certificates of good character (as the question states).  They do, however, on occasion, provide certificates to individuals who apply for them, which merely <Col N="213" /> state whether the applicant has or has not had convictions recorded against him.</P>
    <P>These certificates are in standard form and are, despite the limited nature of what they actually certify, entitled &ldquo;Certificates of Character&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where there are convictions recorded against the applicant these are listed on the certificate.  Since the certificates in question are requested by, and provided to, the applicants themselves, there is no question of unauthorised disclosure of criminal convictions.</P>

      <P>The operation of the roster system in the Garda Síochána is primarily a matter for Garda management.  Any proposals for change in this area would, therefore, come in the first instance from the Garda authorities who are in constant dialogue with the Garda representative bodies on all issues affecting the operation of the Force.  I am confident that all members of An Garda Síochána are anxious to achieve the best possible level of service to the public at all times.  I believe, also, that it is generally acknowledged at all levels of the Force that the traditional rosters do not provide the optimum service during exceptionally busy periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for unemployed people in Britain rests with the British authorities.  That said, the level of unemployment in Britain, which exceeded 3 million people last month, has of course, had serious implications for Irish people who make up a significant part of the British workforce. I am aware that the construction industry, which has been a traditional source of work for Irish people, appears to have been particularly badly hit by the recession.</P>
      <P>The DÍON committee, which advises me on the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain, has kept me advised of the severe effects of the economic climate in Britain on Irish people already there, many for a very long time.  For this reason, the DÍON grant for 1993 has been maintained at last year's level of £500,000, from which I will be making grants to British-based voluntary organisations assisting Irish people there.  These voluntary organisations indicate that the greatest difficulties are presented by those who have been in Britain for considerable periods; people who had apparently settled successfully and have now encountered difficulties, such as unemployment, for the first time.  I know that DÍON intends to pay particular attention to this group in its 1993 grant recommendations to me.</P>
      <P>DÍON is also generally active in representing the interests of Irish workers in Britain and in monitoring their situation.</P>
      <P>In recent years FÁS, at the request of the Government, has greatly strengthened its links with State employment services in the main destination countries of Irish people, particularly Britain.  Since 1991, the British and Irish authorities have operated, with EC support, a Transfrontier Committee (TFC) to</P>
      <P>(a) provide support for workers seeking to move between Britain and Ireland and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> (b)  minimise difficulties of entry to employment and training by arriving or returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the TFC's work in relation to Irish workers in Britain is to provide effective, targeted services through the British statutory authorities. A wide range of special interventions aimed at assisting unemployed Irish people in Britain are now in place.</P>
    <P>In general, I am satisfied that a great deal has been done by my Department and its agencies to provide services aimed at meeting the needs of the Irish community in Britain.  I shall, however, be keeping the situation under review.</P>

    <P>These grants totalled £4.182 million to Galway County Council and £5.312 million to Mayo County Council.  The programme of works to be carried out with these grants is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned and details of the extent to which the grants were assigned to the N84 between Headford and Shrule are not available in my Department.  A road improvement grant of £80,000 was also paid to Galway County Council in 1991 for the provision of hardshoulders on the N84 at Headford.</P>
    <P>The planning and development of road improvement projects on national roads is also a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant local authority.  No proposals have been submitted to my Department for the improvement of the section of roadway in question.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position shortly to determine, and to notify to local authorities, the road grant allocations for <Col N="220" /> 1993.  Pending determination of these grants, I cannot indicate the amount which will be available for specific sections of national secondary roads.</P>

      <P>The motor tax office in Tralee is adequate to serve the needs of both motorists and staff.  In the circumstances, I am not prepared to approve a second motor tax office in County Kerry.  Motorists who do not wish to visit the motor <Col N="222" /> tax office, or those living some distance from the office, have the option of renewing their motor tax through the free postal facility provided by my Department. A reminder notice is sent to each vehicle owner about two weeks in advance of the expiry of the existing tax disc.  This notice contains pre-printed details of the vehicle, including the appropriate rate of tax, and it can be used as a tax renewal form.  The form is accompanied by a post-paid envelope, addressed to the local motor tax office. I understand that about 60 per cent of motorists in County Kerry renew motor tax by post.</P>

      <P>Since 1988, road grants totalling £1.575 million have been paid to Limerick County Council for improvement works on sections of national primary route N20 from the Cork county boundary to Limerick City and further improvement proposals are being developed.</P>
      <P>An Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Limerick City to Lantern Lodge scheme has been submitted to me by Limerick County Council.  This scheme involves the construction of 10.9 kilometres of new dual carriageway and 3 kilometres of single carriageway roadway between Childers Road and Lantern Lodge, together with 3.2 kilometres of associated single carriageway spur roads. A Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of the necessary land for the scheme is being prepared by the County Council and, when this is submitted to me, a local public inquiry will be held into any objections made to me against confirmation of the Compulsory Purchase Order and into the Environmental Impact Statement.  Subject to the outcome of the statutory procedures involved, the Childers Road to Lantern Lodge scheme is scheduled for construction in the period 1994 to 1997.</P>
      <P>A By-Pass of Croom is currently at initial design stage but no proposals have been submitted by the local authority to my Department.  The section between Lantern Lodge and the proposed Croom By-Pass was upgraded in the 1970s and meets the required geometric standards.</P>

The contract for this project will be on a design-construct basis and a pre-qualification process to select the most suitable contractors, who will be invited to tender, is now underway.  It is expected that the local authority will invite tenders from a short list of contractors around the middle of this year and that the contract will be awarded towards the end of the year.  The successful tenderer will then have to complete the detailed design before construction can start.  The earliest realistic date for construction to start is mid-1994.</P>

      <P>Under Section 173 (1) (d) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, it is an offence if any person injures or disturbs any spawning bed, bank or shallow where the spawn or fry of salmon, <Col N="230" /> trout or eels may be.  The enforcement of this legislation is vested in the Central and Regional Fisheries Board under the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
      <P>While Section 327 of the 1959 Act states &ldquo;Nothing in the Act shall prejudice the right of any owner thereof to take materials from any stream&rdquo;, I am advised that the exercise of such proprietary rights is subject to compliance with Section 173.</P>
      <P>The Department is presently looking at ways of dealing with cases where gravel extraction from rivers is carried out on a commercial basis and will forward its advice to the fishery boards shortly.  I will convey that advice to the Deputy when available.</P>

      <P>I am extremely concerned with the emergence over the last year of the practice of having secret holds on fishing vessels.  In the last six months seven such cases have been detected by the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>I would advise the Deputy that on the basis of the vessels detained for this offence, no fixed trend in terms of flag or nationality has emerged, the boats concerned being a mixture of British, Spanish and British/Spanish Flagships.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Naval Service will continue to exercise the maximum vigilance in checking the capacity plans of vessels detained so as to deter those engaging in this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where vessels are discovered to have concealed hold compartments, the owners are charged with failure to carry on board an accurate capacity plan as <Col N="231" /> required under Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 1381/87 and given effect in Irish law by the Sea Fisheries (Marking and Documentation of Sea-Fishing Boats Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 253 of 1987).  The maximum penalty on conviction for this offence is £10,000 plus confiscation of catch and gear.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 131 of 16 February 1993 the total amount paid to <Col N="238" /> end January 1993 to counsel for the State and the tribunal was £2.9 million.  One of the counsel concerned referred to by the Deputy was included in these payments at a daily rate of £1,260 and an initial briefing fee of £5,600.  My Department does not have information on the fees for counsel engaged by other parties at the tribunal and the question of how these are to be met will be a matter ultimately for the Chairman.</P>
      <P>The total cost to my Department of the beef tribunal at 28 February 1993 was £5.1 million.</P>
      <P>As the work of the tribunal is on-going, I have not received an interim report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I propose to commit myself and my new Department to an extensive and dedicated programme of action designed to exploit the full potential of Irish business in foreign markets and, through international negotiation, to extend the range of these market opportunities, wherever possible.  I will look afresh at all aspects of trading and will take on board all views so that an &ldquo;enterprise culture&rdquo; will become a reality.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I will address the following points as operational priorities.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Single Market Unit</i>
      </P>
      <P>To assist Irish companies to compete in Europe, I will establish a <i>Single Market Unit</i> in my Department to ensure that the concerns of Irish business and industry are fully met and that any impediments to the smooth operation of business are eliminated.  This new Unit will:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Develop and identify</i> opportunities arising from the Single Market for Irish companies.  For example, new rules in relation to public works contracts around the community open <Col N="247" /> up a market valued at £300 billion in which Irish companies can compete.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Co-ordination</i>&mdash; the Single Market Unit will be the link between Ireland, other member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Problem Solving</i>&mdash; the Single Market Unit will deal, directly, or through other appropriate bodies with problems brought to its attention by Irish companies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Diversification into New Markets</i>
    </P>
    <P>Diversification into new products, new sectors and new markets is essential, but it must be done in a co-ordinated and focused way.  In practical terms this means a more active involvement of Irish business in the market place.  The number of &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; Irish sales people operating in the marketplace must be increased.  In response to this need, An Bord Tráchtála's EUROPLACE Scheme was launched yesterday.  The scheme plans to increase the number of full-time sales people on the ground in Continental European markets from the current 60 to 150 in three years.</P>
    <P>I have asked ABT to provide three year targets for exports by indigenous businesses by reference to different market regions worldwide.  My plan is to better monitor what is happening in foreign markets and to make better linkages as between the capacities of existing and potential Irish exporters and the opportunities and realities of each homogeneous marketplace.</P>
    <P>In 1993, ABT will, at my request, undertake the biggest promotional programme ever.  To assist Irish business to diversify its geographical spread, I will lead trade missions to Eastern Europe, the CIS, the Asia-Pacific area, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the USA.</P>
    <P>This will involve 120 major sales generating initiatives in which more than 1,300 Irish exporters will participate and which will include a strong Irish presence at leading trade fairs, trade missions, buyer trips to Ireland and programmes for first-time exporters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" />
      <i>International Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Huge untapped potential exists in the services sector.  More attention is needed to identify niche markets for high value-added activities, which are less vulnerable to cost considerations, activities such as engineering consultancy, software, aviation and management services. In order to exploit our potential in international services and build on our recent successful experiences in Central and Eastern Europe, I have asked ABT to prepare a new, focused, programme to promote international services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Earnings Committee</i>
    </P>
    <P>I intend to take a fresh look at how we can maximise our foreign earnings potential.  I want to provide the most efficient structure for marketing Ireland and its products abroad.  I am therefore commissioning consultants to carry out an independent review of existing foreign offices and of how Ireland is projected in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>GATT</i>
    </P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am responsible for negotiating Ireland's position in the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations.  I intend to take an active role in these discussions with a view to attending fully to Irish interests in future efforts to conclude the Round. I hope in the coming months to meet with and to hear at first hand the concerns and views of the key players in the Round both within and outside the Community, including the USA, France and Germany.</P>

      <P>The confidentiality of mobile telephone calls <Col N="249" /> cannot be ensured because any radio system is liable to the overhearing &mdash; deliberate or accidental &mdash; of messages passed.</P>
      <P>Section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, expressly prohibits the interception of telecommunications messages being transmitted by Telecom Éireann save in clearly specified instances.  That section also makes it an offence to disclose the existence, substance or purport of any such message which has been intercepted.</P>
      <P>Unlawful interception is an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £800, by imprisonment for up to 12 months or by both, or on conviction on indictment by a fine of up to £50,000, by imprisonment for up to five years or by both.</P>
      <P>In addition the Wireless Telegraphy Acts provide that no person shall improperly divulge the contents of radio transmissions.  The penalties for this offence are a fine of up to £1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months upon summary conviction.  Conviction on indictment carries a penalty of £20,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 165 and 166 together.  I am fully cognisant of the role Sligo Airport, and indeed all regional airports, play in the development of their local economies.  This is the main reason why the Government has invested heavily in all regional airports through Exchequer, EC and other sources of funding.  I am also aware that all regional airports in Ireland are facing major financial difficulties due to a sharp downturn in traffic.</P>
      <P>My Department recently met a high level delegation from Sligo Airport who provided a very full briefing on the difficulties facing the airport.  Their most immediate concern was the reduction in Aer Lingus services to Sligo.</P>
      <P>The company informed my Department that the reduction in their services to Sligo was one of a series of changes they were forced to make to stem the large losses being incurred by the company. Aer Lingus maintain that all their regional routes lose substantial sums of money.</P>
      <P>Due to the constraints on the public finances there are no Exchequer resources available to me to offer financial assistance to any of the regional airports.</P>
      <P>My Department has approached the EC Commission on a number of occasions with proposals for financial support and temporary operating subsidies for the regional airports.  However, the EC Commission have turned down all such requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, funds available for promotion and marketing purposes under the Operational Programme for <Col N="251" /> Tourism.  At the recent meeting with my Department, representatives of Sligo Airport were reminded of the existence of these funds and were urged to avail of them.</P>

      <P>The Director of the National Museum has calculated that 35,220 square metres of additional exhibition space would be required to enable it to put the entire collections on display.

I accept, however, that the National Museum does have accommodation problems.</P>
      <P>Satisfying the accommodation requirements of the National Museum is primarily the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  The issue of acquiring extra accommodation to ensure that the optimum proportion of the National Collections can be properly displayed &mdash; with particular reference to the Kildare Street headquarters &mdash; is being addressed as a matter of urgency by an inter-departmental committee consisting of officials of my Department, the National Museum and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the number of people under 65 years of age, suffering from serious incapacitating illnesses normally associated with older people, that many of these people are being maintained in acute hospital medical beds; his views on the fact that these patients are unable to gain admission to beds in long stay hospitals; and if he will ensure that admission to long stay beds is based on need rather than on chronological age.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the situation of persons under 65 years in acute hospital beds who would be better looked after in a long-stay nursing environment and the difficulty that such patients may experience in getting admission to long-stay hospitals.</P>
      <P>This year £4 million has been made available for the phased implementation of the Nursing Homes Act, 1990.  A sum of £.5 million has already been allocated from this amount to the Eastern Health Board to transfer patients from acute hospitals to long-stay accommodation in anticipation of the commencement of the Act later this year.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 a health board may pay a subvention to a person who requires long-stay nursing care and who cannot afford to pay for it, irrespective of age.  The subvention may be paid following an assessment of dependency and the means and circumstances of each person.  The new Act will be implemented later this year.</P>

      <P>This year, as the Deputy is aware has been designated European Year of Older People and of solidarity between Generations. <Col N="261" /> The European Community has chosen this year to honour its older citizens, to focus on the challenges and opportunities of an ageing Europe and to reinforce links between the generations.</P>
      <P>In each member state a National Co-Ordinating Committee has been established to ensure the success of the year throughout the Community.  The co-ordinating committee in this country is representative of the social partners, of voluntary bodies representing or providing services to the elderly and of the statutory bodies with responsibility for services for the elderly.</P>
      <P>As a mark of support for the objectives of the European Year, I was pleased to make £400,000 available this year to the National Co-Ordinating Committee to fund its programme of promotion and sponsorship of activities to celebrate the year.  The committee has sought proposals from organisations at national, regional and local level which plan to organise events to mark the year.</P>
      <P>Funding will be made available to these groups from the above allocation on the recommendations of the committee.  I do not support the Deputy's view that there is a lack of State support for the elderly. Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>.  In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to develop services for the elderly and their carers.  This extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine of the elderly in general hospitals, to increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists in the community and to develop services for those with dementia.</P>

    <P>The progress achieved in developing health services for the elderly will be maintained by the new Government. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government we will be developing a health service of the highest quality, so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well looked <Col N="262" /> after should they need medical care.  In accordance with our objective of improving the public health services, the Minister for Finance has provided £20 million in the budget for the reduction of hospital waiting lists.  The priority areas which are of direct benefit to the elderly are the expansion of facilities for hip replacement, cataract and by-pass surgery.  Furthermore, an additional sum of £4 million has already been provided in my Department's Estimate for this year to begin the phased implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  This £4 million will be used to subsidise the cost of nursing home care for people, mainly the elderly, who need nursing care but who cannot afford to meet the full cost themselves.</P>

No permanent consultant appointments are being made in the North Eastern Health Board region pending the outcome of the Comhairle review which is expected to be concluded later on this year.  In addition the North Eastern Health Board is carrying out an examination of all health services in their area with a view to developing a strategic plan for the future provision of services. The development of an ophthalmic service for the Board's area will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the case of Scoil Ard Mhuire there were 500 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1991.  This number warranted a staff of Principal plus 15 assistants for the 1992-93 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, and an assistant in charge of a special class.</P>
      <P>There were 454 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992, a drop of over 40 pupils compared with the preceding year.  While the staffing arrangements for the 1993/94 school year have not yet been finalised, an enrolment of 454 would warrant a staff of Principal plus 14 assistants.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining the scope for development of additional teaching resources to children with special educational needs.  The question of remedial teaching posts will form a key element in this consideration.  In this regard the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the recruitment of 500 remedial teachers by September 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department will be in touch with the school authorities regarding staffing as soon as the arrangements for 1993-94 have been finalised.</P>

      <P>In organising school transport services, Bus Éireann plan routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table, while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended time-tables often require some pupils to make an early start in the morning and to wait for some time in the evening.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement applies in this case and I am satisfied that the standard of service from the Cahermaculeek area is on a par with that available in other areas.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to authorise the provision of an additional vehicle in this case.</P>

      <P>(1)  approval was given last month to the Chairman of the Board of Management to place the contract for the agreed scheme of improvement works at the school in question.</P>
      <P>(2)  arranging the execution of the works is a matter for the school authorities in this case but my Department understands it is intended some of the work will be completed during the Easter holidays and the balance during the Summer holidays.</P>
      <P>(3)  work did not proceed on the basis of tenders received in 1991 because the associated costs were regarded as excessive. The revised schedule to be contracted for now was agreed in the meantime after negotiation between my Department and the school authorities.</P>
      <P>(4)  it is not the practice of my Department to disclose the amounts of grants sanctioned for capital works at individual schools.</P>
      <P>(5)  the refurbishment works involved include upgrading of toilets, staffroom and of windows, and resurfacing tarmacadamed areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  the significant reduction in the cost for this project relative to the original tendered cost in 1991 was achieved principally <Col N="271" /> through substituting adaptation and refurbishment of existing facilities for the provision of new facilities and through the resulting avoidance of the necessity to undertake certain site works.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was informed by my predecessor last October, Bus Éireann made free tickets available for children from Ballyogan Estate to attend Sandyford National School.  However, only six children took up the offer.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the parents have chosen to send their children to school elsewhere.  Given that there is significant unused accommodation available at Sandyford National School, it is not open to me either to provide or subsidise transport to other schools.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated that the programme for the provision of secretarial and caretaker assistance would be phased on the basis of school size.</P>
      <P>The programme commenced at the start of the 1992-93 school-year and the number of schools benefiting was determined, in first instance by the funds available in that year.</P>
      <P>Primary schools with enrolments of 500 pupils or more with no provision or having either caretaking or clerical assistance already were selected under phase one of the programme.  This arrangement is benefiting 175 schools in the current year.</P>
      <P>A total of 69 secondary schools received grants towards the provision of either secretary or caretaker assistance. These schools were selected on the basis of having had enrolments of at least 450 pupils and not being in receipt of secretarial services under a previous scheme for providing such services to schools.</P>
      <P>Partial posts for secretaries and caretakers were created in 20 vocational schools to supplement partial posts already in these schools.  Selection was on the basis of schools having enrolment of 377 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>The equivalent of 8.5 whole-time caretaker posts were created in nine Community or Comprehensive schools, which were considered to be most in need of them on the basis of the sizes of their day and night enrolments and of their premises.</P>
