      <P>There is a number of questions to be put to the House.  Is it agreed that business be interrupted at 7 p.m.?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 4A on a supplementary Order Paper be decided without debate?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 5 satisfactory? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 6 agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Yesterday the Government adopted a declaration which talked about consultation and dialogue and the need to take people's concerns into account.  Today in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, it is attempting to unilaterally change the conditions of employment of existing employees, secretaries of Members of this House, without any consultation or dialogue with those people.  It is completely unfair.  It is amazing that this should come from a Government which contains people who were formerly associated, in some way or other, with the trade union movement. <Col N="895" /> It is a breach of the most fundamental principle of good industrial relations to unilaterally change people's terms of employment without consultation.</P>

      <P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are objecting strenuously to the taking of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A brief comment at this stage is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is setting a very bad headline for the outside world by proceeding with this legislation without proper consultation and agreement. It is fair to say that the secretarial staff working for all parties and Deputies in this House do an outstanding job.  They are all extremely worried, it is Christmas time and they do not know what their future holds.  By its nature the job is temporary.  They are underpaid, they work hard and the least we should do is consult and seek agreement with them before proceeding with this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there is intense concern among the staff of Deputies.  I am sure every Deputy received a letter this morning from SIPTU pointing out its concerns in relation to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy should speak with the shop steward of his staff.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that the way to deal with this matter is to take Second Stage today and to defer Committee Stage until the new year.  In doing that we could enable a debate to take place on the Appropriations Bill which could conclude tomorrow at lunch-time and enable the debate on Northern Ireland to take place in the afternoon. We would resolve a number of problems both for the staff and for ourselves in terms of the scheduling of our business. The Taoiseach would be doing a service <Col N="896" /> to the House by changing the order today and not bringing this Bill to a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what Deputy Bell said it would appear there is <Col N="897" /> a majority in the House against taking this legislation today and I ask the Taoiseach to accept the majority wish of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to put the record straight first.  Every Member is equally concerned, in my view, about the conditions of the staff who work for them and always has been.  It is slightly hypocritical to come in here to try to present this case otherwise.</P>

      <P>I understand the Whips have had meetings with the union and the Minister for Finance on their behalf. It was well known that guarantees would be given on Second Stage or if somebody wanted to table an amendment that certain sections of the Bill would not come into force until consultations had been completed.  That is a very reasonable approach and it ensures that the welfare of the staff is fully and absolutely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I cannot understand is that the Whips have been discussing this Bill and knew about it and yet there are Deputies trying to pretend in the House this morning, from a high moralistic ground, that they knew nothing about it.  I want to put on the record that the Government is as concerned as anybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is quite prepared to meet this in any reasonable way that satisfies the House.  Does the House want to accept a guarantee from the Minister for Finance or, indeed, to let the Whips propose an amendment that can protect the interests of the staff until negotiations have been completed or does the House want the choice of not proceeding with the Bill?  The Government has been approached.  It is not fair to have people working a full year as chairmen of committees without having them looked after but, if the House does not want to proceed with that the Government will not force it on anybody.</P>

      <P>In case the House is not aware, this concerns the Appropriation Bill, 1993, which authorises the spending of approximately £9,000 million and the Government proposes that this be discussed without debate.  I believe this is a device by the Government to prevent any debate on the economic situation before we go into recess.  That is wrong and we object to the taking of this Bill without debate.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton.  I know it is the Taoiseach's desire that the party leaders should sign a motion approving the Declaration and I would be delighted to sign it.  If there is a wish to have a debate on it tomorrow, I would agree to that.  Perhaps we could compromise and devote half the day to <Col N="901" /> the discussion on Northern Ireland and half to the Appropriation Bill.  That would be a fair compromise in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Earlier I suggested that the time allotted to the Committee Stage of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, could be allocated to the Appropriation Bill and that we could debate it until lunch time tomorrow, with the debate on Northern Ireland taking place in the afternoon.  This would give the House the opportunity to confirm its support for the Declaration which the two Governments have agreed.  Will the Taoiseach agree to that proposal, in other words, that the summit statements be made after Question Time and the Appropriation Bill be taken until 7 p.m. and subsequently continued until its conclusion tomorrow at 12 noon or 1 p.m.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill is intended to facilitate the drafting of legislation and statutory instruments in the feminine gender.</P>
      <P>The Interpretation Act, 1937, defines the meaning and construction of words and expressions used in legislation. Section 11 (b) of that Act provides that, in the interpretation of legislation generally, every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it imported also the feminine gender.  The converse of this rule, however, does not apply.  In other words, &ldquo;he&rdquo; can include &ldquo;she&rdquo; but &ldquo;she&rdquo; cannot include &ldquo;he&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As a result, legislation is drafted in the masculine gender, unless it relates exclusively to women, as is the case with the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  However, legislation which affects both women and men is couched in the masculine gender even if it primarily relates to women.  This was the case with the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The predominance of the masculine gender in our legislation has been widely criticised in recent years and there have been calls from many quarters for an amendment to the 1937 Act.  The Act has been criticised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and has <Col N="906" /> been the subject of Private Members' Bills in the past.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women described the present position as sexist and one that could &ldquo;contribute to stereotyped and limiting images of the respective roles of women and men&rdquo;.  The commission recommended that the Interpretation Act be amended to enable the adoption of the feminine gender in legislative measures clearly and primarily addressed to women.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns which have been expressed about the predominance of the masculine gender in legislation.  We are all aware nowadays of the importance of terminology in shaping perceptions of particular groups.  It is no longer acceptable to use language which is sexist or which reinforces sexual stereotypes.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the present predominance of the masculine gender in our legislation is distorted and offensive to women.  It is simply not acceptable that legislation which is primarily but not exclusively directed at women should be framed in the masculine gender.  It is sexist and reinforces stereotyped views of the roles of women and men.  It is time for change.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that, in the interpretation of legislation generally, every word importing the feminine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the masculine gender.  This is, of course, the converse of the existing provision in section 11 (b) of the 1937 Act. It will mean that use of the feminine gender in Bills and statutory instruments will no longer be confined to measures directed exclusively to women. This provision will apply to Acts passed on or after the date of enactment of the present Bill and to statutory instruments made under such Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is a standard technical provision which provides for short title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that, to complement the provision of the Bill, the Government has decided that, in general, Bills <Col N="907" /> and statutory instruments should be drafted in gender-neutral language as far as possible.  In other words, legislation will be framed, as far as possible, in terms which can apply to either gender rather than in terms which are specifically masculine or feminine.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be short but it represents a significant advance in improving the status of women in this country.  It makes a fundamental change to the Interpretation Act.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which implements the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women, but it is bizarre of the Minister to claim that this Bill substantially improves the status of women in Ireland.  This is a modest measure and I am glad it is before the House, but claims that cannot be substantiated should not be made for it.</P>
      <P>The relevant issue here is not so much what is in the Bill but the language used by Government Ministers and the approach taken by Government in ensuring that stereotyped images of men and women, particularly women, are not part of the language of Government or legislation. I have no doubt that what the Minister says in his speech is well intentioned and I am not criticising him or the Bill.  However, if the Bill is to mean anything it requires changes of attitude at the highest political levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that debate on this Bill happens to coincide with sexual stereotyping in which the Taoiseach engaged in the Dáil on Thursday last when he launched an attack on the women members of the Opposition and sought to dismiss them as if they had no place in this House.  Despite the uproar his remarks created, the Taoiseach did not have the good grace to apologise either last week or this week.  If we are going to gender proof legislation and it is to mean anything, perhaps the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and his Department should in future gender proof comments by the Taoiseach.  Years ago there was a TV show called &ldquo;Jukebox <Col N="908" /> Jury&rdquo; and if a pop tune to be adjudicated upon was labelled a miss as opposed to a hit an offensive buzzer was hit and the tune was consigned to the bin.  Perhaps the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should have a buzzer beside him here so that when the Taoiseach puts his foot in his mouth, as he did last week, the buzzer can be pressed and gender proofing can immediately apply.</P>
    <P>This Bill is implementing a change which should have been made many years ago but it is legislative candy floss unless there is a change of attitude in the Government.  The Minister in his speech said in relation to legislation that in so far as possible legislation will be drafted in gender neutral language.  If this Bill means anything at all, if it is necessary to refer in legislation to people as &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo;, why is the Minister not telling us that 50 per cent of Bills published in the future will use the terminology &ldquo;she&rdquo; where it is necessary to do so and 50 per cent will use the terminology &ldquo;he&rdquo;?  Such gender proofing will have a real effect.</P>
    <P>The Government is not serious, although the Minister might be.  What the Minister is about and the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women are being blissfully ignored by every one of the Minister's colleagues from the Taoiseach down.  It is with some irony that we must look at the legislation today in the House.  The Minister tells us that the Government has made a decision &mdash; and he also told us that in the Seanad, so obviously the decision was made a couple of weeks ago &mdash; that the Government has decided that in general Bills and statutory instruments should be drafted in gender neutral language.  The Bill with which we are to deal today, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, was published yesterday.  Presumably there would be some mild exception that at the very minimum gender neutral language might have been applied.  One does not have to go much further than section 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with allowances to chairmen of Oireachtas committees. The Government is supposed to be drafting gender neutral legislation, but a Bill published yesterday refers to the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights as chairman.  It will come as some surprise to my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn, to learn she will be chairman of that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, where is the example of gender neutral drafting of legislation? Why could that legislation which was published yesterday for debate today not use the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; as the Minister stated is to be applicable in all future legislation?  If ever there was a flagrant example of a Minister stating that his colleagues should do something and then have them ignore him that is it.  Was that Bill sent to the Minister for gender proofing?  If this legislation is to be worthwhile it should state that all legislation Ministers intend publishing should first be sent to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I understand that in most cases before legislation is published Ministers to whom it is relevant have an input. Perhaps the Minister for Equality and Law Reform might tell us how this Bill which relates to chairmen of committees of this House escaped his notice.  Does he <Col N="910" /> intend to amend it so that it will contain gender neutral language?</P>
    <P>While I welcome the legislation there is another aspect to it, namely, that there is a great desire on the part of politicians from all sides of the House &mdash; I am sure I succumb to this as much as anybody else &mdash; to do what is politically correct. Occasionally, what is politically incorrect might be more beneficial, but on this issue that is not the case.  The Minister's colleague blissfully ignored what this Minister tells us is Government policy.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speak at any length on this legislation.  While I welcome it and believe this measure should have been adopted a long time ago, I do not attach the same importance to it as the Minister seems to.  A great deal of other legislation is required to improve the position of women in Ireland which will have a more immediate and direct impact on their lives than this legislation.  It is regrettable that legislation such as this has been given precedence over legislation to ensure better protection for women who are the victims of violence.  As the Minister is aware, legislation is in place that allows the courts to make barring orders in circumstances where a husband assaults his wife, but not in circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not succumb to the temptation to engage in a wide ranging debate other than to say that this legislation will not impact greatly on the lives of a large number of women in the real world.  Far more substantive legislation to implement a broad range of recommendations put forward by the Commission on the Status of Women is required.  Nevertheless, the Bill is before <Col N="911" /> us and will pass through the House today. I hope we can then move on to the agenda of other legislation which is much more important.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to leave myself open to attack by my colleagues who will speak after me by giving a male perspective on the matter, but the Minister might wish to expressly amend some of our present legislation which could have been dealt with in this legislation.  It is my understanding this Bill refers to future legislation. For example, legislation is in place which provides for the setting up of the office of Ombudsman.  I do not know if the persons appointed to that position so far have been male.</P>
      <P>In many countries throughout the world women have been appointed to that position.  That term was developed at a time when a male-orientated view of life existed and when there was an in-built presumption that a man would always be the appropriate person to be appointed to such positions.  That is wrong.  There is certain terminology in our language which we cannot change.  However, there are other issues of relevance to this matter in the context of what the Minister proposes.  This matter is really about shaping perceptions of people, groups and individuals.  That is the terminology the Minister used and it is very important we ensure people are seen to be equal regardless of gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should examine the manner in which we have approached positions in office and legislation in the past.  Perhaps the Minister might request the officials in his office to review all existing statutory legislation with a view to discovering if a more detailed Bill should be published at a future date to incorporate amendments into legislation which shows a gender bias towards men that is detrimental to the position of women, or creates a perception that for some reason women should be excluded from particular offices.  That is not stated expressly in any legislation at present but it is evident in Irish life from positions at the top of the Civil Service right down.  There is a relatively small number of women in top <Col N="912" /> positions in Government Departments. That is an important matter which should be addressed.  I hope when we reach the year 2000 at least 50 per cent of ministerial secretaries &mdash; secretaries to Ministers as opposed to typists &mdash; are women. Recently a newspaper carried a picture of the top officials in the Department of Education and, despite the large number of women involved in the teaching profession and contributing to education, it was extraordinary to note the number of males in those positions.  While women play a leading role in aspects of Irish life, when it comes to positions of seniority an ethos has developed here which excludes them from playing a part in the top roles.  That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which follows on the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women which recommended that the words &ldquo;she&rdquo;, &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; should be used in all legislation.  I take on board the Minister's statement that to complement the provisions of the legislation the Government decided that Bills and statutory instruments should be drafted in gender neutral language as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter in that there is a degree of imbalance in regard to this matter that must be corrected. When I first secured a seat in the Seanad some years ago I was amazed at the terminology endemic in legislation which was impossible to change.  When the first Bill was introduced in that Seanad in my naivety I asked if the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; could be used.  I thought I could change the terms of the Bill.  Of course, that was not possible.  Therefore, I welcome the provision being introduced today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Language is extremely important. While this is a short Bill it is also significant. Language has an impact on conditioning, as those of us who have taught young children and who are mothers and fathers are aware.  I have two young daughters.  Following a visit to the doctor recently the younger of the two had a conversation with some of her school <Col N="913" /> friends.  She later asked me: &ldquo;Mum, how come when people ask you how you got on at the doctor they always use the word `he'?&rdquo; I explained, once again, that there was a bias in society.  It is ironic that this statement was made by other girls and we are talking here about 12 year olds. That is the way they have been conditioned but this must change.  There must be a change in attitudes.  That is the reason I welcome this Bill.  It is important that we use gender neutral language in all legislation and give a lead.</P>
    <P>I always find on boards and committees that the chairperson is referred to as the chairman.  I find this offensive as it gives the lie to the fact we are living in the 20th century.  It also means that our attitudes have not changed and that we have a long way to go.  In drafting legislation the term I would like to see used is cathaoirleach as it is gender neutral and causes no offence. This would be of help to those men who cannot understand the reason women have a difficulty with the term chairman. Let us make it as easy as we can for them.  It would appear that for many men something that is relatively simple and straightforward creates a difficulty but this is due to their conditioning.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week on the steps leading to the Seanad we had a lovely ceremony when we unveiled a portrait of Countess Markievicz.  Subsequently we were treated to an interesting address on her place in Irish history.  This is relevant to the Bill because she was the first woman Minister and the first Minister for Labour.  This is not widely known about this extraordinary woman.  If one were to take a tour of the House I do not think that one would see a portrait of any other woman.  It is extraordinary that it took 75 years from the date of her election to recognise her role in society and the contribution she made on behalf of women and the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the Taoiseach's unfortunate remarks earlier this week.  What is more unfortunate is that the Taoiseach and other Members did not realise just how offensive those remarks were.  I am dissatisfied that he did not apologise to the women of the House <Col N="914" /> and, through us, to women in society. Unfortunately, this is typical of a certain generation of Irish men who are dismissive of women and their role in society.  I hope that through this legislation we will be able to change that attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women and wishes to implement them so far as possible, but I do not know if he will have the whole-hearted support of his colleagues.  In this regard he must be pro-active.  Women know that in Ireland nothing happens through osmosis; things must be made happen.  We need to remind each other constantly that equal status legislation will only be implemented when this is demanded by women.  Unfortunately, if we were to wait for our male colleagues we would be waiting a long time.</P>
    <P>While this is a short Bill it marks an advance and represents a genuine effort on the part of the Minister to change attitudes.  I do not know if it will be successful but it marks the first small but necessary step.  It would be most unfortunate if no signal was sent through the media that there was a change.  I hope in the future when I object at a meeting to the term chairman I will not be looked at as if I had two heads.  People should realise that it is reasonable for me to hold this view and it is not right that I have to be defensive.  We should be proud, active and alive to the needs of women.  It should also be realised that language can signify changes in society.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that Deputy Shatter referred to the Ombudsman.  While the word doctor seems to imply to many people that the person concerned is a male the word Ombudsman seems to suggest that only a man may apply for the position. The term originated in Norway from the word Ombud.  At the stroke of a pen the Minister could knock three letters off and send a signal in the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister should gender proof all legislation and nothing should go to print until this has been done.  All existing legislation should be proofed.  While this <Col N="915" /> may be a small step it would be welcomed by women.</P>
    <P>Much more needs to be done by the Minister for women.  We cannot elaborate on the many issues that confront us but we should send a signal that the Minister is serious.  He in turn, should convey the message to his Cabinet colleagues in particular that there is a need for gender proofing and to recognise the role of women in public life.  We know what the figures are and that at top managerial level women are still under-represented.</P>
    <P>The Minister attended a function which Deputy Shatter and I also attended to mark the end of Dublin County Council last night.  Owing to a vote in the House I was delayed and when I arrived everyone was seated.  Although many elected representatives on the council are women, when I looked around at those gathered I saw mainly grey suits.  It is remarkable that at a function where one would expect a 50 per cent representation of women there were so many men.  That can be explained by the fact that, in the main, the senior officials in Dublin County Council are men.  Up to recently I understand there were no women senior officials on the council but now a small percentage of women have such posts.</P>
    <P>I hope a study will be carried out by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights to examine the number and role of women in local authorities.  That will add to the sad statistics in regard to the involvement of women in Irish society. There was talk of a great breakthrough for women when 20 women were elected to this Dáil.  It was a breakthrough in the sense that there are more women in the Dáil now.  I would not regard the election of 20 female Deputies out of a total of 166 as a big breakthrough.  I will be happy when 84 women represent the women of Ireland and the Irish people.  That would represent a true gender balance in Parliament and would be in line with the introduction of gender proofing in our legislation.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left welcomes <Col N="916" /> the introduction of the Interpretation Bill.  It sets right a distortion that exists at present.  It took the development of the women's movement to challenge not just the substance of discrimination but also the language of discrimination and we now see another step, albeit a small one, being taken to redress the balance.  We should not underestimate the power of language to define our politics and our attitude.</P>
      <P>George Orwell made the point that, &ldquo;if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought&rdquo;.  Reflecting on how language has been used against women there is no doubt that his words are still apposite today.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill recommends that the term &ldquo;she&rdquo; can be constructed as if it also imported masculine gender.  I am somewhat concerned about that as it might be presenting the other face of the same coin.  For years women have been described as if the term &ldquo;man&rdquo; was a generic term to cover both sexes.  Now this Bill states that the feminine gender should be construed as if it also imported masculine gender.  I have no desire to find that men are being discriminated against by the use of language.  There is a danger that if this Bill is passed unamended we will use gender specific language inappropriately.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government intends to draw up legislation in language that will be gender neutral, but this is a principle that should be enshrined in law.  It is not good enough to be dependent on the goodwill and the political fortunes of the Government of the day.  At present we have a Government which is committed to dealing with inequality, but this may not always be the case.  Attitudes may change and they often take longer to change than is generally recognised.  In the future we may have a different type of Government. The Fianna Fáil Party in the previous Government was a different animal to the Fianna Fáil Party in the present Government and there is no reason to presume that a further transformation will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday's incident in the Dáil <Col N="917" /> when the Taoiseach disgraced both himself and the House is an indication that many of the changes are simply a veneer. We all know that veneers have a tendency to peel off unless they are well secured.</P>
    <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended the redrafting of the Act with a view to ending discriminatory and unnecessary gender specific language in Bills, Acts and instruments of the Oireachtas, for example, by using &ldquo;s/he&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. The commission proposes a recognition that it is not enough simply to include two sexes under one umbrella term and that the difference between the two should be expressed in our legislation and language.  That may seem a minor point but minor points are often the markers which indicate something much larger.  Language bears the same relationship to the concept of mind that legislation bears to the concept of Parliament. What we say is the concrete expression of what we think and what we put into legislation is the concrete expression of what we do in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment in line with the commission's proposal.  It is also in line with what I believe is the reality, that our society is made up of two sexes who are equal.  If we do not describe that reality in accurate terms we could end up back in the quagmire of gender specific language which distorts reality and corrupts thought.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for pursuing the matter of how language defines women. I have read many tirades from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> school of bitchery that use the term &ldquo;PC&rdquo; as the ultimate form of abuse.  Under that new tyranny one cannot seek changes without running into the danger of being treated as a humourless harridan who is caught up with notions that are both PC and <i>passé.</i> To disregard the importance of language is to disregard the way that we communicate as human beings.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came into this House last Thursday and inadvertently offended many women.  If he made such a comment about, for example, black people, Vietnamese people, Protestants or <Col N="918" /> Northern Unionists there would have been absolute uproar.  The fact that he made it against women makes it no less significant.  At the end of the day we women are governed primarily by men in this Parliament and in the courts of law. Male attitudes determine how we are governed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  However, the larger context within which it is set concerns me.  While the legislation sets out to redress the imbalance between the sexes all legislation is subject to our Constitution. Article 40 of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens shall, as human beings, be held equal before the law.  It states:</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of qualified equality and is one which has serious implications for the principle of equality.</P>
    <P>Who decides how social function affects the rights of a citizen?  Presumably judges do and we all know that judges in the main come from the middle class, middle aged male cohort in our society.  They do not bear children, they have not been at the receiving end of discrimination and they have not known what it is like to be termed a chattel or a second-class citizen.</P>
    <P>We are going to have an opportunity soon to alter the Constitution to vote on the issue of divorce.  I urge the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to also address Article 40.  The Article is important because it is open to interpretation as to what one's social function is and how it might militate against one's right to equality.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister has stated publicly that the Government will use gender neutral language in future and that is welcome.  However there is always the possibility of a reaction or a failure to live up to Government decisions.  We have seen this failure already in the less than impressive approach adopted by the Government to the 40 per cent gender balance promised for State bodies. <Col N="919" /> Nothing was done on that score until there was uproar.  I support the Bill and the sentiment behind it.  We cannot underestimate the importance of language. Last Thursday the Taoiseach made disparaging remarks about women which, if one were to take it seriously, would apply to all women &mdash; even to the President of Ireland.  Then he explained that he did not mean to cause offence and I believe that to be the case.  I do not believe he realised what he said, but that is the kernel of the problem.  Unless we are specific in how we use language offence is caused.</P>
    <P>The way to ensure this matter is dealt with is for the Government to enshrine in legislation the commitment made today by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  If this is not done, we may well end up with Bills that are a bit like the presents Santa Claus gives us in the shops, wrapped up in blue for a boy and in pink for a girl.  Bills relating to engineers, for example, may well end up framed in masculine terms while those relating to nurses may be framed in feminine terms.  Surely we have moved beyond that state in the development of equality.</P>

      <P>Since Deputy Taylor became Minister for Equality and Law Reform the subject of gender-proofing of Bills has been much debated in the House, but the debate has not been balanced.  We have gone over the top on it.  Let me explain what I mean.  Most people would agree with the idea of gender-proofing.  However, the people of Ireland are just laughing at the attempts to do so during the year.  We have what seems to be an annual debate about what to call a lady farmer when the ploughing championships take place.  Do we call her a &ldquo;farmerette&rdquo;?  Some seem to be happy with the term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; which can be male or female.  The term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; has been used and accepted for a great many years. Many ladies are happy that the term should continue to be used although the tendency of late is to use the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;<Col N="920" /> rather than &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;.  Now the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; is going out the window.  Some of the changes are necessary and will make it easier to communicate but in many cases the changes do not do that.</P>
      <P>Recently a racecourse in my own country advertised annual badges for the races with male badges offered at a certain price and female badges offered at a reduced rate.  I did not see anybody jumping up on their high horse to protest that ladies were to be allowed into the races at a reduced rate.  I would like to see a little bit of balance in the debate.  I listened to Deputy Keogh saying she longs for the day when we would have 84 ladies in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister a word that is being used, mainly in the context of education, that is, &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;.  Bullying seems to be creating many problems in schools and has received much coverage in recent months, but I have not seen anyone climb up on their high horse and say that the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; is sexist.  Can we not think of a more suitable word to use?  If one were to analyse that word it could not be seen as anything other than sexist. It just goes to show the ridiculous state we have got ourselves into.  I think we <Col N="921" /> have gone over the top on this, that we are losing the run of ourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed this morning.  I do not suggest that the Bill is the panacea to secure all the advances in the area of gender that we want to achieve. However, it is long overdue.  It is a short, simple measure and I am pleased that it has been welcomed.  It should have been brought in a long time ago, but there has always been the tendency to think that one should, perhaps, not take up the time of the Dáil on such a matter.  I imagine that was probably the response whenever it was suggested.  I took the view that it did warrant taking up the time of the Dáil.  It is one element of conditioning for change.  One cannot achieve everything one would like to achieve by legislation alone.  I agree with those Deputies who made the point that attitudinal change was a key part of the mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation also has a role; there must be a mix of the two and the Oireachtas must set down parameters.  This short Bill is the signal and is a reasonable response to the very fair criticism that has been levelled at the Interpretation Act, 1937. It complements the Government decision that henceforth legislation is to be drafted, in so far as that is possible, in gender-neutral language.  That has been conveyed to the parliamentary draftsman's office.  I think perhaps the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill may well have been in gestation before that Government decision was taken but that is no reason the legislation should not be gender-proofed on Committee Stage.  I will convey <Col N="922" /> the comments made about it by Members to ensure that it is in like manner to the gender-proofing we all did to a much greater extent on the Matrimonial Home Bill which reads all the better for having had that done.</P>
    <P>The idea of reviewing all existing legislation to gender-proof it is a nice one but it would be gargantuan task; I wish I had the resources in my Department to undertake it, but unfortunately I do not. If I were to undertake that, we would have to put aside what we would all agree should have a much higher degree of priority, the equality legislation that is in the course of preparation and which will have a major impact henceforth. However, as measures come up for amendment from time to time the question of adjusting the lack of balance from the gender-equality point of view should be progressively tackled.</P>
    <P>At least we have made a start with the combination of the Interpretation Bill and the Government decision on the drafting of future legislation and statutory instruments.  It represents a sea change.  It is high time we did it in this country.  I know it will be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of our people, both men and women.  It is a good sign for the future.  Conditioning, of course, must commence at a very early stage and that is where the education system comes into play.  It is most important that that conditioning is commenced at the earliest years of the education system.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, who has been a staunch advocate of gender equality for many years will be taking those considerations into account in ensuring that the education system makes the necessary adjustments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Even though this is a minor measure nonetheless it will have a significant impact so far as the verbiage is concerned and the signal it will send out to the public.  I would like to think in the new atmosphere which prevails in the Oireachtas in regard to the use of gender neutral terminology in legislation that incidents like the one <Col N="923" /> which occurred some time ago in the Seanad to which Deputy Keogh referred will not occur in the future.  That type of comment should be immediately accepted rather than automatically dismissed out of hand, as apparently happened on the occasion to which she referred.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;In every Act of the Oireachtas passed on or after the date of the passing of this Act and in every instrument made wholly or partly under any such Act</P>
      <P>(a)  every word importing the feminine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the masculine gender,</P>
      <P>(b)  non gender specific words or terms, including:</P>
      <P>(i)  `s/he',</P>
      <P>(ii)  `he or she',</P>
      <P>(iii)  `his or her',</P>
      <P>(iv)  `him or her',</P>
      <P>shall be construed as importing either or both genders as appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, there is a certain lack of clarity in the Bill and a danger that we could end up using gender encompassing terminology rather than gender neutral terminology.  This amendment seeks to get over that difficulty.  I do not believe that the Bill, as drafted, is specific enough in this regard.  I am also seeking in the amendment to tie down the Minister in regard to the commitment <Col N="924" /> he gave.  I appreciate that it is not possible in this debate to get an absolute commitment that all future Bills will use the s/he formula where appropriate. Obviously, this formula would be appropriate in the vast majority of cases.  The only two areas I can think of which are gender specific are those relating to maternity and birth.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger that we will end up doing to men what has been done to women for so long.  Women have always resented &mdash; it may have been hidden &mdash; the use of the word &ldquo;she&rdquo;, which is technically supposed to cover men, we will be insulting men and will not solve the imbalance which exists; rather we may end up creating a new imbalance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to support Deputy McManus' amendment and I would like the Minister to say how appropriate it is &mdash; it seems to carry through the intent to which he referred.  It is very important when debating legislation like this &mdash; I have been conditioned to some extent by Deputy Power's remarks in this regard &mdash; to make the point that we are talking about equality.  We are not talking about reversing a situation so that men are discriminated against.  That is not the point at issue.  We are talking about ensuring true equality in legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to language, we can laugh about the ridiculous elements in the debate on gender equality, for example, whether we should call a manhole cover a personhole cover etc.  We have to send out the right signal to the public about this issue.  If appropriate, I should like the Minister to include in the legislation the s/he formula proposed by Deputy McManus in her amendment.  This formula makes a specific point and should be included in the legislation if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a diversity of opinion as to the advisability of using the s/he formula.  This is not a standard pronoun and it presents difficulties in a number of respects.  There is a diversity of views as to the advisability of going <Col N="925" /> down that road.  The amendment is not necessary as the Bill, in conjunction with the Government decision that so far as possible Bills are to be drafted in gender neutral language, will cover what we want to achieve.  In any event, the thrust of the amendment would be autologous in effect.  While broadly speaking I sympathise with the thrust of the amendment which proposes that: &ldquo;...non-gender specific words or terms, including he or she, shall be construed as importing either or both genders as appropriate&rdquo; obviously one does not need to say this in a Bill: it is obvious that a non-gender specific word imports both genders.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment is not necessary as the Bill covers the situation that legislation which primarily refers to women will be drafted in the feminine gender and all legislation will be drafted on a gender neutral basis in accordance with the Government decision.  For those reasons the amendment would not be appropriate and I regret I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out the precise difficulty about which I am concerned when he said that Bills that deal primarily with women will be drafted in the feminine gender.  That is not the point I am making.  I do not think Deputy Power should accept this position.  I am surprised he is being so mute on this issue.  Why should men, even if they are the tiny minority affected by a Bill, not have the right to be described as men?  I accept that I may be overstating the case in my amendment but I certainly did not want to let the opportunity pass without stating it.  It is better to be specific, which is what we are all about, rather than vague.  I regret that the Minister is not accepting my amendment if for no other reason than I would have been intrigued to see the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht's correct Irish translation of the term &ldquo;s/he&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the payment of allowances to chairpersons of certain Oireachtas committees and to the Leader of the House in the Seanad.  It also provides for the removal of the statutory <Col N="927" /> provision &mdash; applicable only to Members of the Oireachtas who reside within ten miles of Leinster House &mdash; which restricts the payment of travelling allowances to such Members to days on which they attend sittings of the relevant House, or meetings of House committees.  In addition, provision is made for the making of payments to non-office holding Deputies and Senators for secretarial assistance as well as for the payment to parties and parliamentary groups of an allowance to enable them to engage staff who work for the parties or groups collectively.</P>
    <P>In relation to chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, this Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector.  This review body recommended payments for chairmen of Oireachtas committees because the workload of the chairperson significantly exceeded what would be regarded as the fully extended range of responsibilities and workload of an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Member of the Oireachtas.  The review body recommended that it would be appropriate to recommend an allowance of £6,000 per annum for the chairman of each committee, with the exception of the Joint Services Committee which was recommended at £3,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 2 of the Bill provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of an annual allowance to every non office-holding Member of the Oireachtas who is the holder of the position of chairperson of designated Oireachtas committees. It also provides that the Government may determine the amount of the allowance and that different amounts may be specified in respect of different committees. It is intended that, in line with the review body recommendations, an allowance of £6,000 per annum, updated to £6,500 by reference to pay increases in the meantime will be paid to non-office holding chairpersons of the following committees: the Committee of Public Accounts; the Joint Committee on <Col N="928" /> the Irish Language; the Joint Committee on Women's Rights; the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and to the chairman of the British Irish Parliamentary Body and that an allowance of £3,000 a year, updated to £3,250 will be paid in the case of the chairperson of the Joint Services Committee.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the section of the Programme for a Partnership Government, &ldquo;Broadening Our Democracy&rdquo;, outlined a range of measures, including a framework for a committee system which the Government believes will develop the role of the Oireachtas. The new committee system, which did not exist at the time of the review body examination, is the most fundamental change in the way the House has conducted its business since the foundation of the State.  The success or failure of these committees will largely depend on the effectiveness of the chairpersons as they will play a key role in ensuring the success of the new system.  The task will be a difficult and time-consuming one. For that reason, it is felt that the chairpersons of these committees should be paid allowances at a somewhat higher rate than those recommended by the review body for the chairpersons of the committees which were in existence at the time of the review.  It is, therefore, intended to pay an allowance at the rate of £9,000 a year to the chairpersons of the following committees: the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs; the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy; the Select Committee on Legislation and Security; the Select Committee on Social Affairs; the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the payment of an allowance to the Leader of the House in the Seanad.  It is envisaged that an allowance of £6,500 per annum would be paid.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the payment of these allowances by way of addition to salary to those Members who qualify for them.  This section also provides that the allowances will not be payable in respect of any period before 12 January 1993, the date on which the <Col N="929" /> present Government was formed.  The intention is that the allowance will be payable from whatever date, after that date, a particular chairperson or Leader of the House was elected to the relevant position.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the rates of the allowances may be increased administratively in line with general pay movements in the Civil Service.  This is a common provision.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that contributions in respect of superannuation entitlements, under the Houses of the Oireachtas Members pensions scheme may be deducted from the allowances.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a regularisation of the manner in which secretarial assistance to non-office holding Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann is organised.</P>
    <P>A non-statutory scheme for the provision of secretarial assistance to non-office holding Deputies and Senators has been in operation for a number of years. Under this scheme, a secretarial assistant is provided for each non office holding Deputy and for each three Senators.  The cost of these secretarial assistants is met from moneys under the Oireachtas Vote. Additionally, a number of posts are provided to each party and to the Technical Group to carry out certain tasks associated with the operation of the parliamentary group, for example, to act as leader's secretary, to assist Whips or the press office or to carry out research work.</P>
    <P>Most staff engaged under the scheme are graded at secretarial assistant level, but a small number, including several who are assigned to individual Deputies, are in the promotional grade of administrative assistant, while each party has at least one staff member at administrator level.  Members of the scheme are covered by a non contributory pension scheme which is similar to that which applies to unestablished civil servants.</P>
    <P>Staff belonging to the scheme, although paid directly from the Oireachtas Vote, are recruited either by Members or by the parties.  Under the scheme as currently operated, staff are normally employed under contract for <Col N="930" /> the life of the Dáil and a few weeks thereafter.  The difficulty is that the existing arrangements are largely <i>ad hoc</i> in nature and a number of anomalies and general difficulties have arisen.</P>
    <P>In addition, a potentially more significant problem relates to the compatibility of the scheme with the Constitution.  Legal opinion suggests that the scheme, because it is not provided for in law, could be in conflict with Article 15.15 of the Constitution.  There is also a possible constitutional problem in providing secretarial assistance to outgoing Deputies following the dissolution of the Dáil.  I consider it most important that any doubts on this score should be resolved without further delay.</P>
    <P>The High Court recently considered the question of the status of the members of the scheme.  This arose from proceedings brought by a secretarial assistant who has become redundant following the defeat in the 1992 general election of the Deputy who had been her employer. Mr. Justice Keane decided that she, and other members of the scheme, were employees of the political parties or of individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the existing scheme is so flawed as to require replacement. This can, I believe, be best effected by giving statutory force to the judgment of Mr. Justice Keane and by making payments to Deputies which enable them to employ secretaries directly.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 7 of the Bill under consideration today proposes that an annual payment, of an amount to be determined by order of the Minister for Finance, be made to each non-office holding Deputy to enable him or her to employ a secretarial assistant and to pay related employers costs.  It is intended that the amount in question will incorporate a sum to cover up to six hours overtime per sitting week and also incorporate a pension element and a contribution towards other employment charges, such as costs arising on termination of employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill deliberately takes the Minister for Finance out of the picture so far as specifying pay or conditions of employment <Col N="931" /> are concerned.  There are two reasons for this.  First, experience has shown that such ministerial involvement in our existing industrial relations system means that consideration of particular options has to be weighted against potential repercussions throughout the public service.  Second, it would simply have the effect of re-establishing existing arrangements which have proved to be unsatisfactory to Members, to the secretarial assistants and to parties generally. Accordingly, the legislation does not confer on the Minister for Finance any function in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that staff will be engaged under a contract of service or contract for services with the Member of Dáil Éireann and such contract shall specify that no liabilities arising out of such contract shall attach to the State, to any Minister of the Government or to the chairman of Dáil Éireann.  It would, therefore, be a matter for each Deputy to decide whether he or she should employ a secretarial assistant or obtain secretarial services from more than one source.</P>
    <P>Currently, secretarial assistants are members of a non-contributory pension scheme which entitles them to a lump sum and pension at the age of 65.  It is the intention to protect the superannuation benefits already earned by secretarial assistants either by preserving benefits which would become payable at retirement age or by paying its transfer value into any pension scheme which they might subsequently join.</P>
    <P>In view of the possible constitutional impropriety of providing secretarial facilities to outgoing Deputies following the dissolution of the Dáil, section 7 makes provision for this allowance to be treated in the same manner as Deputies' pay &mdash; that is a sum equivalent to one-eighteenth of the new allowance to become payable on a dissolution.</P>
    <P>As we all know, substantial changes in the composition of both Houses of the Oireachtas take place with each general election.  To cover the effects of such changes on secretarial staff, it is intended that provision will be made in the annual <Col N="932" /> payment for an element to cover the cost of statutory redundancy and sums in lieu of minimum notice.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill, provides, in relation to Senators, for similar allowance arrangements, but with an allowance of only one-half of the sum applying to Deputies.  This will, effectively, improve the ratio of Senators to secretarial assistants from 1:3 to 1:2.  This change reflects the Government's consciousness that Senators as part-time politicians are facing an ever-increasing workload which involves more extensive research, including analysis of numerous reports, than heretofore.  Senators have expressed concern about the difficulties which they face in this regard on a number of occasions and the Government considers this to be an ideal opportunity to redress these problems.  It will be open to Senators to combine to employ a secretary or alternatively to obtain secretarial services on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The staff shall be engaged under a contract of service or contract for services with the Member or Members of Seanad Éireann and such contract shall specify that no liabilities arising from such contract shall attach to the State, any Minister of the Government or the chairman of Dáil or Seanad Éireann.  Since Senators, unlike Deputies, remain in office pending the election of the new Seanad, the payment of one-eighteenth of the annual allowance, which is provided for in the case of Deputies, will not apply to them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes provision for those other staff who provide services to each party collectively rather than to individual Deputies.  In this context, special provision is being made for parliamentary groups comprising not less than seven non-office &mdash; holding Members of Dáil Éireann, such as the Technical Group, so that they too may engage staff to provide support services to the group as a whole.  This section includes an enabling provision which would allow the Minister for Finance to make an annual grant to parties and groups to cater for the payment of such staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> Section 10 provides that allowances payable under sections 7, 8 or 9 shall be exempt from income tax in the hands of any Member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes provision for the laying of orders under this Bill before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made to comply with the necessity of bringing the arrangements into line with the requirements of the Constitution and of efficient administrative practice.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 12 enable the Minister for Finance to amend the existing regulations governing Oireachtas travel allowances to enable Deputies or Senators residing within ten miles of Leinster House to claim daily travel payments for attendance on &ldquo;non-sitting&rdquo; days.  This will bring them into line in this respect with other Members.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 13 provides for a short title, collective citation and commencement.</P>
    <P>What I want to emphasise about these provisions in relation to secretarial assistance is that they comprise, primarily, a framework designed to ensure that they put the provision of a service, which it is fair to say is much appreciated by Members and on which we all acknowledge our dependence, beyond the reach of legal challenge based on non-compliance with Article 15.15 of the Constitution. For the first time, we are putting secretarial assistance firmly on a legislative base.  Far from giving existing staff cause for alarm, these provisions ensure that the employment of this group, the unsung champions of the workings of our democracy, is assured so that their position cannot be suddenly jeopardised as a by-product of malicious or imprudent litigation.  It is intended also to underline the reality of the employer/employee relationship and remove any ambiguity which gave rise to confusion and difficulty, and it has to be said that confusion and difficulty have arisen, even in the case at the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I want to stress also the framework nature of the provisions of this Bill <Col N="934" /> because, as with the formal but non-statutory scheme we operated in the past, it leaves scope for initiatives to be taken by members of the parties to meet the concerns of existing staff.  Some such concerns have been clearly and cogently expressed to me and to other Whips and, through us, to the Minister for Finance. They have also been brought formally to the attention of officials of the Department of Finance.  I and my fellow Whips have placed on record our anxiety to allay these fears and to utilise such scope as is provided by the minimally prescriptive sections 7 to 10 of the Bill once the fundamental requirements of the Constitution have been met.  We have said time and time again &mdash; and I reiterate it for the record &mdash; that we have agreed to explore with them and their representatives possible solutions to their difficulties and perceived difficulties.</P>
    <P>There have been fears expressed outside this Chamber that the enactment of this Bill would be followed by sudden and dramatic action affecting the existing corps of secretarial staff.  This Bill, like others, specifies that its provisions will come into effect on days and dates determined by ministerial order.  There is no question of any such order being rushed through the House to give instant effect to these provisions.  That is further underlined by the fact that we decided, following discussion on the Order of Business this morning, that we would take Second Stage only today.  It was never intended that the Bill would be pushed through the House and the orders signed.  A categoric assurance to that effect was given by me and the Minister for Finance and, I thought, accepted by the Whips.  I reiterate that the provisions of these sections of the Bill will not come into effect until negotiations have taken place.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear to my fellow Whips, and it has been explained directly to representatives of the staff concerned, that the interval between the enactment of this Bill and the making of any orders provides an opportunity for all of us to get together to find a satisfactory and acceptable solution to any problems perceived. <Col N="935" /> In effect we can do that in the interval between Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>When it became obvious that this Bill was coming before the House, the Whips discussed it among themselves.  We agreed that we would collectively go to the Minister for Finance and meet the unions.  We met the unions, heard their views and conveyed those to the Minister for Finance.  I conveyed back to the unions the position of the Minister for Finance on this matter.  I am concerned that a number of statements were made that there had been no negotiations or consultations.  I underline the fact that there were such consultations and thank the other Whips for their assistance in this matter.  I assure all secretaries, particularly those of my own party, that full consultations will take place.  I am sure I speak for the other Whips and they will do the same on behalf of their secretaries.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by emphasising that these changes do not threaten anybody. The current arrangements are ambiguous, unwieldy and, quite possibly, unconstitutional. Anybody who was a Whip after a general election will know what I am talking about.  Legislative change is essential.  It is my belief that the provisions of this Bill represent a fair and reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the need to cater for the interests of existing secretarial assistants and, on the other, the necessity of bringing the arrangements into line with the requirements of the Constitution and of efficient administrative practice.</P>
    <P>Some people alleged that we are trying to sneak this Bill through.  Before the provisions of this Bill will be implemented each one of the Whips will have to consult widely with the members of their own parties.  It will be absolutely necessary to do so since its provisions affect not only our secretarial assistants but every Member of the House.  There is no way that such a Bill could be passed without consultation.  I must re-emphasise that fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> I commend the Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The right decision was taken in the House this morning on the Order of Business to agree to deal only with Second Stage of this Bill today.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important one in its own right, dealing with the rights of Members of the House, with the facilities available to them and to committees of the House and with the rights of secretarial assistants.</P>
      <P>It is important that one should express the thanks of all Members, past and present, for the very valuable work carried out by secretarial assistants in Leinster House over the years.  Having entered this House for the first time in 1975, I know from experience that the Fine Gael Party then had three secretarial assistants to deal with all the queries and responsibilities of its members.  In those days the technology available was very antiquated and conditions extremely poor but people did the best they could to serve democracy to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>It is important that our thanks be recorded to the staff, secretarial assistants past and present.  The right thing has been done in that rushed legislation always leads to mistrust and confusion. The intervening period between the conclusion of Second Stage and the taking of Committee and Remaining Stages will allow for discussion, debate, negotiation and clarification between the Whips, parties, Deputies and secretarial assistants about what is contained in the Bill.  An endless list of queries has to be answered and dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Government Whip is genuine in his attempts to improve facilities both for Members of the House and in respect of facilities for committees, parties and secretarial assistants.  I hope his words come true so that when this Bill is enacted there will be absolute clarity concerning the continuous employment aspect and the protection of seniority gained over the years in respect of the sections dealing with secretarial assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 deals with claims and payments <Col N="937" /> made to the chairmen and members of the various committees.  I note there are different rates for different committees.  The committee system set up this year gives priority to the legislative committees of the Dáil.  I would have thought the Committee of Public Accounts, one of the longest established committees of Dáil Éireann, would rate on equal priority with any legislative committee because it has a fundamentally important role to carry out.  I can understand the difference between some of the committees.  The Fine Gael Party supports the committee system and the granting of the best level of facilities and resources to the committees that can be made available.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with an allowance in respect of the Leader of the House in Seanad Éireann.  I would have thought it would be appropriate to make an allowance to the Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad as that person must be here on all occasions.  Provision should be made in section 3 or in another section, for the Leas-Chathaoirleach, an office holder, whose position is not reflected either by way of allowance or privilege. For example, when the Office of Leas-Chathaoirleach in the Seanad was set up in 1938 the allowance was £750 as opposed to £1,000 for the Cathaoirleach. In 1993 the rate is £7,000 for the Leas-Chathaoirleach and £14,000 for the Chathaoirleach.  There are other differences in respect of the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach which are not reflected in the Bill which perhaps could be included in the relevant section.</P>
    <P>This Bill has a distinct bearing on the nature and work of political representatives of all parties in the House. If the effect of the Bill is to transfer responsibility as an employer from the party to the Deputy, that is a fundamental change in the way politics will work from a representational and a party point of view.  The general position at election time is that the Fine Gael Party would require its secretarial staff to work in headquarters on an irregular basis. This means that secretaries employed directly by Deputies might not feel <Col N="938" /> required to do such work, when the collective advantage of cases being made for facilities from a party point of view would be lost.  In our case if one were to have 45 individual employers as against a corporate employer, comprised of 45, obviously that would detract from the strength of the case one could make to the Government of the day in respect of facilities.</P>
    <P>We employ an additional secretary in the Whip's office to deal with non-constituency work, a secretary in the press office, a supplementary secretary to the parliamentary party who is based in the Dáil, a supplementary secretary based in the Seanad, three extra staff in the Leader's office &mdash; two dealing with constituency work and one dealing with all other work &mdash; a printer and an administrator.</P>
    <P>Some 46 Fine Gael staff are based in Leinster House and 15 secretaries are based in constituencies.  There are different criteria in respect of employment between the constituency secretaries and those employed in the Dáil.  Of the 46 staff employed by Fine Gael eight are paid at administrative assistant grade&mdash; that is executive officer level &mdash; five of whom are supervisors, and three at the administrative grade of higher executive officer and the remaining staff are on the secretarial assistants grade.  The administrative assistants, who are supervisors, have extra duties imposed on them of checking the day-to-day attendance of their secretarial assistants, keeping records of annual leave, sick leave, time-keeping and so on.  All these duties are onerous and time-consuming.  The administrator is appointed to deal with time-keeping, sick leave, annual leave, maternity allowances and so on.</P>
    <P>A contractual agreement in the House is signed by all secretaries.  The terms of that contract mean they have signed away their working rights.  Those contracts stipulate that they are employed only on an interim basis until legislation is put on a statutory basis.  This gives rise to fear, mistrust and confusion in the minds of a great number of secretaries concerning their future, their positions and their continuation <Col N="939" /> in employment.  For that reason the timescale between the completion of Second Stage and taking of Committee and remaining Stages is of importance.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if the committee system is to work it must have resources.  I support the payment of an allowance to the chairmen. In the next Dáil session I hope the committee system and the committee week will operate as intended and that the committees will continue with their work, in terms of their legislative duties, until progress is made with whatever legislation is being dealt with.  It is important that it should not be disrupted as has happened previously.  It was not my understanding that committees would be forced to meet while the Dáil was in plenary session.  This is not my understanding of what committee week was primarily designed for.  I hope it will work more efficiently and that the chairmen, whenever they get the allowance, will be enabled to have further resources, more time and commitment for dealing with their legislative responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In respect of staff being put on individual contracts for particular Deputies, questions must be asked about what happens to previous contracts.  What happens to seniority and pension rights gained by secretarial assistants down the years?  There is confusion on these issues and coming up to Christmas this is a cause of great anxiety for many secretarial assistants.  We must ask what will happen in the event of the retirement or death of a sitting Deputy?  Will a secretarial assistant automatically lose her job?  Can this be dealt with in legislation?  In existing legislation is there built-in protection for persons in this category?  What is the relationship between these events and unfair dismissal?  Will the redundancy Acts apply and will redundancy payments be made?</P>
    <P>After the last election a number of secretarial assistants were offered a very generous redundancy package and some took it and left.  There are different interpretations of why people availed of the package, some wanted to leave but other very good secretaries had to leave.  It is <Col N="940" /> important that some provision to deal with similar events should be built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is to be the employer who determines the rate of pay and conditions of employment of the secretarial assistant, it is imperative that some form of common contract with minimum conditions be drawn up.  Otherwise, it is obvious that there could be great disparities in the pay and conditions of secretarial assistants.  If a secretarial allowance is to be paid to the Deputies there must be a guarantee that secretarial assistants will be paid their entitlements in full.  I am sure the Minister is aware that very few Deputies want to take on the paper work involved in employing somebody.  I employ one person on a weekly basis and the amount of formfilling for the Revenue Commissioners is incredible.  Deputies have more than enough to do in their work than to be involved in this.  Obviously, the parties will have to employ somebody to deal with the payroll.</P>
    <P>I understand also that there will be a rebalancing of secretarial services to Senators.  There is one secretarial assistant for every three Senators but under the terms of the Bill there will be one secretarial assistant for every two Senators and this will be of advantage to the Fine Gael Party.  A number of Senators contend that the allowance should be paid to them so that they could hire either part-time secretarial assistants in the constituency or make other arrangements.  Senators have vocational obligations in their constituency in the country.</P>
    <P>The parties employ other staff such as printers and administrative staff in the Whips office, and extra staff when required.  What will happen to such staff? If there is to be change is this to come about through the process of natural wastage or new contracts of employment once the legislation is enacted &mdash; in other words will the existing contracts that staff have entered into be dismissed in terms of length of service and seniority and the protection afforded to persons in continuous employment?  It is proposed in <Col N="941" /> the Bill that the Deputy will not be responsible for paying the salary of a person on maternity leave.  At present, a person on maternity leave receives her full salary and returns the maternity allowance to the Department.  Under the terms of the Bill the Deputy, as the employer, will not be bound to pay full salary to staff on maternity leave and the secretary will be at the loss of 30 per cent of her salary when in receipt of the maternity allowance.  That amounts to punishment for availing of maternity leave.  The payment of salary while on maternity leave should be safeguarded so that nobody will be worse off when the legislation is implemented.  We should consider paying secretaries weekly instead of monthly as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Over the years people acquired rights due to their continuity of service and it would be worthwhile considering a deal, similar to the Talbot deal of the early eighties where manual workers and secretarial staff &mdash; in our case it would be only secretarial staff &mdash; were subsumed into the public service at a level commensurate with their experience by Order on the direction of the then Taoiseach if they failed to find a job six months after the closure of that firm.</P>
    <P>Every secretarial assistant will be subject to this legislation because all present Deputies will not be here in 20 years time, some will retire, some will be defeated and some will pass away.  Secretarial assistants in their twenties and thirties will be subject to this Bill.  Protection, subject to certain conditions, such as was given to the Talbot workers should be built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements are open to abuse.  For instance, a Deputy could decide that this Dáil term was to be his or her last, dispense with the secretary and employ a person on a much lower salary in the constituency and keep the remainder of the allowance.  I would not like to see that happening.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that this was not an attempt to abolish the rights of secretarial assistants who have served this House well.  We need to give <Col N="942" /> proof of that commitment in the Bill. A proper redundancy scheme may be agreed in the negotiations.  Will Deputies who employ secretarial assistants at executive officer or higher executive officer level be paid a higher allowance to reflect this?</P>
    <P>The Bill deals also with the payment of moneys to parliamentary groups.  I agree with these provisions as they are fundamental to the way we do our business.  I have had limited opportunities to observe the facilities available to parliamentarians in other jurisdictions and from what I have seen the facilities and services available to assist Deputies in their role as legislators leave a great deal to be desired.  I know the Chief Whip has plans to introduce some improvements in this regard.  It is important that a party like ours, with 45 Deputies, the main Opposition party, should have adequate research and secretarial assistance.  It is unfair that an elected representative does not have the back-up facilities to effectively compete with the resources available to the Government.  That is very important and I hope that the parliamentary parties involved will use the money wisely.  I am pleased that the Bill proposes to make moneys available towards the provision of facilities for smaller groups.  The sum proposed is obviously not enough.  It is a matter for negotiation and the Minister for Finance might accede to our proposals.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 12 which repeals the restriction on Dublin Deputies living inside of a ten mile radius of Leinster House.  This has been a bone of contention with Dublin Deputies for a number of years.  They are entitled to the minimum day allowance.</P>
    <P>The right decision has been taken to put off the Committee and remaining Stages of this Bill until the confusion has been dispelled and the mistrust and lack of understanding has been cleared up in relation to the protection of the rights of secretarial assistants.  Nobody should be under any illusions that this is not an attempt by the Government to unilaterally change the conditions of employment of those working in the <Col N="943" /> Houses of the Oireachtas.  Upon further discussion within the groups and by the Deputies further questions will have to be answered with regard to moneys paid to parliamentary groups, the kind of research that might be available to them. the uses to which it can be put and so on.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the allowances for the Leader of the Seanad, the Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad should be borne in mind.  I refer particularly to the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad who is not accorded the level of privilege commensurate with his office.</P>
    <P>I tried to get a copy of the judgment of Mr. Justice Keane in the case referred to by the Minister but it is not available yet.  We would be interested to see how unconstitutional or illegal is the present system.  Those employed in private business, subject to the climate of the day, can find themselves without jobs or prospects upon the closure of a plant.  At least in the Houses of the Oireachtas the Legislature now has the opportunity to make this provision entirely legal and to see to it that the group working for Deputies and Senators in the House is happy and contented, in the knowledge that their conditions of employment are as good as we can make them.  In return that will ensure that there is a genuine commitment to carrying out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations will be made on Committee Stage on foot of the discussions that are taking place.  I hope that when the Bill is passed the rights of secretarial assistants will be protected and will be seen to be protected.  We can then get on with dealing with the enormous problems that confront our country.</P>

      <P>This Bill was published yesterday and until the Opposition voiced objections this morning on the Order of Business it was proposed that it would pass all Stages today.  Even in the case of minor legislation such haste in passing all Stages should be a cause for parliamentary concern.  The main thrust of this Bill, apart from giving allowances <Col N="944" /> to the chairmen of committees, is to establish a scheme which fundamentally alters the status and terms and conditions of employment of Dáil secretaries.  It might have been more appropriate to have a Dáil secretaries Bill and the allowances to Members dealt with separately. It is a discourtesy to Dáil secretaries to include them as part of a package to do with the allowances to Members.</P>
      <P>I note that the chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights will get a salary.  It might have been appropriate for that committee to consider the proposed scheme.  Has the Minister for Equality and Law Reform had an opportunity to look at this legislation which has equality implications, because sections 7 and 8 are women's issues as only one man is employed as a secretary in the House?</P>
      <P>The Bill is presented in the context of a need to regularise the position since the Ann Halliday case and that is not disputed but it should not have been introduced hastily.  I know there have been negotiations with the union and that we have had two or three Whips meetings discussing various aspects of it, but the Bill was only published yesterday.  It is enabling legislation which does not set down the terms or what the new scheme will mean for our secretaries.  It is discourteous to the women working in this House for Deputies and Senators, whatever about the cosiness of the Whips meetings and the robust way in which the Minister for Finance is approaching this issue.  Perhaps the Minister has had long experience in dealing with this matter which has given rise to problems over the years.  I am new to the problem and come with a fresh approach.  This is an opportunity to review how we pay Dáil secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme proposes to incorporate the present pay scales and to take the Minister for Finance out of the picture. We can cut the link between the Dáil secretaries and the Minister for Finance but it is unfair to cast the Dáil secretaries into a type of limbo where nothing is positively agreed.  That is what we are concerned about this morning.  Some of <Col N="945" /> the worries are minor such as concern about the VHI group scheme, seniority, or if a Deputy will not stand again or does not have a hope of being re-elected.</P>
    <P>What future is there for that Dáil secretary and what motivation will she be able to put into her work? How can she plan for her future?  Many of our Dáil secretaries are young women, some are middle aged and all have different responsibilities, but they are badly paid. The pay scale for secretaries starts at £146 a week gross to a top level of £312 gross. That means there are women working in this House earning £128 per week after tax.  Those are 19 and 20 year old women, skilled Dáil secretaries carrying out work which is executive in nature and putting up with Deputies at their worst.  Their pay scales need to be examined.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights commissioned hundreds of reports about women at work, women in the Civil Service, women in the public service and so on.  Any graph of women in the public service or the Civil Service will be pear shaped, with women in the bottom grades.</P>
    <P>I had a gender audit carried out in Dublin Corporation, the results of which showed there were only nine women in the top five grades.  The main bunching of ghettoisation of women was in the lower two grades.  The clerical administrative grades of Dublin Corporation comprise 63 per cent women as opposed to only nine women in the top five grades. That type of immobility of women in the workforce is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am not saying Dáil Deputies do not rate their secretaries properly, but this legislation presents an opportunity for us to examine those grades and their conditions. We do not have any child care facilities in this House.  Apart from the requirements of Dáil Deputies in that regard, our secretaries do not have any child care facilities or support services. An effort was made recently to set up a crèche in the Dáil, but there was a reluctance to change.  Statements were made about there not being a spare inch in this House that could be made into a <Col N="946" /> crèche.  The suggestion had to be diluted to a family room, whatever that means, and it is not being given priority.</P>
    <P>This legislation provides us with an opportunity to address many issues. Sections 7 and 8 are the principal items of contention in the legislation.  Section 2 provides for the payment of allowances to chairmen of Oireachtas committees and that is appropriate.  The Minister stated the Dáil committees have provided a fundamental change in the way the House has conducted its business since the foundation of the State.  The reform has been worthwhile because the committee system appears to be working well and the chairmen should be paid.</P>
    <P>I pointed out already to the Minister of State the difficulties faced by small parties in ensuring we have members present at all committees.  As our party has only ten members it is difficult to attend committees at all times and without research facilities it is difficult to participate fully in Committee Stage debates.  Every member of my party is a spokesperson on some matter and some of us hold two portfolios.  I am not looking for sympathy, just fair play.  Ministers have programme managers, advisers and the officials of their Departments to assist them.  There is an imbalance in terms of resources and Opposition spokespersons are pitched against well resourced Ministers in the manner of David and Goliath. It is difficult to study legislation and prepare amendments for Committee Stage when we do not have the resources to do so.  That puts a great deal of strain on members of Opposition parties.  If the system is to work well, there must be a balance in the capacity of both sides to be adversarial and consider legislation properly.</P>
    <P>Dáil Deputies are reluctant to become employers and that is reflected throughout the entire country.  That is why there are 300,000 people out of work.  At present, employing a person is similar to getting married.  There are many long term implications associated with being an employer and much tedium associated with employing even one person.  I employ a full-time childcare worker and <Col N="947" /> I was amazed at the amount of tedium involved in employing that person.  It is understandable, therefore, that Deputies shirk away from yet another onerous responsibility.  Under the new scheme each party should have a payroll clerk or some such person to deal with the onerous responsibilities associated with personnel matters and payroll.  Prior to agreeing this scheme a draft standard form of contract should be negotiated, and all secretaries should be happy with it.  Vagueness creates fear and distrust, which would have been fuelled by a limbo status if the Bill had passed all Stages before Christmas.  Secretaries would have gone home for Christmas with legitimate fears about their future employment conditions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the level of distrust which has developed through the years between secretaries and the Department of Finance.  Secretaries do not trust the Minister of State in what he says.  That is regrettable.  If he said that no staff member will fare worse following the establishment of the scheme and that we are going in batting for our Dáil secretaries, I would believe him.  However, the distrust which has developed over the years is an indictment of the manner in which our Dáil secretaries have been treated in the past.  I have been a Member of the Dáil for only a short time, but I am aware of that distrust.  The secretaries believe they are being sold a pup.  It is regrettable that staff relations have evolved to the state where a requirement to introduce a new scheme should result in such a level of concern and distrust, and I believe militant distrust on behalf of the union.</P>
    <P>I understand the union will resist change and want to protect the <i>status quo.</i> Any change involves risk, but what about those women who are not members of a union?  They have not been contacted by the union and do not know what the scheme will involve for them.  They do not know if they will continue to be paid on a weekly basis.  Because our Dáil secretaries are low paid workers, I am ashamed to say, they must be paid <Col N="948" /> weekly.  They have immediate outgoings and could not manage if they were paid monthly.  Those issues should be addressed under this legislation which presents us with an opportunity to put in place a realistic and sympathetic scheme which will respect the girls who work with us.</P>
    <P>Those secretaries are concerned also about their pension entitlements and service accumulation and do not know if those entitlements will be protected. That is promised but there is nothing stitched into the legislation in that regard. I do not blame them for being concerned. If I were in their position I would want to know my future status.  I would not be happy to go home for Christmas not knowing the type of contract that would be presented to me when I returned. Those women will definitely lose out on their maternity entitlements in that they will receive only 70 per cent of their previous year's income in allowance.  That is a definite encroachment on their previous benefits which must be sorted out.</P>
    <P>The Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, which is major legislation, was debated here with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  That legislation deals with gender proofing in the drafting of legislation which is important, but this is a much more important equality issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with tongue in cheek I said that.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform should have dealt with this issue today instead of dealing with the Interpretation Bill.  As I said, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights should also consider this scheme.  This is an in house matter which relates to the issue of equality and instead of preaching to industry and agencies on the need to take positive action to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workforce we should get it right.  We are blithely passing legislation under which, <i>inter alia</i>, the terms of employment and contracts of our secretaries will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> This Bill has an attitude problem.  The fact that the contracts of Dáil secretaries are being linked with the allowances payable to Members indicates that a bad attitude is adopted when it comes to the question of how we should deal with our staff.  This issue should be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>Our Dáil secretaries, like Dáil Deputies have no security.  At the end of four years, depending on the electorate, I might be back in my kitchen.  However, my Dáil secretary may be even more concerned than me about that possibility; because, like all Dáil secretaries, she has responsibilities.  Many of them are lone parents and may not have another source of income.</P>
    <P>Dáil secretaries have accepted that, no more than Deputies, they cannot expect security of tenure but they should be compensated for this in their salary.  They do not have any of the perks, privileges or power which Deputies have.  There is a need to review the salary scales and compensate them for the risk that they take &mdash; that in four years' time they may not have a job if a Deputy loses his or her seat.  These issues have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It can be stressful working for Front Bench members of the Opposition or a Whip.  Those Dáil secretaries work very hard even though they are on low pay.  I would like to see a change in this regard. I would be willing to take part in negotiations with the Department of Finance to improve the salary scales.</P>
    <P>If a Deputy is very busy in the House the secretary can be the major link with constituents.  In this regard they deal with queries and make representations to Ministers.  While they do all the running they get none of the credit.  Indeed, secretaries can contribute to the success or failure of a Deputy at an election.  We owe them a lot and in agreeing to take only Second Stage today we are doing them the courtesy of allowing them time to enter into negotiations during the recess and into the New Year.  If the Minister for Finance is to cut the cord it will be necessary to make and agree to formal arrangements.</P>
    <P>In his response the Minister of State <Col N="950" /> might indicate the up-to date position in the negotiations with the union.  I hope we will not have an industrial dispute. There are dangers in pushing Bills through just before Christmas.  I do not know if anyone remembers the legislation dealing with the rod licence but it was rushed through in Christmas week. That was a bad omen.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to take only Second Stage of this Bill today to give the people directly affected an opportunity to examine the detail of what the Minister of State has said today.  The secretaries employed by the House will not examine in detail the contributions made by the Opposition Whips, rather they will seize the contribution made by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State may think that some of the information that he communicated today has been relayed accurately to the women affected but this has not happened.  I accept what he has said about the discussions that have taken place during the past few weeks with the <Col N="951" /> Whips, that a meeting was arranged with the trade union concerned and, subsequently, with the Minister for Finance. The Government Whip relayed to the Minister the outcome of that meeting with the trade union.  All this did happen. It is not accurate to say that there have been no consultations, but it is accurate to say that adequate consultations have not taken place.  Let me explain the reason I say this.</P>
    <P>On two occasions in the House the Taoiseach mentioned that there was agreement between the Whips.  This was unhelpful.  I am delighted, like every other Member, with the apparent success of the Taoiseach yesterday and I sincerely hope that it evokes the response it deserves, but in coming into the House to say that there was agreement between the Whips he was doing us an injustice and threatening to fracture the good working relationship that exists between the Whips.  We did not see the Bill until yesterday.  All of us have been concerned and nervous about the implications of what was proposed, which arose, admittedly, from a court action.  It was clear at all stages that it was the people directly affected who would condition the response of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The leader of my party, Deputy De Rossa, raised this issue each day this week.  Every time the Government Whip presents the Opposition Whips with complex and extensive legislation and it is deemed when we leave the room that we have agreed to take a particular measure when that was not the intention, it underlines the relationship which has been developed.  The Government Whip has been extraordinarily successful in seducing the Opposition Whips to go along with measures which, if we were faced by a less&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Engaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;amicable, less engaging Government Whip, might not be the case.  When I was a trade union official I disliked the nice guy personnel managers because one could not do business <Col N="952" /> with them as well as one could with the other kind.  This Government Whip fits into the nice guy category and therefore makes the job of the Opposition Whips more difficult.  However, I do not think advantage should be taken of us in the manner that was suggested this morning.</P>
      <P>Let us come to the serious business of this Bill.  I have had representations from the grade affected from all of the parties in the House with, I think, the exception of my colleagues in the Labour Party.  I have been approached on a confidential basis by secretaries from Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and my own party and I have listed on one page, in a manner that would recommend itself to the Taoiseach, questions that they have put to me.  The Minister may well say that they have answered them, that they have answered some of them or that we know the answer to them.  I may well know the answers to some of them. The important point is that the secretaries do not know the answers.</P>
      <P>Perception and communication are very important in industrial relations.  We have left ourselves open to the charge of being seen to publish, two to three days before the Christmas recess, and put through the House in 24 hours, all Stages of a Bill which alters fundamentally the system that has obtained up to now.  It may not be a very good system, but it is the one that has obtained since Deputies were first allocated secretarial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose a measure that fundamentally alters that system and we allow for minimum consultation.  We are asking them to go forward on the word of the Whips or, most important, on the word of the Government Whip, which is the only word that matters at the end of the day.  I do not question the assurance given in the House by the Government Whip.  However, it is not very important what I do.  There are many women, especially women, out there who have given long, good and valued service to this institution and to individual Deputies here who do question it and are fearful about what it means, and that it is not enshrined in the Bill.  What is the value <Col N="953" /> of the word of a Government Whip who might pass on &mdash; I think it is very unlikely in the case of this Government Whip&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>He could become a chairman and as a result of the Bill, it would be a not unmeritorious profession to pursue.  The secretaries accept that as a result of the court challenge the system must change.  If one accepts the peculiar and unique nature of the job of a Member of this House, it may very well be that a contract system is the best arrangement; but, like every other contract, it depends on the terms of the contract.</P>
      <P>I understand the secretaries are objecting to a contract system and that the fundamental principle of the Minister and the Minister for Finance is that it is not feasible or practicable for us to confer on the secretaries of Members of this House rights superior to those enjoyed by Members of the House themselves.  In other words, we, unfortunately, do not have permanency of employment.  A large number of Deputies do lose their seats in this House at every general election.  That is a certainty that will continue and, in terms of democracy, I presume it is desirable that it should continue.  If we accept that it is not practicable to confer superior rights on secretaries, we must devise an imaginative system that is consistent with the law in so far as it has now been defined.  I thank the Labour Party for their co-operation. I think that between us we can combine with the other Opposition parties to ensure that we get a good system out of this for the women who work for the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny referred to Justice Keane's judgment.  Like him, I would like to see the precise judgment, which I have not yet seen.  What I am saying about the change in the system being inevitable is conditional on that. However, I think it is accepted that a change is inevitable, that a contract system is probably the best and that it depends on the terms of the contract.</P>
      <P>Here is the check-list of questions that I scribbled as a result of talking to the secretaries: will there be continuity of employment, or will staff be regarded as having left the Oireachtas on one day and started for a TD or a party the next day? This is important in regard to protective legislation, the Unfair Dismissals Act, etc.  Will a secretary be entitled to retain her job, subject to the satisfactory carrying out of her functions, for as long as the TD holds a seat, or will the term of employment be only for the lifetime of the Dáil?  In other words, will a secretary have to re-apply for the job after each election, assuming her Deputy is successful? This, again, is important in terms of the protective legislation.</P>
      <P>Will there be a common contract for all staff with a common set of conditions, or will TDs' parties be able to set different conditions for different staff?  Will the same holiday conditions, hours, sick pay apply as at present?  Will staff who currently work in Leinster House be able to be compelled to work in constituency offices?  Will staff automatically receive any public sector pay increase or will these have to be negotiated individually? Will TDs be obliged to pay over to the secretary the full allowance to them for this purpose?  Will secretaries' pension entitlements be preserved?  Will they be paid overtime?  Will there be a limit to paid overtime?  Will there be a limit to the hours staff can be asked to work overtime?  Who will decide if overtime should be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What replacement provision will there be for staff who are on sick leave either on a short term or a long term basis? Can staff be transferred from one TD to another without their consent?  Will there <Col N="955" /> be any possibility of promotion to a higher grade after a period of service?  If a staff member has a complaint about a TD &mdash; unreasonable treatment, sexual or other harassment &mdash; whom should that be addressed to?  If there is a dispute whom will the union negotiate with &mdash; the individual TD or the party Whip? What about their VHI entitlements?  Can a secretary be sacked on a whim?  This latter point is probably the source of much of the reaction we have seen in the last two or three days.  There is a belief on the part of some secretaries that they can indeed and may very well be sacked on a whim.</P>
    <P>I absolutely concur with what has been said in the debate already that in the main we get exceptional service from the women &mdash; and they are predominantly or exclusively women &mdash; who service the Members of this House.  It is a skilled job nowadays.  They must be able to operate the latest technology and be quasi social workers as well as being personal assistants to Deputies.  They must have a knowledge of social welfare legislation, all of the things that many of our secretaries know better than we do and can perform more efficiently than we can.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say that the 166 secretaries working for the Members of this House are all in that category and I do not want to be dragged into that argument, but in my experience, generally speaking, the secretaries perform above and beyond the call of duty.  There is no doubt about that.  Secretaries employed in other places in which I worked would not put up with a great deal of what those secretaries are expected to put up with.  Their jobs are insecure and not permanent and involve a high level of stress from time to time. The fact that they may be dismissed at a whim is part of what is behind the reaction we have seen in recent days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to his hope that there would be no abuse of the system.  I have not had an opportunity to consider the detail of the legislation in that regard.  Will it be permissible for different TDs to apply whatever new <Col N="956" /> system is implemented differently throughout the House?  Will I be able to sack my secretary and employ two &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; temporaries to replace her, one in my constituency and one here to retain my privileges?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  Will that be acceptable?  The implications of the new system have not been properly conveyed to the secretaries.  Under the new system some secretaries may fare better.  Would it be possible for a Deputy, who may be so disposed as to pocket money, not to pass on additional money to his secretary? A common contract needs to be agreed between the Whips and applied across the House to cover this area otherwise the new system will further fuel the discontent.</P>
      <P>There is a different category of staff who have served in this House for a long time and who, despite their status or lack of it, they have come to believe that because they have been here for so long they are permanent in the psychological sense of that word.  They are concerned as to where they stand, what minimal conditions they have chalked up and how those conditions can be preserved.</P>
      <P>A fundamental point relating to the conditions enjoyed by women who work as secretaries here has been referred to. The union has not managed to get its act together on behalf of the secretaries.  I am also a member of the union that represents those secretaries.  Union representation here on a broad basis is a fairly recent phenomenon.  It is not acceptable that women, who are expected to perform a multidisciplinary role for Deputies, are subject to the level of pay scales to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, which range from £146 per week to a maximum of £312 per week. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to draw comparisons between that salary scale and other sections of the Bill.  I accept that chairpersons of committees ought to be paid. I will speak in regard to the quantum of that salary scale on Committee Stage.  We <Col N="957" /> are laying ourselves open to the perception that we manage to provide a stipend for chairmen of committees that exceeds the salary paid to many women secretaries here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>For a full week's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As their entire week's pay.  That is not fair or reasonable or proper.  We must get together to ensure that the union is facilitated in introducing some appropriate remuneration for those secretaries.  It is not acceptable that the take home pay of many of those secretaries who have families may be £130 per week.  Regardless of whether they have families that figure represents an inadequate level of pay.  Those secretaries' pay scale is at the heart of the distrust referred to.</P>
      <P>I do not decry the fact that this Government and its immediate predecessor has improved the conditions of Members of this House and our ability to do our jobs.  The secretaries are familiar with this position.  There has been no commensurate improvement in their positions. I accept the argument that in a modern democracy the requirements of being a parliamentarian are difficult and complex and if we are to perform our jobs adequately we need a back-up service which the Government has moved to put in place.  The women secretaries should not be allowed to become the forgotten support system that allows the system to function reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny and the Minister referred to the provision under section 9 to provide some element of back-up service for the committee system.  Specific reference has been made to the fact that my party and the Technical Group will benefit from that provision.  I appreciate that will be the case but it represents only a modest step forward. Deputy O'Donnell referred to the difficulties under which the Opposition tried to compete with the panoply of the Civil Service back-up, the employment of outside persons as programme managers and that we must compete with that back-up service with meagre resources and that <Col N="958" /> small parties are disadvantaged in this regard.  My party does not receive a Leader's allowance because of an anachronistic Standing Order that sets the size of a parliamentary group at seven Deputies.  We get no back-up.  It is proposed that a payment will be made available to my party that in total will be less than the allowance for the chairman of one of the committees.  Deputy Kenny indicated that payment may be open to negotiation.  With due rspect to Deputy Kenny, if the Government Whip were to indicate that such renegotiation is proposed that would carry more weight with me.  We are determined to work the committee system in this House, including the reforms introduced by the Minister. How can we employ any type of worthwhile back-up for the processing of legislation on the basis of the very modest stipend that is being rumoured under this section?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this position.  That stipend is not feasible or practical.  The Executive administers this House.  The Government makes the decision.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, has beaten his chest with some justification about the reforms he introduced and which had been long sought by the Leader of Deputy Kenny's party and others in this House.  I do not see how it can be expected in this David and Goliath struggle to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, that we can make a contribution if there is no regard for the rights of independent Deputies or small parties.</P>
    <P>The position changes.  In the previous Parliament the Progressive Democrats had six Deputies and the party to which I belong had seven Deputies and managed to qualify as a parliamentary group. In this Parliament the position is reversed, the Progressive Democrats qualify as a parliamentary group but our party do not.  The Green Party is represented in this Parliament and it was represented in the previous Parliament. It brings a unique and different dimension to Irish politics and it has made an impact on all parties in this House, <Col N="959" /> although they may not wish to publicly admit it, in terms of policies on the environment and so on.  If the new system is to work that is an area that must be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Government as to whether it favours a rewards system.  We do not have a system of peerages as exists in the House of Commons.  If we wish to elevate a number of worthy Deputies who cannot become Ministers &mdash; there are only 30 posts available &mdash; as a reward for their diligence in making the committee system work I have no objection, but there ought to be some system of proportion and some acknowledgement of the rights of the Opposition in the matter.  I am sure the Minister will say that we must have regard to proportionality and to the democratic system, and I accept that, but there must be a floor in this regard.  For a rumoured £10,000 one would not employ a person who would make a significant input. There ought to be strings attached in that it ought to be necessary to prove that the group or party concerned has employed a person for the purpose intended in the legislation, to provide back up to the committees.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage anybody calling a vote at the conclusion of Second Stage. The welter of information contained in the Minister's speech and the comments of the Opposition, in so far as they are considered to be of any value, will no doubt be closely examined by the union and by the Members affected.  Their fears should be assuaged in terms of, for example, the check list I read out.  The information given by the Minister this morning will be very useful to the union in helping it to form a view on these matters, provided they accept that the system must change.</P>
    <P>The question of maternity leave has been raised.  As all the people involved are women and since it is women who have babies it is reasonable to expect that the issue of maternity leave will arise.  I would like the Minister to respond to the question as to whether we, as Whips, can agree a common contract.  I accept that <Col N="960" /> there is a need for flexibility in this area but there ought to be some common system. I hope we can resolve this matter so that we are in a position to enact legislation that will improve the conditions of these women rather than disimprove them.</P>

      <P>In spite of all his constituency work, Deputy Rabbitte has lost none of his skills as an advocate and I hope the Minister will respond to his measured contribution.  The 12 questions posed by him were very much to the point and very apposite.</P>
      <P>If the present arrangements for the employment of TDs' secretaries are unconstitutional, I would like to hear why they are so and what flaws exist in the system.  The Labour Party wants fair play for TDs' secretaries.  We should not rush this legislation; there should be careful consultation and consideration of the matter.  The legislation has provoked anxiety among TDs' secretaries who believe there is an element of privatisation involved.  We should learn from the way other countries deal with this matter and examine their system of employment of secretaries to Members of parliament.  We would benefit from so doing in that we would get a wider picture of what is involved.  Recently I studied some of the working arrangements in the House of Commons.  I am no authority on this matter but I learned that there is a pool of secretaries available to Members of Parliament there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had an office in the centre of Limerick city since I was elected to the <Col N="961" /> Dáil in 1981.  As it is next door to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, 200 yards from the local employment exchange and 50 yards from the headquarters of the Mid-Western Health Board, a constant stream of people come to see me six days a week.  My secretary would need the skills of Kissinger, the patience of Job and the stamina of a plough horse to deal with all the work involved.</P>
    <P>The relationship between a secretary and a TD is unique.  There must be team work and people must get on well together.  The secretary must be versatile, be able to interpret the mood and mind of the TD and to constantly meet deadlines. Politicians, by their nature, are very often vain, impatient and concerned with their profile and image.  They are not the easiest people in the world to work with.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, both the TD and secretary are vulnerable as very often 25 per cent of the TDs are not re-elected. These circumstances do not obtain in any other job.  Essentially we depend on the electorate for our survival.</P>
    <P>We must carefully consider this legislation. Both Deputy Bell and I have a trade union background and we are not going to turn our backs on our secretaries as that would be foreign to what we believe in.  Our party was founded by the two greatest trade unionists, James Connolly and James Larkin.  In their own way these people were feminists and believed in women's rights, as we do.  All parties in the House should play their part in improving this legislation.  More time is needed for consideration not only of Second Stage but other Stages also. Let us use this opportunity to improve the legislation along the lines suggested. It is essential that we have good legislation governing the entire working relationship between TDs and their secretaries. We must practice what we preach and promote good industrial relations not only outside the House but also inside it and in our constituency offices.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that my speech has been rather garbled and truncated.  I will now make way for my colleague, Deputy <Col N="962" /> Bell, who is also greatly concerned about this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill which for the first time has afforded us a real opportunity to correct a number of injustices that have existed for many years in relation to the employment of staff, particularly secretarial staff.</P>
      <P>I was chairman of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party when we lost seats in one general election and I saw the turmoil this caused for the secretarial staff.  The Labour Party had to resolve these problems as no procedures were laid down in regard to the employment of secretarial staff.  These men and women who, as far as I could see had no conditions of employment, were like nomads.  Each parliamentary party had loose guidelines on the employment of secretarial staff. As a result, these staff seemed to struggle from one problem to another, and the problems changed after each general election.  Similar problems arose in regard to the secretarial staff employed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when those parties lost seats in general elections and there was a surplus of staff.</P>
      <P>When I read the Bill yesterday I immediately encountered problems with section 7 and the consequential sections. With respect, I suggest to the Minister that he should allow sufficient time for the union to consult with the staff and negotiate with the relevant Department. The Minister needs to spell out the people with whom the unions should negotiate.  Who are the employers? There is no definition of who is responsible for the employment of secretarial and other staff for this House.  Our secretaries should be as much a part of the staff of this House as any other section and should be treated in the same way, which they are not at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who are not re-elected to this House can fall back on their professions. Most Members of this House have a profession, business or farm they can fall back on.  However, the only avenue open to these secretarial staff when they lose their jobs is to go on the dole, if an <Col N="963" /> arrangement cannot be made within the party for which they work to re-employ them in one way or another.</P>
    <P>If we accept the concept of a contract we will effectively be privatising the employment of our staff.  Section 7 (3) (b) will exonerate the State from its responsibilities, under any heading, for the employment of these women and men.  What about the staff working in constituency offices in Drogheda, Dundalk, Kerry or Tipperary?  As we only received a copy of the Bill yesterday we have not had an opportunity to consult these staff, some of whom may be union members and others who may not.  The unions certainly did not have an opportunity to talk to their members about the proposals in the Bill &mdash; my secretary certainly knew nothing about them.  As it was late when I got home last night I did not have an opportunity to tell her about the provisions in the Bill dealing with her employment, future employment, pension rights and other rights.</P>
    <P>Apart from section 7, and its consequential sections, I have no problem with the other provisions.  I suggest to the Minister in the strongest possible terms that he delete section 7 and its consequential sections until such time as a proper agreement can be worked out on behalf of all the staff and back-up staff working for the various parties.  Once an agreement is reached the Minister could bring forward a separate Bill which would regularise the position in regard to the employment of secretarial staff.  We have had enough ministerial orders.  In January of last year several ministerial orders were introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare and the then Minister for Finance which had a major impact on a very large section of the community.  We did not have an opportunity to debate or challenge those orders in the House as the Dáil was not session.  I had to get copies of those orders from the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Even if I or any of my colleagues are not Members of this House in years to come, our secretaries will still require employment.  There is no provision in <Col N="964" /> the Bill dealing with unfair dismissals, redundancy, pensions &mdash; there is a provision to allow for the transfer of their existing arrangements to other employment &mdash; holiday entitlements, holiday pay entitlement, minimum notice payments if they lose their employment or we lose our seats, maternity leave or sick pay.  The Minister may say that all these matters can be dealt with by way of regulation. However, the issues with which regulations will deal should be reflected in the Bill, particularly in section 7.  I ask the Minister to delete section 7 and include a properly negotiated agreement for the staff in a separate Bill.  The conditions of employment of our secretaries should not be dealt with in a Bill which deals with the chairmen of Oireachtas committees and allowances to Members living outside and inside Dublin.  These matters are of no relevance to secretarial staff who want to know their conditions of employment and to be assured that their employment will be protected by the Oireachtas and all parties.</P>
    <P>I know that that is the aim of every Deputy.  That is why I took great exception this morning to Deputy Bruton's remarks in which he sought to imply that members of the Labour Party were going to support a Bill containing provisions which were totally opposite to everything they ever believed in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <P>I do not agree with the manner in which the Bill was introduced and the influence of the Department of Finance, which is trying to shed all responsibility for these secretarial staff who work so hard not alone for Deputies but on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the conditions of employment and payment of the secretarial staff should be transferred to the Houses of the Oireachtas and dealt <Col N="965" /> with in the same way as issues relating to other members of the staff of the Oireachtas are dealt with.  Money for the payment of their salaries and pensions should be provided for in the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas and should be controlled and administered by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  This would give them some recourse, for example, they would be able to bring their cases to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and have the support of the Deputies for whom they work. I am glad we are only taking Second Stage of the Bill today as this will give the Minister time to reflect on the points raised.  A separate agreement dealing with the conditions of employment of our secretaries and the other backup staff should be negotiated with the unions. Indeed, we should not agree to take Committee Stage until such time as this suggestion is agreed by the Whips from all parties.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  While not downgrading the role of the secretaries, having listened to the debate the general impression one would get about the Members of this House out of the mouths of Members is that there is a shower of chancers knocking around who will exploit their secretaries and other employees, will not pay them and will not abide by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the contributions from Deputies were well measured, it struck me that they might be interpreted in the wrong way.  As all of us in this House know, certain sections of the media are constantly waiting for an opportunity to paint us as bad boys and girls who are only out for ourselves, and they would have got a certain <Col N="966" /> amount of ammunition from what some Members have said here today.  I realise that was not their intention, but the thought struck me as I listened to the various contributions.</P>
    <P>I will attempt to deal with most of the queries raised by Deputies; and I thank Deputy Rabbitte, in particular, for the 12 questions he put forward.  I will try to deal with them here, or by way of written reply if I am unable to deal with all of them.  This Bill is simply an enabling Bill; it will allow us to put the secretarial scheme into a legal framework.  Following that, all Deputies are well aware that we must sit down and negotiate. Whatever about the Department of Finance or the Houses of the Oireachtas, all of the Whips are in agreement that there should be no lessening of the conditions and terms of employment of our current secretarial staff.  That is a fair summary of our position; and we, as a group of Whips, indicated to the unions and the Minister for Finance that we would be fighting that case on behalf of the secretaries with the Department of Finance.  My attitude has not changed in that regard, although, having heard some of the comments that have been made in the past week, I could be excused for changing my attitude.  However, my attitude has not changed.  My fundamental position is that we do not make the conditions of employment of our current secretaries any less than they are at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell referred to writing the terms of a contract into a Bill and he and a number of other Deputies made various suggestions that they would like to see in a contract.  If we include such measures in the Bill, if the secretaries want a change, or if a change in the Bill is required between the parties or individual Deputies, it would require coming <Col N="967" /> into this House each time to amend it in order to change a term of contract.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That clearly would not be feasible.  We must establish the framework, make our agreements and have them binding on both sides.  That is my approach and I believe it is a practical one rather than attempting to have all these terms written into a Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with a number of the points made by Deputy Kenny.  He is correct when he says that this is a fundamental change in the relationship that existed heretofore, because nobody knew what that relationship was.  It was not clear whether the secretaries were working for the Department of Finance, the parties, the individual Deputy or the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That must be clearly defined in the Bill and it is being defined as a relationship between the Deputy and the secretary.  Deputy Kenny referred to practices that have developed within the parties &mdash; for example, secretaries being required to go to the Fine Gael headquarters during an election campaign.  He stated that was a long established practice and that it might change if one had 45 different employers.  It may or may not change, depending on the commitment of the individual secretaries; and in my experience most of them, regardless of their particular party, are committed to that party and will carry out work over and above the call of duty.  Therefore, that relationship and the &ldquo;extra curricular&rdquo; activities that they might engage in at election times and on other occasions need not necessarily change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, along with other Members, referred to the section in the Bill which deals with making payments to some parties or to groups.  This refers specifically to administrative arrangements that might be necessary after negotiations with the unions and when agreement is reached with the parties as to how they will operate the new system. Deputies do not want to be employers, and Deputy Kenny referred to this also. <Col N="968" /> Therefore, there may be a need for the parties to take on the administration of a scheme and that is provided for in the Bill.  It is separate to the issue that the Deputy referred to in relation to the committees and the necessary backup.  This provision is to administer the scheme in whatever way it is drawn up.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat again, all issues regarding unfair dismissals, minimum terms of notice, holiday pay etc., regardless of whether the employer is the Deputy or the party, will have to be fully met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to be met by the employer, whether that is the Deputy or the party.  I certainly have no difficulty saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to do that.  I came into this House to serve my constituents, not to become an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have taken Deputy Bell up wrong.  I understood the point he was making on behalf of the secretaries was that they would have to have the same legislative protection as every other worker and I am saying that they will have that.  That is subject to agreement, but those laws will apply and that is why there is a provision in the Bill for parties to be given some administrative assistance and backup to ensure that these measures are implemented. The secretaries need have no fear in that regard.  The parties will have to fight their own battles with regard to how the obligations that will be placed on the party or the individual Deputy are met and shared by that party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to other matters that were raised &mdash; and Deputies will appreciate I am taking them in the order that they were raised, rather than dealing with them in general &mdash; I wish to refer to maternity allowance.  At the moment, as I understand it, secretaries continue to be paid when they are on maternity leave and whatever social welfare payments they receive they pay back to the Department of Finance.  Under the new scheme <Col N="969" /> the maternity rate would be the standard rate, but it is a matter that could be negotiated in the contract that secretaries have with their individual Deputies or parties.  It is open to them to increase that amount to the full amount of pay if they want.  It allows that flexibility and it is a matter that certainly must be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding also that the allowance paid to the Deputy would be paid at the higher level of the scale so that those on EO and AO levels would be catered for and the Deputy would have sufficient moneys to pay at that level.  Deputy Rabbitte pointed out that in some cases &mdash; and Deputy O'Donnell had strong views on this also &mdash; with the commencement of the new system the individual Deputy would be obliged to pay at a particular level.  In that regard I do not accept the fear that secretaries might have that they would be given a pittance and told to get on with the job, because it would not work that way.  The relationship between Deputies and secretaries is more personal than that and it is one of personal commitment.  That is the way I have always viewed the relationship between Deputies and secretaries. I do not envisage, even in changed circumstances, that relationship or attitude changing.  In fact I predict they will enhance that attitude, where there is personal commitment between a Member and secretary.  The system will allow a Member flexibility to increase payments within the band of money he or she receives, allowing them to reward a secretary accordingly.</P>
    <P>Some Member mentioned the question of overtime.  Some Members may not be aware of it but, for secretaries, in this House, there is an allowance of up to six hours for a Member who has a secretary here.  I cannot obtain that allowance for my secretary in the constituency.  I consider she should be paid it, as should everybody else.  Therefore, the anomaly in relation to constituency secretaries works very much to their disadvantage.  I want to see that anomaly being redressed. Indeed, the provisions of this Bill will allow us do so.  In addition, the <Col N="970" /> system applicable to constituency secretaries is one that obtains for the lifetime of a Dáil, as is proposed under the provisions of this Bill.  However, if a Member loses his or her Dáil seat the constituency secretary goes automatically, without there being any pooling arrangement or anything else.  Certainly I take the point made by a number of Members that such anomalies which have developed should be redressed.  The provisions of this Bill so provide.  That has always been my intention, as the other Whips will confirm, since we discussed this matter between us.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a very strong argument about the fact that these particular sections have been incorporated into this Bill.  I do not want to be insulting in any way to anybody &mdash; I do not intend to be so &mdash; but, under the terms of our law and Constitution the secretarial assistance scheme is a facility for Members and must be treated in that manner.  Therefore, it is in that manner that it must be treated within the provisions of the Bill before us.  I should say that the Government is not attempting to be facetious in any way about that.  That is the reality and the legislative manner in which we must deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a number of other points about back-up facilities for the committee system.  Perhaps, in the light of what we are talking about, I will skip over that query and go on to deal with questions raised by Deputy Rabbitte, reverting to those raised by Deputy O'Donnell later.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate that all of this will be subject to negotiation, I will attempt to give him my personal view only with regard to some of the questions he posed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish as quickly as I can.  On the question of continuity of service, Deputy Rabbitte will excuse me if I am somewhat vague but he will understand, having been a union official, that <Col N="971" /> when one begins talking about entering into negotiations one does not expose one's hand totally.  We are talking now in the context of a contract of some kind. The Deputy asked whether continuity of employment or service would be possible. Yes, it will be possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked how long the job or employment can be retained, whether it can be retained as long as the relevant Member retains his or her seat or for the lifetime of a Dáil.  I should point out that the provisions of the Bill allow for such employment to be retained for the lifetime of a Dáil.  I presume that if a Member is satisfied with a secretary's performance and so on, arrangements can be made for her continuance of service in that manner.  I suppose the short answer is that it is possible to hold the job after an election.  The Deputy also asked whether there would be a common contract.  I cannot give him a straight answer to that because different parties may have different needs and may well decide they want different types of contract. But if asked whether I would favour a type of framework of minimum standards to be applicable across the board I can say I would favour it.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with questions about holidays, working hours, sick pay and so on.  The Deputy also asked about public sector pay increases.  I presume the allowance will be increased in line with public service pay increases, thereby allowing a Member to increase payments to his or her secretary as well.  I have already referred to maternity leave which was also mentioned by the Deputy.  He also raised the matter of overtime payments. The six hours overtime per week at present allowed to secretaries in the House will be built into a Member's allowance, thereby allowing it to be passed on to secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not quite sure from where the suggestion about a transfer to other Members emanated but, if I might put it this way, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent such a transfer.  Neither is there any provision in the Bill to render such transfer compulsory.  I am not sure that I <Col N="972" /> understood the point precisely but I can say that there is no provision in the Bill that would affect such a transfer one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Complaints and so on would be dealt with in the normal manner through the normal channels.  For example, if a secretary has a complaint and is a member of a union, that complaint can be made to the union through the appropriate channels.</P>
    <P>With regard to negotiations, although I have never been an active negotiator for or on behalf of a union at any stage, I understood that when a union began negotiating with an employer, with Whips or whoever, the union representative, speaks for and on behalf of all the union's membership.  That is the position as I understood it.  I know from what Members have said that there appears to be a communications problem. Certainly, I would not be happy with circumstances in which we, the four Whips, would agree something with a union representative or representatives, which was not communicated down along the line.  I take the point made that communications will have to be improved right from the top to the bottom.  That is something which, over Christmas, I will endeavour to devise a means of doing.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which was commenced on 1 September last, nursing home proprietors have one year in which to register with a health board.  The Act, therefore, provides for the gradual registration of nursing homes with health boards.  To date health boards have received 184 applications for registration from nursing homes, of which 60 were received during the month of November.  So far 34 homes have been registered by health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department was concerned that prior to the month of November, so few homes had applied for registration.  It was drawn to my attention that the procedure for confirming that nursing homes had complied with fire safety requirements was causing difficulties and was delaying registration.  My Department wrote to the health boards in November clarifying the procedures for registration of nursing homes in relation to confirmation that fire safety requirements were being met. This clarification is a major reason for the increase in applications for registration under the Act and it is expected that significant numbers of homes will be registered before the end of this year.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know that my Department has established a group to monitor the implementation of <Col N="974" /> the nursing homes Act comprising representatives of my Department, of health boards, of the principal nursing home associations and of the National Council for the Elderly, which is meeting regularly to monitor progress on implementation including the registration of nursing homes, and to advise on how difficulties encountered in the implementation of the Act can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that during the year following the commencement of the Act, health boards have discretion to pay nursing home subventions to persons who have qualified for the subventions, to nursing homes which have not yet registered under the Act.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the comment by his colleague I put it to him that the uptake on the nursing home regulations has been remarkably slow and that action other than that adverted to in his reply is required?  Is he aware that approved subventions have been remarkably low? Does he accept that in the Mid-Western <Col N="975" /> Health Board region out of 140 applications only eight have been approved; that of the 70 applications in the Southern Health Board region only eight have been approved; that only 24 have been approved out of more than 170 in the Midland Health Board region and that in the South-Eastern Health Board region very few have been accepted out of 390 applications?  Does he accept there is a serious problem in the arrangement for subventions because there appears to be a hold up?  What action does he propose to take to minimise the hold up given the welcome by all sides of the House, and the community, for these regulations when they were introduced on 1 September 1993?  People are not benefiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by the Chair regarding what is appropriate for me to answer.  In relation to the supplementaries, I was most anxious that this legislation be brought into force.  I worked with a certain alacrity, since my appointment, to ensure that very complex regulations which were needed to bring the Act into force were worked on. That involved a huge volume of work which was expertly carried out by my departmental staff, to whom I pay tribute. This enabled me to bring the provisions of the Act into force on 1 September.  That was welcomed uniformly by all the associations and the proprietors of nursing homes.  Everybody will welcome two aspects, the monitoring of the standards of care &mdash; which is so important &mdash; and the provision of subventions to those in need.  I share the Deputy's concern that the volume of take-up has not been as high as I would have wished.  That is the reason I outlined a programme of action, including the establishment of a monitoring group.  I <Col N="976" /> am confident that significant progress will be made in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of subventions, are the appeals officers operating in all the health boards?  The Minister can have all the monitoring committees he likes but if the staff is not available there will be a problem.  Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient staff is available to implement these very complex regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the allocation of moneys I made to the health boards was to enable specific designated staff to be provided to ensure that all applications were processed expeditiously and responded to.  I am content that that is the case.  In relation to an appeals mechanism, an appeals officer is in every health board region on the same basis as appeals officers for other benefits provided by my Department.  I share the Deputy's view that a health board appeals mechanism alone is not satisfactory. I am giving serious consideration to establishing a better national appeals mechanism, not only under this Act, but in regard to other benefits to which people may be entitled.  It is sometimes pointed out to me, and I am sure to Deputies opposite, that there can be disparities and differences in the interpretation of requirements from health board to health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> May I at the outset refute any suggestion that the Department has not, since the initiation of lottery grants, acted in accordance with the guidelinss issued by the Department of Finance and in accordance with administrative procedures based on accepted good practice? The procedures which have been adopted have had regard for the need to ensure transparency and accountability in disbursing national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the latest year for which complete figures are available, of the £41.292 million available in lottery funding, almost 98 per cent went to support ongoing services administered by health boards or by bodies which have a close ongoing relationship with my Deparment. A very small proportion was available, therefore, to support discretionary type grants.</P>
    <P>The procedures which have been adopted in relation to this small proportion of funds, issued at the Minister for Health's discretion, are briefly:</P>
    <P>(a)  each request is assessed by the relevant division in the Department having regard to the nature of the service being provided by the organisation seeking the grant.  The request may be made by the organisation or on its behalf.  The division will, either through its direct knowledge of the work of the organisation or on the basis of information provided by the relevant health board, take a view on whether the grant should be favourably considered and, if so, the order of priority which should be afforded to it among the competing requests.</P>
    <P>(b)  In a small proportion of cases the Department may itself take an initiative, based on knowledge and ongoing relationship with an organisation, and recommend to the Minister the making of a grant to supplement the resources to it from other sources.</P>
    <P>(c)  The various requests and recommendations are then the subject of discussion with the Minister normally in the first half of the year and, again, in November-December each year.  The <Col N="978" /> Minister's decisions are then implemented by the Department. Other requests which arise from time to time and which have to be dealt with quickly are addressed in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>(d)  Each organisation receiving a grant is informed in writing that the lottery grant may only be used on the project or for the purpose in respect of which it was approved and is requested to submit a certificate of expenditure to the Department on completion of the project or as soon as possible after the end of the financial year in which the grant was issued, whichever is the earlier.</P>
    <P>When I was considering the first <i>tranche</i> of requests for lottery funding earlier this year, soon after my appointment, I requested my officials to conduct a full review of administrative procedures relating to the disbursement of these funds.  Resulting from this review the following amendments have been adopted: a standard application form, as I informed the Deputy at the Special Committee, will be introduced from January 1994 onwards which will be the basis on which payments will be authorised, save for those recommended by the Department on its own initiative; confirmation of expenditure for the approved project or service will be pursued; health boards to be informed on a routine basis of all direct payments made to organisations within their functional areas: the aim of this is to improve co-ordination.  All unsuccessful applicants in each year will be notified and informed that they may submit a new application in the future. This processs has already begun &mdash; for example, all of those who have received discretionary funding in 1992 have again been written to for certification of expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>However laudable the Minister's approach may be, he is in effect, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  I believe there are serious irregularities in the matter of disbursement of lottery funds in his <Col N="979" /> Department.  Is the Minister prepared to open the books in his Department and come clean on applications for lottery funds over the past number of years?  The Minister mentioned that discretionary payments by his Department were small. I understand that in 1992 payments under the discretionary grant scheme amounted to £7.7 million.  Will he confirm that the figure is accurate?</P>
      <P>There is great public unease about the disbursement of lottery funds by the Department of Health.  The Minister has now admitted to the House that the standard application form will be introduced as and from 1 January, 1994.  This is the reaction to something that is bordering on a scandal.  I ask the Minister to come clean and inform the House on the steps he proposes to take at Cabinet level to ensure that the distribution of lottery funds is above board.  Since 1987 we have handled over £350 million of lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me respond very directly not only to the supplementary questions but to the mutterings on the benches opposite.  I have a very clear view on this matter.  I intend that transparency will be the hallmark of my time in the Department of Health.  That is the case and will remain the case.  I refute any suggestions stated or muttered to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy opposite talks about serious irregularities but no such irregularities occurred.  As I stated in my initial response, the guidelines and the law were complied with in their entirety.  The secretary of my Department has responded today before the Committee of Public Accounts on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt, I instructed my Department&mdash;although they did not need instruction&mdash;to make available to the Committee of Public Accounts all documents that are required for as long and for as far back as it requires them. The documents will be made available to everybody.  I understand the Deputy's usual overstatement on these matters and why some Deputies, absent or present, <Col N="980" /> would like to make more of it than there is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is grave public disquiet and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any doubt about it, I am in office 11 months and there will be complete transparency about every action I take in office.  I am accountable to this House and my Department is accountable before the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, of course, wrong again in his figures.  For the information of the House, the total amount of funds nominally at the Minister's discretion in 1992 was £1.69 million.  Of this amount £834,000 had to be allocated to meet ongoing commitments, arising from decisions made earlier, to fund organisations of which the Deputies opposite will be very familiar and certainly support. This left a balance of about £857,000 on which the Minister was free to make the decision.  Of that amount a great deal went on organisations with which the Deputy would be familiar &mdash; for example, Western Care got £70,000 to fund ongoing development in the mentally handicapped services.  The information is available in black and white for everybody to see.  There is absolute transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made some amendments because I felt that the processing of applications for national lottery funding was very awkward and it was very hard for staff to treat handwritten letters as applications &mdash; somebody submitted very comprehensive documents and one voluminous application included a video. There needed to be a standardisation and months ago I instructed staff that the standard form would come into operation from next year.  Obviously, I did not want to ask every organisation which had submitted an application to resubmit another.  For comparative purposes and ease of administration, as well as clear accountability, a standard form is desirable <Col N="981" /> and will be implemented from 1 January, 1994.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair agrees that this is a matter of considerable public importance.  The only way the tide of cynicism will be dispelled is when the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues take on board a suggestion made by the Tánaiste in 1988 that an all party forum be set up to deal with the lottery.  Until there is a root and branch review of the disbursement of lottery funding we will have the type of problems that were referred to not only by me and other Deputies on this side of the House but by no less a person than the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A number of important questions remain to be answered.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that lottery applications in the Department of Health were haphazard.</P>

That is as far as we can possibly go.  I understand the wish of some Deputies to make more of it than there is, but everybody who has received a grant from the Department of Health was worthy of it.  The money available for voluntary organisations is very small and the social services and the health services only survive due to the tremendous work of voluntary organisations. Sometimes we can make only token payments to these organisations and the payments are of significance only in terms of the suggestion of support as opposed to monetary value.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Increases in real terms in annual expenditure in respect of drugs and medicines under the GMS scheme for the years 1989 to 1992 have been in the order of 10 per cent to 13 per cent per annum. A continuation of these trends into the current year would have resulted in an increase in GMS drugs expenditure of about £15 million.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the indicative drug targets this year, allied to the new support structures which have been put in place, has brought about a significant reduction in the previous trend increases.  In the first nine months of this year overall drugs expenditure increased by about £4.4 million, or 4.44 per cent on the corresponding period last year.  A further improvement in the position is expected as the general practice units become fully operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome the overall trend in this regard, but there is a number of matters about which I am seriously concerned and I now seek the aid of the Minister in dispelling that concern.  On the question of confidentiality, will the Minister confirm that there is an element of confidentiality with regard to prescribing under the GP units and that the privacy of the relationship between the doctor and patient will be respected? With particular reference to a case within a health board, where perhaps a patient may have a disabled person's maintenance allowance under appeal, will there be access through the GP unit to the patient's file now that we have, for <Col N="984" /> the first time in the State, departed from the individual GMS patient/doctor confidentiality? The Minister has been short on information on how best the confidential relationship between doctor and patient can be preserved.</P>

There will be no question of any individual knowledge of the prescribing patterns of an individual doctor to a patient.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>An accurate figure in respect of the number of persons addicted to hard drugs in Dublin is difficult to compute.  However, it is estimated that, excluding persons attending the community services established by the Eastern Health Board in 1992 and <Col N="985" /> 1993, approximately 1,850 persons are receiving treatment for drug abuse in various treatment centres.  A total of 352 persons are on the methadone and maintenance programmes in the satellite clinics and a number are receiving treatment from general practitioners. Information concerning the areas of residence of persons addicted to drugs is not available.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that when the Deputy refers to hospital beds available for drug treatment he is referring to specialised detoxification beds.  There are ten such beds available in Beaumont Hospital for which there is a waiting list of 15 female and 21 male patients.</P>
      <P>There have been significant developments in the Eastern Health Board treatment services in the last two years.  At present the board is providing services at four locations &mdash; Baggot St., Amiens St., Ballyfermot and Trinity Court &mdash; and community drug teams to complement the above clinics are being provided in Rialto and Ballymun.  A total of 536 persons are currently on the waiting list for the health board methadone treatment programmes and the board intends to open at least two further clinics in early 1994.  They also propose to establish further community drug teams.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the protocol on the prescribing of methadone in 1994 and the increased involvement of a number of general practitioners in a structured methadone maintenance programme in the community will also assist in tackling the problem.</P>
      <P>The services which are now in place and those which are being developed have been introduced as a result of the strategies prepared by the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse and the National AIDS Strategy Committee. Both of these committees will continue to assess the need for the development of services and to advise me on the appropriate responses to such needs.  The Deputy can be assured that I regard this area as a priority and have made provision in the 1994 Estimates to develop these services further.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm whether he has recently stated publicly that there are in the region of 5,000-6,000 people addicted to hard drugs in Dublin city?  Arising from the reply in relation to the new satellite clinics, does the Minister not accept that these clinics, despite the dedicated staff, provide little more than a band-aid service, with in some instances two counsellors looking after hundreds of addicted persons and a waiting list of nearly 200 awaiting them, giving them an opportunity to see the addicted person only once a month and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept much of what the Deputy has said and the Deputy's sincerity in putting this case.  I have sought resources to combat drug abuse. Last year we substantially increased the funding available and in 1994 I intend that we shall have substantial additional funding.  The funding enabled us to establish three satellite clinics and at least two more are about to come on stream.  The staffing will be put in place along with further community teams.  The methadone protocol that allows GPs to prescribe and all the recommendations of the national co-ordinating committee will be implemented in that regard in 1994. Action is being taken to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>On the figures, we do not have accurate information about the number of people who are addicted to drugs in Dublin.  We are trying to get firm figures.  The figures presented to me range from 2,000 to 7,000 and, looking at all the figures, I reckoned that 5,000 would not be an unreasonable estimate; but we are not really clear about it.</P>

Does the Minister accept that his job is made all the more difficult, if not impossible, when we read in the papers today that a drug dealer convicted of possession of heroin with intent to supply, who is linked by the Garda to a seizure of 60 grammes of heroin, £100,000 worth in street value, was given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 61 together.  In determining the annual allocation for a hospital, my Department identifies, where appropriate, the specific amount of funding provided for the approved developments in particular specialties. However, it is a matter for the hospital authority to determine its overall expenditure budget in line with the agreed level of allocation to support its agreed service levels.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Vincent's Hospital the national liver transplant programme is identified in respect of additional development funding in this manner.  The average cost of an individual liver transplant is £33,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the high cost of liver transplants and similar high-tech operations is putting a major drain on hospital budgets and that there is a danger other areas of hospital activity, which are equally essential and important, will become under-funded?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is underscoring the difficulties facing me as Minister for Health in allocating resources because of the very expensive new techniques and specialties coming on stream. I had an opportunity to visit the national liver transplant unit on a number of occasions during the past year.  Marvellous work is being carried out there and some of my constituents have benefited from liver transplants, one of whom has had three transplants in the past 12 months.  We have a national duty to provide funding for people who need such transplants and we must find it over and above the normal allocation.  I accept the Deputy's comments in that regard. That is our attitude when allocating resources to hospitals such as St. Vincent's.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's comments in regard to the inestimable <Col N="989" /> value of such operations and I welcome the fact that they are carried out here now.  One of our colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, had such an operation recently.  I again ask the Minister to examine in the next financial year the need to ensure that other types of hospital activities and surgery are not neglected or underfunded as a result of providing funds for liver transplant operations.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Minister's reply about the dental hospital I would impress on him the urgency of the matter.  The problems associated with the dental hospital and its structure go back as far as the 1960s.  It is time the matter was taken in hand by way of capital injection either for relocating the hospital or a more financially feasible extensive refurbishment of the hospital at its present location.</P>
      <P>The importance of that initiative is underlined by the fact that 2,000 people per week attend the dental hospital.  We have not acknowledged the tremendous role played by that hospital, particularly in the Dublin area.  The disadvantaged and those who might not otherwise benefit from dental treatment are being treated in that hospital.  Will the Minister publish that report prior to the budget with a view to imparting some welcome news in 1994 in regard to that hospital?</P>

It treats a large number of patients and has a reputation of having some of the most skilled dental surgeons in the country. From a Government perspective, I am anxious to ensure its continued existence. Shortly after taking up office I was motivated to talk to my colleagues with overlapping responsibilities in that area. Because the Dublin Dental Hospital is an educational institute its subhead is covered under the Department of Education Vote.  I have had discussions with the Ministers for Education and Finance, we set up a joint working group chaired by an officer of my Department and their report is now to hand.  I hope to be able to take action on that report shortly.</P>

General practice units have been established in each health board area and in the Department with the overall aim of improving the organisation and infrastructure of general practice. Such units have recruited general practitioners and rely to a large extent on such expertise in executing their remit.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to reports that the Government intends to close both the Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin 2, and St. Anne's Hospital, Northbrook Road, Dublin 6; and if he will give an assurance that this is not the case.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15, 69, 161, 162, 163, 164 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospital board earlier this year adopted a strategic plan for the development of the hospital as a national centre of excellence in the treatment and care of cancer patients. The strategic plan was submitted to my Department for consideration some months ago.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the plan is to enhance the range of services at present available and to ensure that a high quality, integrated and comprehensive range of facilities is provided to meet the present and future needs of patients and their families.</P>
      <P>Following detailed and extensive consideration of all the issues involved, the board of St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospital is satisfied that the needs of patients and their families can best be met by transferring personnel and acute services at present provided at St. Anne's on to the St. Luke's Hospital campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the strategic plan in detail, I wish to announce that I am in agreement with its main elements.  I am confident that the transfer of acute services from St. Anne's to the St. Luke's Hospital campus will provide a unique opportunity to consolidate and improve the overall level of services at present available.  I wish to state clearly that the <Col N="996" /> strategic plan is not in any way concerned with a reduction in present services but rather a significant strengthening and expansion of services to patients.  This will entail significant additional costs.</P>
    <P>I should stress at this point that the preparation of the plan and the decision of the board has been made in full consultation and agreement with the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. They will be concentrating in the future on the development of hospice and palliative care at the St. Francis Hospice, Raheny and these services will complement and supplement the enhanced services for cancer patients on the St. Luke's campus.  In the discussions I hope the new hospice and the new national cancer centre will be linked.  Taken together, these developments will represent a significant advance in the whole area of cancer care.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the announcement of the board's intentions has raised the concerns of certain staff, principally those working in St. Anne's Hospital, and I would like to reassure all concerned that staff interests are fundamental to this change.  It is the intention that all staff will be assimilated within the change process.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate a speedy and smooth transition, I am immediately establishing a joint project team, comprising representatives of the hospital board and officials of my Department, to plan for and oversee the arrangements for the transfer of services which is expected to take place during the coming year.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed disposal of lands by the hospital board, I can confirm that this matter is being pursued by the board and is not inconsistent with the board's overall plans for the development of services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the incidence of cancer, as cancer is not a notifiable disease, it is not possible to say how many new cases of the disease have been diagnosed on a yearly basis over the past five years. However, the recently established National Cancer Registry Board, which I opened in Cork, will be commencing full national cancer registration on 1 January <Col N="997" /> 1994 and this will allow detailed information to be assembled on the incidence and prevalence of cancer.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the question concerning the future of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, I can confirm that there are no proposals before me for the closure of the hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with some of the specific points raised in the question?  Will he indicate how the service can be strengthened if 64 beds are to be closed and if a question mark will be placed beside country clinics, held in counties such as Wexford &mdash; the Minister's home county &mdash; and Mayo, and in St. Anne's Hospital where there is an out-patients clinic?  Will matching funds be made available in 1994 to provide these facilities at the St. Luke's centre? While the Minister says that the staff will be protected can he assure the House that this applies equally to temporary and other staff who do not have contracts under which they have statutory protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the facilities for cancer patients will be strengthened.  There is no question of closing 62 beds and not replacing them on the new campus.  The purpose is to transfer the beds and to strengthen and enhance services for cancer patients, not simply to close a hospital.  It is the view of the joint board of the hospitals that because technology is constantly changing and being improved and because of the expense involved in acquiring the latest hi-tech facilities it makes sense to have one national state of the art centre. I hope to work towards this.  There will be no diminution in the number of beds available in the new centre as opposed to the number of beds available in the two centres at present.  The outreach services will be subsumed into the new centre.  In relation to staff matters, I do not want to pre-empt the negotiations but I am determined that all staff will be treated fairly which is consistent with the equality of care they have provided to generations of Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself I find it difficult to understand how the loss of 62 beds, according to the Minister, tallies with his statement that it is the intention to provide as many beds as possible.  Specifically, will the Minister refer to the country clinics which have been a very valuable feature of the service provided by St. Anne's?  Will these clinics continue to be provided and staffed on the same basis as heretofore?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my initial response I said specifically that this proposal will entail significant capital costs.  I am establishing a project team to quantify these capital costs but I am prepared to pay them because the recommendation made to me was that services for cancer patients could be enhanced on a single campus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this decision mean that St. Luke's will not be selling land, rather that they will be retaining it for the developments which the Minister has outlined?  This raises the question of whether other hospitals should retain land for developments which may be provided in the future.  We have to think long term, rather than short term given that it was the intention to dispose of some of this land.  Does the Minister know at this stage what will happen the St. Anne's Hospital premises?  Is that matter being considered in the negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Anne's Hospital is <Col N="999" /> actually owned by the Daughters of Charity and on lease to the joint board.  It is not a matter for me to dispose of it.  It is private property owned by the order, as is the land connected to it.  I certainly will be anxious to ensure that sufficient land exists on the St. Luke's site to provide the new enhanced facilities that I require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for his somewhat comprehensive reply, could I ask him to give an assurance that his plan will be put into effect in 1994 and that the axe will not be hanging over the future of St. Anne's for very long?  I do not think the Minister addressed the question posed by Deputy Fitzgerald.  It seems somewhat foolish to allow the sale of land from a complex that the Minister states will be a national centre of excellence.  Surely it is important in the interests of long term development to keep the campus of St. Luke's in one unit and not allow the sale of land.</P>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister agree that it is important to remember the need of cancer patients to have a choice about where they might go for treatment and that that choice will be greatly reduced following the closure of St. Anne's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most people who suffer from life threatening or debilitating diseases such as cancer would feel better served and would prefer to know they are going to a national centre of excellence than to have a range of choices. We have one national neurological centre for neuro-surgery.  We have a national liver transplant centre, because that makes sense.  We have one national cardiac centre, although there is a developing cardiac unit in Cork.  The scale of treatment and the cost and technologies of it do not always make choice an essential component in care of the highest quality.</P>
      <P>On the question of land, I am establishing immediately a project team to overview this project and the matter of sufficient land will of course have high priority on their agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has no function in relation to the information on individual private nursing homes sought by the Deputy.  Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, it is the responsibility of health boards to establish a register of nursing homes in their respective regions.  These registers, which are currently being established, will give the name of each registered nursing home and the number of patients who can be accommodated in the home.  Information will not be provided on the cost per patient in each home as health boards have no function in relation to the cost of care in individual homes.  These health board registers will not be completed until after 1 September 1994, as nursing homes have until that date to register with a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in Dublin the difference between the cost of a place in a private nursing home and the subvention available from his Department, even under the new revised scheme, is so wide that it imposes severe hardship on many families? Would he therefore consider that there is a need to modulate the subvention in some way to the prevailing costs in parts of the country which reflect the higher costs generally of doing business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made a remarkable start this year.  We are spending £4 million on the implementation of the nursing homes Act in 1993 and a further £5 million in 1994.  That is new money in this area and is welcomed by the nursing homes associations and by patients who will benefit.  There are three levels of subvention.  They are very much higher than any that were available to those few <Col N="1001" /> categories of people who were entitled to a subvention in the past.</P>
      <P>The disparity between costs in Dublin and those in the rest of the country must be taken into account, but generally speaking I would like there to be a uniform system if that is possible.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Health I have a responsibility to ensure that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board remains financially viable.  In that context my Department has negotiated with the VHI for the past two years a national budget for health boards and public voluntary hospitals.  The budget relates to payments by the board to public agencies for maintenance and levy charges incurred by VHI members.</P>
      <P>The negotiations between the board and my Department have resulted in substantial increased payments by VHI over the past two years; in that period there has been a total increase of 50 per cent in VHI payments to health boards and voluntary hospitals.  This income is of considerable importance to the health boards and voluntary hospitals in maintaining services and my Department will begin discussions early in the new year with VHI in regard to payments to the public agencies for the VHI year 1994/95.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Is the Minister aware that because of a management plan to have a mix of private and public patients at the Cork Regional Hospital there will be a shortfall in funding this year of £5,000 and at the end of next year it will be £500,000, a significant sum?  As this policy has only recently been implemented and the quota is low, could the Minister see his way to ensuring <Col N="1002" /> that the VHI take this into account and also ensure that proper funding is made available by the Department to the regional hospital next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary responsibility is to public patients.  I support the concept of private patients being treated in public hospitals in private wards as long as there is a complete separation in terms of the visibility of the private public.  Besides generating income for the hospital it ensures that all specialists and consultants are available on the campus within the hospital rather than having to leave the campus to treat private patients.  There is benefit in that. However, I cannot allow a situation where the private practice would expand in a way that might put pressure on the throughput of public patients.  A balance must be struck.</P>
      <P>I must also be aware of the viability of the VHI, which funds the private sector procedures for the most part.  The balance I have struck in 1993 is reasonable and I hope to do similarly in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we are between a rock and a hard place because of the deficits facing health boards.  Given that in the Southern Health Board area there was very low interaction with the private patient sector &mdash; and that it is a good innovation &mdash; would the Minister agree to give special consideration to the regional hospital in Cork when a quota is set next year?  What impact nationally will the VHI quota system have on public hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat for the benefit of the Deputy and the House that we have encouraged and insisted on the payments from the VHI to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals.  These have increased remarkably in the last two years by a factor of 50 per cent to the cap rate of £51 million this year.  That is a significant new resource for hospitals and health boards.  As to the deficits mentioned by the Deputy, I am close to concluding an agreement to address the problem of indebtedness of health <Col N="1003" /> boards.  I know the Deputy will welcome that matter being brought to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>In regard to allocations to hospitals generally, I am concerned that some hospitals, having regard to their throughput of public patients, have not done as others and I hope to improve that situation in the new Estimates, taking into account the data on case mix available to me.</P>

It was in serious financial difficulties about five years ago but had picked up in the meantime.  Is there now a danger that it might be on a downward slope and, if so, what action does the Minister propose to take in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.  It is my intention to bring in legislation early in 1994 which will put the provisions of the Third EC Directive on Non-Life Insurance into Irish law, in so far as they affect health insurance.  This legislation will ensure that after 1 July 1994, insurers who wish to operate in Ireland may only sell private medical insurance schemes which provide for community rating, that is, all members pay the same premium per plan, irrespective of age or other risk factors.  The legislation will also provide that health insurance schemes must be marketed on the basis of open enrolment and non-termination of cover.</P>
      <P>In order to protect community rating I propose, by way of a system of risk equalisation, to remove incentives for insurers to devise means of attracting only low risk subscribers to their membership. Under such a system the cost of certain high risk subscribers is shared between all funds operating in the market.  It is likely that all insurers will be required to offer for sale a basic health insurance policy, the content of which will be laid down in regulations.  The components of such a policy and of the risk equalisation mechanism have not yet been decided on but a firm of actuarial consultants has been engaged to advise my Department on these matters.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for insurers to decide whether they wish to enter the private medical insurance market here after July 1994.  However, it is my objective to ensure that an equitable market, based on the arrangements I have described, is available for insurers and insured alike in Single Market conditions from July 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome competition in the area of health insurance.  Will the Minister set down a comprehensive list of regulations governing health insurance before next July and will he create a level playing pitch in that regard?  He has said already that community rating will be taken into account.  Will he give a guarantee <Col N="1005" /> in that regard, as it is of fundamental importance to all health insurance subscribers that all elements of the principle of community rating be fully honoured. Will the new premia be tax deductible? In the context of this question will the Minister acknowledge the concern I expressed about the current position of the VHI and indicate how the new arrangements might impact on that body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a series of questions to which I will seek to reply.  Regarding the area of health insurance in the open market situation, I intend to regulate that area by way of a Bill I propose to introduce in the next session or, at the latest, before the summer recess.  The three principles that will be enshrined in that legislation include community rating, open enrolment, which allows individuals join a health insurance scheme regardless of age, medical condition or other risk factors, and lifetime cover whereby those who provide health insurance may not cancel or refuse to renew membership for those who are covered and wish to maintain cover.</P>
      <P>We have considered the application of competitive systems elsewhere.  We have considered the dangers the open market will pose and we will be mindful of those in the proposed legislation.  We have considered the system of community rating that operates in Australia.  A mechanism was used by insurance operators in Australia to cherry pick some of the best risk ventures, notwithstanding the legal requirement for community rating.  I must ensure that the law is comprehensive in this regard and I am hopeful it will be before I introduce legislation in this regard.  That is the legislative framework in which the open market will operate.  Tax deductible premia is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance and, ultimately, a budgetary matter to be decided by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the future of the VHI, that body is a statutory public company and it must have regard to the new requirements for the open market.  For example, <Col N="1006" /> it must have reserves of a level which it does not currently have.  I propose to establish a working group to examine the workings of the VHI, hopefully within the next few weeks.  It will spend three weeks overviewing the operations of the VHI and report to me on other matters that need to be addressed to ensure that we have a viable and healthy VHI operating in the open market next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister guarantee that under the proposed legislation the Irish market will not be dominated by a major international player, such as the British company, BUPA?  If companies such as Blue Shield or Blue Cross made arrangements with BUPA they could monopolise the Irish market to the detriment of the VHI.  Will the proposed legislation protect the position of the VHI?  Deputy Quill stated that the recent report on the VHI was not positive and does the Minister consider that the VHI is ready for competition at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must operate within the law.  The European Union has decided that from 1 July next there will be an open market.  That is the position regardless of the views of Members or Ministers here. I will not be able to protect anybody in an open market.  The idea behind open markets and open competition is to provide competition that will benefit the consumer and I am sure that view is supported by Deputies opposite. However, I must preserve some fundamentals. The issues we negotiated in regard to the EU regulations are the preservation of the factors of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  We hope they can be regulated and that everyone will be required to compete on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of international companies, and I will list them if time permits, have already sought information from my Department in relation to the requirements for next year.  I suspect a number of companies will operate once there is an open market and that is a basis of law that we must address.  It will be my job to enact the law to protect the consumer <Col N="1007" /> as best I can and comply with European law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will introduce regulations to ensure that people are protected.  That is an important development.  I am aware it is early days and it may be unfair to ask the Minister specific questions.  In relation to information to which clients are entitled, will the Minister ensure information is given to people who apply for cover, particularly if those applicants are refused cover?  The lack of provision of such information is a major problem in respect of car insurance applications, particularly where cover is refused. There does not seem to be any onus on a company to provide information.  The same position applies in respect of medical reports.  A medical report may be carried out in respect of an applicant but the applicant has no access to that report. The report becomes the property of the insurance company.</P>
      <P>Regarding spreading the load of high risk clients, does the Minister envisage that each company will have a quota that it would be required to fill?  How would this matter be regulated to ensure that companies were not avoiding taking on clients who will cost them money?</P>

      <P>In relation to the criteria for refusals and medical reports, I have not begun to address these matters yet.  I will bear in mind the Deputy's observations when framing the legislation, which we are in the process of doing at present.  As to how the risk equalisation mechanism will operate, this mechanism is a fund which will be contributed to by all health insurers with a lower than average risk and out of which insurers with an above average risk will be compensated. The objective is that everybody will be on an equal level.  We will have to find a way to ensure that we can do that legally and in accordance with European law.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confer with his colleague on the question of <Col N="1008" /> whether premia will be tax deductible?  If there is to be fair competition we must create a level playing pitch.  The question of whether premia are tax deductible is one element in levelling the playing pitch and should not be left out of the Minister's discussions.  Will he confer with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the position is the same for existing and new companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the video referred to was to provide advice by a recognised medical expert to general practitioners on the appropriate prescribing of various categories of medicines.  While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have a well established and accepted role for particular indications, the point being made in the video was that these products are often used in circumstances where a simple pain killer would suffice.</P>
      <P>Like all medical preparations, these products have their adverse effects, particularly if used over a prolonged period of time, which medical practitioners must take into account in prescribing for their patients.</P>
      <P>All non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs approved for use in this country are the subject of product authorisations on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The board operates a monitoring system for all medical products on the market under which adverse effects of drugs are recorded.  In its monitoring of these adverse reactions, the board may decide that the use of the products concerned may be further restricted and that appropriate warnings and precautions be incorporated in the information supplied to medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the procedures in place for the authorisation and use of these products are sufficient to protect public health.  I would reiterate that the expert advice contained in the video relates to the appropriate use of medical preparations by doctors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it is fundamentally important that there be no confusion on this issue?  It would be very damaging if the impression was given, inadvertently or otherwise, that medical card holders are being offered drugs of the yellow pack standard, drugs that are not up to the standard approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board. <Col N="1010" /> In light of what emerged from that video it is important that a definitive statement be clearly conveyed to everybody because at the end of the day perceptions can be damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a definitive statement for the Deputy and the House. The best possible medicines are available to all patients regardless of whether they are medical card holders.  Some discussion took place on this matter in the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I totally reject the notion that there is pressure on doctors to prescribe anything but the best for their patients.  I am sure general practitioners would be the first to resist any such pressure.  I will make one point by way of illustration of my regard for medical card holders.  When pressure was brought to bear in relation to the availability of the flu vaccine in recent months, it was medical card holders who had access to stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the five Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that yesterday afternoon, on an otherwise historic and significant day, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, announced in the House of Commons his decision to allow commissioning of the THORP at Sellafield in West Cumbria. The UK authorities have come to a judgment that there is a sufficient balance of advantage in favour of the operation of THORP and that the activities giving rise to radioactive discharges permitted by authorisations are justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On hearing this news, I immediately expressed the Government's deep regret at the British authorities decision.  I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to convey, through the Ambassador in London, the Government's very strong views on the matter.  The Government's views on the decision were delivered today by the Ambassador to the Secretary of State for the Environment.  I have made it clear that the Government was particularly concerned that the British authorities had not acceded to the many requests made to them by this Government, and numerous other interested parties, for a full public inquiry into the wider issues related to the plant before a decision was taken authorising its commissioning.  It is still the Government's view that a full, open inquiry in which all contentious issues could be subjected to vigorous and independent debate and close scrutiny is the only process which would command widespread <Col N="1018" /> public confidence.  I know that Deputies from all parties would wish to be associated with the Government's feelings.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret that the British authorities did not recognise at this stage the fundamental changes which have occurred in the nuclear industry since the 1970s decision to build the THORP. Reprocessing is no longer seen as an essential and future strategic activity to safeguard further energy supplies. Indeed, the role of the nuclear industry is now much diminished compared with what was envisaged at the time.  The economics of reprocessing have fundamentally changed.  Uranium is now in plentiful supply and prices are lower. More important, the extraction of plutonium then envisaged as the &ldquo;fuel of the future&rdquo; in a new chain of fast breeder reactors does not now have any meaningful role in the energy supply chain because of the technical and economic failure to develop the required technology. Instead, an increasing stockpile of plutonium is a cause of increasing concern about its possible risks of causing nuclear weapon proliferation and possible terrorists uses.  In addition, the intervening years have seen no progress in arriving at an acceptable solution to the safe long term storage and disposal of the growing volume of nuclear waste to which reprocessing gives rise.</P>
    <P>One can only come to the conclusion that commissioning THORP is now based on the narrow and unconvincing grounds of financial expediency and the viability of BNFL and retaining employment in the Cumbria area.  While I have not had the opportunity yet to study the rationale which led to the decision of the UK authorities it is very regrettable that they did not see fit to conduct their review in open forum instead of behind closed doors and take a broad view of the present state and future prospects of the industry as it is now.  I would also say to the Governments of those countries whose utilities have contracted to reprocess fuel at Sellafield, that they are using the plant as a means of resolving their own waste handling problems rather than <Col N="1019" /> securing real economic benefits for energy security and supply.</P>
    <P>The Government, and its predecessors, consistently opposed the planned reprocessing plant at Sellafield since it was first proposed in 1978.  In the past year, two comprehensive submissions were forwarded by me in the public consultation process undertaken by the UK authorities &mdash; one in January and the other in October 1993.  These submissions detailed Ireland's absolute opposition to the plant and called for a public inquiry.  The Government has also used every opportunity in every appropriate international fora to highlight its concerns and to object to THORP's commissioning.</P>
    <P>It is a grave disappointment, therefore, that, despite the Government's objections to the THORP set out in the two submissions, the concerns expressed by other European Environment Ministers, for example Norway, Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the large number of objections received at the second public consultation process, the British Government is determined to press ahead with the operation of THORP primarily for its straightforward financial benefits to BNFL and the UK's balance of payments, as well as for job retention purposes in the depressed local west Cumbria region.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to know that, when the second consultation period ended on 4 October 1993, of the 42,500 responses received in London 63 per cent were opposed to the operation of THORP. More than 29 per cent of these respondents called for a hearing or public inquiry.  This demand included 85 local authorities in the UK as well as the Isle of Man Government, although the two local authorities with direct responsibility for the Sellafield area &mdash; Cumbria County Council and Copeland District Council &mdash; did not consider a hearing to be necessary. It is notable that in their announcement the UK Ministers acknowledge that substantial concerns were expressed by respondents not only on the narrow issue <Col N="1020" /> of the effects of the discharges from the site, but also on the broader policy issues which focused on the need for reprocessing at THORP.  In view of these representations it is hard to readily accept the decision reached.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate to the House that the Government's opposition to the Sellafield plant will continue unabated. The Government continues to believe, and is supported in its view by numerous international authorities, that there are no demonstrable economic or security benefits arising from the new plant which would justify it or balance out possible, and even likely risks, to public health and environmental damage.  The Government firmly believes that an inquiry should have been undertaken to deal with the basic justification for operating the THORP plant in the changed circumstances prevailing today from those at the time the plant was approved in 1978, as well as other important issues such as the economics of reprocessing and the need for an environmental impact assessment for the plant to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>On that particular EIA question the Government is aware that during the second consultation procedure letters concerning the need for an environmental impact assessment of THORP were also received from Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Isle of Man and many local authorities in Britain.  The UK authorities consider, however, that the directive does not impose legally binding requirements in relation to THORP since the project was approved and commenced well before the directive came into effect.</P>
    <P>I also consider that the British Government's decision contravenes the wishes of a very large majority of European countries expressed at a meeting this year in Berlin of the Paris Commission on the Prevention of Marine Pollution.  That meeting called for a full environmental impact assessment before any permission was given for THORP's go-ahead.  That meeting also called for more information on the justification for spent fuel reprocessing as well as information on other <Col N="1021" /> waste management options before a new or revised authorisation was granted.  It was also agreed that there should be prior consultations with the Paris Commission beforehand.  The advice of the UK Government's own waste management advisory committee, which believed that there were no compelling waste management reasons for THORP, was not followed either.  The Comare Committee, which advises the UK Government on the health implications of environmental radiation issues, also had serious concerns about the levels of discharges being proposed by BNFL.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the most recent submission made by me on behalf of the Government in October this year concluded that as THORP would serve no overall useful purpose, there was no justification for the increased risk of radiation exposure that the public would receive from the THORP plant.  The issues of an environmental impact assessment, proliferation risks or demonstrable overall economic benefits were not addressed in the statement yesterday made by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons.  The focus was primarily on the risks related to discharges. My officials and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will therefore study with great interest the full decision, its rationale and supporting documentation and also the reasons for the UK authorities not holding an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government's October submission also referred to the revised limits for gaseous and liquid discharges being grossly excessive in relation to the margins between likely discharges from the Sellafield site and the proposed limits.  I understand that a number of amendments have now been made in order to provide greater reassurance that discharges from the site will be minimised and there is a procedure to require BNFL to further reduce discharges.  I welcome this decision.  However, the actual details of the amendments will have to be examined by the Radiological Protection Institute to see whether a significant gap still exists between what is now authorised and what is possible using today's <Col N="1022" /> available technology and best operating practices.  It is necessary to ensure that any radioactive discharges are kept as low as reasonably achievable and this will be closely monitored by the Irish Government in relevant international fora.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Avril Doyle's question on areas of health and environmental protection, I have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to evaluate the actual and potential risk to Ireland of additional discharges from Sellafield rising from THORP's operation and to communicate their significance to the public in realistic terms.  A separate detailed press release was issued yesterday by the institute.  The RPII estimated that in full operation, and assuming that discharges will be at the maximum authorised levels, the radiation dose to the most exposed member of the Irish public will be about 20 per cent greater from operations at Sellafield than at present.  It will still represent no more than 0.2 per cent of a persons' present total radiation dose from all sources of radiation, the great bulk of which are natural.  Because the THORP decision will inevitably increase the anxiety already felt by the public about Sellafield, I have also asked the institute to expand its programme for testing of levels of radioactive contamination of the marine and aerial environment and to monitor the levels of exposure to the Irish population to radiation arising from its start-up.  Special equipment has recently been installed at the institute's laboratories to monitor atmospheric levels of Krypton-85 gas which is the main contribution to the increase in atmospheric discharges resulting from THORP.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, it is a grave disappointment that despite widespread concerns and reservations about THORP, it is now to be allowed to open by the UK authorities.  Our opposition to Sellafield, and indeed to the nuclear option in general, will continue.  I would empathise with the various environmental interests in Ireland who have today also expressed grave disappointment at the British decision.  I can <Col N="1023" /> understand their feelings.  The question as to what legal action the Government could now take regarding the THORP plant is being kept under constant consideration and review in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow one round of supplementary questions from the five Deputies who have tabled the Private Notice Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask you, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to be as lenient as time will allow.  I thank you for permitting us to put down these questions, given the time constraints on us at the end of session.  Could I ask the Minister to detail precisely what course of action the Government will take from today?  What steps will the Minister take to get the British Government to reverse this decision?  The Programme for Government refers to the possibility of using Community and international law.  Can that be done?  Is there a role for Community and international law?  Will the Minister pursue Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands in their request for an environmental impact assessment of the proposed development? Will he pursue the resolution of the Paris Commission in relation to the EIA also?  What can the Minister do to get this development reversed?  I thank him for his long and considered reply, which contained much worthy information, but we need to know precisely where we go from today on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister's reply to my specific question regarding the RPI and his request to them.  It is not simply the normal operation of Sellafield that I ask the Minister to consider.  The plant is a major cause of anxiety to the Irish people, particularly those living on the east coast.  The British authorities exported their risk to their west coast, so that we now have the major risk in the event of a major accident.  It is that fear of a major accident, given Sellafield's accident history, which is not good, which is a major cause for concern, apart altogether <Col N="1024" /> from normal operations and a normal increase in the dose of radiation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to address those two points and to accept that any increase in risk is not warranted.  We obtain no benefit whatsoever from the operation of Sellafield.  We have all the risk without any benefit, control or consent. In other words, there is no self determination in this area and it is an infringement on our sovereignty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the Programme for Government.  In that programme we reiterate our commitment to investigate the possibility of using Community and international law to hasten the winding down and closure of Sellafield, and particularly THORP.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, there is not sufficient evidence to date, based on the advice of the Attorney General, to suggest that operations at Sellafield, including THORP, are in breach of EU law and international conventions which would sustain a successful case.  The question of legal action is a matter which is open to Government at any time.  The point to be made about access to legal action is that one must be advised by one's legal advisers that there is the achievable probability of sustaining a successful case. Unfortunately, there have been test cases recently in relation to parents of children who suffered from leukaemia when cause and effect were not established to the extent that liability could be attributed to the BNFL operation.  That was in respect of people who lived in close proximity to the plant.  There were 40 cases held back, on a group liability basis, to ascertain whether that case would succeed, but unfortunately it did not.  Legal options have been available at all times to successive Governments who have maintained a consistent line on this issue.  The prospect of sustaining a successful case must be a major consideration in whatever decisions the Government might take in relation to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of environmental impact assessment, it is not simply the position of Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and others in <Col N="1025" /> relation to this matter that must be considered. Everybody who has seen the submissions we made when the British Government was considering what should be the authorised level of discharges will realise that we have always argued that an environmental impact assessment should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Because the plant was built prior to the relevant EU directive coming into legal effect, there is no legal requirement on the United Kingdom authorities.  The point being made by us and others is that, given the level of public concern, one should take these decisions with the benefit of an open public inquiry rather than the unfortunate route that has been taken.  We share the grave disappointment of all Members of this House and of the entire electorate that the position taken by the United Kingdom Government on this issue has been the one announced yesterday.</P>
    <P>We will continue, at every possible opportunity, to maintain that, in principle, we disagree with the existence of this plant, that there should have been wider considerations in this case, not confined within the narrow limit of authorised levels of discharges.  Perhaps there should have been regional considerations in the United Kingdom.  There are 15,000 people employed in this plant.  We should remember that there was a public inquiry into the THORP site as far back as 1977. Developments in a whole range of areas have advanced so much it would have been prudent, proper and necessary to instigate a public inquiry before commissioning the plant.  That has not been the case.</P>
    <P>Within their level of competence the United Kingdom Government have taken that decision.  We will continue to voice our views on this matter at every available opportunity, in conjunction with other states who are equally concerned. Through the Radiological Protection Institute, we are expanding our monitoring to satisfy ourselves that, given the commissioning of this latest plant announced yesterday, full and detailed information will be made available, <Col N="1026" /> not merely to me, but to the public so that the context is understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said that yesterday, when we had an historic <i>rapprochement</i> between our two islands within the political arena, many Members on all sides of the House felt that simultaneously there was an exercise in cynicism and grotesque <i>real politik</i> on the part of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, in issuing approval for the commissioning of this latest plant.</P>
      <P>All Members of the House would agree that there is an absolute sense of urgency about this matter, in that we have, in effect, a mere 28 days in which to act. Speaking for all Members of the House, we want the Minister to put on his boots, tog out on this one, go into court, and do whatever is necessary to proceed against Mr. John Gummer and the British Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's colleague said, about a year and a half ago, that there was not a legal case.  Nonetheless, if one examines the record, one finds that in 1986 this House unanimously called for the closure of THORP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to frame a question, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. There is a whole range of issues involved.  For example, the United Kingdom Radioactive Substances Act dates back to 1960 but, for the very reasons the Minister has mentioned, their domestic law is defective.  In fact their second consultation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>They prejudged their second consultation, their two ministries issuing approval to THORP before the relevant report had been received.  I have 16 points listed before me.  Obviously, I cannot go through them all; I am willing to furnish the Minister the relevant list.  It <Col N="1027" /> is my view that we could proceed legally against THORP, that we should take action.  That is the overwhelming wish of this House.</P>
      <P>Because of the broader political scenario obtaining, if the Minister does not want to take action, then certainly the local authorities in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Louth and Wexford would be willing to go ahead if the Minister were prepared to indemnify us, since we have already received consultants' reports which are absolutely damning.  In the course of his reply the Minister had this to say:</P>
      <P>Special equipment has recently been installed at the Institute's laboratories to monitor atmospheric levels of Krypton-85 gas which is the main contributor to the increase in atmospheric discharges resulting from THORP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to Deputy Broughan, when he asked me to tog out on this one, that I have really been togging out on a 24 hour day basis.</P>
      <P>To revert to the substance of the many relevant points he made, the basis of any decision to take legal action would not be founded on wider political considerations but rather on the merits of the case as we saw them.  The Irish Government will seek, in protecting its citizens in every possible way, to base its case on its merits and the likelihood of a successful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined that the attempt to establish cause and effect in a whole range of areas, when even a disinterested observer might have expected a successful outcome, has not been successful.  While understanding the sincerity and emotion that matters of this <Col N="1028" /> kind enkindle, I stress that these matters must be examined analytically in the cold light of day.  That option is available to us at all times but we must consider it on the basis of the facts and on what can be established in law.  The point to be made is that this in no way changes our commitment, our determination to do what is available to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That would not be in the interests of the Irish people nor in the interests of the Government in pursuing its policy objectives in this overall area.</P>

      <P>That is not tokenism. Deputy Sargent has no monopoly on this issue.  This is an issue causing equal concern to everybody.  If Deputy Sargent regards diplomatic initiatives, the work of diplomats, the outcome of which we saw yesterday, as tokenism, then his ability to understand the great job they do, indeed its very purpose, is grossly inadequate and displays the type of naivety he has shown already on a number of occasions.  However, I do not wish to get into that area.  I am replying to Deputy Broughan, saying that everything possible that can be done, based on the advice available to the Government, has been done and will continue to be done on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as brief as possible.  Just over a month ago two other Deputies and I visited Sellafield and the THORP plant.  I should like to point out to the Minister that all three of us were astounded at the fact £3 billion had already been spent on the buildings. Literally, it was a matter of lifting two sluice gates and letting water flow in, letting all the various flasks go in from one building to another.  There were 300 people employed there practising what they hoped ultimately they would be doing.  I said to the officials in BNFL at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must proceed by way of question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the question.  When we were finished I said that what I had seen there that day convinced me more than ever that the consultation process that had been put in place by the British Government was little more than an absolute farce.  I ask the Minister to comment and give some indication as to whether he would share the same opinion as I had on that day? Would the Minister not accept that on this particular day, when we are recognised as a sovereign, neighbouring and friendly state, the British Government have in effect treated us in an extremely cavalier fashion?  What is going to happen?  I think we have lost this round, and I said that when I came away from Sellafield.  I said they would get their authorisation and that the people who were practising what they felt they would ultimately be doing would get their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that his Department and the Government do all they can to ensure that the ultimate storage of whatever remains from the processing of nuclear fuel at THORP will be catered for properly?  The Minister said earlier there was no legal requirement on the British Government to carry out an environmental impact assessment. Would he not agree there is a moral obligation on the British Government and has been for the past number of years, not only to their own citizens but <Col N="1030" /> to the citizens of this State, to have such an assessment carried out?  As a fellow lawyer, I do not have to tell the Minister his business.  Many cases have been brought into court where the prosecutor called the bluff of the defendant.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to call the bluff of the British Government in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dermot Ahern, who discussed his visit to Sellafield with me on his return.  Based on that conversation alone, I share the view that this plant should not have gone ahead.  I also take the point that, even if there is not a strict legal obligation to hold a public inquiry, sufficient concern has been expressed by a number of member states in the European Union to have an environmental impact assessment carried out and that perhaps that may have swayed opinion sufficiently in favour of that happening.  I reiterate our grave disappointment that that was not the decision taken by the British Government. Regardless of the timing of the decision, it was a wrong decision.  We have formally expressed our grave disappointment, saying we will continue to look at this situation.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point in regard to calling the bluff of the British Government. This is a question of such magnitude and importance that the taking of legal action must be based on the evidence available and the likelihood of a successful outcome.  In the meantime it is important that we use the agencies at our disposal and the excellent service provided by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to ensure that people are properly informed of the situation and that there is not undue alarm.  That is not in any way to diminish the extent of public concern as a result of this decision. However, people should be confident that the agencies are working to provide the maximum possible information based on scientific monitoring of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that yesterday, as he adverted to himself, very major steps were taken with a view <Col N="1031" /> to trying to bring to an end the long history of killing and terrorism in Northern Ireland which has resulted in the deaths of 3,500 people.  Is he aware that the other decision which was announced in London yesterday could well result in the deaths of many times 3,500 people? One or more noughts could be added to the figure.  In particular, that could arise in the event of an accident at THORP, an entirely new plant of a type not previously built in Britain, of which there are very few in the world &mdash; only one or two others &mdash; and of which there is little or no experience.  Is he aware that the real danger is not from the ordinary day to day discharges, which, if all goes well, are not that great, as he mentioned, but the dangers there are from an accident where the consequences could be catastrophic?</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister also that the cases he mentioned, which were lost recently by the plaintiffs, in respect of children who contracted leukaemia about ten or 12 years ago in the Sellafield area are not relevant to this matter because they relate to alleged discharges from the then existing ordinary small conventional nuclear generating station, of which there are dozens in Britain and hundreds throughout the world.  The THORP operation is totally different.  Therefore, the cases in relation to the existing station, which is completely different, are not relevant.  Is he aware that the only market available today for the plutonium which will be produced in substantial quantities by this reprocessing plant is from weapon manufacturers, because there are few, if any, fast breeder reactors who would wish to purchase or would need to purchase plutonium?  In these circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is it not criminally negligent to go ahead with a plant, the main output of which can only be used for the destruction of literally millions of people?  We must also bear in mind that <Col N="1032" /> it now appears that the nuclear powers in the world are not confined to three or four very large countries as in the past, but that this plutonium may be of use to a much wider range of countries, including some which, to put it mildly, are politically unstable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The plant which is the subject matter of these questions is the largest single expansion of Sellafield to date.  It will reprocess spent fuel rods from light water nuclear reactors converting them into uranium for reuse and also plutonium.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, it is not a reactor in the plant but rather a process to deal with spent fuel rods where the waste material is taken out and converted.  I take the general point that this will involve the storage and transport of plutonium in large amounts.  The reason we object in principle is precisely because of the possibility, however remote, that something may happen in the overall plant that would cause a nuclear catastrophe.  That is the reason we object to THORP in principle.</P>
      <P>The THORP plant is not a nuclear reactor plant, it serves a different purpose. However, we object to it in principle for the reasons outlined by the Deputy in addition to the fact that it involves the storage and transport of plutonium. Things have moved on the nuclear industry since this idea was first floated.  It has to be said, however, that it provides foreign revenue for the UK, and there are regional implications as well.  Those considerations are valid from their point of view but given the international dimensions to the problem we believe that a full public inquiry is necessary to ensure that everybody has a full say and is informed of what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the legal arguments, I am simply pointing out for the information of the House the difficulties in bringing forward a successful case.  It is more difficult than the layman would think.  The case taken was unsuccessful, although it seemed it would succeed and that a casual link would be established <Col N="1033" /> sufficient to satisfy the courts of the liability of the defendants.</P>
    <P>The legal option remains available to the Government at all times but we are seeking to ensure a successful outcome before taking such a case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the recent report from the British Radiological Protection Authority states that the THORP plant will increase cancer deaths from radiation by 200 for each year of its operation?  Has his Department studied that report?  Will the increase in the number of deaths have an effect also on this island?  If so, could that be the basis of a legal case with regard to the operation of the plant?  Has the Minister examined the question of transportation of the waste fuel, mainly uranium and plutonium, which will be transported across the Irish Sea to Sellafield and again transported across the sea after reprocessing.  What steps can be taken, legally or otherwise, to have that traffic stopped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department officials have studied the report to which he refers.  My officials are very up-to-date on this whole matter.  The Department's position, which reflects successive Government positions, is very strong and they have all the available information. The officials who advise me on this matter are expert in this field.</P>
      <P>The British Radiological Protection Authority report refers to deaths within the jurisdiction of the British authorities. Unfortunately a legal case could not be brought to try to impose a civil liability on BNFL in respect of notional damage as one would need a person who could show that because of negligence or otherwise he or she suffered permanent damage.  One cannot bring a case on a notional basis but only on the basis of establishing actual bodily harm in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport of nuclear products falls within the remit of the Department of the Marine.  However, we will continue at every available opportunity in international fora to point out our serious <Col N="1034" /> objections to this plant going ahead and to the transport of these materials to and from the plant.</P>
    <P>They have taken the decision within their competence but we will continue to fight the case with the same vehemence and vigour as we have done in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 10 and 11 December last accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.  Apart from attending the Council, I had the second of three meetings with Prime Minister Major in the margins.  I reported on the overall outcome of these yesterday.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Belgian Presidency, whose term of office ends on 31 December next, and which can point to a very solid record of achievement.</P>
      <P>The discussion at last weekend's European Council concentrated on the economic situation in the Union with particular reference to combating unemployment. As Taoiseach, I have placed the need for co-ordinated action to retain and create jobs at centre stage in my approach to EU affairs.</P>
      <P>The Commission's very substantial White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment received a unanimous welcome from the Heads of State and Government as &ldquo;a lucid analysis of the present economic and social situation of the Union and a reference point for future work&rdquo;.  The White Paper stated that there was no miracle cure for unemployment, but it pointed the way forward, and its policy prognosis was broadly accepted by the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the view that a joint approach will be the most effective way of implementing the White Paper, the Heads of State and Government decided on an action plan aimed at significantly reducing by the end of this century the currently unacceptable level of 17 million unemployed.  This action plan has three <Col N="1135" /> main planks which are a general framework for the policies to be pursued at member state level, to promote employment; specific accompanying measures to be conducted at community level and a follow-up procedure.</P>
    <P>The key aspect of the first plank is, the guidelines for economic policy broadly approved by the European Council and agreed by the Council of Finance Ministers on Monday last.  These guidelines encompass a stability-oriented monetary policy, low inflation, curbing excessive budget deficits, and moderate incomes growth.  This is the prescription to deliver low interest rates, thereby generating economic growth, without which we cannot achieve the required employment increases.</P>
    <P>The European Council accepted the White Paper's view that getting the economic fundamentals correct is not sufficient, and that member states must be prepared actively to pursue structural measures to help create jobs.  The Presidency conclusions sets out such measures, including improved education and training systems, greater labour market flexibility, economically sound reorganisation of work at enterprise level, targeted reductions in the indirect cost of labour, especially low-skilled work, with particular reference to statutory social contributions and better use of public funds set aside for combating unemployment through more active policies to help job-seekers.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken decisive action in a number of the areas identified in the White Paper, for example, in regard to education and training.  In other instances, the Commission's views accord closely with priorities identified in our Programme for a Partnership Government. The Government will carefully consider whether there are further policy changes that would help to improve Ireland's performance.  We are fully aware of the obstruction which structural barriers to employment creation can pose.  It is essential that the right balance be achieved between the need to foster social protection and the rights of <Col N="1136" /> employees and the need to create an environment conducive to employment creation.</P>
    <P>One further theme in the domestic framework for job creation mentioned in the White Paper and the Presidency conclusions, which warrants attention, is the notion of solidarity between those with jobs, especially those fortunate enough to have a very high degree of job security, and those without jobs.  Our conclusions rightly point out that one expression of such solidarity is to allocate part of productivity gains, on a priority basis, to investment and job creation, in particular through wage moderation.  I also welcome the recognition by the European Council that there must also be solidarity across the regions in the context of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The second plank of the strategy approved by the European Council is a series of Community measures.  The Council decided on action to fully tap the potential of the Single Market, including the creation of a better environment for small and medium sized enterprises.  In this context, the Council asked the Finance Ministers to adopt before the end of the year the system of interest rate subsidies amounting to 3 per cent for small sized enterprises decided upon at the Copenhagen and Brussels European Councils.  The Council resolved in the infrastructural sphere to speedily complete the programme of trans-European networks in the transport and energy fields and to advance infrastructures in the key sphere of information.  On funding, we agreed that the Union's main task is, by reducing financial risks, to support the decisive role of private investors. We noted that some 12 billion ECU per year both from the Community's budget and from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund are available for this purpose.  We agreed that additional funding will be provided as far as is necessary to lever the target investment and called upon the ECOFIN Council to study procedures which would enable the mobilisation of up to an additional 8 billion ECU per annum in loans for operators involved in setting up <Col N="1137" /> networks.  The European Council stressed the importance of the research framework programme for 1994-98, in areas such as information technology, with a budget not less than 12 billion ECU.</P>
    <P>These initiatives add up to a significant investment package with the potential for direct and indirect employment benefits for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The third plank of the action plan provides for direct involvement of the European Council in follow-up on the action plan adopted, with an annual stock-taking of results, starting in December 1994.</P>
    <P>This European Council placed jobs at the top of the European Union agenda, and has set out a realistic and credible plan of action.  The Government will ensure that this country will play its full part in helping to achieve the employment goal set out in the action plan. Through the boost that it together with the successful completion of the GATT negotiations will give to the European economy, it should help significantly to reduce our own unacceptable level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our meeting took place as the negotiations on the GATT Uruguay Round were reaching a conclusion.  I greatly welcome the successful conclusion of these negotiations which will certainly, over time, give a tremendous fillip to trade and economic growth internationally. Estimates of the global welfare benefits vary but they are generally in the range of $200-500 billion annually.</P>
    <P>As a country very dependent on trade, Ireland will be set to make a significant net gain.  A study commissioned from consultants estimated that the net annual gain in output to the Irish economy would be of the order of IR£1.7 billion and that the direct employment gain would be in excess of 20,000 people.  Those estimates depended on a wide range of assumptions and have to be regarded as orders of magnitude.  They were net of foreseen loses for Ireland.  The result will also be good for consumers in the long run.</P>
    <P>The consultants' assessment was based on the Dunkel draft Final Act of 1991 and the original, unmodified form of the <Col N="1138" /> Blair House Agreement on agricultural trade.  Since the estimates were made some months ago, there have been very significant amplifications of the Blair House Agreement which make the modified agreement less problematic for Ireland.  There have also been significant improvements, in other areas, on the draft Final Act.  Thus, the effects on Ireland will be considerably more favourable than the consultants' assessment.</P>
    <P>Quite significant improvements to the Blair House Agreement were secured in the course of the recent negotiations between the European Union and the US, gains which have now been multilateralised in the final GATT outcome in Geneva.  The concern about front-loading of commitments in regard to reductions in subsidised exports has been met by agreement to change the base from which the reductions are to start. The revised arrangements mean that over the full implementation period, the Union will be able to export substantial additional amounts, as compared to the unmodified Blair House Agreement. These additional amounts include 362,000 tonnes of beef, 102,000 tonnes of cheese and 44,000 tonnes of other dairy products.  Irish exporters will be able to avail of these quantities on the same basis as all other EU exporters, and it is for the Irish interests involved to secure the maximum amount of this additional business with the support of export refunds. These arrangements, coupled with a start date of 1995 for the new GATT arrangements, should also enable the Community to make significant progress in disposing of accumulated stocks.</P>
    <P>In addition, the duration of the peace clause was extended by three years, to a total of nine years; continuation of this clause will be included in the overall review of the agreement which is to commence in its fifth year.  On another important European concern, that we should be able to participate in the normal growth in world trade in agricultural products, the agreement is that the US and the Commission would consult annually.  The US also accepted the EU position on market access, something <Col N="1139" /> that is very important for Ireland, as well as other aspects of the European position. The position on South East Asia markets for beef was that the European Union can discontinue at any stage on a unilateral basis the Andriessen understanding, which excluded the European Union from those markets.  It is not and was not part of GATT.  In return for these concessions, the European Union agreed to grant only limited further US access to some agricultural products.</P>
    <P>At the European Council, we secured further important commitments on the implementation of GATT within the Union.  It had always been the Government's position that commitments in a GATT agreement should be compatible with the reformed CAP; and that implementation arrangements within the Union would have to take into account both the relative importance of agriculture in the economics of the different member states and also the Treaty provisions on economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the European Council, I put our position on these matters strongly on four separate occasions.  In the guidelines adopted by the European Council for the conclusion of the round, we took note of the Commission's prognosis that the emerging GATT agreement was compatible with the reformed CAP.  It will be several years before the actual outcome on this is clear.</P>
    <P>Our conclusions state that if additional measures were to prove necessary they should not increase the constraints of the reformed CAP, nor affect its proper operation.  It was further agreed that the Union would take the requisite steps for the application of the reform, while respecting the financial decision of the Edinburgh European Council.  Thus, there is a basis for obtaining compensation for producers, if any steps were to be taken beyond those under CAP reform.</P>
    <P>Overall, the European Union has been remarkably successful in retaining the essential elements of the Common Agricultural Policy, especially when at one stage the US was seeking a 90 per cent <Col N="1140" /> reduction in European exports benefiting from export refunds.</P>
    <P>In the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; the European Council had successful discussion in three areas.  The common factor in each case was the willingness to bring the influence of the European Union to bear in a sustained and coherent manner on the shaping of external events.</P>
    <P>First, the European Council decided to launch the diplomatic process which should lead to the adoption of a &ldquo;pact for stability&rdquo; in central and eastern Europe. This is an exercise in preventative diplomacy aimed at avoiding unstable situations which could lead to conflict in the future.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the European Council had a detailed discussion of the Bosnia negotiations which began in Geneva on 29 November.  Last Saturday's declaration from the European Council is both firm and detailed.  It considerably narrows the room for manoeuvre of the parties, and especially of the Serbs, if they hope to have their good faith accepted by the European Union.  As a further encouragement, the parties have been invited to meet the Council in Brussels on 22 December.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in relation to the Middle East, the framework for joint action agreed at the European Council is an overview of the political steps and concomitant economic measures to be taken in support of the Middle East peace process.  I indicated to the chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, this morning that we would strongly support, through the European Union and bilaterally, aid and other measures necessary to underpin the stability of the new arrangements for the Palestinian people arising from the accords with Israel.</P>
    <P>There was also discussion at the Council on the place of the applicant states in the institutions and my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Kitt, will deal with this aspect in his reply.</P>
    <P>My assessment of the meeting is in line with a very widespread reaction in the media across Europe, that it was a workmanlike <Col N="1141" /> Summit that set out a worth-while programme of action that with the major bonus of a GATT agreement, should provide a major injection of confidence into the world and European economies, with consequent benefit for all, starting in 1994.  For Ireland and its people, it has, therefore, been a good week's work, in the economic, as in the political, sphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the National Development Plan?  As the Taoiseach is aware, the new Structural and Cohesion Funds come into effect on 1 January 1994, and to my knowledge our plan has not yet been approved.  When does the Taoiseach expect the plan to be approved?</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of queries in regard to whether our plan complies with the EU rules laid down for such a plan. The Union's regulation of 20 July in regard to the principle of additionality states that the proposed EU expenditure may not replace public expenditure on structural or comparable expenditure and that the member state should provide relevant financial information to the Commission at the time of the submission of its plan to show that is the case.  The Government's plan does not contain anything to show it complies with that EU regulation.  Furthermore, I am concerned that it does not comply with the rules set down by the Community in regard to money spent by the European Social Fund on human resources.</P>
      <P>In Article 4 of the relevant regulations it is stated that in the plan the Irish Government must supply figures concerning imbalances between demand and supply in employment, including female employment, the nature and characteristics of unfilled vacancies, employment opportunities which exist on labour markets, the types of measures to be implemented and so on.  I read the relevant part of the Irish plan as submitted to Brussels and it does not comply with those regulations.  It does not contain such detailed figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided to include provision for the building of a hospital in its plan.  The relevant regulation of 24 <Col N="1142" /> June 1988 states that investment under Objective 1 must contribute to increasing economic development or structural adjustment of the region concerned.  I understand that the Government's inclusion of the building of a hospital in its plan has been queried by the EU.  I understand also that there is a query in regard to the procedures the Government proposes to adopt in regard to environmental protection and its various investments in that regard.  Therefore, to my knowledge there are at least four main areas under which the plan is being questioned.  First, it has not supplied the necessary figures to prove additionality; second, it has not complied with the regulations in regard to the operation of the labour market; third, it has not complied with the environmental regulations and, fourth, the inclusion of a hospital is being questioned.  I want to know if that is true and whether the plan will be revised.  If the plan has to be revised it will involve another launch, Dáil debate, and press conference in Dublin Castle.  If this is not the real plan we wasted a great deal of time in this House.  Is this the real plan, will it be approved and will we receive the £7.2 million, or less?  I understand there is a doubt about the figure of £7.2 million at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Summit communiqué states that the rules on competition and control of State aid must be applied vigorously.  I am particularly concerned that is not happening and that Ireland is losing out as a result.  There is no way we, through the IDA, can compete with what the Germans can offer in an industrial location in North Rhine Westphalia or Hamburg or with what the Dutch or British can offer in regard to various areas, because they have more financial resources than we have.  It is vital that the rules are properly enforced to prevent over-bidding of poor countries by rich countries in regard to industrial investment.  That is not happening at present and declarations such as those contained in the Summit communiqué have been adopted many times before with no effect.  I would like assurances from the Minister of State <Col N="1143" /> who will reply to the debate that this time it will be different.</P>
    <P>I was very enthusiastic about President Delors' proposals for major infrastructural investments and I regret the Summit did not agree to give him the right to issue European bonds to finance that.  It is regrettable the Commission is not being put in the driving seat in regard to such major trans-European networks and that it will be left to the member states to apply to the European Investment Bank on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for funding for individual projects.  That is not good enough.  For example, less than half the money agreed at the Edinburgh Summit one year ago has been taken up and I am concerned the same will happen in this case.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also at the Community's response at the Summit to the drugs threat and crime problem on a worldwide basis.  There is a proposal to set up a Europol drugs unit and we are told there will be a comprehensive anti-drugs strategy with the possibility of renewing the existing tariff preferences for Andean countries.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem and the ensuing violence is posing a major threat to European civilisation.  The Loyalist terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland are already heavily involved in the drugs trade and if the IRA continues its campaign &mdash; please God, it will not &mdash; I have no doubt that it will get involved in the drugs business also to finance its operations. Drugs are at the heart of violence in Europe.  Yet, even though there is a crying need for action, this issue is not being addressed by the European Union on a European basis, rather it is being dealt with under the token part of the Maastricht Treaty relating to intergovernmental action under which Governments can agree to declarations and do little about it.  Responsibility in the war against drugs should be transferred from departments with responsibility for home affairs and given to the Commission to deal with the issue on a federal basis and ensure action is taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> There is no better example of the ineffectiveness of the intergovernmental approach to justice matters than the record on asylum policy.  The Government is breaking EU law by failing to enact legislation dealing with refugee protection.  This is causing acute embarrassment for our Commissioner, Mr. Flynn.  He has told me he is embarrassed by the fact that the one Government not acting in this area is the Government of the country which he formerly represented, namely, Ireland.  The fact that we are so far behind in implementing legal changes in this area shows that in the justice area one cannot leave the matter to member governments.</P>
    <P>The same could be said about money laundering.  In recent times the Minister for Justice trumpeted that she was dealing with this problem as part of her campaign to tackle the crime problem but she failed to point out to the House that we have been in breach of European law for the past two years for not implementing this legislation.  Despite the fact that we are two years late we are taking the credit for implementing that legislation just as eventually we will probably take the credit for making provision for refugee protection three or four years late.  This shows that national civil services do not work.  On the issues of refugee protection and money laundering our Civil Service and Government did not work.  It is essential therefore that responsibility for dealing with the drugs problem should be transferred to the European Commission to be dealt with on a Community basis under the first pillar of the Treaty, not the second.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the stability pact to be implemented under the heading, foreign and security area &mdash; the so-called Balladur pact.  Eastern European countries are not happy with this; they see it as a sop in keeping them out of NATO. Europe does not want them; it does not want their imports of fruit and food, rather it wants to give them some money to keep them quiet.  It does not want to include them in any security arrangements under which they would have real guarantees.  They are not going to be <Col N="1145" /> admitted into NATO and, in turn, the Balladur pact is being thrown at them as a sop.</P>
    <P>This so-called stability pact will not be underpinned by any institutional arrangements.  It will duplicate the work done by the CSCE, the Council of Europe, NATO and the Western European Union.  It will be a new body but without the ability to do anything about any problem.  Essentially, what the countries in Eastern Europe are being told is that we will do just as much about any problems they may have, particularly in Russia now that it is more of a worry as a result of the new political landscape following the recent elections, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, as we did in the case of Bosnia which was not much.  The Balladur pact is a sop; it will be a big meeting to be held in Paris where all the meetings which lead to little take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is about it, it has a soporific atmosphere.  The people from Eastern Europe will hear many speeches but will be given precious little assistance to deal with a threatening situation.  The right in Russia is, apparently, in communication with the right in Germany and both are in the ascendant while Poland feels extremely threatened.  What is Europe offering them?  Europe is offering the Balladur pact which amounts to nothing.  Europe is not as safe a place as we might like to think and I do not think this Summit represented an adequate response.</P>
      <P>We should not console ourselves by saying, &ldquo;well, it could never happen&rdquo;; some things have happened which no Member expected.  I remember objecting to a trade deal with Russia in this House when I raised the question of Latvia and Lithuania and a Member now present made fun of it &mdash; those places did not count, they do now.  Things can change and we should not assume that they necessarily change for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the provisions relating to agriculture.  In his speech the Taoiseach mentioned compensation for <Col N="1146" /> farmers for the losses which have definitely accrued as a result of the GATT deal.  The relevant addendum to the minutes of the Council, which I read, states:</P>
    <P>If, however, additional measures were to prove necessary the Council agrees that they should not increase the constraints of the reformed CAP nor affect its proper operation.</P>
    <P>There is no indication of any commitment to provide additional money.  So far as I am aware, there is no room for additional expenditure on compensation for farmers. It is obvious that the Taoiseach who may have tried to secure such a commitment in Brussels failed because there is no indication of any firm commitment to provide compensation in the Summit declaration.  The time to secure this was before the deal was struck when the Taoiseach was in Brussels.  I am afraid that it is now too late and this will prove to be a major disappointment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the commitments that the European Union gave in Rio de Janeiro in regard to the environment. It seems that the proposed carbon tax is dead in the water and going nowhere with the result that Europe will be unable to fulfil the commitments it gave in Rio de Janeiro in regard to global warming.  It seems that Europe's leaders have no replacement strategy in mind in regard to the commitments given at Rio de Janeiro in relation to the environment now that the carbon tax seems to be going nowhere.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Government's shabby performance in regard to the regional committee established under the Maastricht Treaty.  The fact that we could appoint nine people to this body when we do not even have regional bodies from which to appoint them indicates that we want to send nine extra politicians on the expenses trail to Brussels where they are not representing anyone or, indeed, any entity.  Neither do they have any commitment to regional development in Ireland.  This reflects anxiety to send a few more Fianna Fáil and Labour Party politicians on frequent <Col N="1147" /> trips to Brussels so that they can draw their expenses and enjoy a few good meals.</P>
    <P>The significance is obvious when we see that four members of Fianna Fáil, three members of the Labour Party and one member of Fine Gael have been selected.  Not one member of the Progressive Democrats or the Democratic Left&mdash;</P>

I will quote from it: &ldquo;Between 1970 and 1992 the US economy grew in real terms by 70 per cent, somewhat less then the Community's growth of 81 per cent.  Yet employment in the US rose by 49 per cent compared with only 9 per cent in the European Community&rdquo;.  That is the crucial conundrum, the crucial question that this weighty tome poses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have almost come to a conclusion.  This White Paper, long as it is, does not explain why the performance of Europe is so bad.  It does not analyse it properly and does not come up with answers.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another matter that was dealt with in the Summit, that is, the situation in the Middle East.  I have had the opportunity of meeting Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation today, as have other Members of the House, and there are three things he is concerned about that were not dealt with at the Summit.  First, Israel appears to be revising understandings in regard to the boundaries of Jericho which is the proposed Palestinian State.  They are also proposing essentially to retain the principle of &ldquo;hot pursuit&rdquo; into the Palestine-controlled area.  We certainly would not accept hot pursuit by British troops into this State from Northern Ireland and I do not see why the Palestinians should accept it any more than we would.  Finally, the entries to the area are to be controlled not by Palestine but by Israel rather than an international force of any kind.  I hope those three issues will be dealt with more adequately at European level and that the Minister will be able to give us some assurances on these points when he is concluding.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this Summit has measured up to expectations and the main reason is that the Maastricht Treaty is wholly inadequate.  It is not adequately federal; it does not provide federal methods for dealing with the three issues people want dealt with in Europe &mdash; unemployment, drugs and crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December was attended by Ireland, and the report given to this House by the Taoiseach is a testimony to the poor performance of the <Col N="1149" /> Irish Government on issues of central importance at that Council meeting.  It is, of course, welcome that the European Community should address itself collectively to the issue of unemployment and that in the White Paper there was some evaluation by the European Union of its failure in creating jobs in the last decade or so.  That apart, merely talking about or issuing papers on the question of unemployment will not suffice.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's approach to reporting to this House what happened at that Summit is complacent, smug and completely inadequate, bearing in mind this country's particular problems in relation to unemployment.  I need not point out to this House that we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union and that this Government has done nothing substantial to counter that except fiddle at the margins in relation to the definition of unemployment and use social welfare changes and the like to deflate figures artificially and manipulate statistics with a view to preventing an explosion from being perceived by the public.</P>
      <P>If things go on as they are over the period of the National Economic Plan, and if emigration does not provide a safety valve for our economy, the unemployment rate will up towards 400,000. That is a fact, and there is nothing in the activities of this Government which indicates any willingness to confront the issue.  It is a sad irony that the Taoiseach should report to this House on the unemployment proposals of the European Union and ignore what the Council meeting decided ought to be done at national level about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth decision in principle as to a method and a strategy for tackling unemployment on a national level was to deal with the tax wedge.  In Euro-speak, targeted reductions in the indirect cost of labour's statutory contributions and particularly of less skilled work in order to achieve a better balance between the costs of the production factors, fiscal measures possibly relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to the environment, could be one of the means of offsetting a drop in social contributions <Col N="1150" /> within a general context of stabilising all statutory contributions and reducing the tax burden.</P>
    <P>That is the most important central issue as far as this economy is concerned.  Let us put on the record yet again, because it always has to be repeated to the Labour Party in particular and to Fianna Fáil, that since they came into Government they have increased the tax wedge, despite the fact that they are paying lip service to the Culliton report analysis that the tax wedge is the single greatest area for potential improvement in employment in this country.  The Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition, in its first budget, increased taxes on work.</P>
    <P>The effect of the 1 per cent income levy was effectively to drive up the lowest rate of taxation by 2 percentage points, from 27 per cent to 29 per cent in real terms.  This was deliberately done by a Government of all the talents, this new broom that was to sweep clean.  This was done by the group of dewy-eyed idealists who met in the National Concert Hall and told us that a new era was at hand. What did the Labour Party do with its first grasp of the levers of power in this community?  It slapped taxes on work and drove the tax wedge further into the heart of the economy.  That is what the Labour Party did.  That is what this Government stands for.  Now we have pathetic bleating from the Minister for Finance that he cannot afford to undo the damage he did in his last budget.</P>
    <P>What is all this expenditure aimed at? It is not aimed at the little frills of wasteful public expenditure that we have seen.  It is aimed at creating a ramp of tax-and-spend policies which is designed to sustain Fianna Fáil and Labour popularity in the country.  We have suffered enough high taxation on work.  This country has been told by every independent body that has ever examined it from outside, and by every independent body that exists inside, that if we do not tackle the tax wedge we can kiss goodbye to even approaching any kind of solution to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The European Union Council has a meeting on the subject and it <Col N="1151" /> determines that national measures must be taken to tackle unemployment.  But the Taoiseach comes back in a waft of euphoria because of what he has done in London.  He comes before this House and does not even mention his own national and governmental responsibility in relation to unemployment.  The time has come to stop accepting Government waffle about unemployment.  If the Government is concerned with unemployment and really does believe that the tax wedge is the problem, let us see some action in the next budget.  If this budget does not begin a radical transformation of a pro-employment pro-jobs kind in our tax system then the measure of this Government and the extent of its failure will be apparent for all to see.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to draw some preliminary conclusions about the tendencies of this Government.  This Government is one for optics and PR trickery, but when it comes to the basic fundamentals on which we have been expertly advised, both externally and internally, as to what we must do to tackle the root causes of unemployment in the economy, we find that this Government not merely has done nothing but has actively worsened the situation.  I do not apologise to anybody for dealing with employment in terms critical of national measures here because the European Council zeroed in on the national measures that must be taken.</P>
    <P>I have to part company with Deputy Bruton on the proposal that the European Union should develop a competence in borrowing money and spending it on major infrastructural products in order to boost employment. The convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty in relation to a single European currency and the restrictions placed on national borrowing in that context should not be exchanged by the European Union for Keynesianism on a global basis.  Our experience is that the European Union is a poor evaluator of investment projects and that, at Commission level, it is not in a position to get good value for money or a good return on <Col N="1152" /> investment.  Some kind of new competence in borrowing and Keynesian economic intervention by the European Union is not the answer to our problems. We have seen on a nation by nation basis the folly of that policy and doing the same things collectively will not prove to be any more efficient in delivering jobs.  It will be less efficient.  I beg to differ with the analysis of Deputy Bruton in relation to that.  Borrowing on a Commission level will not help us in the slightest.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton about the European drugs issue.  The EUROPOL initiative is completely inadequate to deal with the problem which Europe is now experiencing in relation to crime, organised crime and the drugs problem.  The time has come for this country to take an initiative in that regard.  Recently, the seaways off our coast have been used to bring drugs into this country and, thereafter, into other EU member states. Ireland should propose, at international level, the establishment of the equivalent of the US coastguard by a European agency and we should be willing to participate in and provide bases for such a service.  I am sure the Irish people would accept this.  We should take an initiative and propose at European level that the equivalent of a coastguard service should be established on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of the European Union and this country should indicate its willingness to play a full part.  There would be spin-offs in terms of employment and training of young Irish men and women to participate in such a service.  The time has come for the Government to take an initiative on that front rather than hoping that an agency such as EUROPOL will deal with the drugs problem.  It is evident that what is happening off our coasts is as a result of a vacuum in security for which we are partially to blame.  If it were not for the vigilance of a French trawler captain the largest catch of drugs that has ever been seized in European waters would have gone unreported and would probably have been imported later into the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Summit on which the Taoiseach reported to the House was one in regard <Col N="1153" /> to which there was a good deal of talk, but little decisive action was taken.  It is welcome that the employment issue was discussed.  It is better that it should be talked about than that it should be the matter of a respectful silence.  In order to match the performance of the European economy with the American economy the fundamentals which stand in the way of employment creation within the European Union must be addressed. How could we talk about labour market flexibility when last week this House passed a Bill placing on employers, irrespective of their size, yet another bureaucratic requirement to furnish employees with statutory information?  How will that requirement work in a factory or workshop employing five to ten people?  It is an additional layer of bureaucracy which is not designed to bring about labour market flexibility.  It is designed to make the activity of employment all the more difficult.  It is time that we began to look to freeing up labour practices, as the Union's communiqué suggests, there is no willingness on the part of the Government to tackle inflexibilities and obstacles to mobility in our labour market.  The Government is committed, wherever possible, to driving up the tax wedge.  The thrust of the Government's policy is in direct contravention of the recommendations made for action at national level by the Union members states.  The Taoiseach's speech was effectively an annotated set of minutes of a Council meeting which any Member who was slightly interested would have found more concisely covered in the Presidency Conclusions which have been published and circulated, even though they are in &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; and the Taoiseach's speech is in &ldquo;Taoiseach-speak&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been said in this House which gives any Member any basis to trust or hope that this Government has finally decided to face the unemployment issue.  The issue does not relate only to the tax wedge.  There are three parts to the drive against unemployment.  First, is the issue of tax, social insurance and the poverty trap and second, the issue of the remainder of the Culliton agenda which <Col N="1154" /> relates to the thrust of industrial policy and freeing up the current obstacles to economic growth here.  Very little has happened in regard to those issues. Third, unemployment must be dealt with in a manner which is radical and inclusive.</P>
    <P>We must forget about the idea of economic exclusion of those for whom the market fails.  We must replace unemployment exclusion by a system of community employment for those who are in long-term unemployment.  From a number of points of view it is essential to have an inclusive response to the unemployment problem which has now grown to its present proportions.  It is essential to say to people whom the market has failed that the State will assist them in participating in the economy rather than compensate them on a human set-aside basis for being excluded.  People in the suburbs of this city are faced with massive poverty traps which do not make it worth while for a person who is married with four children to take a job at less than the average industrial wage.  We must give those people an opportunity to participate in the economic life of the country for a number of days each week and complement their earnings by allowing them the liberty to work in their free time.</P>
    <P>I do not condemn anybody who, trapped on present welfare levels, does something in his or her free time to crawl out of the trap, even if it is a technical breach of social welfare regulations. Somebody who is in that position must do something to help themselves.  I make no moral judgement on them but I make a firm and stern moral judgement about a Government such as ours that promised so much so recently and has done everything possible to implement policies opposite to the political goals it has set itself.  The Taoiseach's account from the report from the European Council meeting in Brussels is a monument to smugness and complacency and is something which this House should firmly reject.</P>

      <P>The European Summit in Brussels was billed as a jobs <Col N="1155" /> summit.  Employment, we were told, was to be top of the agenda.  Delor's White Paper, so eagerly awaited, would point us on a new path; the European Union was determined to create 15 million new jobs by the end of the century; things were about to change; the socially excluded would be brought in from the margins.  The high hopes culminated in a fudge; a missed opportunity wrapped in the familiar Eurocratic jargon which says little and means less.  Seventeen million people queueing for a living throughout the European Union were once again left wondering when their turn would come.</P>
      <P>In the final commmuniqué, the statement of 15 million new jobs to be created by the end of the century was replaced by a mere aspiration to provide employment for &ldquo;most of the 17 million unemployed in the Community&rdquo;, an unobjectionable aspiration, but one which gives little hope to those likely to lose their jobs next year or the year after, or to European schoolleavers entering the labour market.</P>
      <P>Jacques Delors has predicted that 30 million Europeans may be unemployed by the end of the decade.  A mere aspiration to provide employment for most of those currently out of work gives little hope to our young people whose increasing apathy and cynicism is manifesting itself in political extremism and social instability throughout the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Copenhagen Summit in June Jacques Delors produced some radical and far-reaching proposals which, while not perfect, would have helped inject a much-need shift of emphasis into our economy.  At Copenhagen Delors proposed a fundamental tax reform, shifting the tax burden away from labour to taxes on energy, natural resources and consumption. My party has long demanded such a fundamental shift, arguing that only by reducing taxes on labour and increasing taxes on pollutants, energy, non-renewable resources and the profits of consumption can we hope to preserve the environment and create sustainable economic growth and jobs.  The proposals put forward in draft form at Copenhagen deserved serious consideration, <Col N="1156" /> but Jacques Delors was beaten by the combined forces of political apathy and neo-liberal orthodoxy, the latter ably represented by John Major and his Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>While lip-service was paid to the needs of the environment &mdash; are we not all green nowadays?  &mdash; the final communiqué omitted any mention of a CO2 tax, confining themselves to mentioning the Objectives of the Rio Convention. As Deputy Bruton pointed out, unless we deal with the question of CO2 tax the objectives of the Rio Convention will not be met.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, although Jacques Delors proposals have been considerably watered down, I welcome some of the conclusions emerging from this Summit. The so-called Eurobonds, if properly used by member countries, could have a positive impact on job creation.  European funding is only as good as the policies of the countries concerned, and the Irish experience in this regard has not been a happy one.  I would welcome a statement from the Minister for Finance as to whether he intends to draw on the Eurobonds, and what projects he envisages financing from this source.</P>
    <P>In Copenhagen Jacques Delors emphasised the need for an efficient, ambitious and well-targeted research programme, properly funded at both national and Union level, and I am delighted that this proposal made its way into the Brussels Summit conclusions relatively unscathed.  The research programme from 1994 to 1998 is to be funded by a minimum budget of 12 billion ECU. The potential benefits to Ireland of this programme are enormous, and I hope the Government will do everything in its power to strengthen our research and development programme which has been sadly underfunded to date.  We have just recently seen the concrete benefits of science and technology parks such as that at Plassey; the programme announced last weekend provides the potential for more such initiatives.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted to see the importance attached to the role of small and medium enterprises, and the establishment <Col N="1157" /> of an interest rate subsidy system of SMEs.  I hope the Government will reflect these measures in its own policies: small businesses rooted in the community are vital to our economy and to job creation, and they deserve more attention than they have received.</P>
    <P>I am, however, especially worried about some of the Summit's conclusions regarding the labour market.  References to improving flexibility within enterprises and on the labour market by removing excessive rigidities resulting from regulation are hardly reassuring for Europeans who already see their social protection under threat.  A de-regulated labour market generally equates with low pay and a minimum of social protection, hardly a recipe for either a healthy economy or a healthy society.</P>
    <P>When reading the Presidency conclusions, I was reminded of much of the verbiage in our national plan.  The information, motivation and guidance of job-seekers has a nice ring to it, but is of little use when there are no jobs at the end of it.  Training, emphasised in the Summit proposals, is both economically necessary and socially desirable, but all too often ends in schemes which are a poor substitute for real, sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>With unemployment across the Union predicted to reach 20 million next year, and up to 30 million by the end of the decade, it remains to be seen whether the decisions taken at the summit will result in the necessary job creation.  I fear that the end result will be one of containment or, to use the odious phrase, maintaining unemployment at an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>Our economic fortunes, both nationally and at European level, are closely tied up with the monetary policies pursued by the Union, and in this context I was surprised to read in the Presidency conclusions that, &ldquo;the European Council note with satisfaction that all the conditions are fulfilled to allow the second stage of European Monetary Union to start effectively on the agreed date, i.e. 1 January 1994.&rdquo; What of the currency crises and near crises experienced during <Col N="1158" /> the past 18 months?  It seems they have been airbrushed out of the EU's collective memory, and with them the need for regulation and controls on the money markets.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has argued for the introduction of a transaction tax to inject some element of risk into the profitable business of currency speculation.  This concept is gaining wide support throughout the Union, one which could profitably be considered by the Council and one which should be promoted by the Government given that we were one of the victims of this horrendous crime in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>While the economy took centre stage last weekend, there were a number of side shows, some played out in the glare of publicity, such as the GATT negotiations. With regard to GATT, Democratic Left welcomes the declaration that any compensation for the loss of farm export subsidies would not be permitted to exceed the ceiling placed on the CAP budget.  European taxpayers and consumers are already weighed down by agricultural expenditure and subsidy, and we cannot afford any watering down of the hard-won CAP reforms.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has supported the conclusion of a world trade deal, and we believe that the agricultural element of the deal will in the long term benefit the Irish agricultural and food industry sectors, leading to diversification and a more market-oriented production.  The shadow boxing which occupied the national airwaves over the past months largely ignored the real benefits of GATT as well as the real dangers.</P>
    <P>The national discourse on GATT concentrated on the agricultural element to the exclusion of other aspects equally vital to our economic interests.  In particular, the textiles element could have adverse consequences for that sector.  It was therefore amazing to note that, while our Government scrambled onto the French bandwagon with regard to farm export subsidies, we did not follow the Italian lead in pressing equally vocifereously for a modification of the textiles element.  Of course, as was evident <Col N="1159" /> at the time of the VAT hike, the textiles industry does not constitute nearly as powerful a lobby as farming interests.</P>
    <P>The debate on GATT was largely uniformed, which is no surprise, since the Government chose not to publish the vital Fitzpatrick report at the time, despite repeated demands from many quarters, including Democratic Left. Strangely, it appeared in this morning's post to all Deputies the day after the GATT was signed.</P>

      <P>Extraordinarly useful.  No less important than GATT were the discussions and resulting conclusions in the areas of justice and home affairs.  I welcome certain steps, such as the immediate start-up of the EUROPAL Drugs Unit and &mdash; I accept the comments of other Opposition spokespersons that it is anything but adequate, but nevertheless it is an advance &mdash; and the application of a comprehensive anti-drugs policy.  Increased European co-operation to combat drug-trafficking is vital if we are to apprehend the packages of death; the hard drugs being continually unloaded at our ports and airports.</P>
      <P>In this context also I welcome the statement that the Council will consider the possibility of renewing the existing tariff preferences for Andean countries and I urge the Government to push for such a renewal.  The drug problem is, after all, rooted in economics at both ends, the poverty of the small peasant producer and the poverty of the addicts, both richly rewarding the middleman.</P>
      <P>However, I have serious reservations about the application of common policies in regard to asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.  There is a thirteenth member of the European Union who had no seat at the table last weekend.  That thirteenth member is made up of those countries which did not acquire that much vaunted European citizenship on 1 November.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  As I was saying, the right to asylum, a basic right which defines civilised society, is under threat throughout the European Union.  Some countries such as Germany have recently adopted draconian new asylum laws which are likely to send thousands of refugees back to their homelands to face an uncertain future, or indeed no future at all.  Of course we in Ireland have yet to see the asylum legislation promised by our Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the Bosnian conflict.  The European Union's declaration on the former Yugoslavia gives little hope to those facing another winter of discontent, hunger and death in that troubled region.  While I welcome the European Union's determination to ensure the convoying of aid, the people of the former Yugoslavia demand and deserve more than mere palliative measures &mdash; they deserve the wholehearted <Col N="1161" /> political commitment of the Union, a commitment which should go beyond mere pious aspirations and which must realise that centuries old ethnic conflicts will not be resolved by simply imposing an ever tighter ring of sanctions.</P>
    <P>At this stage I believe the arms embargo must remain, but it must be accompanied by protective and innovative initiatives to find a political solution to the conflict, a solution which reconciles different aspirations and which at all costs must avoid legitimising the acquisition of territory through force. Nearly 50 years after the Second World War ended the European Union cannot afford to endorse such a dangerous precedent. It is becoming clear that there are increasing tensions between European Union Foreign Ministers and Lord Owen to the point where a press conference due to be held by Lord Owen at the Summit, was, I understand, abruptly cancelled.  I would have serious reservations regarding Lord Owen's approach to the conflict.  It is vital that a mediator be seen as impartial by all parties concerned, and this is clearly not the case.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a commitment by the European Union to take more refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Although we have taken some refugees, our record in that regard is abysmal.  A few months ago members of the Union indulged in an undignified scramble to take medical refugees when their plight was highlighted by the television cameras. However, ordinary refugees, those individuals whose mundane fate does not make exciting copy, have been forgotten by the media and governments.</P>
    <P>Since the precipitated recognition of Croatia, the European Union's handling of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has been marked by ineptitude and bungling. Too little, too late has been the unspoken motto.  The declaration appended to the Summit conclusions gives little cause for optimism.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach <Col N="1162" /> has given a detailed outline of the main issues which were considered at the European Council and I will concentrate on a small number of particular points which need to be stressed and which also relate to some of the points made by the Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the meeting was satisfactory. The European Union is putting behind it the difficulties which had affected it since the first Danish referendum during the summer of last year. In recent months we have made progress in a number of important areas.  The Maastricht Treaty has finally come into force and we can now start to implement its provisions.  The GATT round has been completed, with all that this implies for the revival of confidence in the world economy.  The negotiations to enlarge the European Union have entered their final stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask why the Minister has come into the House with a prepared script rather than replying to the points made during the debate?  He is not treating the House with respect by coming in with a prescripted document which was obviously written three or four hours before the debate even began.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not treating the House or the Opposition spokespersons with the respect they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Deputy and other speakers had to say and I can assure them that I will reply to the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, the negotiations to enlarge the European Union have entered their final stage and the member states have made a commitment to have them completed by March.  Finally, we have recognised the vocation for membership of the Union of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, thus helping <Col N="1163" /> to underpin their reform programmes and contributing to security in a region whose stability is vital to the Union.  I am under no illusions as to the most fragile nature of this return of confidence.  Difficult issues remain to be resolved in the enlargement dossier.</P>
    <P>All of the Deputies referred to unemployment. It is most important that the Union shows its capacity to deal with the most challenging task facing it at present, that is, the vital necessity to deal with the problem of unemployment.  As the Taoiseach reported to the House, the European Council made a start in addressing this issue.  The success of the Union's policies will be judged on its capacity to alleviate the misery caused by growing unemployment.  The fact that last weekend's meeting devoted most of its deliberations to the issue of unemployment is a sign that it is being seriously addresed at European level.</P>
    <P>I would now like to make some specific comments on three aspects of the Council's deliberations, some of which impinge on the points made by the Deputies opposite.  I will come back to the detailed questions raised by Deputy Bruton in regard to the National Development Plan.  I would like to deal first with the Common Foreign and Security Policy, referred to by some Deputies.  The Taoiseach touched on this subject and I would like to elaborate on the Council's conclusions in this regard for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <P>The full text of the conclusions has, of course, been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  One of the major consequences of the coming into effect of the Treaty on European Union is the replacement of traditional European Political Co-operation by the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The CFSP involves a number of institutional and administrative changes aimed at a more effective presence by the European Union at international level, not as an end in itself but in the interests of our citizens and of the international community in general.  I am glad to report that the European Council had successful <Col N="1164" /> discussions in three areas covered by the CFSP.</P>
    <P>I will refer first to the pact for stability. I find it strange that Deputy Bruton should be so critical of a pact which has not yet commenced.  The Deputy should at least give this pact a chance to see how it operates.  I can assure the House that the European Union takes this matter very seriously.  It decided to launch the diplomatic process which should lead to the adoption of what is being called a &ldquo;pact for stability&rdquo; in Central and Eastern Europe.  As the Taoiseach indicated, this is an exercise in preventive diplomacy, aimed at avoiding unstable situations which could lead to conflict in the future.  With the active support of a wide range of third countries, as well as of the CSCE and relevant international organisations, a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe will be encouraged to overcome potential problems related primarily to minorities and borders. Formal joint action under the new Treaty providing for the conference to open in April is likely to be adopted by the General Affairs Council on Monday next.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council had a detailed discussion on the Bosnian negotiations which began in Geneva on 29 November.  Following the meeting between Foreign Ministers and the contending parties, the Council adopted a declaration on Bosnia and invited the parties to meet the EU Foreign Ministers again on 22 December next.  One of the <Col N="1165" /> major concerns of the Bosnian Government is to obtain credible assurances regarding the effective implementation of a peace settlement.  It seeks in particular an expanded role for NATO which is already involved in implementing UN sanctions policy in the Adriatic. The declaration adopted by the Union at last weekend's summit makes it clear that the implementation of a settlement which might involve NATO should take place under the authority of the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>In essence, what is now at stake in Bosnia is the avoidance of a humanitarian disaster.  Differences between the parties are narrowing.  Apart from the plan on the table, there is no other realistic option of peace.  There is the strongest onus on the parties in the former Yugoslavia to end the agony now.</P>
      <P>Two issues I have already mentioned, the European Stability Pact and former Yugoslavia, concern the European Union's neighbours in central and eastern Europe.  The European Council also addressed another neighbouring region where peace, stability and progress will serve the basic interests of the Union.  I refer to the Middle East.  The framework for joint action agreed at the European Council is an overview of political steps and other economic measures to be taken in support of the Middle East peace process. The Taoiseach, of course, has already referred in this context to his meeting today with Mr. Yasser Arafat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Union issued separately a declaration on human rights, a copy of which I have arranged to be placed in the Dáil Library today. Ireland was one of the strong supporters of this initiative.  We believe that in this year of the Vienna Conference it is important to underline respect for human rights.  International involvement in ensuring such protection is at the core of our efforts for stability and progress at international level.  In this connection, I welcome the likelihood of a decision at the UN early next week to establish a new post of High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Tánaiste called for this at the Vienna Conference and Ireland worked <Col N="1166" /> hard for it at the current session of the General Assembly.  The second area on which I wish to comment is the GATT which was widely referred to in the course of the contributions opposite.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated the advantages which a GATT agreement will bring to our economy and he has set out in detail the approach which Ireland adopted during the European Council discussions.  I would like to focus on one aspect &mdash; the implications of the GATT for the Common Agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>The farming organisations and some Opposition spokesmen on agriculture have not welcomed the agreement and I suppose this reaction was predictable. However, I would urge them to consider what would happen if the talks between the European Union and the United States had failed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Disciplines on the world market would have broken down at <Col N="1167" /> immense and ultimately unbearable cost to the European Union's budget.  Thus the financing of the whole network of support which underpins the industry would have been at risk.  Furthermore, as we saw from the dispute with the US on oilseeds, a conflict might well have involved retaliation, not just against primary products, but also against foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Ireland would not have escaped retaliation.  I have no doubt that the European Union should maintain a strong position in international trade and be robust in defending its interests but in undertaking such a defence we need to be realistic and strategic to ensure that action that might appear <i>prima facie</i> to be justified in one area does not rebound on us with disastrous results elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Blair House agreement, as amended and improved, does not, of course, meet the ideal which some seem to seek &mdash; open-ended and limitless support for agriculture production.  That ideal, if it ever existed, has faded away over the last ten years.  This is, however, a regrettable and inevitable process.  No system which involves the accumulation of huge surpluses &mdash; to be dumped on third markets, often with the side effect of damaging the poorest countries &mdash; could survive indefinitely.</P>
      <P>What is to take place over a period of years is a controlled reform of the CAP which reserves the essentials of the policy &mdash; as the Taoiseach has already made clear.  The CAP, which is vital to Irish agriculture, will now be in a better shape to cope with the changed circumstances on the world market and on the European market.  Surely it is better that we have the guarantee for continuity and protection for income and price support schemes than the real threat of constant trade wars, the draining away of budgetary support for the CAP and is ultimate collapse.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first point made by Deputy Bruton regarding the National Plan, following submission of the plan the proposals are being discussed with the EU Commission with a view to agreeing a Union support framework and a wide range of issues are being discussed with officials in this context.  The EC Commission has not yet given us a formal reaction on any of the planned proposals and it is mischievous to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised a number of points.  In regard to additionality, the plan shows clearly that planned public structural expenditure will be maintained at least at the 1993 level, thus fulfilling additionality requirements.  He mentioned also the environmental requirements and they have been fully complied with in a separate chapter entitled &ldquo;Environmental Situation on the Plan&rdquo;. The chapter on human resources is set in the context of the training and education needs of the Irish labour market.  Deputy Bruton also referred to the hospital infrastructure. This is a new element but the Deputy is wrong to suggest that it is ineligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other points were made in relation <Col N="1169" /> to the drugs issue and the question of asylum.  The European Council initiatives on justice and home affairs will specifically deal with the problems of crime, including drugs.  On the question of asylum, the Department of Justice has stated that it expects early action on this front.  On the question of union bonds, that issue is not closed.  This matter has been referred to ECOFIN and new sources of funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The whole question of Sellafield was raised and there was a discussion on that topic for almost an hour before this debate.

      <P>As the House will be aware, the annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>The 1993 Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule the sum of £8,789,118,010.  This comprises the original Estimates of £8,548,119,000 set out in the revised post-budget Book of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates totalling £240,999,000.</P>
      <P>Following the normal practice, the Bill also approves the use of certain departmental receipts, amounting to £1,006,586,000 &mdash; as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This year's Bill also covers an Excess Vote relating to 1991.  The minor excess of £10 on the Vote for the State Laboratory arose from a miscalculation of PRSI liabilities.  Following established practice, the Committee of Public Accounts has examined this Excess Vote and has no objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from authorising the Estimates and any Excess Votes, the Appropriation Bill also has another essential purpose. It provides a statutory basis for the calculation of the issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the <Col N="1178" /> Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of the following year's services before the Dáil has an opportunity to approve the Estimates for that year. Accordingly, the Appropriation Bill must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year to allow the provisions of the 1965 Act to come into effect.</P>
    <P>As we are approaching the end of the financial year, I would like to take this opportunity to review some of the economic and budgetary outturn figures for 1993 and if time permits, to look at the prospects for 1994.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has turned in a resilient performance in 1993.  That performance has been all the more remarkable given the currency-related turbulence at the beginning of the year, and the sluggish international environment.</P>
    <P>Economic growth in Ireland for the year is now expected to be the highest in the European Union.  Over the past three years, GDP growth here has averaged almost 5 per cent per year.  This is one of the best growth rates in the industrialised world.  In contrast, annual average growth in the European Union was less than 2 per cent; in the United States, it was only 0.5 per cent; and in the United Kingdom, GDP actually declined by 0.75 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>This year our growth rate has slowed down, as it has in almost all other European countries.  But Ireland still had the fastest growth rate in the European Union.  Irish GDP is estimated to have increased by about 2.5 per cent while it fell by 0.5 per cent in the European Union as a whole.</P>
    <P>Our exports have continued to grow at a faster rate than our markets and our trade and wider balance of payments have both remained in substantial surplus.</P>
    <P>A particularly positive feature of the last two years has been the continued strong growth of industrial exports despite the international slow-down. Indeed, our rate of export growth has <Col N="1179" /> far exceeded the growth of our export markets.  In other words, we have been increasing our share of other countries' markets at a significant rate.  According to OECD figures, Ireland's markets for manufactured exports have grown by about 5.5 per cent in 1992 and 1993; at the same time, the OECD estimates that the growth in the volume of Ireland's manufactured exports has been over 15 per cent &mdash; almost three times as fast as the growth in our markets.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes told that Ireland is experiencing what is termed &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo;&mdash; that we are failing to convert growth into jobs.  We all know that we face an immense challenge on the employment front but perhaps it is not so well known that employment growth here in recent years has more than held its own by international standards.  In the last two years, total employment here has been broadly unchanged, while it has fallen by about 0.25 per cent a year in the European Union as a whole and by about 0.5 per cent per year in the United States. And, when you allow for the long-run decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture, non-agricultural employment here has continued to grow &mdash; even right through the worst years of the international recession.  Not many other countries can say that.  According to the latest EU Commission forecasts, Ireland will be the only EU country, apart from Luxembourg, to show any employment growth during the current year.</P>
    <P>The budget forecast for the live register was for an average of 309,000 in 1993, an increase of 26,000 compared with the 1992 outturn.  It now looks as if the average outturn for this year could be lower than 295,000.  Although this is still about 12,000 higher than in 1992, the trend in the live register has improved greatly, with the seasonally adjusted total at end-November some 2,000 less than at the end of last January.</P>
    <P>None of this must be taken to imply complacency about the scale of the unemployment problems we face.  There are far too many people on the live register; long-term unemployment, in particular, <Col N="1180" /> must be tackled as it leads to a cycle of poverty and deprivation.  Creating jobs in Ireland for the unemployed is the Government's top priority.</P>
    <P>This is not an idle aspiration.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> contains a long list of the actions we are taking and propose to take towards this end.  Provision for many of these initiatives has been included in the 1994 expenditure Estimates published on 9 December.  As I will outline later, the National Development Plan will undertake a major programme of investment designed to improve the potential for growth of the economy and create significant additional employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>No matter how committed and energetic the Government is in devising and implementing policies to reduce unemployment, these will not be effective if wage increases are so high that we lose competitiveness against our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>While, over the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> hourly rates of pay in the key manufacturing sector, expressed in a common currency, are estimated to have increased more slowly than among our main trading partners, we have no grounds for complacency at all about the future.  The annual rates of nominal pay increases in these countries have slowed throughout the three years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The latest EU forecasts point to a continuation of this trend in 1994.</P>
    <P>In 1993, Irish wage competitiveness increased but only because of devaluation. If we want to improve our competitive position in 1994, the rate of increase in pay in national currency terms has to be less than among our trading partners.  The fact that the average rate of pay increase in the UK is currently very low has to be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that our above average economic performance has been achieved without fuelling inflation or resorting to excessive public borrowing. Inflation here in recent years has consistently been below the EU average.  In <Col N="1181" /> 1993, inflation averaged 1.5 per cent, the lowest for 30 years.  The Irish economy has clearly shown its potential for rapid, non-inflationary, market-led economic growth.</P>
    <P>At the start of the year, interest rates were at very high levels &mdash; as we can all recall &mdash; as a consequence of the currency turbulence precipitated by the withdrawal of Sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  Though the exchange rate difficulties facing exporters disappeared following the realignment of the punt within the ERM at the end of January, it was only in March that interest rates started to fall.</P>
    <P>The climate of uncertainty which characterised the period of currency instability from September 1992 to early this year had a negative effect on business and consumer confidence at the time. Confidence has since improved in both areas, and the sharp fall in interest rates is a major factor behind this change.</P>
    <P>The substantial reductions in mortgage rates this year represent a huge boost to the mortgage borrower.  For example, the saving on a £40,000, 20-year mortgage is about £160 per month compared with the levels which prevailed during the currency crisis, and about £80 per month compared with pre-crisis figures.  Business borrowers, too, are benefiting from interest rate reductions of up to four percentage points.</P>
    <P>I have recently pointed out the importance of the small business sector to the economy and my concern that not all interest rates for small businesses and farmers have been falling as fast as have interbank rates.  I have been pleased to see some evidence in the latest round of retail interest rate reductions, and in certain initiatives taken recently by the two largest banks, that banks are starting to address these concerns.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of interest rates which are historically low, and which compare well with those of the former ERM narrow band countries, is dependent on both domestic and international factors.  The international background is something over which we have only very limited control.  However, it is essential <Col N="1182" /> that we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to the management of the economy and the public finances to secure the progress we have made so far and to protect the Irish economy as much as possible from the effects of the international recession.</P>
    <P>The outlook for 1994 and 1995 is for at least a modest improvement in the international economic scene.  Growth in the OECD next year is likely to be at least twice as fast as this year &mdash; about 2.25 per cent compared with the scant 1 per cent achieved in 1993.  The European Union will return to growth after a fall in GDP this year.  The latest Commission forecasts are for growth of 1¼ per cent in 1994 followed by 2 per cent growth in 1995.</P>
    <P>In addition, the UK economy is recovering.  Following the recent budget, the UK Treasury is now forecasting GDP growth of 2.5 per cent next year.  Independent forecasters are, on average, predicting growth of 2.75 per cent.  This may not sound very dramatic until one remembers that output in the UK has been falling in recent years &mdash; by 2.25 per cent in 1991 and 0.5 per cent in 1992. Against that background, the latest outlook for the UK represents a huge improvement and a vital opportunity for our exporters.</P>
    <P>Here at home, domestic demand is likely to continue to recover as consumers become accustomed to the new low interest rate regime.  Investment will also benefit from lower interest rates and from the injection provided by the Structural Funds.  While inflation will probably pick up a little from the exceptionally low levels we saw in the middle of this year, it is likely to remain moderate.</P>
    <P>All in all, the outlook for 1994 is for a return to a fairly vigorous rate of economic growth.  This view is widely shared by independent forecasters, as seen for example in the recently published forecasts of the Central Bank and the ESRI as well as in the comments of some other private sector analysts.  And, of course, a return to stronger growth holds out the prospect of stronger growth in employment next year, with perhaps a broad <Col N="1183" /> levelling off in the numbers registered as unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the relative success of our economy in all the areas I have just outlined has been supported by the Government's stance on the budgetary parameters.  The House will be aware that the programme for Government makes clear that budgetary policy will be based on the overriding requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, in particular the condition that the general Government deficit should be kept to around 3 per cent or less of GDP.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that this year's budget had to accommodate a number of very severe pressures, including: costs associated with the inauguration of the Single Market, particularly the change from the imposition of VAT at point of entry for intra-Community trade and the new DIRT tax regime for special savings accounts; the payment of arrears of equal treatment entitlements to social welfare recipients; and a substantial increase in public sector pay following the Government's decision to honour commitments in respect of deferred general and special pay increases so as to maintain the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> consensus.</P>
    <P>Despite all these pressures, the Government ensured that the EBR target was set at just 2.9 per cent of GNP, in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>In a difficult economic environment, the Government has succeeded in meeting its budget targets.  The main features of the 1993 outturn will be as follows: overall expenditure on central fund services should register a saving, as debt service savings will more than compensate for an overrun on the EC budget contribution; despite the shortfall in advance VAT payments and generally slack consumption trends, overall tax revenue will exceed the budget projection thanks to strong direct tax revenue flows and non-capital supply services, as presented in the Abridged Estimates Volume, are showing some overshoot on the budget provision, <Col N="1184" /> mainly because of overruns on demandled schemes in the health area and costs associated with the £IR realignment which adversely affected the Agriculture Vote.  However, social welfare expenditure has benefited from the lower than anticipated live register average this year and from buoyant PRSI receipts.  This will limit the slippage in spending. Accordingly, the current budget deficit will turn out close to the budget target. The capital budget outturn would also have been close to the budget target were it not for the emergence of the Aer Lingus equity issue.</P>
    <P>Despite the impact of the Aer Lingus equity injection costing £75 million and the problem with advance VAT payments which led to a loss of £65 million, the final budget outturn will be within acceptable limits.  As I announced, I am also providing funds in 1993 totalling £75 million in respect of part payment of public service pay arrears.  Under the agreement reached with the Irish Congress of Trades Unions these arrears are due to be paid not later than January 1994.  Even with this extra cost on top of the other elements which had to be absorbed this year, I expect the EBR outturn to be reasonably close to 2.9 per cent of GNP as targeted in the budget.</P>
    <P>The 1994 outlook, on a no-policy-change assessment, indicates another challenging budget.  However, the Government has, in the published expenditure estimates for 1994, shown its resolve to keep the budgetary aggregates within the overall framework set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Allowing for the full £75 million in pay arrears brought forward from 1994 to this year, the increase in net supply services spending, that is, net current spending plus net voted capital, is 2.7 per cent.  These figures show that we are on course to maintain our position among the top ranking budgetary performers in terms of borrowing in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I am convinced of the need to achieve continued progress in reducing the overall level of our national debt so as to free up resources for tax reform and other <Col N="1185" /> spending priorities.  Strict adherence to the budgetary stance of recent years must therefore be maintained, and the Government, in dealing with the 1994 budgetary position, will continue to keep this commitment very firmly in mind.  A change from the prudent approach which has been adopted up to now would undoubtedly run the risk of creating significant additional pressures on the public finances.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, we have made substantial progress in bringing order to the public finances.  Ireland's Exchequer borrowing requirement, which exceeded 12 per cent of GNP in 1986 has been reduced to about 2.7 per cent in 1992.  As I said, recent Exchequer returns indicate that the EBR for 1993 will be close to the budget target of 2.9 per cent of GNP. Against a difficult international economic background, this is a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>Over the same period, sound management of the public finances has ensured a significant reduction in the burden of the national debt.  This has fallen from 122 per cent of GNP in 1986 to about 104 per cent at the end of this year, after taking account of the once-off adjustment resulting from the realignment of the value of the IR£ within the EMS.</P>
    <P>The burden of debt service costs has also fallen, from 11.2 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 8.9 per cent in 1992 and a further fall to 8.6 per cent of GNP is projected for this year.  A reduction of 2.6 per cent of GNP is equivalent to an annual interest saving of more than £700 million at 1993 prices.  This reduction in the burden of debt service has been facilitated by the strict controls on public expenditure and borrowing exercised by Government since 1987, and by measures to improve the management of the national debt.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we maintain the momentum of recent years as regards the improvement of the public finances, so as to free up resources for the development of the economy and to facilitate the tax reform measures which will help to improve efficiency and create employment opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be voting against this Bill as a gesture to outline our opposition to the trend of Government economic policy and its proven failure to deal with the economic and social issues facing the country.  I welcome the opportunity to debate economic issues.  The whole economic debate &mdash; whether it is the tax amnesty or the Book of Estimates &mdash; has been totally overshadowed by the important events relating to Northern Ireland.  The necessary scrutiny has not taken place and I hope to address that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the publication of the Book of Estimates last Thursday, the Minister for Finance gave the impression that his Estimates were tight, prudent and cautious.  Here was the man with a steady hand on the tiller ensuring there was tight bookeeping.  When we opened our newspapers we read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a crisis in Europe, if the Deputy read yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the spending Ministers &mdash; Education and Health &mdash; said they had improved public services &mdash; increases in spending &mdash; and the Tánaiste said that the Book of Estimates will specifically deal with equality and disadvantage in our society with more spending on social services.  How can one do this simultaneously?  How can one spend more and at the same time spend less?  When the figures are analysed a clever sleight-of-hand is exposed because the Government is not comparing like with like.  Let us compare like with like. If we take the pre-budget Book of Estimates for 1993 and compare it with the identical document for 1994 we see that spending which was targeted to be £8.312 billion, actually ran out at £8.789 billion. <Col N="1187" /> If we compare like with like, the pre-budget Book of Estimates for 1993 and 1994, we see that spending has increased by 7.6 per cent.  The fact is that spending has increased by £632 million.</P>
      <P>The Book of Estimates is the first instalment on a three stage journey.  On budget day another series of expenditure announcements are made involving social welfare and new schemes are announced.  Throughout the year a raft of Supplementary Estimates are introduced which, this year, amounted to £241 million and last year amounted to £294 million. The Book of Estimates, which the Minister published last week, bears no relation to what will be spent in 1994.  It is only the first instalment of what will be spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of expenditure and what is put forward in the Book of Estimates bear little relationship to each other.  I would like to draw attention to some of the clever conjuring tricks that the Minister for Finance is particularly adept at.  For example, if we look at some of the under provisions we see in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Vote that £1 million has been provided for the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.  At a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs last week we had a discussion on legal fees and the consensus was that the minimum cost of the tribunal will be £10 million.  It is up to Mr. Justice Hamilton to decide the question of costs but there is no way we will get away with £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teilifís na Gaeilge has to be funded, but by whom?  Paddy the taxpayer, as the Exchequer is going to take up this Bill. TV3 was not economic and neither will this venture be an economic proposition. <Col N="1188" /> If one looks at the TAM ratings and the advertising revenue from Irish programmes, we know it has no basis in economics.  The taxpayer has only provided £3 million for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Will there be a levy on the video industry?  I would deplore such a move.</P>
    <P>We see further massaging of the figures. The Minister had a little nest egg in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry because 1994 is a transition year for EC headage payments.  Previously the headage money from the EC was always paid the following year &mdash; the 1992 allocation was paid in 1993 and so on.  However, in 1994, the transition year, it will be paid concurrently and the allocation for two years is in the Agriculture Vote.  This is, however, a once off measure.</P>
    <P>On Vote 40, Department of Social Welfare, item C, there is a cut in non-contributory old age pensions of £7 million. I observe that the Minister has not provided any money for the indexation of social welfare.  Are we going to have 2 per cent fewer old age pensioners?  All the information tells us that people are living longer.  How can this be explained? In the Vote for the Department of Health we see that the money provided to health boards for income maintenance schemes, that is disabled person's maintenance allowance, incapacitated person's allowance, blind welfare allowance and so on is being cut by £2 million.  Are we going to have fewer non-contributory old age pensioners and fewer sick people?  There is no explanation for this.  I submit that these are deliberate under-provisions which will have to be rectified in Supplementary Estimates next year.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the Minister has made hard decisions, the Estimates are clearly anti-employment.  Where there have been real cuts, they went for the economic Departments, such as the Department of Enterprise and Employment which is down 19 per cent, the Department of Tourism and Trade which is down 26 per cent, and the Department of Forestry which is down 57 per cent. Science and technology, a vital area <Col N="1189" /> where we are under-spending in terms of the GNP ratio, is down 9 per cent.  The summary table shows where the Government's priorities lie.  We have heard all the rhetoric that every decision will be underlined by the pro-employment strategy, but the budget for economic services is down 18 per cent, whereas the totally unproductive social services which provide no return are up 4 per cent.  We know where the Government's real priorities are.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside all the machinations of moving the IDA from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the Taoiseach &mdash; I see no reason that he should be responsible for enterprise development, but I am sure political factors underline that &mdash; its budget has been cut by 25 per cent or £30 million.  It is quite clear that these Estimates are anti-employment.  The Estimates do not deal with the Central Fund Account, the equity injection for Aer Lingus and the possible assistance for Irish Steel.  I am not satisfied that in the preparation of the Estimates there has been any imaginative or creative thinking on value for money or trying to identify waste, duplication and inefficiency in the public service.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a very small allocation for the work of looking for value for money.  He only looks at this in the context of the historic outturn to see if there has been fraud and whether the money has been spent in the way it was supposed to have been.  He does not deal with the issue of whether it was supposed to have been.  He does not deal with the issue of whether we are getting value for money for the total public expenditure of £10 billion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might do two VFMs in a year but that is wholly inadequate.  We do not have a transparent procedure within Departments which shows they are trying to get value for money.  We need to establish a new office similar to the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office, such as a public expenditure comptroller, to debate openly the question of value for money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> What are the consequences of a policy of high spending and high taxation for the poor taxpayer?  We in Fine Gael believe that the best way to convert economic growth into employment is through the reform of the tax system.  Our present layers of PAYE, PRSI and levies make payroll and PAYE costs too high.  The difference between gross and net pay is too great.  Each year there is pressure on employers to cut the payroll costs and shed jobs.</P>
    <P>Not only do we have the well identified problem of the tax wedge but we also have poverty traps.  As an ordinary constituency Deputy I find that people are coming to my clinic and saying that it would not pay them to work because of the loss of the medical card and the increase in rent.  The take home pay from a job does not match the combined benefits from social welfare.  This is utter insanity.</P>
    <P>The Government has created poverty traps in which people are condemned to idleness and unemployment.  That is the reason the Minister will have to change the tax system, particularly for the low paid.  The child tax free allowance has to be restored.  The more children one has the more social welfare one receives, whereas somebody with ten children has the same tax free allowance as someone with no children.  That cannot be explained logically.  It has created the biggest poverty trap.  There is no recognition for spouses in the home and there is no proper recognition of adult dependants being cared for in the home.</P>
    <P>The exemption limit for low paid workers is far too low.  The fact that people earning £75 per week should have to start paying tax at 30p plus in the pound is wrong.  A single person earning under £100 per week should not have to pay any tax nor should a married couple earning under £200 per week.  In Britain they already have a graduated system of employers' costs which goes from 6.6 per cent upwards and the employer pays lower contributions for low paid workers. In their recent budget they have cut each rate by 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Here the difference between labour <Col N="1191" /> cost and take home pay in industrial sectors such as clothing and manufacturing has actually got worse and they have become less competitive.  We have heard the rhetoric all throughout the year from both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on what would be done for that sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play in his speech about the fiscal factors being right and that is true.  He kept within the 3 per cent range but we need to be honest about how this has been achieved.  In the first instance the Minister was very lucky that the CSO told how it had made a mistake in GNP figures and they had to be hiked up.  They did not do it once but twice.  Obviously if the GNP is hiked up the statistics expressed as a percentage of GNP have to come down.  The Minister has been well able to benefit from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate that.  The point I am making is that the massaging of the figures has worked out very favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is in the best position of any Minister in the past 20 years radically to reform the taxation system.  The party has the largest majority in the Dáil and a full term ahead.  We are experiencing historically low inflation and low international interest rates and we have never had a <Col N="1192" /> lower cost of servicing the national debt. All these factors are in the Minister's favour.</P>
    <P>We have the famous amnesty.  Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> carries the headline &ldquo;Revenue Challenges Tax Amnesty Entitlement&rdquo;.  It now appears that we have got into such a deep quagmire that the Revenue Commissioners are having to take people to court to ensure they do not avail of the amnesty. The case reported involves £1.5 million. It transpires that nobody knows who will benefit in relation to arrears.  Apparently if on 25 May 1993 the case was at the enforcement stage one is not eligible. Does that mean one is ineligible if proceedings were initiated on that date, or when one got a summons or a letter?  The Collector General's Office are advising people whether they are eligible, but the courts can turn around and say that the Revenue made a mistake.  We do not know who is entitled to it.  We have the farcical situation that non-compliant tax-payers, if they win a court case after 21 December 1993, can look for a refund and the compliant taxpayer is left standing there in horror.  We will be returning to these issues.</P>
    <P>The outcome this year, when one takes into account all the changes, is that the Minister was operating a high tax regime &mdash; the 1 per cent levy, the 21 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear and the probate tax.  That is the hallmark of what the Minister did for the economy in 1993. That policy must be reversed if we are to encourage initiative and develop enterprise. The present high tax policies of the Government are detrimental to our economic and social needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to have this brief debate.  Notwithstanding the momentous events of the week it is worth putting down some markers this side of Christmas in relation to the shape of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the Appropriation Accounts which mop up the Estimates for 1993, including the Supplementary Estimates, we can see that even since the Book of Estimates was published, not <Col N="1193" /> the abridged version referred to earlier, there has been an increase of more than £220 million.  A fifth of that is accounted for by extra money made available for public service pay and pensions brought forward to next year.  This shows a tendency to manipulate cashflow to make the outturn for one year worse than it might be in terms of the underlying situation, making the opening position for the next year appear somewhat rosier than it ought to be.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill I objected to another piece of financial engineering.  I do not suggest that the Minister has set out to grossly mislead, but the way we present our accounts needs a good deal of cleaning up.  The Minister remarked in passing in public recently, on the idea of producing accounts on an accruals basis.  We ought to move towards producing a Book of Estimates on that basis.  They have managed to do so in the UK.  That system avoids the necessity for people to run around trying to add up all the bits brought forward and deduct all the bits that go back somewhere else in order to find the underlying position.  In terms of a straightforward transparent easy to understand system we ought to consider the production of some Book of Estimates on that basis, perhaps even starting with next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the case earlier in the year that he is losing VAT at the point of entry because of the Single Market.  That is true but it counterbalances the gain one of his colleagues made ten years earlier on a once off basis. To cover up the once off loss in cashflow terms we introduced a rule to bring in £145 million by early payment of VAT which, because of a recent European court case, we had to change but which will still bring in between £90 million and £100 million.  The improvement, in terms of the overall position, which that carries forward to this year, is an illusion, because in January the same 1,087 companies will get input credits and the £100 million will go back to them in effect, or at least they do not pay in the fresh £100 <Col N="1194" /> million that they might owe in January. We have written into law that money due in January must be paid in December every year, in other words encourage people to make early payments.  It is all due to this non-sensical system of engineering the cashflow presentation of the books.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates for 1994 boasted that net current overall spending would be up by less than 3 per cent and that that, broadly speaking, was in line with the rate of inflation.  Creditable as that performance is, it is not the full story because the Minister already conceded in his speech that tax revenues in 1993, notwithstanding a few difficulties in regard to VAT, ran ahead of schedule. The result is that the Government was presented with the option of borrowing less than the £760 million they included in the budget.  If we do better in income we have a number of options but it does not compel us to spend up to the limit. We have the option to borrow less or to retain the margin to manoeuvre it gives for tax reform in the following year.</P>
    <P>The extra revenue, however, was not earmarked to reduce borrowing and, in any event, borrowing is nothing more than postponing tax.  Nor indeed is it held over or earmarked for greater tax cuts in 1994.  Instead, it was used to expedite payment of other things in the system. We get ahead of ourselves in tax receipts and, partly for the cashflow engineering and partly to do with this arithmetic I am describing, we decided to bring forward payments we owe in public sector pay from January to be paid in December. That will make 1993 look more expensive but it will improve the opening position in 1994.  There are two illusions built into this, one being that if tax is ahead of schedule, we might as well use it and borrow up to the limit anyway and the other is that it allows us to do things much more easily than might have been the case.  That camouflages the true position.</P>
    <P>Taking one full year with another, and trying to avoid the fudge and the camouflage, I suggest that public sector pay and pensions in 1994 will be 7 per cent more than in 1993 if we compare the <Col N="1195" /> underlying position on a 12 month basis. That level of extra pay in the context of the rate of inflation is staggering when it is presented in plain form without end of year manipulation.  I accept the Minister can explain the carryover from <i>Programme and Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with which he had to catch up.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats has always held the view that PRSI is simply a payroll tax, another tax on work.  If we counted that as an ordinary tax receipt instead of as an insurance receipt, we would see that the underlying position in the book of Estimates is not the Minister's 3 per cent but that it is nearer to 6 per cent. That is more than twice the likely rate of inflation for next year and is not quite as cherry and rosy an outcome as was presented last week in the Book of Estimates. We are entitled to include PRSI as another tax.</P>
    <P>As long as we allow the room for manoeuvre in the economy &mdash; if tax revenue, for example, runs ahead of what was scheduled &mdash; to be whittled away by extra public spending, we condemn the taxpayer to a tax burden which is a huge disincentive and is anti-employment. That is the choice being clearly made in the presentation today of these Appropriation Accounts and was made last week in the Book of Estimates from this partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The scope for dramatic tax changes which we need is already circumscribed for next year by the drift we have allowed this year notwithstanding the reports that there will be some room for manoeuvre. We have one of the worst tax wedges in the OECD.  If we take labour intensive industry and the clothing sector here and compare like with like, we will see that there is a minimum wage in both Ireland and the UK.  In the UK the minimum wage is lower than the Irish minimum wage but in Ireland the take home pay is lower than in the UK by a significant amount.  That extra burden of taxation in a vulnerable labour intensive sector, where jobs are vital, is whittled away by <Col N="1196" /> the scale of the tax wedge.  In turn, the tax wedge is whittled away by allowing an upward drift in spending fill the gap when tax runs ahead of schedule in receipt terms, as was the case this year.</P>
    <P>The labour intensive argument does not apply only to the clothing industry.  I spoke recently to a senior manager in the financial services sector here who talked about the comparative gross costs, including the tax wedge, of running offices here and in the UK.  The same argument applies to the services sector where there is a high degree of labour intensity, a sector in which Ireland could develop a competitive edge.  There will have to be a dramatic assault in next year's budget on the level of taxation as it affects labour intensive industry.  In particular, I hope we will drop the myth that PRSI is an insurance fund, not a tax, that we cannot interfere with PRSI on the grounds that it is an insurance scheme when, in reality, one would only be manipulating a labour tax rate.  We must break that psychology.  My party and I have argued for some time that there is validity in regarding social security tax as simply another tax and it should be treated in that way in next year's budget. It should be reduced for the labour intensive industry, where it hurts most.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that economic growth in Ireland for the year is now expected to be the highest in the European Union and that over the last three years GDP growth here averaged almost 5 per cent per year.  He went on to say that such growth compares well with the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom and that our exports have continued to grow at a faster rate than our markets.  He stated that a particularly positive feature of the last two years was the continued strong growth of industrial exports despite the international slow down.  I accept that is what the figures show.  However, there is a problem in that regard which the Minister dealt with later, but he did not take on board fully the consequences.  He referred to &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo; and stated that our growth is not entirely jobless. He said that by international standards <Col N="1197" /> we have managed to do reasonably well and that total employment in Ireland has been broadly unchanged while it has fallen by 0.25 per cent in the European Union as a whole.  Total employment has remained unchanged, but we have had real growth of 5 per cent per annum in GDP for three successive years.  That requires a fundamental explanation.  The only person from an economic establishment who spelled it out with any clarity recently was Maurice Doyle in his famous speech for which he will be remembered for other reasons.  Perhaps this is the reason for which it should be remembered most.  Mr. Doyle said that, by way of any conventional measure, there was little evidence of a recession in Ireland. He is correct.  He examined some of the alternative growth measures which should be considered because when the Minister, the Taoiseach or the European Union uses GDP figures they should carry a health warning.  They are incorrect and give a false sense of reality in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are two economies here, one being the export-led multinational-led high performing sector.  It is a Ben Johnson economy, pumped full of steroids in performance terms, it is an enhanced performer. It even wins gold medals occasionally although it is somewhat false.  The rest of us live and work in the Community Games economy.  We are producing Olympian results which we wear as badges of honour at international meetings when in fact it is far from the Olympics we were reared; rather we are living in the Community Games undergrowth. In terms of future planning for employment, we must find alternative measures to the GDP and GNP figures. They should not be dismissed and I do not propose we cook the books, but those figures do not work as an explanation. How could we achieve real growth of 5 per cent and end up with employment unchanged?  The Minister quoted estimates of European growth as given by Mr. Delors at recent meetings but I am <Col N="1198" /> sure the Minister will agree that these are not very good.  Jacques Delors is probably an agnostic about his growth plans if those growth figures are anything to go by.</P>
    <P>Finally, to bring some sanity into the matter, I wish the Minister a Happy Christmas and hope he does not get up to the things Ministers and Governments frequently do when we are all away.  I welcome the Minister's stance on public sector pay and on pay in general, but I hope he does not go soft on us over Christmas.</P>

      <P>The other Opposition spokespersons devoted a considerable amount of time to talking about book keeping and the presentation of the annual Appropriation Bill.  In the absence of any provision for an adjournment debate, which was previously provided for by the Whips, I would like to regard this mopping-up operation as some kind of a review of the performance of the Government in the economic area as it approaches the end of its first year in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As stated by Deputies Yates and Cox, much of 1993, especially the later half, was dominated by the affairs of Northern Ireland.  I am sure nobody would dispute the urgency of the Northern Ireland position or that it merits a place at the very top of the Government's agenda.  Neither, I am sure, would anybody deny the Taoiseach credit for the manner in which he concluded one stage of the negotiations yesterday nor begrudge him his day of glory.  We must all hope that the document will receive the response it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a negative side effect of the political and media preoccupation with Northern Ireland, namely, that urgent economic problems have disappeared from the agenda.  I hope there is an early political settlement to the problems in Northern Ireland, not only because the people there deserve peace, but because a settlement would refocus political and media attention on those <Col N="1199" /> economic problems which, in some respects, are wreaking almost as much havoc on communities in the Republic as paramilitary violence is on similar communities in Northern Ireland.  Many people in my constituency who are facing the miserable prospect of yet another Christmas on the dole, who have seen their communities decimated by crime and vandalism, want to see peace in the North, but they also want to see an end to the economic violence inflicted on them by the neglect and inaction of this Government.  If there is one feature of the first 12 months of this Government that has surprised me more than anything, it is the failure of the Labour Party to exert any influence in the key economic area.</P>
    <P>When the Programme for Government was published last January Democratic Left remarked immediately that it largely reflected Fianna Fáil economic policy while the influence of Labour was strongest in the social or liberal content.  Perhaps one should not have been surprised because the prize ministry of Finance was there for the taking at that time.  In saying that I do not intend any disrespect to the present holder of that office.  The Taoiseach would have bargained anything, except the Premiership, for a partner. The fact that the Labour Party demonstrated no interest in capturing the main economic portfolio demonstrates its lack of confidence in having any alternative economic strategy to that pursued by the present Minister for Finance or by Fianna Fáil in general.  The cosy complacency that is so evident between the partners since then bears out the fact that the Labour Party is happy not to have to confront the economic problems but to tinker around at the edges of a social agenda which is important, but which the majority of that party's supporters take for granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would offer them more than an amnesty if the opportunity presented itself but this is unlikely in the short-term.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1993, therefore, the economic dominance of Fianna Fáil is clearer than ever.  I concede that the Labour Party has made some progress in securing useful reforms on the social agenda but when it comes to the key economic issues, poverty, unemployment and tax reform, not only does it appear to have no influence but it appears to have given up any hope of making an impact.</P>
      <P>When in Opposition the Labour Party rightly harassed and harried the former Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government on its failure to deal with unemployment crisis.  A recent edition of the priority it deserved.  As Deputies will recall, in the middle of August last year the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, called for the recall of the Dáil because of the unemployment crisis.  A recent edition of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> published an audit of the Government's performance in this area and commented as follows:</P>
      <P>This is an issue on which the Labour Party won much electoral support in the 1992 General Election.  There were 281,746 people out of work then.  Now, the figure is 286,185.</P>
      <P>The method of calculating the figures has been changed somewhat so the real figure is considerably higher.  That is the net contribution of the Labour Party, which has its largest ever number of Ministers at the Cabinet table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one expected the Labour Party to wave a magic wand or achieve an instant miracle in seeking a solution or partial solution to the unemployment crisis but the source of sickening disappointment for those who voted for the party must be the failure of the party to ensure that this problem was given additional urgency.  The sense of disappointment must be intensified by the knowledge that a Labour Party Minister has had his hand <Col N="1201" /> on the tiller at the Department most concerned with job creation strategies, the new Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The prospect of changing a conservative Progressive Democrat Minister in this area caused bonfires to be lit in the strongholds of the Labour Party only a year ago, but now could anyone tell the difference?  What has been the value of exchanging a Labour Minister for a conservative Minister in the new Administration.</P>

      <P>On the front page reference is made to a nice little earner which I am sure will come back to in the debate on the ethics Bill.  I should not be diverted by such levity from making the point that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, in his 12 months in Cabinet cannot point to one single novel idea which has contributed to a reduction in dole queues.  He has failed to take his courage in his hands in regard to the implementation of the Cullition report.  Despite the rhetorical commitment to the Culliton report, all the Government has done is waste three valuable years, dedicated to a revamp of industrial strategy, by doing the opposite in most respects to what the report recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is chaos in regard to the industrial agencies.  The Culliton report recommended that we put in place a streamlined industrial agency system but <Col N="1202" /> there is such chaos that all we have is uncertainty and paralysis.  The IDA way is now rethinking its strategy.  Presumably the new organisations will be vested by 1 January in order to put the memory behind them but it looks as if Forfás will become a think tank under the aegis of the Department.  The chief executive who was appointed changed his mind and is now the chief executive of IDA Ireland.  Last week we finally got around to appointing a chief executive for Forbairt.  We now have a multiplicity of agencies and there is one more significant agency to come &mdash; An Bord Bia. Despite the explicit recommendation of the Culliton report that we should avoid fragmentation in regard to our export sales drive, because of competition within the Cabinet and the efforts of the farming lobby An Bord Bia is to be established.</P>
    <P>The only proposal that has been implemented is the establishment of the county enterprise boards, admittedly on a less elaborate scale.  This was a Fianna Fáil idea which the Minister, Deputy Quinn dismissed out of hand when in Opposition.  He would have nothing to do with it.  He has been hiding behind the soutane of Fr. Seán Healy and the CMRS.  One is safe behind its clerical robes in the sense that one could promise the unemployed another scheme in respect of which the CMRS would be the intellectual driving force.  Sadly, that is the net contribution of the Government at the end of the first year.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Cox referred to a particular athlete &mdash; I cannot remember his name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He also referred to the dual economy and the inflated performance of the exports sector.  The Deputy is right and the Minister's speech does not change this.  There are two economies the first of which is the enclave &mdash; the multinational companies and its <Col N="1203" /> extraordinary performance &mdash; and the other the indigenous sector which is a different kettle of fish.  At least one major report has been produced recently on the relationship between the growth rate and the number of jobs created.  We made an order of the House to refer that report to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy but it has yet to come before it.  If the Minister is serious about addressing this matter adequate time will have to be made available to debate that report.  It continues to be a mystery that we have a healthy growth rate by comparison with the figures for the rest of the countries in the OECD and the European Union, yet the jobs are not being created.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has confirmed that he has a large amount of money left for tax reform. We look forward to this with anticipation.  In his speech he listed all of the measures which have been strikingly successful which leaves him in the happy position that he will have much money for tax reform in the budget at the end of January.  If he follows the advice given to him by Deputies Yates and Cox on the question of public pay I look forward to the most radical and far-reaching package of tax reforms that has ever been introduced in this House in the hope that this will make a contribution to job creation.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Cox in wishing the Minister yule-tide felicitations and promising that we will see him on budget day.</P>

      <P>While the media for a considerable period has concentrated on the beef tribunal, a group of 40 workers at the AIBP plant a Rathkeale, County Limerick, are not looking forward to Christmas with any great optimism.</P>
      <P>Over the past year those workers, although regarded as full-time workers, have worked periods of short term employment varying from one day a week to two days, three days and very rarely a four day week.  They have not worked a full week from the start of this year.  Although they are full-time workers they are treated like casual workers.</P>
      <P>The 40 workers work on a piecework basis and are dependent on each other as to what they earn on a daily basis.  Those workers have worked with the company for varying periods from ten to 33 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The residue of what was labelled the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts still remain in the manner in which those workers are treated in regard to unemployment assistance.  Systematically, each worker is being assessed at different times of the year.  About one-third of the current workforce are now affected by these cuts.  When they are first assessed for unemployment assistance a daily rate is fixed.  They then work a 13 week period and are further reassessed depending on the time worked.  They then have to lose a working day to requalify.  The system not alone penalises the workers in regard <Col N="1208" /> to their social welfare entitlements, but it also acts as a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>Recently, the union, on behalf of the workers discussed their case with Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare Deputy Burton and social welfare representatives.  They gave her case studies and other data to substantiate their case.  To date there has been no response from the Minister.  Those workers are in a poverty trap with no benefits such as medical cards, family income supplement and so on and many of them have to meet mortgage repayments. In many cases they would be better off being in full-time unemployment and in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will look sympathetically at their case and I urgently appeal to him to make a speedy decision on their problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two changes in the social welfare code which have affected the entitlement to unemployment payments of the workers concerned.  From July 1992 the earnings of all insured persons have been assessed as means for unemployment assistance purposes and from January 1993 applicants for unemployment benefit have been required to show that they have sustained a loss of employment.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the unemployment assistance scheme is to assist people who are out of work by ensuring that they have an income which is in line with their needs as determined by legislation.  Being a social welfare scheme, it is designed to be applied in an equitable manner to the various categories of claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation establishing the scheme in 1993 provided that persons could have their means assessed while still employed so as to avoid any delay in authorising claims if they suffered a loss of work.  By excluding income from current employment, the assessment reflected the situation <Col N="1209" /> that would exist when they became unemployed.  That was a necessary provision, at the time, in circumstances where entitlement to unemployment benefit was very restricted.</P>
    <P>The unemployment assistance legislation was not updated in line with changing work practices over the years.  In particular the growth in part-time working meant that many people could work for a number of days and claim unemployment assistance for the remaining days of the week, regardless of the amount of their earnings for the days worked.  In this ways the scheme became, for certain categories of workers, simply a top-up for what in some cases were substantial earnings from part-time working.</P>
    <P>At the same time a growing number of self-employed people began to claim unemployment assistance where their income from self-employment decreased.  In their case, the income had to be assessed in full and deducted from the basic unemployment assistance in determining their entitlement.  Furthermore, the scope of unemployment benefit has been greatly expanded since the assistance scheme was introduced, most recently with the extension of insurance cover to employees earning over £25 per week.</P>
    <P>To reflect these changing circumstances, the Social Welfare Act, 1992, provided for the assessement as means for unemployment assistance purposes of earnings from insurable employment. The effect of this provision is that, with effect from 29 July 1992, people claiming unemployment assistance and working on a part-time basis have their earnings from employment assessed as means.  The purpose of the change is to ensure that there is a consistent approach in this matter by treating employees and the self-employed in a similar way.  This is in line with the overall objective of reducing the anomalies and the complexity of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> In implementing the new arrangements, a degrees of financial incentive was provided for unemployed people to take up occasional employment where the opportunity arises.  This has been done through certain disregards of earnings in assessing a claimant's means.  The amount disregarded each week is the equivalent of the person's appropriate daily rate of unemployment assistance for each day worked plus an additional amount of £15 per day.  For example, a married man with three children working a three day week will have £111.55 of his weekly earnings disregarded.  The balance of earnings will then be assessed as means in determining the rate of unemployment assistance payable for days of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The loss of employment provision was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1992, and became effective on 4 January 1993.  It was introduced in connection with the extension of insurance cover to part-time workers and in recognition of the long-established principle that unemployment benefit provides a replacement income only where there is an actual loss of employment.  Whether a loss of employment has actually occurred is determined, in practice, by comparing the period for which benefit is claimed with the applicant's normal level of work.</P>
    <P>The original provision provided that the extent of the loss required was proportional to the previous level of employment. I reviewed the level of the loss required and decided that it should be reduced to one day in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Any person who is adversely affected by the changes in entitlement to unemployment benefit may instead claim unemployment assistance.  From April 1993, I revised the regulations governing the assessment of insurable earnings so that the amount a person can earn and still receive unemployment assistance for the days not worked has been substantially increased.  This measure has significantly improved the position of <Col N="1211" /> those who are involved in casual or part time employment.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the operation of the loss condition may have had particular consequences for those engaged in casual employment.  I am currently reviewing the impact of the provision in the light of the experience of its operation over the past year.  Should it emerge that changes are necessary I will accordingly seek Government approval to the necessary amendments to the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  The small village in rural Ireland sustains a scattered community and is the hub of activity for a community drawn from all walks of life.  The decline in rural population has been ongoing and indeed the 1991 census of population demonstrated this very clearly.  My own county of Westmeath is, surprisingly, the county with the third highest migration rate in the country, with some parts of that county showing a rural population decline of up to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Commercial life in the rural village is paramount to the success and vibrancy of the local community and as one drives through rural Ireland one cannot be but impressed by the efforts of many of these small communities to enhance their villages with their efforts in the Tidy Towns competition and to remain vibrant.</P>
      <P>Life in many of these small hamlets has been under threat from Government forces for some time.  The closure of rural Garda stations has been ongoing and this Government does not seem to have the willpower to reverse that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We continue to see small primary schools under threat and the new Minister for Education continues <Col N="1212" /> to allow primary schools to close and be amalgamated.  The village post office has also been sought out as a possible victim of rationalisation.  Some congregations have even experienced threat of closure of the local church, if they are unable to sustain the building and its environs. Many small communities have buckled under these closures and have allowed their communities to die.  However many more vibrant communities have fought back and are continuing to fight against central bureaucracy, where their worth is not understood and where values of life in rural communities are not appreciated.</P>
      <P>The latest threat to sustaining economic activity in small villages has come from major oil companies.  In the last couple of weeks, a major Irish oil company has written to all its customers indicating that from 1 January 1994, a surcharge will be imposed on retailers purchasing quantities of less than 9,000 litres of product per delivery.  This will have a devastating effect on petrol stations located in rural areas and will lead to higher prices.  Hence, many of them will be neglected by their customers and subsequently will have to close.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that many of these small stations do not have the capacity to store quantities of 9,000 litres and, even if they wished to co-operate with the oil company, they would not be in a position to do so.  It is also important to note that demand for different types of fuel, for example, lead free, super, diesel, etc., has led to problems in regard to tank storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a typical village in Ireland the petrol station is part of a small complex which usually includes a grocery shop and a public house.  The closing of a petrol station in a small village means that people in that locality have to travel to the nearest town for fuel.  Having made that trip they will no doubt complete the remainder of their shopping in that town. This will have the long-term effect of forcing local retail outlets to close, <Col N="1213" /> thereby further downgrading life in rural villages.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to stemming the decline of rural communities. It appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for this area and I am glad he is present tonight.  The Minister should consider this serious issue and ensure that people who own petrol stations in rural areas are treated fairly. Having regard to the fact that oil companies operate under a motor fuel category licence, it should be possible to bring some pressure to bear on them, either through the Director of Consumer Affairs or the competition authority, to ensure that they do not close another service in rural Ireland.  This oil company, in its pursuit of profits at the expense of rural communities, should remember the following words of Oliver Goldsmith, who lived in the locality where this policy will have most effect, in <i>The Deserted Village:</i></P>
    <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:</P>
    <P>Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;</P>
    <P>A breath can make them, as a breath has made;</P>
    <P>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I always listen carefully to the problems affecting the structure of rural communities.  I listened carefully to Deputy McGrath but I do not share his view that the Government lacks commitment to preserve a vibrant rural infrastructure. One has only to look at the success of programmes such as the Operational Programme for Rural Development, the Leader programme, the small community enterprise scheme and other schemes, which are specifically geared <Col N="1214" /> towards dealing with the problems identified by Deputy McGrath, to see evidence of the Government's commitment to preserving a vibrant rural infrastructure.</P>
      <P>For the first time a section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been given specific responsibility for rural development and I am glad the Deputy acknowledged that.  I am proud to head up that section of the Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, price control on petroleum products and the Restrictive Practices Order, which regulated the operation of competition in the industry, was abolished in 1991.  The move was preceded by a report from the Fair Trade Commission which stated that price control was imposing costly distortions on the petrol retailing industry and that the consumer was deprived of the benefits of price competition. At the time the International Energy Agency also recommended the abolition of price control on petrol products.</P>
      <P>Since price control was abolished we have seen good competition on price, between the petrol companies.  This has meant that the consumer can shop around and is free to choose the best price.  The consumer is assisted by the operation of the Petrol Display Order which is in place and is monitored on a regional basis by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In the past price controls and restrictions have hindered competition. By allowing the market to operate freely we can expect gains in efficiency and ultimate benefits for the consumer.  We should think through very carefully any proposal to interfere with the operation of a healthy, competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the abolition of price control and the Restrictive Practices Order, petrol companies were in a position to charge load premia.  I would add that the issue of differential pricing based on quantity is not peculiar to the oil industry.  The <Col N="1215" /> Fair Trade Commission in its report dealt with this issue and was of the view that provided the charges were equitable they could not be regarded as unfair discrimination. It also considered that it would be unrealistic to require a company to deliver very low amounts.  These views are reasonable and I do not think that it would be in the overall interest of the consumer to require oil companies to operate uneconomic practices.  We consider that by deregulating the minimum size of delivery we encourage economic distribution practices to the ultimate benefit of the consumer.</P>
    <P>One key concern is, of course, to ensure an adequate spread of outlets to serve all parts of the country.  Competitiveness in the market brought about by deregulation ensures that supplies are met.  If one company finds it uneconomic to make small drops there will be another company prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Competition Act, 1991, contains important rules to ensure the operation of a competitive market and to outlaw abusive practices by dominant firms.  This is an important protection for small companies and consumers.  For example, section 5 of the Act prohibits an undertaking in a dominant position from directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions. It is open to the aggrieved person to consider taking an action in the Circuit Court against abusive practices.</P>
    <P>Information available to me suggests that, in the main, oil companies are operating a system of load premia which is fair and reasonable.  If the Deputy has information to suggest otherwise I would be prepared to consider the issue further.</P>
    <P>I omitted in my opening comments to apologise for the absence of the Minister who is in Brussels on official business.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Grant Payments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you most sincerely, <Col N="1216" /> a Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that hundreds, if not thousands, of farmers in Cork south west and other disadvantaged areas, are very annoyed at the haphazard way the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is dealing with the payment of the cattle headage, suckler cow and sheep headage grants this year. Despite modern technology, computerisation, etc., this year farmers have received only a token payment of the cattle headage, a suckler cow and sheep headage payments they received in previous years.  Nonsensical statements in the letters accompanying the payments such as (a) &ldquo;Grant Restriction&rdquo;, (b) &ldquo;Insufficient fodder acreage&rdquo;&mdash; even though maps were lodged with the Department six months ago indicating that they have ample fodder acreage &mdash; and (c) &ldquo;Advance Payments without Prejudice&rdquo; are mindboggling and misleading for farmers.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Department is not competent to process the cattle headage, suckler cow and sheep headage payment application forms and is incapable of issuing the full payment to farmers.  Alternatively, this may be an easy way out for the Department &mdash; it may be an excuse for withholding the full payments to cash starved small farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister should let common sense prevail in regard to this matter and use his influence, as master of his Department, to ensure that all outstanding cattle headage, sheep headage and suckler cow grants are paid immediately to farmers who, incidentally, are penalised to the tune of 10 per cent if they are in arrears with their income tax payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should say if his Department will compensate farmers by paying them 10 per cent extra on all overdue headage payments.  Will the Minister state publicly why his Department cannot pay farmers the full rate of grant?  The levels of payments made range from 60 <Col N="1217" /> per cent to as low as 20 per cent.  Indeed in some cases no payment has been made.</P>
    <P>Is it a fact that the money from Brussels for such payments is withheld by the Department of Finance in Dublin?  Is the EC Commission aware of the present situation appertaining to headage payments in Ireland?  Is it aware that only a token payment has been made on those schemes this year?  The time has come for the Minister to come clean with regard to this problem which is causing such anxiety to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister or the Minister of State opened a new office of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Portlaoise to deal with all applications for beef premiums, both ten months and 22 month.  Farmers throughout the country must now wait until the end of January or perhaps February for the return of their cards, which they submitted for punching to the Department with their respective application forms at the end of November.  Why did the Minister not allow each county veterinary office deal with such beef scheme applications, as was the case in previous years when all the cards were punched and returned within a week?  In fact, the cards were punched on presentation at the counter and returned to farmers immediately.</P>
    <P>Farmers cannot travel to Portlaoise from Mizen Head, Dursey Head or Malin Head.  They cannot get to Portlaoise to hand in their cards personally.  Farmers cannot dispose of their bullocks until February or perhaps March and the majority of them will be forced to borrow money to purchase feeding stuffs to rear their animals throughout the winter months.  It would be interesting to know if Government Ministers would wait several months for their salary cheques.  It is already obvious that the Government has decided it can always leave the farmers without their money as they do not constitute any threat to the Government. Those on social welfare, civil servants and many others must get priority.  If they <Col N="1218" /> do not get paid on time there is an outcry. Cows cannot be switched off like taps. Cattle must be sold at a specific time and crops must be harvested when ripe.</P>
    <P>Surely in this season of peace and goodwill the Minister will see fit to ensure that all outstanding headage grants are paid to farmers before Christmas if at all possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan, as usual, is putting in an excellent pre-Christmas performance but nonetheless I share his concern in relation to the payment of livestock grants to farmers.  However, I must bring to the Deputy's attention the actual facts in relation to the payment of grants.</P>
      <P>Payment to farmers in 1993 under the various premia and headage schemes have already exceeded the record levels achieved in 1992.  To date in 1993 over £350 million has been paid out to farmers under these schemes.  At mid-December, 1992, the figure for payments stood at £275 million, so this year's payment figure is some 27 per cent up on that of a year earlier.  Payments are continuing under all the schemes and Deputy Sheehan and other Members of the House will be pleased to learn that I expect a further amount of £30 million to be paid out by the end of this year.  In effect, that amount of money will be paid in the coming week.  By any standards, that is an indication of the Department's concern to ensure that the maximum amount of money is paid to qualified farmers within the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not pay out 100 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account other direct payments to farmers in 1993, the total for the year could in fact be of the order of £440 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With CAP reform there has been a considerable increase in the number of applications for the various livestock schemes.  It is important to note that <Col N="1219" /> applications in 1993 are of the order of 640,000 as compared with 370,000 in 1992.  These two figures will give Members some idea of the huge volume of work which must be dealt with in the Department as a result of our success in relation to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the various new livestock schemes which have been brought onstream and the number of farmers qualifying for theses schemes.  The Deputy will appreciate that many of the schemes are highly complex both from the farmers' point of view &mdash; and Deputy Sheehan raised that point on a number of occasions in this House &mdash; but also from the Department's point of view in relation to their administration.</P>
    <P>To meet the various additional demands, the administration of the special beef premium schemes was, as the Deputy has identified, centralised in Portlaoise and some 80 additional staff have been allocated to that office.  The relocation to Portlaoise will be one of the main factors in streamlining the administration of all the schemes on which the farmers are dependent in terms of grants.</P>
    <P>My objective is to secure the maximum level of payments to farmers during 1993 and to ensure that these payments are made at the earliest possible opportunity. I believe this objective is being achieved. The record payment levels in 1993 are being achieved notwithstanding the fact that EU regulations preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November. Deputy Sheehan must understand, from his knowledge of the scheme, that that is the case.  Payments could not commence before 1 November and even then there is a limit on payment to 60 per cent advances &mdash; 100 per cent payments had previously been the norm.  Most disadvantaged areas headage payments are normally on the basis of advances and this is also in practice in 1993.</P>
    <P>The CAP reform arrangements are, as I have already said, quite complex.  My <Col N="1220" /> Department is coming to terms with the new requirements but I will not be satisfied until we have mastered all of the problems involved.  I am, therefore, currently reviewing all our systems in the interest of further improvements for the 1994 schemes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would not accept that there have been delays in the overwhelming majority of cases in the return of cattle identity cards submitted with the ten month and 22 months special beef premium applications in June and July 1993.  As a general rule, such cards are returned within the two months retention period applicable under those schemes so as to allow the applicants concerned to sell the male cattle listed on their applications as soon as that retention period expires.</P>
    <P>I expect that the special beef premium unit will continue to cope well with the cattle identity cards submitted with the November applications under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  Everybody in this House is aware of the important business in which he is involved, namely, the GATT negotiations in Brussels.</P>

Cuireadh iarratas isteach i 1892 le haghaidh breis seomraí de bharr an méadú a tháinig ar líon na ndaltaí ag freastal ar an scoil agus sa bhliain 1985 cheadaigh an Roinn dhá sheomra ranga sa bhreis agus seomra uilefhóinteach don scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1988 cheadaigh an Roinn ailtire príobháideach a fhostú.  Bhí na tairiscintí faighte agus liosta de na conradhtheoirí curtha go dtí an Roinn <Col N="1221" /> agus súil ag gach éinne go mbeadh an obair ag tosú ag tús na bliana seo.  Ach fuair siad scéal ón Roinn i mí Meithimh nach mbeadh an Roinn sásta aon airgead a chur ar fáil ná cead a thabhairt dul ar aghaidh leis an obair.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé sin an-díomá ar an mBord Bainistíochta agus ar na tuismitheoirí. Caithfidh mé a rá leis an Aire go bhfuil an-fhearg ar na tuismitheoirí agus go bhfuil sé beartaithe acu na daltaí a choimeád sa bhaile ón scoil.  Tá stailc aon lá sa tseachtain ar siúl sa scoil seo faoi láthair. Níl á chur ar fáil ag an Roinn ach suas le £70,000.  Tá airgead ceadaithe ag Roinn na Gaeltachta do chuid den obair seo le trí bliana anuas agus tá siadsan ag bagairt go mbeidh an t-airgead sin á tharraingt ar ais acu muna n-úsáidtear é go tapa.</P>
    <P>Mar sin tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire a chinntiú go mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil anois mar go bhfuil Meastacháin na bliana seo chugainn socraithe ag an Rialtas. D'fhéadfadh an tAire a chur in iúl dúinn anocht go mbeidh an Roinn sásta an obair seo a cheadú, cé mhéid airgid a bheidh á chur ar fáil ag an Roinn, cén ceatadán a bheidh á chur ar fáil ag an Roinn agus cé mhéid airgid a bheidh le bailiú ag na tuismitheoirí.  Chomh maith leis sin ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire in iúl dúinn go bhfuil an Roinn sásta glacadh leis an íocaíocht atá déanta ag an mBord Bainistíochta leis an ailtire &mdash; suas le £20,000 &mdash; de bharr gur thug an Roinn cead don Bhord an t-ailtire sin a fhostú i litir chucu i mí Lúnasa 1988.  Tá an Roinn taréis scríobh chucu le gairid, áfach, á rá nár thugadar an cead sin.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na deacrachtaí atá ann.  Bheadh sé éasca iad a shárú.  Beidh an-drochchaoi ar an scoil agus ar na daltaí muna fhaigheann siad cead dul ar aghaidh láithreach leis na seomraí ranga seo.  Beidh trí seomra scoile in easnamh mí Meán Fómhair seo chugainn, má fhágtar an scéal mar atá.</P>
    <P>De bharr an uimhir daltaí atá ann agus an moill uafásach fhada atá ar an obair go dtí seo ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire in iúl dúinn anocht go mbeidh <Col N="1222" /> an Roinn sásata an t-airgead riachtanach a chur ar fáil sna Meastacháin don bhliain seo chugainn.</P>

Beidh cúirt liathróide i gceist freisin, mar aon le córas nua draenála agus séarachais.</P>
      <P>Tá costas measta de £70,000, ar an obair seo.  Beidh an obair seo mar chuid de scéim mhór tógála.  Tá halla nua agus seomra ilfheidhmeach le cur ar fáil freisin.  Beidh soláthar airgid ar fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta chomh maith le soláthar áitiúil i leith na scéime ina iomláine. Tá costas measta de thart ar £250,000 ar an iomlán.</P>

      <P>Is oth liom a rá nárbh fhéidir an scéim seo a chur i measc na scéimeanna ar socraíodh conradh a dhéanamh dóibh i 1993 toisc go raibh scéimeanna eile ann, a raibh níos mó práinne, ag baint leo.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go maith gur chúis mhíshástachta ag an mBord Bainisteoireachta nach ndeacthas ar aghaidh leis an scéim roimhe seo, agus go bhfuil tosca ar leith i gceist ón uair nach bhfuil an Roinn seo ag íoc deontas, ach i leith cuid den scéim.</P>

    <P>Buailfidh oifigigh de chuid an Roinn Oideachais, le toscaireacht ón scoil an <Col N="1223" /> tseachtain seo chugainn chun fadhbanna na scoile a phlé.</P>
    <P>Roghnófar go luath na scéimeanna a ndéanfar conradh ina leith le linn 1994. Ba mhaith liom a gheallúint don Teachta go bhfuil an scéim seo ar cheann de na scéimeanna a chuirfear san áireamh, agus an roghnú sin á dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith a iarraidh ar an Teachta <Col N="1224" /> Molloy a áiteamh ar na tuismitheoirí sa chás seo, gan na daltaí a choimeád sa bhaile ón scoil.  Le comhoibriú ó mhúinteoirí agus ó thuismitheoirí agus le tacaíocht ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, tá súil agam go mbeidh socrú ar an scéal seo i 1994.</P>

In general while the bulk of such services for AIDS patients have to date been provided on a community basis I am not aware of any case where AIDS sufferers were discriminated against in regard to the provision of such inpatient services where required.  The National AIDS strategy committee recommended that Hospice Care be developed to cater for the likely increased number of deaths from AIDS over the coming years.  This would include the provision of some inpatient Hospice Care facilities, particularly in city areas.  I propose to act on those recommendations and a number of designated beds will be provided in 1994.

      <P>The development of orthodontic services is an integral part of the Programme for Government and funds will be provided over the period of the programme for this purpose.  This process has already commenced.  In the current year an additional £0.7 million was made available to the health boards to enable them to improve their services, to allow them to develop orthodontic training programmes for dentists and to equip surgeries. In addition, approval has been given to the employment of a full-time orthodontic consultant in the Maxillofacial unit in St. James's Hospital.  Overall six of the eight health boards employ full-time consultant orthodontists and efforts are being made by the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board to fill approved vacancies.  This is a very significant improvement on the position which applied pre-1992 and is resulting in a corresponding improvement in service levels.  Significant further progress needs to be made, however, and I am at present reviewing all aspects of the service to determine how this can be brought about.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a Green Paper on the development of services for the mentally ill and new mental health legislation was published in June 1992.  The Green Paper was circulated widely to provide an opportunity for interested parties to submit views on new mental health legislation proposals.  My Department received approximately 100 submissions on the Green Paper.  These submissions <Col N="1036" /> have been examined by my Department to establish the broadest possible degree of consensus in relation to proposals for new legislation.  My Department is currently finalising proposals for a new mental health Act.  It is my intention to bring forward new legislation without delay.</P>
      <P>However, I am also concerned that the small number of contentious issues in relation to the new legislation are given due consideration before decisions are taken.  I can assure the Deputy that a new mental health Act will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1037" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 31, 48, 63 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I am concerned to ensure that both the health boards and hospitals are equipped to respond to the demands which are placed upon them.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government allocated £20 million this year for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery, hip replacement and other procedures, ophthalmology, cataract, ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery, by-pass operations, vascular surgery, varicose veins and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties, and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  I am glad to say that substantial progress has been made towards achieving these objectives.</P>
      <P>With regard to hospital accident and emergency departments, because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict what the workload of these departments will be at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of a more appropriate bed.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the accident and emergency departments is exacerbated at times through, for instance, major accidents or epidemics such as the flu.  Some of these departments particularly in Dublin have experienced difficulties from time to time because of the number of elderly people requiring attention.  The difficulty here has not primarily been the provision of acute hospital beds but of insufficient step-down facilities for patients in need of a lower level of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the accident <Col N="1038" /> and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. In this regard, shortly after coming into office, I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of this type.</P>
    <P>Following further discussions in recent weeks, I have allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.  This is being achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin, who are no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition.</P>
    <P>To date the Eastern Health Board has placed 86 of these patients in step-down accommodation and a further 23 patients will be placed in the coming days.  I am confident this action will greatly relieve the seasonal pressures on the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputies of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Beijing flu, the possibility of an outbreak occurring here this year was indicated by the Department of Health as far back as April 1993 and the usual arrangements for ordering and distributing stocks of the vaccine were put in place.  These consist of health boards distributing sufficient stocks to protect &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; persons on the GMS category and pharmacists ordering the holding stocks for their private patients.</P>

      <P>Genetic counselling is largely provided in paediatric hospitals, paediatric units and in obstetic hospitals and units throughout the country.  Genetic screening and testing facilities are available in the major university hospitals, in Dublin, Cork, and Galway.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, funds have been allocated over the past two years to Our Lady's Hospital for sick children in Crumlin for the establishment of a major medical genetics centre.</P>
      <P>A consultant medical geneticist/ professor of human genetics has been appointed to head up the service, and is expected to take up duty at the hospital on the 1 July 1994.  In the meantime, the appointee has been actively involved in the arrangements for the setting up of the Medical Genetics Laboratory at the hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the ethical issues arising from genetic counselling, the position is that the ethical guidelines for the running of the unit are a matter for the hospital authorities and must conform to the standards set down by the Medical Council and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in relation to reproductive medicine.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of visually impaired people regarding the availability of technical aids and realise that there is room for general improvement in technical aids assessment and provision <Col N="1040" /> in Ireland.  This is an area of particular concern to me as it forms a vital link in the practical application and promotion of the concept of &ldquo;independent living&rdquo; for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>The question of providing appropriate technical aids is being addressed by the Review Group on Services for People with a Physical or Sensory Disability which I set up last year.  It will report to me next year and I will give due consideration to its recommendations.</P>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee recently launched by the Minister for Education examined the provision of specialised equipment and materials to schoolchildren.  My Department will be giving careful consideration to its recommendations and will liaise with the Department of Education in this regard.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I say that, while modern technology has ensured that there is an ever-increasing range of equipment available to assist disabled people, the Deputy will appreciate that, in the light of competing demands for development of other services for the physically and sensory disabled, wider provision of what is often very costly equipment can only come about on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 170 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know the European Community designated this year to honour <Col N="1041" /> its older citizens, to focus on the challenges and opportunities of an ageing Europe and to reinforce links between the generations.  The year is the culmination of the Community's programme for the elderly which was adopted as a result of the EC's Social Charter.  During this year the Community and the member states have tried to heighten the awareness of the position of the elderly and of the challenges which an ageing population holds for society and community policies.</P>
    <P>To prepare for and manage the year in this country, my Department established a co-ordinating committee in July 1992, chaired by Mr. Larry Twomey, former chairperson of the National Council for the Elderly.  The national co-ordinating committee is representative of the social partners of the voluntary bodies representing or providing services to the elderly, and of the statutory bodies with responsibilities for services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to make £440,000 available to the co-ordinating committee to fund its programme of promotion and sponsorship of activities to celebrate the year.  The committee approved grants to 170 groups and organisations, mainly voluntary, which organised suitable events to celebrate the aim and spirit of the year. These projects were in addition to the estimated 5,000 events organised as part of the year in villages, towns and cities throughout the country.  The year stimulated cross border exchanges which helped to strengthen links between older people in both parts of this island and between organisations working on their behalf.  These links will, I believe, be one of the lasting benefits of the year.</P>
    <P>This important year is also being marked by improvements in the health services which will benefit the elderly, namely, the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September and the expansion of facilities for hip replacements and cataract surgery as a result of the major action programme on hospital waiting lists.  The action programme provides for an additional 1,117 hip replacement operations <Col N="1042" /> and 2,145 cataract operations.  The estimate for my Department in 1994 includes a sum of £5 million to continue the implementation of the Nursing Home legislation.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be present at the ceremony in Brussels last Wednesday to mark the end of the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations. At that ceremony a Declaration of Principles, agreed by all the member states, was published.  The declaration commits the member states to recognise in their legislation and policies, the full citizenship of the elderly, in freedom and with equal rights and obligations, in all areas of the life of the community.  In the Declaration, the Commission commits itself to making medium-term proposals in 1994 for increased Community support for member state policies which continue to contribute towards achieving the objectives of the European Year.  The Government has endorsed the principles in the Declaration and looks forward to the medium-term proposals of the Commission in 1994 for continued action in favour of older people.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish in the near future a health charter for the elderly.  I have invited the National Council for the Elderly to advise me on the contents of this charter and am awaiting their response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department collects in-patient activity data from all public hospitals on a monthly basis and each year selected statistics are published in the health statistics series of reports.  Information by specialty, including paediatrics i.e. where <Col N="1043" /> there is a practising paediatric consultant, is published for each individual hospital.</P>
    <P>Paediatric analysis on a national level is available from the hospital in-patient inquiry (HIPE) scheme.  These figures relate to children aged under 15 years of age discharged from all public hospitals. The volume of data collected under the monthly in-patient activity scheme and under the HIPE scheme is quite immense and consequently it is possible to publish selective data only.  The more detailed data are of course used by my Department and by the health boards in the planning of services.  The comprehensiveness and timeliness of these data are being continually improved.</P>
    <P>The information collected by my Department relates only to activity in public hospitals.  Private hospitals do not at present participate in the provision of data and I have no authority to require them to do so.</P>

      <P>All health agencies are aware of their obligations under the relevant EC directives in relation to purchasing contracts. Under the waiting list initiative which I launched earlier this year, the Deputy will be aware that my Department entered into agreements with health boards and hospitals throughout the country whereby some 17,000 additional patients, over and above the normal throughput, would be treated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central feature of the initiative is that the agreed additional activity targets would be achieved by individual agencies in 1993.  It was also made clear to the agencies involved that where they were <Col N="1044" /> satisfied that their own hospitals could not achieve the agreed targets, for whatever reason, they should endeavour to have the operations carried out elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In all such cases, it is a matter for the agency concerned to satisfy itself fully that the contracting hospital can meet the requirements in terms of timeframe, cost and quality of care.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that, due to difficulties in recruiting a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon, the Southern Health Board was not in a position to carry out the 300 additional hip replacement operations for which they had contracted.  In these circumstances, the board made arrangements with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast to perform the operations on a contract basis. Before entering into a contract with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, the Southern Health Board approached all the suitable public and private hospitals in the country.  The board awarded the contract to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on the basis of competitive cost and the ability of that hospital to meet the board's requirements in terms of timescale and quality assurance.</P>

      <P>In March of this year I made regulations concerning the advertising and promotion of medicines to health professionals and the general public.  These regulations give effect to the 1992 EC Directive on the advertising of medicinal products for human use.  The regulations contain criteria regarding the offering of gifts or other benefits to health professionals which specify that such gifts must be inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy.  The area of hospitality is also covered and the regulations specify that this must be reasonable in level.  Provisions to deal with breaches of the regulations are also included.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in discussion with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on the framing of a code of practice for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the regulations.  I am satisfied that these measures will deal with any abuses in this area and I can assure the Deputy that I will keep the operation of these regulations under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure the safety of nursing staff, and indeed all personnel working in the health services.  I was therefore alarmed at the two recent incidents <Col N="1048" /> involving psychiatric nurses.  On 9 July last, three psychiatric nurses were assaulted while endeavouring to escort a psychiatric patient to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.  On the weekend of 16 October 1993, three psychiatric nurses were also attacked by intruders in the grounds of St. Brendan's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Eastern Health Board for a report on the latter incident.  Concerning the incident of 9 July, I requested the assistant inspector of mental hospitals to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assault and to make recommendations in relation to the escort of psychiatric patients.  The assistant inspector recently submitted to me his report on the incident.  He concluded that the assault in question falls into a one in a million category and its extraordinary rarity must in no way be used to put any escort procedure in place that would take from the dignity of patients, increase the unease of the already traumatised relatives, increase the likelihood of danger to escorts or diminish the professionalism of psychiatric nurses.</P>
    <P>Discussions have since taken place between the assistant inspector, officials of my Department and the Garda Síochána to discuss the legal responsibilities in relation to escorting patients.  The constraints of the current legal framework were discussed and it was agreed that legal changes were necessary to provide more suitable arrangements for escorting patients to psychiatric hospitals.  Proposals for new mental health legislation are currently being prepared in my Department and will include new provisions in relation to escorting psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>As a result of the assistant inspector's report and my meetings with the unions involved, my Department wrote to each health board on 12 October requesting various steps be taken to ensure the safety of nurses engaged on escort duty. On 26 October, officials from my Department met with union representatives to inform them of the outcome of the assistant inspector's report and of the steps taken to ensure the <Col N="1049" /> greater safety of psychiatric nurses on escort duty.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting the union representatives myself in the near future and I hope in the light of the assistant inspector's report and the action I have taken, that psychiatric nurses will feel assured of their safety.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for recognising hospitals and other facilities for training purposes lies with the appropriate higher training bodies.  In the case of surgery, the appropriate body is the Irish Surgical Post-Graduate Training Committee at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My primary concern as Minister for Health is to ensure that the appropriate staffing and other resources are available to provide services to patients.  In the case of consultant appointments, Comhairle na nOspidéal has the statutory responsibility for regulating the number and type of such appointments.  I understand that the Comhairle takes account of guidelines and recommendations issued by the training bodies.  However, these guidelines are only one element of the many factors taken into account by the Comhairle in assessing applications for the creation of consultant posts.</P>

    <P>Of the hospitals listed by the Deputy, I understand that a formal proposal for the creation of a second consultant surgeon post has been made by the North-Eastern Health Board for Louth County <Col N="1050" /> Hospital.

      <P>Ireland, along with the United Kingdom, sought to have Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) excluded from the terms of the Directive on the organisation of working time because we believed that the provisions of the Directive were incompatible with the service and training requirements of Irish hospitals.  The Deputy may also be aware that a major improvement in the working hours of Irish NCHDs was achieved in 1989 with the introduction of a 65 hour week.  To achieve this objective, in excess of 200 additional NCHD posts were created at an annual cost in excess of £3.5 million. A very thorough exercise was undertaken to draw up rosters based on a 65 hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary concern is that patient care is delivered in a satisfactory and safe manner.  Obviously the physical and mental state of those delivering that care can have an impact on the quality of the care delivered.  I am satisfied that the 65 hour week, which was implemented on an agreed basis between hospital managements, consultants and NCHDs, provides a satisfactory basis for the delivery of good quality care.  However, I am concerned at reports that some of the rosters agreed to in 1989 are not being adhered to.  To some extent, this is inevitable from time to time given the demands that are <Col N="1051" /> sometimes made on hospital services.  I am more worried by serious and continuing breaches of agreed rosters.</P>
    <P>If my Department is made aware of such breaches, they will be investigated and rectified.  I will be discussing these and related issues with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation shortly.  I am confident that, with the co-operation of hospital managers and consultants, we can deal with these problems which have arisen.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his/her spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for <Col N="1052" /> social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of disabled people living at home with their parents where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, that the rules concerning assessment of spouse's earnings are less favourable under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  My Department is examining the cost implications of bringing the method of assessing spouse's earnings under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme into line with arrangements that apply to social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>While the instances referred to by the Deputy are uncommon, I would be most concerned if a health professional, including a general practitioner, suffered injury and subsequent financial loss in performing any professional duties associated with psychiatrically ill patients.</P>
      <P>The contractual relationship between general practitioners and the State mainly relates to the General Medical Services and there are extensive sick leave provisions for general practitioners under the agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation for the provision of services under the General Medical Services Scheme.  The agreement provides that general practitioners who are unable to provide services because of injury will continue to receive their appropriate fees and allowances in full for up to six months in a 12 month period and for an aggregate of 12 months during any continuous period of four years.  In addition, contributions are paid to the doctor towards the employment of a suitably qualified locum doctor to provide general practitioner services in the doctor's practice.  Should longer periods of absence be necessary, sick leave facilities also apply, albeit at a lesser rate of contribution.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that provisions under the GMS contract are sufficient to meet the needs of participating general practitioners in most instances.  Such provisions are without prejudice to a general practitioner pursuing a civil action against any person in relation to injury or loss.  It would be a matter for the courts to determine liability and the award of any damages.</P>

      <P>Outpatient dental, ophthalmic and aural services are not provided in public hospitals other than for medical card holders and patients receiving treatment arising out of child health examinations.  This is in accordance with the provision of section 56 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, and the Health Services Regulations, 1972.  The intention of these provisions was to ensure that persons outside of these groups would not attend hospital outpatient departments for dental, ophthalmic and aural services which would more appropriately be provided by community based practitioners e.g. dentists, opticians/ophthalmologists and general practitioners.</P>
      <P>It was not intended to restrict out-patient attendances for treatment which is appropriate to the hospital setting.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The area of activity referred to in the Deputies' questions is one of the areas which is described under the generic heading of alternative or complementary medicine.  The entire issue of alternative and complementary therapies has traditionally been a difficult and very controversial one.</P>
      <P>In this country, practitioners of these therapies are free to practice so long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners and so on.  Practitioners in these areas are not employed in the public health service. Their position as regards their private dealings with their clients would be subject to the generality of civil law.  The position in the United Kingdom is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the very miscellaneous and diverse nature of the complementary therapies, my general approach to this issue would be to encourage the various therapies to establish their own representative associations and to put in place such appropriate <Col N="1056" /> structures of self-regulation as they themselves deem appropriate.  They can also, of course, undertake to inform the general public and orthodox registered medical practitioners and other health care professionals about the availability of services from reputable therapists.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will understand, I am not in a position to pronounce on the efficacy or effectivness of this or that alternative or complementary therapy, or on the bona fides of individual therapists and practitioners.</P>
    <P>I think it would be undesirable for my Department to become involved in this complex area by attempting to adjudicate upon various claims and counter-claims made in relation to alternative and complementary medicine, thereby being drawn into disputes between the established conventional health care professions and the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; groups, and into disputes between the various alternative therapies themselves.</P>

      <P>At present it is not possible to say with certainty what the incidence of prostate cancer is in Ireland each year.  This information will be available from 1994 from the new national cancer register.  The main objective of systematic screening is the prevention or the early diagnosis of certain conditions with a view to curing or stabilising the condition.  In general, screening programmes involve the carrying out of specific diagnostic procedures on apparently well individuals, on a mass population basis, to detect those with previously undiagnosed disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Studies which have been carried out abroad suggest that a national screening programme for prostate cancer may result in the unnecessary treatment of a large number of men.  The medical advice <Col N="1057" /> available to me is that at present the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of the three diagnostic tests used to detect prostate cancer are too low to justify their use in a national screening programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which is just over one year in force, has imposed for the first time ever a statutory duty on the health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children. In anticipation of the commencement of this provision, additional funding was made available to the health boards during 1991 and 1992 for the development of new services and facilities for homeless children.  Over 40 extra hostel and other residential places have been developed in the Dublin area and an additional 30 places outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government indicated its commitment to the full implementation of the Child Care Act over a three year period and have made available an additional £5 million this year to begin the process.  I have recently approved a package of new developments for each health board area which includes the provision of additional residential places for the young homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, where the incidence of youth homelessness <Col N="1058" /> is highest, I have approved the following initiatives: additional funding for Focus Point &ldquo;Off the Streets&rdquo; project which provides accommodation for difficult to place youngsters; additional funding for Eccles Street hostel to increase places from 12 to 14; provision of funding for boys' hostel at Botanic Road, Glasnevin; funding for accommodation for adolescent girls at Salvation Army, Eden Quay.</P>
    <P>Outside of the Eastern Health Board area, the new service developments include: the provision of a grant of £100,000 towards the development of Termon Residential Centre for Homeless Girls in Cork and the development of a new residential service for homeless children and abused spouses in Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Estimates include a provision of £15 million to implement the Child Care Act during the coming year.  This will meet the full year costs of the various initiatives launched this year and will also finance a further round of major new service developments that will amount to £10 million in a full year.  While the precise details of new service developments still have to be finalised with the health boards it is my intention that further progress will be made next year towards the provision of a comprehensive range of facilities and services that are geared to address the specific needs of this particularly vulnerable group of children.</P>
    <P>I have received a copy of the report referred to by Deputy O'Donnell and I am currently examining it.  I have been assured by the Eastern Health Board that it will have full regard to the report in the context of planning further initiatives to combat the incidence of homelessness among young people in its area.</P>

      <P>The proposal to transfer the General Register Office to Roscommon arose in the context of the policy of decentralising Government offices.  There are many factors to be considered in deciding on how best to implement the proposal. These include maintenance of an acceptable level of service to the public, need for legislative change, cost, timescale and so on.</P>
      <P>The extent to which it is technically feasible and cost effective to computerise the operation of the registration system also has an important bearing on the way in which the re-located office would operate in the future.  Preparatory work on a computerisation project is now well advanced and this will require a significant infusion of resources in 1994 and later years.  A detailed analysis of the various options for re-location has been carried out by my Department, the outcome of which I am currently considering.</P>

      <P>Consultations have taken place between both Departments on a range of legislative matters relating to the welfare of children, including the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The timescale for the implementation of that Act has been decided by the Government.  The legislation is to be brought into operation in its entirety over a three year period.  Primary responsibility for ensuring that this objective is achieved rests with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase of implementation involves the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI of the Act which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to <Col N="1066" /> children in their care.  The need for the early implementation of these key provisions, which will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the Garda to intervene in cases of child abuse, has been underlined in the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation.</P>
    <P>When these priority provisions have been brought into operation, arrangements will then be made for the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Act, including Part VII which provides for the supervision of pre-school services and in which my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has a particular interest.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that there will be consultations between my Department and the relevant interest groups, both statutory and voluntary, in relation to the preparation of the various sets of new regulations required to give full effect to the Act.  This will be done as part of a structured programme for the implementation of the legislation within the timescale determined by the Government.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues in Government are fully committed to resourcing the Child Care Act.  This is reflected in the Health Estimates for 1994, which includes a provision of £15 million for the implementation of the legislation.  These extra funds will meet the full costs of the various initiatives launched this year with the initial provision of £5 million.  It will also finance a further round of major new service developments that will amount to £10 million in a full year.  The scale of this investment in the child care area is unprecedented and demonstrates our determination to put in place a comprehensive range of services and supports to assist children and families in need.</P>

      <P>I have not had any such assessment carried out nor have I received reports from the health boards indicating a particular health problem in this area.  Any health or hygiene hazard that might arise from the disconnection of water supplies would, of course, be of concern to me. However, I am advised by the Department of the Environment that before disconnection of the water supply is considered the ability of the householder to pay water charges is taken into account.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="1068" /> determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
      <P>Persons, with conditions such as that described by the Deputy, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  There are no plans at present to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provides assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.</P>

      <P>It is the accepted practice that certain hospital services such as intensive care units, coronary care units and some geriatric facilities accommodate both male and female patients.  In the interests of ensuring that the privacy and dignity of patients are respected, I would be concerned at any mixing of patients, outside of the special <Col N="1069" /> areas to which I have referred.  Occasionally it can happen that the urgent demand for beds for one of the sexes exceeds the number available and it may, therefore, become necessary to accommodate patients of both sexes in the one area for a short period.  I am informed that this practice is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy has a specific case in mind, I would, of course, be willing to have it investigated.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, however, additional funding amounting to £12.5 million is being made available in 1994 to continue the development of services for people with mental handicap.  This is in addition to the funding of £14.5 million which was made available in 1992 and 1993.  This funding enabled an additional 617 day places to be provided in a broad range of community based day services.</P>
      <P>Among the additional services to be provided in 1994 will be over 500 day places which will once again be spread over a wide variety of community based services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise services to be provided in each region will be decided in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees who will identify the priorities within their regions.  Funding of approximately £26 million per annum will continue to be provided over the next six years from the EC Structural Funds for the training of people with disabilities for employment. Many young people with disabilities avail of these training programmes.  In addition, a major capital programme to provide additional training centres for people with disabilities will commence in 1994.  The programme will cost £36 million and will be spread over six years. <Col N="1072" /> Up to £4 million will be spent on the programme in 1994.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £3 million is being provided in 1994 for further developments in services for people with physical disabilities and in improved psychiatric services based on the recommendations in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>I am not happy with the present uptake of the MMR vaccination programme.  As the Deputy is aware I have recently established a working group under the chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer of my Department to review the existing arrangements for the delivery of vaccinations and measles immunisations and to make recommendation on how these can be improved.  This group includes representatives from my Department, the Health Boards, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Society of Medical Officers of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation and is expected to report very early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the IMO has deferred its threat to withdraw from the immunisation programme from 1 January 1994.  The Department is in touch with the health boards at present to assess the increased level of uptake of vaccinations following the recent advertisement campaign.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the early discharge of long stay patients from psychiatric hospitals to home-based community care without adequate follow up.  I can assure the Deputy that before a long-stay patient is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, a thorough assessment is carried out by a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that the patient is able to cope with community living.  Patients also participate in rehabilitation programmes to ensure that the transition to community living is successful. Indeed, a recent survey carried out by the Eastern Health Board established that of the 450 long-stay patients who have been discharged to community day and residential care from St. Brendan's Hospital over the past few years, all were satisfactorily accounted for.</P>
      <P>Patients admitted for acute short term psychiatric treatment are discharged as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of their illness.  I have been assured that in all cases adequate arrangements are made for them to continue their treatment under the care of their local GP or by receiving treatment as day patients of the psychiatric services. If necessary, their GP can refer them back for further treatment by the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of community residences and training hostels for discharged long-stay patients has increased from just over 121 in 1984 to 324 in 1991.  The number of places in these residences and hostels has also increased from just over 900 to 2,288 in the same period.  Day hospitals and day centres for the mentally ill have also been established to cater for patients <Col N="1075" /> living in the community and to prevent admissions to hospitals which might otherwise take place.  In 1984 there were 32 day hospitals and centres providing 800 places compared to 114 providing approximately 2,500 places at the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>All community facilities are inspected by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals during his inspections of local psychiatric services and the inspector has commented that physical conditions in these facilities were generally of a very high standard.  In most cases the inspector noted that accommodation in these facilities was substantially better than the accommodation which is available in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the policy of discharging patients from psychiatric hospitals to the community is in line with Government policy as outlined in the 1984 Report of the Study Group on the Development of the Psychiatric Services, <i>Planning for the Future</i> and the <i>Green Paper on Mental Helath</i> which was published in June 1992.</P>

    <P>The unallocated balance of £3.2 million was carried over into 1993 for inclusion in this year's allocations to Departments/Agencies.</P>
    <P>Details of national lottery sales and prize payments are contained in the Annual Reports of An Post National Lottery Company, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>As regards the total amount of money distributed by my Department since the inception of the national lottery, I might perhaps explain that prior to 1990 all funds for lottery-approved programmes were voted in a single subhead in the Vote for my Department.  My Department, in turn, released funds to suspense accounts maintained by the Departments directly responsible for the relevant lottery programmes.  This system was appropriate in the early stages of the lottery when the amount of funds available could not be accurately predicted early in the year.  Technically, therefore, my Department distributed all lottery allocations in the period 1987-1989.  However, only one grant was actually made by my Department in the period 1987-89; this was a grant of £20,800 made in 1989 to Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 lottery funds are no longer issued from a single subhead in the Finance Vote.  Instead, the expenditure is provided for in appropriate subheads in the Votes of the relevant Departments. The present system is more appropriate because it is transparent, and because it ensures greater direct accountability to the Oireachtas for the spending of lottery funds by the Minister/Department directly concerned.</P>

      <P>The person in question was a member of the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees.  As members of this scheme are normally entitled to the full range of social welfare benefits, the scheme is structured so as to ensure that the sum of (a) the scheme pension; and (b) the person's social welfare entitlement is equal to the pension payable to a person with no social welfare entitlement.  Accordingly, if (as in this case) a person retires before social welfare pension age, the initial pension awarded under the scheme is usually greater than that payable if the person had attained pension age.  However when the person concerned reaches social welfare pension age, and secures a higher social welfare entitlement, an appropriate adjustment is made in the scheme <Col N="1080" /> pension to take account of the higher rate of social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The above procedure was applied in this case, but it has now come to light that the actual rate of the social welfare payment to the person concerned differs from the figure used in adjusting the scheme pension.  The correct adjustment will be applied to the pension as soon as the Department of Social Welfare confirms the correct figure.</P>

      <P>People claiming unemployment payments may participate in part-time educational courses where it can be shown clearly that the course will not interfere with their availability to accept full time employment.  Factors which deciding officers take into account in determining such courses include, the type of course involved, its duration and the hours of attendance and study.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Deputy has in mind the case of a particular person who claimed unemployment assistance on 13 October 1993.</P>
      <P>Her claim was disallowed on the basis that she did not satisfy the statutory condition of being available for employment due to her participation in a postgraduate degree course at Dublin City University. The deciding officer while recognising that the course was part-time took the view that the duration of the course, over two years, and the requirement as part of the course to participate in work experience, precluded the person concerned from being freely available to accept employment during this period.</P>
      <P>She appealed the disallowance and an independent appeals officer also disallowed her claim.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas.  This allocation is made having regard to the overall demands for policing services balanced against factors such as crime levels and population shifts. I am informed by the Commissioner that, taking these matters into account, the current distribution throughout the country is intended to achieve the optimum use of existing Garda manpower and resources.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific question asked the Garda authorities inform me that the rural area in question forms part of the Ballymacarberry sub-district.  The strength of this sub-district is one sergeant and two gardaí and this has remained unchanged over the past three years.  The station is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sundays.  The area is also patrolled from the District Headquarters at Dungarvan and if the need arises, the patrol car from Lismore is also made available to respond to calls in the area.  The Garda authorities have no plans to alter the current policing arrangements in the area, which they consider to be adequate to meet the needs there, but they are being kept under continuing review.</P>

      <P>The persons named were visited by a Teagasc adviser on 5 August as part of a survey to assess the losses suffered by the horticulture industry due to abnormal weather conditions last May.  This survey was carried out by Teagasc at the request of the IFA and was done without any commitment by me to provide assistance.  On 12 November 1993 I announced that I had established a fund of £1 million out of which assistance will be granted to horticulture and potato growers who suffered major or total crop losses.  The details of the scheme, including the form of application for assistance, are currently being discussed with Teagasc and will be announced as soon as those discussions have concluded.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> I am aware that some people in the horticulture industry have been adversely affected by the severe weather of the 8-9 December.  However there are no funds available to my Department out of which assistance could be provided.</P>

      <P>The only project funded by my Department with national lottery funds is the restoration of the GPO Building, Dublin. To date national lottery funds amounting to £2,888,219 have been paid, through grants, to An Post for the project.  The provision in this year's Vote for my Department for the project is £729,000. My Department has not allocated any national lottery funds to community, sporting or voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>The reform of the law on occupiers' liability is an issue which is receiving priority within my Department and proposals will be brought forward as quickly as possible to update that law, taking into account the work of the Law Reform Commission.  In this context, the commission recently held a seminar, at <Col N="1107" /> which my Department was represented, to give the various interested groups an opportunity to develop further their initial responses to the consultative paper which was published by the commission. The legislation will aim to accommodate the concerns of those groups to the greatest extent practicable.</P>

It is my intention to develop and expand the service and establish it on a permanent basis.  Development proposals, including the provision of services in locations outside Dublin, are at an advanced stage in my Department.  A provision of £300,000 has been made for the service in 1994, which is more than double the 1993 provision, to facilitate this expansion and development.  My priority at present is the development of the service and consideration will be given in due course to the question of legislation.</P>

    <P>The Health Research Board, HRB, the State agency primarily responsible for medical research, directly funds the employment of 121 people in medical research at present.  This figure includes postgraduate students on HRB scholarships. In addition, 114 people work on HRB funded projects who are not paid by the board.  However, it is likely that there is a large element of double counting between the EOLAS figures and those of the HRB.  It is not, therefore, possible to estimate a combined employment figure under these two headings.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that a very large proportion of those engaged in medical research either work in hospitals or in the private industry for which limited information is available. For example, EOLAS records in its <i>Business Expenditure on Research and Development, 1991</i> a total of 638 persons employed in the pharmaceutical industry in that year &mdash; 381 researchers, 187 technicians and 70 support staff.</P>
    <P>State funding for medical research is channelled through the HRB which is funded by a grant from my Department.</P>

    <P>The HRB's 1994 allocation is £2.303 million and this represents an increase of 30 per cent over the 1992 figure.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that HRB spending is not limited to its Department grant: it supplements its grant from its own resources and with external funding.  The HRB also assists Irish researchers who seek international funding.  This assistance significantly increased the number of Irish researchers who gained funding under the EC BIOMED Programme in 1992.</P>
    <P>Medical research in acute hospitals is also funded through my Department. This funding forms an integral part of medical education and health care provision but is not separately identified within the individual acute hospital's allocation.</P>
    <P>Medical research carried out in Ireland is of a high standard and is internationally recognised.  Its benefits are many: it advances the standards of both medical education and medical care, it provides challenging employment for some of our brightest people and this, in turn, builds up a level of skill and expertise which can serve as a means of attracting both international research funding and industry such as international drug companies to this country.</P>

      <P>Very limited information is available in regard to attempted suicide and it may not be possible to supply the information sought.  I am having the position in this matter examined and I will write to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to a recent Adjournment Debate, Dáil Official Report of 25 November 1993, columns 707-709, which sets out the role of my Department in regard to the appropriate response to the problem of suicide and attempted suicide.</P>

      <P>The 1992 agreement with the medical organisation included a number of initiatives, including indicative drug targets for individual doctors, to promote better quality and cost effective prescribing in the GMS.  On the basis of the figures available, a number of doctors will achieve savings on their targets in 1993.  These savings will be used, in accordance with the 1992 agreement, to fund specific developments in individual practices and in the GMS service overall rather than to increase doctors salaries.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to revise the 1993 targets which were set last year.  Discussions on the 1994 targets are ongoing with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>

The health board has indicated that during the period of this <Col N="1116" /> patient's admission, she was necessarily transferred to three different wards in order to facilitate the emergency admission of other patients.  According to the health board, the medical treatment and nursing care provided to this patient was of a high standard, and her physical condition was not put at risk at any time. The health board has expressed its regret at the inconvenience caused to the patient by the transfers.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> The Government is making available an additional £12.5 million in 1994 to develop services for people with mental handicap and their families.  This funding will build on the improvements resulting from the additional funding of £14.5 million made available in 1992 and 1993.  The precise services to be provided in each region will be decided in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.  St. Michael's House is represented on the co-ordinating committee for the eastern region.</P>

      <P>Scoil Paipin Naofa is a new gaelscoil which opened on 1 September 1993 in temporary accommodation in the Setanta Sports Complex, Poppintree. The school was granted temporary recognition only as is usual with all new Gaelscoileanna. It is only after a number of years of satisfactory operation that permanent recognition would be considered and the question of permanent accommodation would then arise.  In the meantime it is a matter for the school authorities to provide temporary accommodation for the school.  I understand that the school authorities intend providing prefabricated accommodation on a site in the Santry area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of all national schools is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of Scoil Paipin Naofa there were 23 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1993 which <Col N="1125" /> warrants a staff of principal only for the 1994-95 school year.</P>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements is in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. The school might qualify for the appointment of an extra teacher in September 1994, as a developing school.  No application however has been made to my Department for such an appointment to date.  Any such application will receive due consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>Where primary teachers are absent on certified sick leave, maternity leave or jury service, the board of management of a school may employ a qualified substitute teacher, who will be paid by my Department.  In the case of a teacher absent on unpaid leave, the board of management may employ a temporary qualified teacher who will be paid by my Department.</P>
      <P>A number of boards of management in the Dublin area have indicated verbally, that on occasions they have experienced difficulty in obtaining the services of a qualified substitute teacher.</P>
      <P>My Department has introduced, with effect from 1 September 1993, a two year pilot project in three areas, Ballymun/Finglas, Limerick city and North Mayo.  The short term substitute needs of selected schools in these areas are provided by a panel of ten temporary teachers employed in each area, while the long-term substitution needs are provided in the traditional manner.  My Department is closely monitoring the project and the experience provided will be of assistance in formulating proposals for alternative arrangements for substitute supply nationally.</P>

      <Quest>the reason St. Brigid's Girls' School, Cabinteely, County Dublin is to lose its 16th teacher in January 1994; and if, in view of the fact that the school reached the required number of pupils on 16 October 1993, and that the school was only one pupil short of the required number on 30 September 1993, she will sanction the continuation of this school as a 16 teacher school.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Brigid's boys national school, there were 503 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus 15 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher.  The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.</P>
      <P>The school authorities applied in April 1993, to my Department for sanction to appoint a 16th assistant on the basis that its projected enrolment of 534 pupils for September 1993, met the criteria laid down for designation as a developing school.</P>
      <P>My Department sanctioned this additional assistant on a provisional basis, subject to the condition that a minimum enrolment of 533 be achieved when the teacher took up duty (this was the enrolment required under the criteria for designation as a developing school).  The enrolment in the school on 30 September 1993, was 516, which was 17 pupils short of that laid down in my Department's letter of sanction.</P>
      <P>A strict policy is operated in relation to teaching posts sanctioned on a provisional basis.  Such posts are withdrawn if the conditions specified by my Department are not met.  The school was allowed to retain the post up to the Christmas vacation in order to minimise any disruption in the school and to give the school authorities time to formulate alternative arrangements for classes.</P>

      <P>County Clare vocational education committee is the vocational education committee in question.  Claims were submitted in respect of nine teachers.  The maximum amount of the honorarium was £657 per teacher per annum with effect from 1 September 1991, increased to £676 with effect from 1 March 1992.  The criteria which were not satisfied were those set out in Circular Letter 5/48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of Circular Letter 5/48, an honorarium may be paid to any rural science teacher who, in the opinion of my Department's Inspectors, <Col N="1129" /> has given adequate attention to the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the organisation and development within the school area of adult evening classes (discussion groups) in Agricultural science; (b) the development of the school garden as an educational medium and particularly the use made of it for experimental and demonstration purposes.</P>
    <P>Other factors which are taken into account in determining the amount of the award, if any, which may be sanctioned include, in so far as the resources of the school and the circumstances of the locality allow, whether &mdash; (a) a public lecture scheme was undertaken by the teacher; (b) seed testing and home garden schemes were carried out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Claims were submitted by the vocational education committee in respect of nine Rural Science teachers. The vocational education committee requested my Department's sanction for the payment of the full honorarium to each teacher.  The hours claimed by individual teachers varied from approximately 27 hours 30 minutes to 192 hours. The claims submitted did not have sufficient detailed information to enable my Department to decide whether payment of the honorarium or a proportionate amount was warranted.  For example, some of the claims did not specify dates and times of the nature of the activity.</P>
    <P>Clarification on these matters and certification by the Principals were sought.</P>
    <P>Claims, duly authenticated, were re-submitted but, in a number of cases, the details on the number of hours involved differ from those on the original claim. This has given rise to further queries.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is anxious to finalise this matter without further undue delay.  Payment of the appropriate amount will be approved provided my Department is satisfied that the payment is warranted having regard to the terms of Circular Letter 5/48.</P>
