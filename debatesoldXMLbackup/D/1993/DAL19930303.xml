      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i>.  I now call on Deputy Noonan to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to move a motion under Standing Order 30 to allow the Dáil to debate the sale of the shares in Greencore held by the Department of Finance.  When the legislation to privatise the Irish Sugar Company was introduced into Dáil Éireann a commitment was given that not more than 15 per cent of the shareholding could be held by any one individual or institution. This condition was included in the prospectus of sale of the shares at the time of flotation and was also incorporated in the articles of the new company.  By entering into negotiations with a foreign multinational to sell to it in excess of 29 per cent of the total shareholding the Government has breached its commitment to Dáil Éireann.  I believe also, a Cheann Comhairle, that the announcement on budget day that the Government were to get involved in the sale of assets to yield £150 million included the sale of <Col N="402" /> Grencore, that the sale of Greencore is fundamental to the budgetary arithmetic and if it does not take place, then there is also a budgetary problem.</P>

      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, to substitute 11 a.m. for 3.50 p.m. in respect of the statements on the Greencore matter.  It seems pointless to proceed with a debate on the budget when uncertainty exists in regard to one of the crucial elements of the budget arithmetic which is whether or not there are to be receipts from the sale of Greencore.  In view of the fact that the prospectus upon which people bought shares in Greencore stated that no more than 15 per cent would be held by any one owner, the Government's budget seems now to be in conflict with legislation and the prospectus establishing Greencore.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party to giving additional time to this important issue.  I wish to express my concern that the Taoiseach seemed to attempt to mislead the House yesterday with regard to a decision already made by the Government when he sought to tell the House that no decision had been made.  It is a very serious matter for a Member of this House to attempt to mislead but it is particularly serious for the Taoiseach to attempt to do so.  I rise specifically to seek to amend the Order of Business in regard to another matter. I seek to amend No. 3 to read, that statements <Col N="404" /> on the Greencore matter shall be made at 11 a.m., as proposed by the Fine Gael Leader, and that statements on the Kilkenny incest case be made at 4.45 p.m. so that this House will have an opportunity not only to debate the Greencore matter today but also the Kilkenny incest case, between 4.45 p.m. and 7 p.m.</P>

      <P>In respect of the latter matter referred to by the Deputy, he may not introduce new matter as distinct from the proposals made by the Taoiseach, whose prerogative it is to propose specific matters.  The rape matter must be dealt with in another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in June 1987 we debated a case not dissimilar to this case &mdash; it was a rape case &mdash; when there was much public outcry about the outcome of the case and there was agreement across the floor that the matter should be debated.  The Taoiseach so far has refused to allow such a debate here.  You urged us yesterday to seek ways of raising this matter in an orderly way, and that is what I am trying to do here this morning.  I am seeking to get the Taoiseach to agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could be of help in solving this issue.  The Government has already instructed the Minister for Justice to bring forward at the earliest possible opportunity an amendment in this area of criminal law to ensure stiffer sentencing.  Perhaps that will solve the problem this morning.</P>

      <P>First, the Government is not in negotiations with anybody.  That will correct Deputy Bruton's first statement. Second, the budgetary figures are <Col N="406" /> not in danger.  The debate on the budget will be resumed immediately and the Deputy can refer all he likes to that matter.  There were statements on Digital last week, which were quite satisfactory, and I see no reason why the same arrangements cannot apply this evening. The debate on the budget will go on for most of the day but if the Opposition want five minutes more or something like that I do not have any problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a point to the Taoiseach which may be helpful?  The purpose of my amendment is twofold. First, it will allow this matter to be discussed before the debate on the budget is resumed and, second, it will allow more time for statements.  The Government is allowing only one hour for the debate on this subject this evening.  It seems to me that this is quite inadequate in view of the complexity of the matter and the fact that the Cabinet seems to be leaking all over the place on this issue.  May I suggest to the Taoiseach that he might allow a longer debate so that all of those who are making unattributable remarks about what they said to people on the phone, etc., will be able to come into the House and speak about it and, if necessary, give us transcripts of these phone calls?</P>

      <P>The positive impact of the budget on economic activity, employment and interest rates will become more apparent, as the year progresses.</P>
      <P>The budget was formed against a very difficult background of the continuing deep world recession, high unemployment at home, and costly fiscal adjustments to the Single Market, all of which place limits on what we are able to achieve this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> From next year, the new round of Structural Funds together with their more flexible application will enable us to do much more in the area of emloyment. As the agreed Programme for Partnership Government sets out, we plan a major community enterprise development programme that will move towards a participation level of 30,000 each year. We will be in a position to increase wage subsidies for employers hiring people who have been on the live register for a year or more, and to take other initiatives which will enable us to make substantial progress in reducing the numbers of people in long term unemployment.  We also plan to establish a comprehensive national training scheme, but the funds for many of these initiatives will not be available until next year.  Consequently, we have to concentrate on what was feasible in 1993.</P>
    <P>This budget is manifestly fair and equitable.  It is socially caring, and it is financially responsible.  The budget is always about choices, so one can always expect different responses from different sectors.  The budget contains no unacceptable burdens and impositions on personal taxpayers.  Despite the criticisms in this House and by many commentators, members of the public are relieved that they will not be significantly worse off as a result of the budget.  On the contrary, most people can look forward to at least a modest rise in net disposable income this year.  The budget is being seen by most people as a fair deal for everyone in difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>Our ability to bring in a budget of this kind, that nobody can describe as harsh, in very difficult times is a measure of the economic progress we have made since 1987.  We no longer have a financial crisis on our hands as we did in 1983 and again in 1987, and a harsh budget is not an appropriate instrument for tackling unemployment.  Our task this year is to provide a stimulus to the economy, through public capital spending. That cannot reasonably be expected to come from markets in present depressed world economic circumstances.  At the same time, we had to ensure that the hard-won financial and economic gains of the last six years are retained, so that we can participate in international recovery from the word go, something we conspicuously failed to do or were not in a position to do on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>We live, as we have been forcibly reminded in recent weeks, in a tough competitive world.  At home, we try to look after the weaker sections of our community.  But in the world outside, despite policies to develop greater solidarity and cohesion in the European Community, it is still largely a case of the survival of the fittest.  The Government are determined, that despite some recent setbacks, Ireland will be fit to compete and to gain employment, particularly once world recovery gets properly under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most remarkable achievements of the last six years has been our ability to maintain low single-figure inflation, averaging around 3 per cent. This has been the longest sustained period of low inflation for over 40 years. It was largely achieved with the help of the social partners and the two programmes. Since 1990, our inflation rate has been below Germany's and below the UK's, and our performance has been among the top three or four EC countries consistently.  Low inflation helps everyone, <Col N="424" /> whether they are in business, on farms, on pensions, on PAYE or on social welfare.</P>
    <P>In forming the budget we were very conscious of the need to keep down inflation, particularly after the recent devaluation.  That is why, for example, there are no excise duty increases on petrol which would have had a large knock-on effect on costs, or on beer and spirits.  In fact, there have been no excise duty increases on petrol since 1989, and in the last seven budgets including this one a grand total of 1p is all we have put on the price of a pint.  We would ask and expect that all commercial bodies, public and private, should show similar restraint in increasing prices.  The ESB in this respect is a model, having lived without a price increase since 1986.  As a result, we now have one of the lowest electricity prices in the EC, instead of one of the highest as has been said by some speakers in this House.</P>
    <P>As a result of this budget, 90 per cent of service industries are on the lower rate of VAT.  The VAT on a number of labour-intensive services, such as hairdressing and garage repairs, was reduced from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent, and in the case of biscuits without a chocolate content, by 8.5 per cent from 21 per cent. It was good to see the recent advertisements by labour-intensive industries in the confectionery, garage repairs and hairdressing sectors, saying they were reducing prices and thanking the Minister. I trust that the other goods and services benefiting from a reduction in VAT will also pass on those reductions to customers.</P>
    <P>Conversely, the increase in VAT on some other items should not be used as an excuse for disproportionate price increases.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will continue to watch developments carefully.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 we achieved a major improvement in our competitiveness, which led to a net increase of 45,000 jobs. In all previous recessions, we have lost employment heavily in net terms.  In the recession that lasted from 1980-86 we lost 75,000 jobs.  In the current recession we <Col N="425" /> have so far held our own, and have hung onto the employment gains made between 1987 and 1990.</P>
    <P>Last year, Ireland enjoyed the highest growth rate in the Community at 2.75 per cent of GDP.  This is all the more remarkable, given the fact that our closest trading partner, the UK, has experienced two and a half years of continuous recession.  This year, the EC in its annual report anticipates that Ireland will continue to have the strongest rate of economic growth, which we estimate at 2.5 per cent.  Industrial production rebounded last year to almost 10 per cent. We had renewed strong export growth of 9.3 per cent last year and a record trade surplus of over £3 billion.  Consumption increased by around 3 per cent.  All this is a clear reflection of the competitiveness of our economy.</P>
    <P>The need for continued pay moderation in the future in both the public and private sectors will remain essential to the maintenance of low inflation and the improvement of our competitiveness. Unlike the trading sector of the economy, which is exposed to market forces, the public service in its broadest definition enjoys the inestimable advantage in recessionary times of secure employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many employees in the private and even in the commercial semi-State sector have voluntarily accepted reductions in wages and conditions to protect their employment.  Again, this is not a sacrifice that has been demanded of anyone working in the established public service, although in 1987-88 there were agreed voluntary redundancy schemes. Through a combination of wage rounds and special pay increases, nearly all categories of public servants have enjoyed a substantial increase in remuneration between 1 January 1987 and 1 January 1993, ranging from nearly a third to over one-half in nominal terms compared with inflation of around 21 per cent in that <Col N="426" /> period.  In the same period the average industrial wage has increased by less than one-third.  The problems and overhangs inherited from the past and, to be fair, some legitimate catching up, all of which have been responsible for abnormally large increases in the overall public pay bill in recent years, will soon be largely ironed out of the system.  This provides a unique opportunity to restructure the system of pay determination more in line with what the nation can afford.</P>
      <P>The time is therefore approaching for a major reappraisal to ensure that there is a level playing field for all sectors of the economy.  We must always remember that the public service is there for the benefit of the community at large, and not the other way around.  In Germany in the last month a public sector wage round of 3 per cent has been agreed, at a time when their current inflation rate as estimated at 4.4 per cent.  As we know from the experience of the Programme for National Recovery, taking into account the broader picture, including tax relief and interest rate reductions, there can still be real income increases, even when nominal increases are below the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that apart from continuing low inflation, the other aspect which will have a most beneficial impact on employment is the level of interest rates.  I am glad that it has been shown in the past hour that the short term rate has come down to a rate approaching 12 per cent.  The current high level of interest rates is choking off investment and in some instances is creating trading difficulties.  The threat of any further rise in interest rates has receded since the budget, and there are already signs of some easing of interest rates, notably in the one month rates and in the rates to prime borrowers.  The past few days have shown a very clear direction in that regard.  We have also succeeded in rebuilding our external reserves into a strong position since devaluation.  We did not lose our reserves, as some commentators have claimed.  We used them to protect our currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement <Col N="427" /> in 1993 is, contrary to expectations, less than £50 million above the outturn for 1992, with the EBR rising from 2.8 per cent of GNP to 2.9 per cent.  The purpose of this is two-fold.  It is broadly compatible with the Maastricht guidelines, but, more important, in the short term it is designed to ensure that there are no domestic factors to prevent us benefiting from a reduction in interest rates during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement has been criticised in some quarters for being too high, but mostly for being too low.  I want to deal with both arguments. Given the rise in unemployment and the once-off factors affecting VAT and DIRT revenues with the coming into effect of the Single Market, it is a remarkable achievement to have held the EBR to under 3 per cent of GNP for the fifth year in succession.  The Fine Gael Party, during all its time in Government, could not get the EBR to under 12 to 13 per cent.  We will have in 1993 one of the lowest borrowing levels in the Community, below Germany's and way below that of the UK.  But once fiscal discipline is relaxed it is very easy for borrowing to get out of hand quickly, and bringing it back down again is a slow and painful business.</P>
    <P>We have kept public expenditure under very tight control.  At a time of low economic growth and increased social transfers, expenditure tends to rise somewhat as a proportion of national output, and this has happened to a small extent here.  Nevertheless, our public expenditure as a percentage of GDP will be the lowest in the European Community this year, on the basis of Commission estimates, and about 7 percentage points below the EC average.  There is, therefore, no objective justification for claims that this is a high-spending Government.</P>
    <P>The overhang of debt and the need to reduce the debt/GDP ratio, which will be set back a year by devaluation, makes it necessary to restrain expenditure tightly. If we want interest rates to fall, and that must be one of our highest priorities, <Col N="428" /> we have to show a clear commitment to continue tight budgetary control.  I reject suggestions that we had scope to borrow up to £200 million more.  Any positive employment effects that might have had could have been quickly cancelled out by higher interest rates resulting from doubts about the Government's continuing commitment to sound public finance.</P>
    <P>There are no short cuts to lower interest rates, and certainly not a devaluation a month, as proposed by Deputy Michael Noonan.  I find it hard to reconcile the new soft option, anti-European policies of Fine Gael Deputies with their former rhetoric.  The addition of another £1 billion to the national debt is obviously not a serious consideration to a party that doubled it when it was last in office.  If there were any evidence needed that the Fine Gael Party has ceased to be a serious party, this proposal surely provides it.  Fine Gael Deputies appear to have abandoned their Christian Democrat principles and become more and more attracted by the floating economic policies of some commentators and a small minority of financial institutions. Deputy Noonan was criticising the Government only last September for not maintaining the Irish pound within a narrower 1 per cent band of fluctuation against the German Mark than that permitted under EMS rules.  What a U-turn.</P>
    <P>Neither my party nor our partners in Government have ever subscribed to the view that it is sufficient to keep the economic fundamentals right and to leave the rest, and especially job creation, entirely to the market.  In times of world depression that is a counsel of despair. During the election the centrepiece of Fianna Fáil's strategy for dealing with unemployment was to give a big boost to public capital investment to stimulate economic activity.  The Labour Party adopted a similiar approach.  It was a key policy commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government which has already been honoured.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme of £2.4 billion is the largest ever and, unlike the investment plan in 1981, it is not based <Col N="429" /> on increaed borrowing.  There is no doubt that a large programme of this kind is very beneficial to employment in the short term, particularly in a recession.  It will help to slow down the rise in unemployment, and the Minister for the Environment estimates that up to 9,000 jobs could be created directly and indirectly in the construction industry, which is, of course, overwhelmingly an indigenous industry.  It is wrong to suggest that the employment is once-off.  Provided the money continues to be there, and it will be, thanks to more than £8 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds negotiated in Edinburgh, once one project is complete, construction workers will move on to the next.  We are raising the level of activity now, when it is most needed, but it will not subsequently fall back.</P>
    <P>By investing in our ports, our roads, our railways and by providing adequate water supplies and sanitary facilities, as well as developing our human resources through education and training, we are also improving our competitiveness. Bottlenecks or deficiencies in infrastructure seriously inhibit economic development.  Go around to any part of the country, and you will find that improving deficient infrastructure is one of the main demands for action, both from the point of view of improving competitiveness and enticing investment, and from the point of view of creating immediate jobs in construction.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is trying to suggest that this level of infrastructural investment is unnecessary or is not a priority.  Its decision in their 1984 plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, that county roads were not a priority and that there should be no new investment in railways or in the seventies that modern telecommunications were not a priority shows that this is a very shortsighted attitude.  The European Commission has a quite different view, and urges governments to follow policies aimed at increasing the dynamism and competitiveness of the economies through the removal of market impediments to economic growth, and at creating the conditions which will prevent <Col N="430" /> stronger employment creation in the medium term.</P>
    <P>At the Edinburgh European Council, member states were asked to exploit the margins for manoeuvre available in the budgetary area to implement measures to encourage private investment and to switch public expenditure towards infrastructure and other growth supporting priorities.  Most governments in the western world and, in particular, the Clinton Administration, are pursuing this policy, and so are we.</P>
    <P>The new Government is proceeding with the establishment of the county enterprise boards.  £25 million is provided in the budget with about £130 million coming from the financial institutions.  I have always attached great importance to this initiative as a means of boosting small enterprise.  It will give local ideas a better chance to be judged by people who know the region and who are sympathetic to local initiative.  Increased self-reliance has an important role to play. There was a supplement on Cavan in a newspaper at the weekend, which made the point that, despite few multinationals locating in Cavan, unemployment was lower than elsewhere, because of the amount of local enterprise.  Of course, we will continue to need multinational investment, which has accelerated national progress and the development of skills, but we need to fire on two cylinders, not one.  Many areas, like Galway today, are a repository of skills that will be both attractive to new foreign investors and that can be used to develop new local enterprises.  The Government will ensure that the full resources of the State are brought to bear to help replace the employment lost in Digital, as we succeeded in doing over a period of years in areas where there were very heavy job losses, such as Kilkenny, Limerick, Thurles or Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the implementation of the Culliton report.  Legislation is being prepared to set up the new industrial agencies.  The task force presented its final report on 13 January 1993.  The recommendations of Culliton have been largely accepted, and <Col N="431" /> in many cases are being implemented. In other areas further work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided incentives for investment in industry.  We renewed the business expansion scheme, as recommended by Culliton, and abolished the lifetime cap.  The new special investment accounts being introduced will provide a further incentive.  The Minister for Finance indicated he would be having discussions with managers of pension funds to increase their level of investment in Irish job creation, especially in manufacturing. There will be further measures in the Finance Bill, which will look among other things at the tax treatment of the owner's capital for business startups and incentives for employee investment.</P>
    <P>Disappointment has been expressed that the Government has not embarked on more radical tax reform this year. With changes in VAT and DIRT there has already been disruption of revenues. While the effect of the tax reforms over the last five years has been beneficial to the economy and will be beneficial to employment in the long term, no one should pretend that they have had any immediate impact in reducing substantially the level of unemployment. The evidence to the contrary is the 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>In fact, there is no evidence that tax reform has any short term impact on unemployment whatsoever.  The Progressive Democrats, particularly Deputy McDowell, long peddled the simplistic and fallacious notion that tax reform was the key to solving the unemployment crisis.  If he reads Culliton carefully, he will see that the report makes no such claim.  At times of economic difficulty reducing the top rate of tax, from which the really well-off benefit most, is not the biggest priority.  If you look across the water to Britain, which has the lowest tax rate in Europe for top earners of 40 per cent, it has not prevented unemployment rising to over three million again, and some 40,000 job losses were announced last week.  In Ireland, there has been very <Col N="432" /> substantial reductions in income tax, the standard rate down from 35 per cent to 27 per cent, and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent since my budget in 1989.  We did not reverse those rates in the budget, but we did introduce a 1 per cent income levy, so that we could support those without jobs.  Income tax yield is projected to increase this year by 6 per cent.  It is not too much to ask in solidiarity with the unemployed.  When conditions improve, the process of tax reform will be resumed, concentrated on taking those on low incomes out of the net altogether, and substantially widening the standard band.</P>
    <P>It is hard to take seriously Opposition criticism of the income levy, a relatively modest and temporary imposition.  Both the new Clinton Administration and the German Government have had to impose much greater tax increases on higher incomes or temporary levies on income amounting to 7 per cent.  It is said that a levy of this kind takes no account of differences in personal circumstances. That is true, but let us remember that radical tax reform as recommended by the Progressive Democrats would see us with straightforward income tax rates of 25 per cent or 40 per cent, with all or most of the allowances that would recognise differences in personal circumstances eliminated.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael seem to forget that in 1983 they introduced a 1 per cent income levy on top of a 5 per cent increase in the top rate of tax.  The levy lasted three years until 1986.  Totally ignoring the principle of collective responsibility, Deputy John Bruton has attempted to put all the blame on the Labour Party for this.  I have no difficulty in standing over the measure today.  The arguments about equity might have some force if we were talking about a 10 per cent or 25 per cent levy.  When one is speaking about 1 per cent, with an exemption limit of £9,000 compared to only £3,000 in 1983, so that it does not affect the low paid, then the argument is largely theoretical.  It will not apply to about 500,000 of the 1.1 million workforce. According to the Department of Finance, incomes are projected to rise by <Col N="433" /> approximately 6 per cent in 1993 so it is not too much to ask for 1 per cent to show solidarity with the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have provided substantial assistance, as we promised during the election, to those with heavy mortgage repayments. The raising of the ceiling to £5,000, the 100 per cent allowance for the first three years, and the temporary 90 per cent allowance for others represents a generous response to the problem.  It was right in the circumstances to concentrate the limited tax relief available more on mortgage holders and on the low paid.</P>
    <P>Neither of the Government parties believes that our public services should be allowed to run down in order to pay for tax reductions, especially as many services provided are short of funds even as things stand.  Post-1989 we restored the level of health spending, and in this budget we provided a further £20 million to deal with waiting lists.  Current health spending at over £1.8 billion is now 14.2 per cent of gross expenditure, instead of 12 per cent in 1989.</P>
    <P>On the capital side we have provided for 3,500 local authority housing grants. There has been a major increase in child benefit, which will help all families.  We have made special provision for the elderly in the budget with an increase in the carer's allowance, the provision of a free colour television licence, and money for the refurbishment of flats in Dublin's inner city.  The incomes of all social welfare beneficiaries are being protected and further progress is being made towards implementation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  There has been a large increase in the provision for services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The social measures in the budget are well targeted, and they continue the practice established since the 1989 budget, of doing more than is strictly required for the least well off in our society.  As the economy improves, we hope to be able to do more, and we all want to do more.</P>
    <P>From Fine Gael on the other hand we hear calls to dismantle effectively the existing social insurance system.  How will social welfare be paid for if up to £600 million provided by employers is <Col N="434" /> to be removed?  Is the general taxpayer expected to pick up the tab for the employers?  In every civilised country employers are expected to contribute towards the pensions of their employees, and to cover sickness and unemployment benefit, should they need them.  PRSI is not a tax on jobs.  It is a system of social insurance and of social obligation. Ireland has one of the lowest rates of employers' contribution in the EC at 12.2 per cent.  Would Deputies like to hear the rate of employers' social security contributions in other EC countries?  In Belgium it is 41.7 per cent, France 38 per cent, Germany 17.8 per cent, Italy 50 per cent, Portugal 24.5 per cent, Spain 30.3 per cent.  It could not be clearer that the level of social insurance and the level of unemployment are not directly connected. While the rate in Britain may be marginally lower than here, at 10.4 per cent, manufacturing employers in Britain pay 33 per cent corporation tax instead of our 10 per cent.  The arguments of Fine Gael do not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I might be more sympathetically disposed to listen to the argument that lower PRSI would mean more jobs, if there had been a more impressive uptake of the existing PRSI exemption scheme for new employees taken from the live register and of the wage subsidies and training schemes.  Of the 15,000 places available on the employment subsidy scheme, where there is a £54 per week subsidy for every new employee, there has only been a take-up of 6,000.  For the training scheme paying £45 per week, with funding for 10,000 places, there has only been a take-up of 600 jobs.</P>
    <P>A study was carried out in the Labour Market Review by John Sexton of the ESRI 12 months ago which showed that the effect of cutting employers' PRSI was not substantial, when compared with the size of the job creation requirement needed to make a serious dent in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The principal demand of the farm organisations during the recent election was that something should be done to raise substantially the tax thresholds for lifetime farm transfers between generations, <Col N="435" /> complementing the EC retirement scheme.  This has been attended to straightaway in our first budget.  The raising of thresholds and the probate tax provide a general incentive to lifetime transfers.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the budget represents a good start to the partnership Government for the following reasons: it delivers the promised boost to economic activity and employment; it maintains the tight budgetary discipline that will enable Ireland to benefit from lower interest rates; it provides the promised tax relief to mortgage holders and keeps tax increases to a minimum; it maintains the incomes of the less well off, and it contains carefully targeted social improvements that are priorities in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the budget to the House and to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad to hear the Taoiseach addressing the House seven days after the budget about unemployment and employment creation when the fact is that since the Minister for Finance announced the budget a further 1,000 people have been thrown on to the scrap heap of unemployment.  The Taoiseach continues to refer to task forces and reports and states that the fundamentals are right and the priorities are in order. I would question the Taoiseach's fundamentals and what his real priorities are in relation to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the last election I hoped that any Government elected by the people would address the main issues that confront this country, the creation of jobs, the elimination of unemployment and the reduction of taxation.  This was a difficult set of objectives for any new Government. However, the people were fed promises before and during the election campaign and were told that if they put the Labour Party into Government the national agenda would change, job creation would become a top priority and the gap between the well-off and the less well-off would be bridged.  The people were told there would be social justice <Col N="436" /> for everybody.  Those were the promises, but the reality is different because, unfortunately, as soon as the Labour Party got into power the socialist type policies it promised to introduce were replaced by cronyism of the worst type.  The only jobs that have been created to date have been those for friends and relations, sons and daughters, and first cousins of those in Government.</P>
    <P>The public's expectations were that the budget would create a new climate and introduce a set of policies that would create jobs for the 300,000 people unemployed. Unfortunately, the central issue on our political agenda has been totally ignored.  Not alone has job creation been ignored but workers, especially those in the PAYE sector, have been further crucified with the imposition of a so-called temporary little arrangement of a 1 per cent levy which I forecast will be in place for many years.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has abandoned the less well off in favour of power.  There is no real will to tackle the major problems of poverty and deprivation in our society. The result of unemployment is evident throughout our cities and towns with an increase in the crime rate, attacks on people and property, an increase in drug addiction and armed robberies.  Those incidents do not occur because people suddenly turn to crime.  People have turned to crime as a result of the bitterness which long term unemployment causes.  They turn to crime because of the expectations raised by Governments and political parties; people are forced into crime as a result of unemployment and the evils that go with it.</P>
    <P>What has been happening in our cities, towns and villages in recent years is a direct result of our unemployment crisis. Much comment has been made in regard to crime in the recent past &mdash; I am glad the Minister for Justice is present for this debate &mdash; and other politicians and I have demanded extra Garda resources for our cities and towns, but I would be the first to admit that recruiting extra gardaí in itself will not resolve the problem.  It will certainly help to put a lid on the awful happenings of recent times, but the <Col N="437" /> vicious crimes which take place in our cities and towns are a symptom of an underlying problem.</P>
    <P>The crime problem can be resolved by the creation of jobs for the thousands of people left without hope at present. People feel very bitter when their sons and daughters or fathers and mothers are unemployed for long periods.  In my constituency there is high unemployment, bad housing and inadequate health services.  Parts of my constituency have an unemployment rate of almost 80 per cent.  In putting together my thoughts on the budget, I judged it on how it will affect the people at present marginalised in my constituency and throughout the country and my conclusion was that this budget will marginalise them even further. The health charges, which were announced on the eve of the budget, are a vicious attack on people who have to pay their way.  Having listened to the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and his colleagues in the Labour Party opposing vehemently the last increases in health charges, it is sad that having achieved the mantle of office and seat of power they are now abandoning the people they claimed to have represented for so long.  It reminds me of an old Cork saying, &ldquo;I've got the foreman's job at last&rdquo;.  That saying rings true in this case.</P>
    <P>The money announced in the budget to reduce hospital waiting lists will have a marginal effect because throwing money at a system that is haemorrhaging from lack of reform will be effective in the short term but, in the long term, will have little effect on the overall position in the health services.  Major reform of the health services is necessary and I see no evidence of that in what the Minister for Health has announced to date.  We have had a problem in regard to nursing homes for many years.  In 1990 the Health (Nursing Homes) Act was passed, yet very few regulations were made to implement its provisions.  The situation in Cork is well catalogued &mdash; a nursing home is in danger of closing down but we do not have the regulations to allow the health board to deal with this situation in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> This morning the Taoiseach spoke for some time about funding from the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I would like to see these moneys spent in a more effective way than they have been to date.  I noted the Taoiseach's comments that he had been around the country and had seen the developments in our roads and infrastructure.  I think the Taoiseach was taken on a very selective tour.  The Structural Fund has certainly brought about improvements in our infrastructure but I question whether this has had any impact on our marginalised people and those living in areas marginalised by unemployment and deprivation.  I believe it has had very little impact and I question the manner in which the Structural Fund moneys have been spent to date.  It has been a bonanza certainly for firms involved in road and bridge construction; it has created employment but not lasting employment in the areas that need it most.  If we examined how the Structural Fund moneys have been spent I believe we would see very quickly that those who hoped for an improvement in the quality of their lives have been sadly disappointed because the benefits from the Structural Fund have bypassed the areas that needed it most.  I am afraid this will happen again in the years ahead and that Structural and Cohesion Fund moneys will bypass these areas.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity I ask the Minister to look at the areas that have been marginalised and torn apart by unemployment. Areas of high unemployment become rundown and rundown areas are unattractive to the industrialists coming into the country who go elsewhere and then these areas are left without hope. We have to break out of this vicious circle and the only way to do so is by uplifting the area through investment from the Public Capital Programme.  This will act as a sign to give people hope and lift them out of their despair.  I hope moneys will be spent on areas of high deprivation.</P>
    <P>I note that £25 million is being allocated to the county enterprise boards.  I believe this will give hope to some people, but in my view we are adding another layer of bureaucracy.  I have seen <Col N="439" /> one such board in operation in my own area in recent times.  I am monitoring the case of a man on the live register who has been dealing with the North Lee Development Board since last November and has been trying to find out whether he will get a grant or a loan to set up a business.  He has been run from Tom to Jack and then to Harry and passed from agency to agency yet no decision has been made &mdash; unless this has changed in the past two days &mdash; on his future and the future of his business.  I hope the moneys allocated to these boards will not be swallowed by the layers of management and people justifying their existence in the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the election promises the first budget of this partnership Government gives very little sign of hope to the 300,000 unemployed; indeed, slowly but surely that figure will rise to 400,000 unless the scale of the problem is tackled seriously.  Social welfare recipients will find their standard of living as low as ever while workers will be taxed even higher. In spite of the Taoiseach's trumpeting of his achievements, mortgage holders have been let down by this Government &mdash; the promises given during the election campaign have not been delivered.  There is very little hope for the marginalised in our society and not only will we have to mourn the lost generations that have gone abroad but we have to be fearful for the generations to come, including our own sons and daughters.  As I see it, the Government have no real job creation policy.</P>
    <P>We have a large and growing underclass. Along with unemployment it is becoming clear that the breakdown of the strong family unit is one of the principal reasons for the social unrest and misery in our cities and towns.  The emergence of an urban underclass is destroying not only those trapped in that situation but all our communities and is directly linked to unemployment, the resultant breakdown of the family unit and other social factors.  Large areas of our cities and towns have become marginalised and the people living in those areas have gone <Col N="440" /> from being poor to being part of the underclass.  What we must learn from the mistakes made in the United States and Britain is that once an underclass becomes part of society it is almost impossible to root it out.  We now have a growing underclass.  The gap between the marginalised and the well off is growing all the time.  On one hand we have people living in abject poverty while the indecent wealth of others is flaunted in our media. There is now a huge contrast; it is more akin to what I have seen in some of the Central American countries.  I am not being alarmist.  I believe we are not facing up to the situation that exists and the symptoms will become more apparent in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>People are drifting into crime, indeed some are forced into crime by their lack of hope and feelings of despair.  We must stop this rot and learn from what has happened in the UK and in the United States unless we want to see ourselves further reduced and sinking into the morass.  As I said, an underclass is beginning to take root because of the breakdown of family values and the problems arising from unemployment.  Unless we have a social policy that puts the preservation of families at the centre of the political agenda, things will become worse.</P>
    <P>We could make a start by eliminating dependency and giving people a sense of hope and of control over their own lives. The Department of Social Welfare statistics rather than the money paid out by the Department tell the real story, although time does not allow me to go into detail on the statistics.  We must give people hope.  All the public relations and hype that the Government and its backup agencies engage in will not eliminate the real truth.  Irish society is disintegrating before our own eyes.  This is happening all around us but we seem to be blind to it.</P>
    <P>The problems we face at present are daunting.  We really need to identify the fundamentals and set real priorities.  If we do so, I think we can overcome our problems.  I question the present priorities of this Government.  The Taoiseach <Col N="441" /> is very fond of talking about the fundamentals, indeed we joke about the fundamentals from time to time in this House.  I question the Taoiseach on his fundamental priorities for Irish society and where he sees this society going.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed Minister for Equality and Law Reform was reported recently as saying that the time is right for divorce in this country.  I have no moral hang-ups about divorce but I was surprised at such a statement.  A report was published yesterday by a voluntary organisation on abuse in the home and the breakdown of marriage.  That organisation receives only £500 from the Southern Health Board in support of its activities of guidance and counselling. The articles on the report of the Cork Marriage Advisory Council &mdash; I have not see the report yet &mdash; make frightening reading.  In proposing a ready expensive fix for divorce we are getting our priorities and our fundamentals wrong.  What we need to do is tackle the root causes that bring about marriage breakdown before providing what is a top-of-the-head fix, a very expensive fix.  The only people to benefit in financial terms from such a solution will be lawyers who will have a field day.  We should support the family and people with problems and allow these people to sort out their difficulties in life.  The State must support services that are helping these people, but at present that is not happening.  I am painting a black picture here today in relation to the society in which we are living.</P>

Most of them were under 22 years of age.  That is an indication of what is happening here.  People are losing, and have lost hope while all the Government and people in authority seem to be doing <Col N="442" /> is feathering their own nests and taking care of their own people.  Respect for authority and for this House has been sadly undermined in recent times.  The Government has a responsibility in this area.  It has four years in which to set out a programme of real benefit for the people rather than the shadow of impressions, reports and task forces we have been presented with in recent times.</P>

      <P>The 1993 Estimate for the Garda Síochána Vote amounts to more than £372 million.  This is £20 million greater than what was spent in 1992 and represents a very substantial investment of taxpayers' money.  To put it in perspective it is an investment by the State of over £107 for every man, woman and child.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance of maintaining and indeed improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the force and the responsibility of ensuring a value for money approach, the Garda Commissioner, in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government, is currently preparing a corporate strategy for the Garda Síochána to identify priorities and map out the course for the Garda Síochána over the next five years.  This is a major step in that not alone will it set out the overall mission on policy objective of the force, but it will also identify the intermediate goals by which this objective can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element in maintaining the effectiveness of the force is the continued recruitment of gardaí and the maintenance of the command structure.  The 1993 Estimates provide for the recruitment of 260 garda trainees and in line <Col N="443" /> with the Programme for a Partnership Government I intend to accelerate Garda trainee recruitment at the earliest possible time.  In addition, I intend to increase the operational strength of the force by the recruitment of civilian support staff. The civilian staff are recruited on the basis that they will release an equivalent number of gardaí from routine clerical duties to do the outdoor operational duties for which they were specifically recruited and trained.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of maintaining the command structure, on Thursday last I announced that the Government, on my recommendation has decided to discontinue the procedure whereby only one vacancy in three arising in the Garda promotional ranks can be filled.  The Government also decided that the number of supervisory posts should be maintained at levels recommended by the Garda Commissioner so as to ensure the continued availability of an appropriate and efficient command structure to oversee the efficient and effective performance of policing duties.  It is expected that this decision will create an extra 199 promotion opportunities in the force in the current year alone.</P>
    <P>Turning to other aspects of the service provided by the Garda Síochána, I am currently considering the recommendation made in the reports of the Advisory Committee on Fraud with a view to introducing the measures necessary to improving the Garda response in this area.  Recognising the importance of the Garda response to crime, I am also examining how to provide a co-ordinated approach by the various agencies to the particular issue of urban crime.  Many social and environmental factors have an impact on crime.  In this regard I will shortly be bringing forward proposals on the implementation of the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee on Crime.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for total expenditure of approximately £96 million on prisons and places of detention and on the probation and welfare service in 1993.  This is an increase of 5 per cent on the allocation <Col N="444" /> for 1992.  The main increases are in the provisions for salaries, wages and allowances and for buildings and equipment. A total of £65.633 million is provided for prison service pay.  This amounts to 75 per cent of non-capital expenditure and represents an increase of 5 per cent over the provisional outturn for 1992.  It arises mainly because of increases due as a result of the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Over the last few years, the prisons have had to respond to a range of new demands.  These have included an increase in the daily average number in custody from 1,870 in 1986 to 2,193 last year, a new institution at Wheatfield and new problems such as those associated with the management of prisoners who are HIV position.  Staff numbers have had to be increased from 1,700 to 2,330 and the provision reflects this increase. I mentioned briefly the question of the management of HIV positive prisoners. This is one of a number of matters which has been under consideration by an expert advisory committee and I am expecting to receive its report soon.  In the meantime, I am pleased to say that a new health care unit in Mountjoy Prison is now almost completed and it will be brought into operation without delay.</P>
    <P>The other major increase is on the prison capital programme.  The amount provided is £7.5 million, an increase of £1 million over the provision for 1992, but in fact it represents an increase of £2.5 million because of the once-off nature of certain provisions last year.  This increase in funding will allow for the continued modernisation and improvement of the building stock and for the up-grading and improvement of facilities generally in all prisons.  The increases in prison expenditure which are being provided at a time when great discipline must be the order of the day in relation to public expenditure, reflect the Government's commitment to provide the required level of funding for the prison service.  However, it would be wrong to suggest that the prisons have avoided the restrictions on expenditures which other services have to bear. <Col N="445" /> The courts systems is vital to the administration of justice and I am committed to ensuring that the service it provides is both efficient and effective.  The 1993 Courts Vote provides for an expenditure of £17.372 million which is an increase of approximately £1 million on last year's outturn.  Included in the Vote is a sum of £1.250 million in respect of courthouses capital works.  There are a large number of courthouse accommodation requests advanced by local authorities many of which require urgent attention.  To date, the available funds have been sufficient to enable a small number of capital projects to be approved.  I am examining these requests with a view to making a priority list in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Among other proposals which I intend bringing forward in 1993 will be the extension of the small claims procedure as announced in the Government's programme.  This speedy, informal and low cost system when extended will facilitate access to the court system in respect of consumer claims.</P>
    <P>Although the original demand of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds has, in common with most Departments, been reduced somewhat the provision for this year &mdash; £11.848 million &mdash; shows an increase of 4.8 per cent over last year's provision.  I am satisfied that sufficient resources have been provided to enable the registries to function efficiently and also to further reduce the backlog of arrears.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the proposal, approved in principle by Government, to re-constitute the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body.  To this end, a non-statutory interim board for the registries was appointed in July 1992.  The principal role of the board is to advise me on the various steps which need to be taken in readiness for the reconstitution of the registries. Legislation to formally vest the registries in a semi-State board is in course of preparation by my Department.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, a phased information technology programme prepared for the <Col N="446" /> registries is being implemented and I am particularly pleased to be able to report that the improvement in services and reduction in arrears of work, achieved in 1990 and 1991, have been maintained throughout 1992.</P>
    <P>The main part of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice &mdash; amost two-thirds &mdash; is covered by the administrative budget agreement.  This has ensured that over the three years 1991-93 spending on various non-pay items such as travel and subsistence, consultancy and general office expenses has actually fallen. Similarly, pay costs, after adjustment for increases in rates, have been reduced annually.</P>
    <P>An additional £2 million approximately, has been made available in 1993 for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Expenditure in 1992 on free criminal legal aid was £3.868 million.  The additional funds provided for 1993 are required in the main to fund the fee increases granted to solicitors in 1992, which fall to be paid in 1993, together with appropriate retrospection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for Justice for her initiative and progress since her appointment. On her recent visit to Cork she met with Garda chiefs and, more important, with community groups who articulated their anxieties.  The Minister is very clear on the problems of the local areas.  I am confident that she will play a part in allaying the fears of people and in reassuring them about their security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting on the details of the budget I will briefly discuss its overall thrust.  While traditionally the budget was seen as a major starting point for economic policy each year, the reality of modern life is that planning and implementation of key financial policies cannot fit within the framework of one budget. When one is assessing a modern budget <Col N="447" /> one must have realistic expectations. While some Members of the Opposition may see this debate as an opportunity to attack Ministers and the Government with impunity, such contributions are of little or no value to the country or to assist a Minister in fine tuning the details of proposals.  Our needs are too important for any serious public representative to indulge in easy negative criticism.</P>
    <P>I do not need to stress the urgent need to rapidly expand employment.  The needs of the poor must be addressed with all available resources.  When one considers recent financial and industrial developments here and abroad one can see that the Minister for Finance faced a major task when preparing this budget. The need to provide more than £2 billion to service the national debt limited the scope for radical measures with regard to State expenditure.  In that context the Minister has done an excellent job in balancing the obligations and demands he faced.</P>
    <P>I am happy, because of the over-riding needs of our poor, that the Minister has provided for increases in social welfare. In general, the goal of at least matching the expected rate of inflation in social welfare benefits has been achieved.  I welcome the excellent increases in child benefit which provide a vital extra monthly income to many hard pressed parents. The provision of a payment of £200 to mothers with newly born twins is highly commended.  I warmly welcome the increase in the carer's allowance.  The unselfish service provided by carers deserves the highest praise.  The least we can do for them is allocate as much financial support as possible.  The people caring for the ill and elderly play a silent but crucial role in society at a time when society is often dominated by blatant materialism.  Many carers provide excellent leadership in the area of service to mankind.</P>
    <P>Progress in income tax reform has been limited to an extent by lack of resources but I welcome the move towards removing low income families from the tax net. <Col N="448" /> It is essential that the less well off should receive the first benefits of tax reform.</P>
    <P>There are two further aspects of the budget which I confidently expect will prove to be extremely valuable during the coming year.  One is the commitment of £260 million to the jobs fund and the other is the substantial provision for the public capital programme.  In recession the construction industry is often the first victim of spending cutbacks.  It is heartening to see the wide range of measures proposed by the Minister which will directly provide much needed growth in construction.  Provisions have been made for a number of projects in infrastructural development, for example the allocation of Cohesion Fund revenue of £40 million to the national road projects while £42.4 million has been allocated to the development of public water supply and sanitary services.  A sum of £13.1 million has been allocated to development of key industrial ports at Cork, Dublin and Waterford and that is of great significance.  Allocations have also been made to CIE, Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis and the ESB.  Even when one excludes the Cohesion Fund allocations there are a number of measures under the public capital programme which will stimulate industrial activity throughout the country.  The increase of almost £24 million for local authority and social housing is of special importance.</P>
    <P>While a recent international report showed that we have the highest percentage of home owners among OECD countries, there are many areas of the country where there is almost total dependency on local authority housing. Cork North Central includes districts with up to 80 per cent dependency on such housing facilities.  There must be a major emphasis on quality when one is applying extra funds to housing.  Otherwise, an increasing proportion of local authority housing budgets will continue to be needed for the maintenance of existing stock.  By investing heavily in quality housing the emphasis will move towards an increase in the building of much needed extra housing stock.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased funding for <Col N="449" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta.  One way of ensuring the development of our national language is to stimulate economic growth in Gaeltacht areas.  I would stress that the Minister has included a number of important measures to stimulate the economy despite severe limitations in terms of available resources.  From recent events it must be increasingly obvious to everyone that the future well being of our country depends to a large degree on our own ability to grow and develop.  While membership of the EC allows us access to large markets and provides a relatively even playing pitch, the primary concern of each country in the Community is to provide growth and prosperity for its own people.  Thus, we cannot expect any favours from our EC colleagues as we attempt to attract new industries while, at the same time, endeavouring to increase our exports against ever more vigorous international competitors.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which should receive increasing attention in our penetration of new markets, especially in eastern Europe.  The importance of developing the range of language available in our second level school curriculum cannot be over emphasised in this regard.  I wish to pay tribute at this stage to Minister O'Rourke for her efforts during her term in the Department of Education when this was one of the issues which was at the top of the agenda.</P>
    <P>The second area offering substantial potential for industrial growth involves import substitution.  We must take every step to encourage initiatives in this area. Such initiatives might include the collation of detailed information on the nature and extent of our imports, the distribution of such information to relevant national manufacturers and distributors, and supporting the ongoing efforts towards higher quality standards and lower consumer costs among our indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to society in general and the concern he has for many areas.  There is no doubt that we are all concerned with the changes in society today.  This House must play its part as <Col N="450" /> legislators in ensuring that people get fair play and that we are seen to do our job. But it is not alone the job of legislators. There are the community in general, the legal profession and the judiciary and one is dependent on the other.  If we all work together, constructively, I have no doubt that we can make a major contribution to build a better and happier community for all our people.</P>

      <P>This series of statements by Members of this House on the 1993 budget gives us an opportunity to review what has been proposed in the financial motions and also to comment on the strategy &mdash; or the absence of it &mdash; outlined by the Minister in the course of his budget speech.  This is an occasion also for Members of this House to reflect on the course which Irish society is taking, the direction in which the Irish economy is moving and the effect that this has through its laws &mdash; particularly its tax and other economic laws &mdash; on the Irish economy and the prospects for the Irish people as members of an economic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is seen by many people as an occasion on which issues such as social welfare entitlements and other ameliorative measures can be outlined and discussed.  However, the fundamental purpose of a budget is to indicate for the year in question how the State intends to influence the economy and to finance its affairs.  In the lifetime of a Government there are, at most, four budgets.  This is the first budget in the lifetime of the present Government and we have now a unique combination of parties, the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties, sharing Government with an overwhelming majority in this House.  Some Members of this House such as Deputy Kitt and Deputy Brennan, speaking on radio at the time the alliance between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party began to formally emerge into the light of public scrutiny, stressed that the two parties had a common heritage and that in their view, a view they had certainly kept under a bushel up to then, the Fianna Fáil Party was in some sense a left wing party. <Col N="451" /> Although there has been a change of heart on the part of some members of Fianna Fáil to re-characterise their party as a left of centre party, it does not appear to me that this Government is left of centre in any sense except that of being an unthought-out statist combination of parties with an unthought-out approach to strategic planning.</P>
    <P>This House has a serious moral, economic and political responsibility for the present state of the Irish economy.  We have known for decades that the demographic changes in the population were likely to follow the pattern that has emerged in recent years.  It is not as if the accelerating growth in the population was unpredicted, nor that we have been blind to the international effects on the Irish economy, of such factors as recession or emigration levels.  All these matters are entirely predictable and, therefore, in so far as things have gone wrong, it comes down to a fundamenal failure of strategy &mdash; politically, socially and economically &mdash; on the part of the elected representatives and of the Governments put in place and left in place during the past ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>On this occasion one would have expected of a new Government, especially in its first budget, that they would have mapped out clearly and without equivocation, a new strategy for the manner in which our economic affairs are to be supervised and carried through. For that reason it came to me as a huge surprise and disappoinment that the Tánaiste would admit that time and other matters prevented this budget from being a radical one.  If you are not radical in your first budget, you will not be radical in later budgets, and the nearer the next general election comes into view and more immediate the question of re-election appear to be in the minds of Deputies who form the two Government parties, the less likely it will be that those two parties will sustain any radical or challenging steps to change Irish society.</P>
    <P>One thinks of painful decisions that sometimes have to be made in order to reform our system of taxation, of <Col N="452" /> unpopular measures that may have to be taken to make the system of taxation more consonant with an enterprise culture in Ireland.  If that is not done early in the life of a Government it will not be done at all.  That was the tragedy of this budget &mdash; two parties who spent many hours putting together aspirational plans for a programme for Government over four years did not devote themselves to a budgetary strategy for 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 which might be worthy of the description &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.  The apology made by the Tánaiste that time and economic constraints prohibited radicalism on this occasion is, in my view, a very weak and limp excuse to put to the House when the country voted for change and intended, obviously, a radically different outcome to the election than what has happened.</P>
    <P>The party which claimed to be the harbinger of change, the Labour Party, has effectively adopted conservative &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; policies in relation to budgetary matters.  It is easy to criticise in general terms and not to be specific.  Therefore, I want to dwell on the specific injustices that are created by maintaining and pursuing present policies in relation to employment, participation in the economy, our system of taxation and our poverty traps.</P>
    <P>I believe that tax reform has been identified by every responsible objective commentator on Irish affairs, whether internal or external, for the past five years as the central mechanism whereby the economy of this country can be transformed into one which is participative, dynamic, productive and growing.  The OECD, the Culliton report, the NESC, the ESRI, the Central Bank and everybody who has come to consider the issue of how our tax system impinges on the enterprise ethic in Ireland have come to one simple conclusion that we have among the states of the European Community and the OECD states the single most aggressively anti-work, anti-participative tax and welfare system that could be imagined.</P>
    <P>There is no point in people weeping crocodile tears about unemployment <Col N="453" /> while we maintain a system of taxation which not merely discourages but brutally penalises those who wish to participate in the economic life of the country.  The figures are shocking when set out in black and white.  It costs an employer £2.54, or even more now following the imposition of this levy, to give a single employee earning less than the average industrial wage an extra £1 in take home pay.  Between social welfare levies and taxation employees earning the average industrial wage pay 40 per cent of their gross earnings in taxation to the State.  Contrast that with the facility now available to a well-to-do married couple with £100,000 to put into a special savings account who can now negotiate around 14 per cent or 15 per cent interest. On that 14 per cent or 15 per cent interest which would yield in the course of a year about £14,000 or £15,000, which is more than the average industrial wage at present, they will be liable to 10 per cent tax.  For an outlay of £100,000 they will earn effectively the gross earnings of an average industrial worker, net of tax. What kind of society is it that says to a well-to-do couple in those circumstance &ldquo;Make a risk free investment of that kind and you will be rewarded&rdquo; while a skilled worker, earning the average industrial wage, who had spent 40 hours working every week, would have to pay 40 per cent of his earnings in welfare levies and taxation?  It is simply inconsistent with the maintenance of any pro-employment posture on the part of any Parliament &mdash; I am not merely castigating the Government for this &mdash; to say that a society represented by a Legislature that would leave that system in place is in any way concerned with whether people participate or do not particiate in the economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>When one speaks in terms of tax reform, shifting the burden of tax off labour in our society and shifting the burden of tax away from risk free to enterprise investments one has to be conscious of the fact that you are not merely speaking to the well-to-do but to those who are at the lowest end of the scale, the people who are now locked into the <Col N="454" /> politics of exclusion, what Deputy Cox termed correctly the human set aside scheme which we have put in place as a response to the weak labour market in Ireland.  We say to people: do not participate in the economic life of this country and we will pay you some money, social welfare, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and so on.  We say that any assistance you receive when the labour market has failed you is conditional on your remaining out of the labour market.  We say to those who are excluded from employment by the weaknesses in our labour market in Ireland that the one basis on which they will be assisted is if they remain outside the economic life of the community.  In my view that is fundamentally wrong.  It is wrong in terms of social justice, it is wrong in terms of economic dynamics, it makes no sense from any perspective of any kind whatsoever and it demands a radical revision and reform in our system.</P>
    <P>People are shy to use terms such as &ldquo;workfare&rdquo; in Ireland.  Sometimes I can understand why, because it smacks of relief schemes for the poor in famine ridden Ireland and the building of follies by the landlord class in order to alleviate poverty in accordance with some very harsh view of the world based on 19th century capitalist theory.</P>
    <P>Some form of community employment scheme in which those whom the market fails are guaranteed two days work per week, instead of being told by society that they must remain unemployed for the entirety of their working week, and which would leave them free to go and earn during the remaining two or three days of the working week would be infinitely preferable to what we are doing today.  Nobody can kick the system or buck the market in regard to what effect the tax on the welfare system will have on people's behaviour if they are not willing to face up to that one issue: whether our system is pro-participation or anti-participation.  A clear indication from all studies, surveys and analyses is that we have devised and put in place in Ireland a system of taxation whose real purpose is to keep the poor excluded <Col N="455" /> from the economic life of the country and to offer them no hope.</P>
    <P>The income levy imposed in the budget may not appear to be significant from the point of view of being merely 1 per cent, but 1 per cent in terms of a standard rate of tax of 27 per cent is a 4 per cent or 5 per cent imposition increase in taxation on lower incomes.  The paper thin excuse that that levy was applied to incomes about £9,000 does not wash with me.  As far as I am concerned £9,000 is £3,000 or £4,000 less than the average industrial wage.  The ridiculous assertion by the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, that the burden of dealing with unemployment had to fall on the shoulders of those who could afford it was shown to be a sham protestation when we realise that he was really increasing the burden of tax on those earning thousands of pounds less than the average industrial wage.  How the Labour Party, as a party which espouses work and the worker as its political power base, could add an extra tax &mdash; a fifth tax &mdash; on work as part of its strategy to get Ireland back to work defies belief.  It was a sad day that the process of tax reform, which this party insisted on since its inception in 1985, on its entry into the Dáil with 14 Members in 1987 and its participation in Government since 1989, was reversed in its entirety and that we are back to the old and faulty methods of increasing tax on work as a response to unemployment itself.  How could a Minister for Finance come before his fellow legislators and say &ldquo;I intend to improve the climate for work in this country&rdquo; and say at the same time &ldquo;I intend to increase the burden of taxation on work itself&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I believe we have now reached the point where all the pretence has been shorn away.  We have now reached the position where the Government has put the process of tax reform on reverse thrust &mdash; taxes are going up, the yield from PAYE workers is scheduled to increase and the number of unemployed is scheduled to increase.  We are now faced with the position that those who generate taxation policy are, in fact, <Col N="456" /> advising the Government to worsen the situation and to increase the burden of taxation on workers earning below the average industrial wage, and worsen tax and poverty traps in so doing.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder why it is that successive Governments have been advised to ignore the clear orthodoxy that the present tax system is anti-work.  I have come to the rather cynical conclusion &mdash; it does not reflect badly on any individual but I think it is true &mdash; that as long as taxation policy is dictated by people who do not come from the market system and do not understand the market system, by people with permanent jobs who are not affected by increases in taxation, except in so far as it affects their take-home pay, but who do not know about its disincentive effect to work, people who through no fault of their own are in the public service and seek promotion as a career move and and are not, therefore, affected by a difference of 1 per cent this way or that way on incomes, and by people who do not understand the visceral dynamics of a market economy, then we will have anti-work tax systems in place.  When we have a radically different Government, which I am confident we will have after the next election, when this 39 seat majority will have been swept brutally aside by a cynical and disappointed electorate, and when there is a new set of genuine politicians commanding a majority in this House whose understanding is based on a market economy and its requirements, whose sympathies are consonant with the dynamics of a market economy and know what incentive means, there will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>I am driven to the sad conclusion that as long as this Government remains in power unemployment will continue to rise, taxation will continue to rise, borrowing will continue to rise, expenditure will continue to rise and all of the good which was done during the past three to five years will be swept away.  Sadly, I have to say that the political imperative is to get rid of this Government as quickly as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Keeffe.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that the greatest challenge and blight facing this country is unemployment.  The need to generate employment is paramount and it must supersede all other economic and social considerations.  For this reason, I am happy to welcome this budget, a job-creating budget.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Irish economy faces considerable challenges as a result of the international recession and the ongoing currency turbulence. However, despite these difficulties our economy has performed with credit.  We must maintain and improve upon this economic progress, with the overriding aim of generating employment.  This economic growth must be based on careful and prudent economic planning if we are to create genuine and enduring progress which will lead to true job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing this principle in mind, I welcome the job creation proposals contained in the budget.  The most welcome proposal is the setting up of the jobs fund, for which an initial £250 million will be provided this year.  This marks a major commitment on the part of the Government to tackle the jobs crisis.  We must be in a position to maximise the employment potential of the economy.  In this regard, I welcome certain new aspects of the employment policy.  These include a new standards-based apprenticeship scheme, a review of training programmes in order to put a more effective national training <Col N="458" /> scheme in place and an examination of the roles of the Departments of Education and Enterprise and Employment with a view to better defining their respective roles in the area of vocational training so as to allow for a more structured and streamlined approach.  Programmes are being prepared for the substantial expansion of vocational training and employment schemes in preparation for the new phase of EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Developing a greater enterprise culture is an integral part of generating employment.  The most effective way to develop this spirit of enterprise is to develop it at local level.  This is why the county enterprise partnership boards are so important.  I welcome the allocation of £25 million to the boards this year.  These boards have the responsibility of encouraging and developing enterprise at local level.  They will have have the major task of promoting tourism at local level.  In establishing such a system the Government has shown its commitment to developing a real seed bed for growth at local level.  I believe this kind of approach is much more effective than the programmes which were previously developed and implemented at national level.  At a time when recent events have shown the urgent need to further develop indigenous enterprise, the county enterprise partnership boards will have a sufficient and central role to play in job creation.</P>
    <P>Structural funding has an important role to play in generating employment. These funds must be used in the most effective manner possible.  Securing these funds represented a major achievement by the Taoiseach and his team at the recent summit.  These funds must be used to sustain economic growth and increase employment.  The national development plan, which is currently in preparation will form the basis for the programme to be included under the next round of Structural funding.  I welcome the statement by the Minister that this plan will focus on the creation of sustainable employment and improved economic growth.  It will also form an important <Col N="459" /> blueprint for employment generation during the coming years.</P>
    <P>This budget not only represents a major commitment to job creation but it is also a caring budget.  This can be seen from the wide range of social welfare increases it contains.  The budget will protect the incomes of those who are dependent on social welfare by maintaining the real value of their social welfare payments. This will entail a 3.5 per cent increase in all social welfare and health board payments.  There will also be a special increase in all short term payments at a cost of £7 million.</P>
    <P>The Government regard children as a priority and it has provided an extra £62 million a year in child income support. This is made up of £50 million in child benefit and £12 million for higher child dependent allowances and improved FIS. Child benefit is paid to mothers and is funded entirely by the taxpayer.  This payment is recognised as the most effective means of directing resources to families. In contrast, increases in child dependent allowances have been shown to create barriers for workers wishing to return to the jobs market, especially for workers with large families.  Child benefit is paid to all families, regardless of whether the wage earner is employed or unemployed.</P>
    <P>This is the beginning of the Government's process to increase child income support with the main emphasis on child benefit.  Child dependent allowances paid with all weekly social welfare and health board payments are being increased. Child benefit is being increased to £20 per child for each of the first three children and to £23 each for the fourth and additional children.  This is an increase of £4.20 per month or 26.6 per cent in the rate for each of the first three children. The new rates will come into effect from the beginning of September.</P>
    <P>The £12 increase in the family income supplement is most welcome.  The increase of £6.20 per week in the carer's allowance which will bring the long term rate to £59.20 is also welcome.  I should like the Minister to look at the method <Col N="460" /> of assessment for the carer's allowance. Many people should qualify who do not. I welcome the increase of £5 in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit and the new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins.</P>
    <P>There is a better deal for unemployed people who qualify under the third level education scheme.  The maintenance element of their higher education grants will be disregarded in determining their allowance.  There is an extra £1.3 million in grants to the voluntary sector and to assist in counteracting money lending.  I welcome the grant of £100,000 to the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome changes in the recent measures which adversely affected claims to unemployment assistance, disability benefit and treatment benefit.  I also welcome changes which improve the entitlements of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I raised with the Minister for Social Welfare the position of 32 part-time workers at the port of Fenit who were seriously affected by a decision made by the former Minister for Social Welfare that casual earnings would be assessed as means in determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.  This group of casual workers is exceptional. Their earnings are very small due to the very low volume of traffic coming through the port of Fenit.  This is a small rural community with no manufacturing industry of any sort.  The only source of income these people have is by way of casual earnings which enable them to supplement their very low income from social welfare.  I appeal to the Government, and to the Minister, to give their case serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the giving of free colour television licences to pensioners who already qualify for a black and white licence.  Given that this is the European Year of the Elderly, I am pleased and heartened by the range of measures introduced to help our old people.  We have 250,000 pensioners who deserve the best the State can give.  A couple in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension will receive a total increase of £4, bringing their weekly pension to £59.20 in each <Col N="461" /> case.  Old people will benefit in a variety of other ways.  The increase of 12 per cent in the carer's allowance will be useful. The budget also provides a welcome £1 million for the renovation of flats for the elderly, as requested by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The £20 million allocated to reduce hospital waiting lists will be of major benefit to people waiting for operations to deal with hip replacements, eye defects, cataracts and heart conditions. This measure is very much in the caring tradition of Fianna Fáil.  I make a special plea to the Government to consider the request to Tralee General Hospital to the Southern Health Board for a third surgeon.  The waiting list for surgery is such that in many cases patients have to wait in excess of 15 months.  This would be much longer but for the tremendous work carried out by the two surgeons, Mr. Spillane and Mr. McCormack.  A submission already made for an ophthalmic surgeon must be regarded as a priority in view of the waiting list for eye surgery.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem in Tralee General Hospital is the lack of beds.  One 30-bed ward in this new hospital has never been opened and many beds in other wards are not being utilised due to lack of staffing.  In recent years various commitments have been given by Ministers to make funding available to the Southern Health Board to enable this hospital to become fully operational, but these commitments have not been honoured. Further medical and surgical beds must now be made available in this hospital and the nursing complement must be increased accordingly.  I appeal to the Government, and to the Minister for Health, to give serious consideration to Tralee General Hospital and to make available the essential finance to make it fully operational.</P>
    <P>Housing is a fundamental human right. The increased resources for social housing in this year's Estimates and in the Public Capital Programme is an essential move.  It will mean an increase of 50 per cent in public housing starts over the next two years and it clearly indicates the <Col N="462" /> Government's determination to make housing available to those who cannot afford to provide it from their own resources.  I welcome the substantial increase in the housing allocation to Kerry County Council.  It is double the amount for last year.  In the light of recent events, the increase in mortgage interest relief is most welcome.  With the increase in public housing, this will provide a welcome boost to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector is one of the mainstays of the economy and its wellbeing is of concern to all.  Common Agricultural Policy reform represents a major challenge to agriculture.  The Minister has responded well in the budget by allocating £4 million to help administer schemes introduced as a result of the reform.  It is an essential measure in helping agriculture to adjust to the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  Other positive measures have been introduced such as the £1 million for Teagasc to provide an advisory service in connection with the small farm development programme scheme, £400,000 for a pig evaluation programme and £250,000 for research in the food area.  The revised rate will continue to compensate farmers fully for the VAT borne on their purchases. The sum of £1 million will be provided for the farm retirement scheme this year.  The same amount will be provided for the agri-environment scheme.</P>
    <P>Last week's budget, as well as providing for the continuation of essential current services, provides a very large increase in funds for capital projects.  The expanded capital programme is vital to the growth of the economy and will lead to a large increase in employment, directly and indirectly.  All involved in business and in job creation, whether in the private or public sectors, must keep looking for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and the delivery of services.  We must have confidence in ourselves, confidence in our country and confidence to build a better future for us and our children, using all the resources we can bring to bear.  This budget has been formulated at a very difficult time but it manages to <Col N="463" /> achieve that very fine balance between sensible economic management and the overriding need to generate employment. It is both positive and caring and deserves the full support of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The overriding objective in this budget is correct in that it is designed mainly to create jobs.  I recognise the Minister's dilemma.  Unemployment is at 300,000 and we have a diminishing number of taxpayers at a time when there is increasing demand for spending.  All the economies in the western world are in a similar plight.  We are told that the fundamentals are right but with inflation at 2 per cent and interest rates at 16 per cent this cannot be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 we cut Government spending and created thousands of jobs.  In the last two years we have doubled borrowing and have record unemployment.  We have 1.1 million people at work and paying taxes and we have imposed more taxes, including VAT which is an indirect tax.  This means less spending power to purchase goods and services which are the only way to create jobs.  I disagree with this policy which I regard as the economics to the graveyard.  At every turn people are hit, initiative is destroyed and incentive removed.  It is not worth seeking low paid work.  We live in a fantasy world where it is believed that Ireland is full of resources with an abundance of rich people who, if taxed, could make everything fine.  It is a mentality of begrudgery and dependency combined <Col N="464" /> with an arrogant self-importance.  The very people who put forward this view are the ones who contribute least in terms of taxes, jobs and effort.  I worry that our present approach is leading into a <i>cul de sac.</i></P>
    <P>Recrimination over Digital is doing us no good.  Blaming other people is unfair &mdash; we are all to blame.  We must be careful of the smug, knee-jerk reaction which condemns all multinationals.  Let us be sensible and realistic.  We need multinationals as well as indigenous development. The real reason for the Digital closure is the slump in computer business worldwide.  We were the victim of that fall out.</P>
    <P>We are in danger of furthering the policy of tax and spend, which is the wrong recipe for our sick economy.  We must create a climate of initiative, enterprise and investment by making it worthwhile to work and invest and have disposable income of profits.  We must move away from the climate of envy, greed and begrudgery which has had a disastrous effect on our economy.  We must discourage the dependent culture mentality.</P>
    <P>For the last six weeks in this House we have spent more time discussing ethics and how we can spend more taxpayer's money creating more committees and employing more advisers.  I can understand why the taxpayer's are angry.  The Beef Tribunal rumbles on with no end in sight.  It will create no extra permanent jobs and will cost us money.  In the end we will have many more rich lawyers and nothing to show for the effort.  The last few days indicate that we are now to depend on the secrets of the confessional to protect people from giving further evidence in that tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is time we faced problems in this country.  We are not rich, we have few inherent resources and emigration will no longer solve our unemployment problem. We should therefore now support this Minister's endeavours.  First, we must lead by example in this House by cutting our own expenditure, by putting all these committees on hold and placing an embargo on advisers.  We should support <Col N="465" /> a total embargo on pay increases for everybody, including public servants and commissioners &mdash; in other words, we need a pay freeze now if this economy is to survive.  In this regard we will have to take on the vested interests.  PRSI needs a radical overhaul and must not be a tax on employment.  It makes no sense to tax employment.</P>
    <P>The vast bureaucracy now threatening farmers must be modified and simplified. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on the many great successes in Europe in bringing back much money to help to fund farming operations and headage payments.  The nightmare is the implementation of those schemes and the effort to qualify.  Many farmers who do not have the resources to fill in forms are living a nightmare.</P>
    <P>The tax bands should be changed so that people at the bottom of the ladder will have an incentive to work.  Last year's Finance Bill must be amended and reformed. Those who are unemployed should be offered employment by the State on a voluntary basis similar to &ldquo;work fare&rdquo; in the United States.  They should receive the basic wage of those at work, the extra money being provided by the State.  It should not hinder them applying for further employment after a period of, say, two years.</P>
    <P>We should give up the false claim that everyone is entitled to free health care and education.  It is nonsense.  We cannot afford it.  We have had to introduce an unworkable hospital charge.  It would be far better to give free education and health services to those on low incomes and let people who can afford it pay.  We should stop pretending that we can afford the social legislation to increase maternity and parental leave and reduce working hours.</P>
    <P>We need to put our care for the environment in perspective.  This means there must be a balance whereby factories can be built once they have been through proper planning and not be held up by minorities many of whom are in comfortable employment and who in an excessive and zealous manner obstruct such developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> At present the costs of car insurance, insurance of property and medical malpractice insurance are the highest in Europe because the claims are so excessive and in some cases bogus.  In many instances the only people to gain are the lawyers and the doctors.  The law here is crying out for reform and yet we ignore it.</P>
    <P>This country is at a crossroads.  Soon there will be so many not working that the whole fabric of society will be threatened. The Minister must take his courage in his hands and sell off some of the State assets to either reduce the national debt or create meaningful employment or both. I welcome what is happening with regard to Greencore.</P>

He has shown by his direct remarks that he is at least in touch with the sentiments of a great number of people throughout the country.  For a Government Deputy to come in and say what he has said in the way he has said it is laudable and the Ministers in Cabinet should certainly listen to that kind of comment from a Government Deputy. His sentiments certainly coincide with the feelings of a great number of Opposition Deputies in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate really is a farce.  It should have taken place prior to the budget being introduced.  There should be a system whereby there could be discussion in the House on the budget about to be introduced.  The submissions that are coming in from various interested organisations and bodies throughout the country would then at least be given a hearing by both Government Ministers and Opposition Deputies prior to the introduction of the budget.  Under the present system submissions are sent in to Deputies and to the Minister for Finance by the various groups.  The Cabinet considers these and the Minister introduces his budget anyway.  With a majority of 33 it is probable that there will be no changes from what was introduced in the budget by the Minister for Finance unless <Col N="467" /> extreme pressure is brought to bear from within the Government benches.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Budget is an absolute disaster. It was contrived by two parties, one of whom did not think it would be in Government and one of whom apparently is not able to handle being in Government.  Has there ever been such disharmony, such dissent, such confusion, such disarray within Government ranks so early in a period of office?  Has there ever been a Cabinet where discussions relevant to Cabinet were leaked in advance and where, following the discussions, one party claimed credit for having prevented a particular form of Government action and stopping the mighty machinery of Government in its tracks?</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have had some experience of this particular form of Government, having been involved with the Labour Party in coalition on a number of occasions.  The late Deputy John Kelly used to speak eloquently in this House about the &ldquo;flutherbags&rdquo; of the Labour Party and what they were prone to do under pressure.  It now appears that one side of the Cabinet is leaking like a sieve so that when the pressure is on that side advance notices are given to the media that certain matters are to be discussed in Cabinet and, once they have been dealt with, the Labour Party claim they prevented Fianna Fáil from wreaking havoc on the country and from implementing things that might be detrimental from the Labour point of view. It is very obvious that the smiles that have replaced the discontent on the faces of the Fianna Fáil element of the Government, particularly those on the backbenches, is the result of this disconcerting position that the Labour Party finds itself in.</P>
    <P>How in heaven's name could a Coalition Government work when one side speaks publicly about people being betrayed by the other party in Government? How can they expect to run the country decisively when they have become consumed with what one might call the politically orgasmic effect of <Col N="468" /> making appointments to some 600 State and semi-State positions, setting up two-bit boards, appointing programme managers, personal advisers, personal assistants and specialists of all types to assist in all matters of Government?  How could any Government consumed with this kind of notion deal with the day-to-day problems of this economy, which is under pressure from many sources, particularly when one element is not used to handling this in Government?  Consider the Government's decision to send the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn to Boston to deal with the Digital problem.  Britain's Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, played the ball correct politically and won the day. Was the Government right to send on his first major national mission a man of some experience but with not sufficient clout or experience to deal with an issue like this?  When we read afterwards that the decision was made three days before the delegation went to Boston we can only conclude that it was merely a cosmetic exercise.  That is partly because this Government has become absolutely consumed with its own importance.</P>
    <P>In terms of the appointments being made, one could parody the late Father Peyton and say that the family that votes together works together.  The chairman of the Labour Party has been driven to public comment and has said that this is mere fireproofing for the Labour Party. It is fireproofing from public dissent; fireproofing from backbiting among the ranks down the line that the boys and the girls are not being given the jobs.  This morning I heard on radio the Minister for Equality and Law Reform defend the appointment of specialist advisers to Government Departments.  If the Programme for a Partnership Government was drawn up by six people, three delegates from the Labour Party and three delegates from the Fianna Fáil Party, surely it should be possible for those people to get together once every two months to review the progress being made on the implementation of the programme. Equally, it should be possible for departmental secretaries to point out <Col N="469" /> each week the aspects in which progress has failed to be made or is not being made quickly enough.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for former Taoiseach Haughey, but in his emperor-like days he never descended to the level of making family appointments. I guarantee that if the former Taoiseach were to have appointed his brother, sister, son, daughter or any other near relative in the capacity of specialist adviser or were to have given a close relative a hack job in Government, the drums of holy war would have been beaten incessantly by the Labour Party for months on end in the news media.  Now Labour Party Members have to go on national television and national radio to try to justify the making of such appointments.  As I have said, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform &mdash; the Minister for Equality, mind you &mdash; was forced to go on national radio this morning to try to make that justification.  The matter is farcical.</P>
    <P>The budget did not give us much.  It made a few cosmetic changes but there was nothing radical.  The budget had no hope to offer and there was no sign of a light shining at the end of the unemployment tunnel, a tunnel of hopelessness and despair for more than 300,000 people.  The Ministers say that all is well, that we are not on a slide, that things are looking up and that we are in a position to make progress.  We might be on the road to recovery but it seems that we are travelling in reverse.  It is apparent that the Government is paralysed &mdash; it has no energy, it has no leadership and it is fast losing momentum.  The Government has abused the democratic decision of the people and has forced upon the country a Government that the people did not vote for, did not want and did not support.</P>
    <P>The budget contains two particularly nasty pieces of work, the first being the 1 per cent levy on income earned by workers and the second being the probate tax on inheritance.  Those measures are typical decisions of a Government that has no conception of the way in which the country should be run.  The Government <Col N="470" /> has decided to nail to the cross those who can most easily be caught.  Workers are already caught and are being over-taxed, some 600,000 of them, according to the Taoiseach this morning.  The decision to tax every inherited property worth more than £10,000, from the humble cottage to the great mansion &mdash; and the Great Creator will some day call &ldquo;Time up&rdquo; for us all &mdash; is an example of a lousy form of nit-picking government.  The Government started off on the wrong foot, it has gone further into the quagmire of incompetence and it is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>One of the indicators of the real income of the country is the number of new cars sold each year.  In 1989, 78,383 new cars were sold in Ireland, in 1990 that figure increased to 83,420, in 1991 it declined to 68,533 and in 1992 it decreased again to approximately 67,700. New car sales give a true indication of the pressure that our people are under, because people generally like to keep their car in reasonably good condition and renew it as often as possible.  An annual reduction of 20,000 in the number of new car sales makes it obvious that great economic pressure is being exerted on a large number of family households.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Education, a Labour Party Minister, met two deputations from County Mayo.  One of those meetings concerned a proposed extension for a large vocational school in Castlebar, County Mayo, namely, Davitt College.  The extension was promised by several Fianna Fáil Party Ministers, who at least took an opportunity to visit the place.  The school was built for about 400 pupils and now has more than 700 pupils. The vocational education committee in County Mayo agreed with the Department's recommendations for a low-cost building.  Yesterday the proposed extension was shot down by the Minister for Education.  The other deputation to meet the Minister was concerned about the long-promised regional technical college for County Mayo.  That matter had dragged on for more than ten years and by early 1987 we had arrived at the stage at which a site had been identified, money had been provided in the 1987 budget, <Col N="471" /> the curriculum had been determined, the number of pupils had been agreed and matters were in hand for the appointment of architects and so on.  Plans were stopped by the previous Fianna Fáil Government and the issue came to a head in November last before the general election.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice of the time, former Minister Flynn, gave a specific Government commitment to the people of County Mayo that in September 1993 third level courses would be set up and running, irrespective of which building the courses were to be held in, and that eventually a college of technical excellence would be provided in the county.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, shot that proposal down in flames and held out no hope at all to the deputation.  I now call on Minister Bhreathnach to clarify in the House for me whether or not she deems Commissioner Padraig Flynn to be a liar. On behalf of the Government, Minister Flynn, as he was at the time, gave a specific commitment, which I do not doubt, to the people of County Mayo that irrespective of what happened, whether or not the Fianna Fáil Party was in Government, the decision was irrevocable and would be honoured.  This was agreed to in writing by the Leader of the Labour Party, now the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who gave the wholehearted support of his party to the concept of a regional technical college for our county. One would now have to assume that the EC Commissioner for Social Affairs was not telling the truth to the people, and in that regard I want clarification in this House from the Minister for Education. I do not believe the former Minister, now Commissioner Flynn, was misleading the people.  He gave to the people a specific commitment, a categoric commitment, a Government commitment, a Flynn commitment. Because the commitment has now been reneged upon one can only assume that the former Minister was not <Col N="472" /> telling the truth and that the Minister for Education now deems him to be a liar.</P>

      <P>Rarely would I resort to the use of such language, but this is a very important and sensitive matter for a great number of people and, as I have said, it has dragged on for more than ten years.  Along with a great many others, I was certainly led to believe the former Minister's words.  I spoke to him at that time.  Following the Minister's meeting with the deputation yesterday, the commitment given does not appear to apply any more.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister for Health well in his onerous position, as a colleague dealing with Whips' business I should wish him well.  However, I note from recent public statements by him that he intends to start work on Tallaght hospital this year and that upwards of £40 million is available to be spent although the Department, and the Minister, are unsure when the work will start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind the House that in 1985 the then Labour Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, gave consent for phase 1 of Castlebar General Hospital to go ahead.  Great credit is due to him &mdash;<Col N="473" /> and has been given &mdash; for this decision. However, phase II remains to be completed and all that is required to do that is an expenditure of £5.5 million over four years.  That figure can be broken down to £600,000 in 1993, £2.5 million in 1994, £2 million in 1995 and £400,000 in 1996.  It is very little to ask in the context of the overall budget of the Department of Health to deal with a matter as sensitive, serious and important as this to the people in County Mayo.  Labour and Fianna Fáil Ministers should remember that the people in the area will have an opportunity to vote in a by-election, it will be a test of the Government's popularity and whether they have honoured their stated commitments.  The hospital has been visited by several Fianna Fáil Ministers who gave commitments in regard to it.  I call on the Minister for Health to visit the hospital to enable him understand that the casualty department with three treatment cubicles is completely inadequate to deal with 15,000 examinations per year.  If this matter is dealt with over a four year period, which is agreeable to the health board and the administration of the hospital, nothing will be heard from County Mayo in relation to this hospital for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>The VAT increase on clothing will be disastrous.  With the exception of Denmark, we will have the highest VAT rates in Europe.  Clothing is not a luxury; within a week of sterling being devalued German customers asked manufacturers on the west coast what the Irish pricing for 1993 would be and the end result will be thousands of job losses with people being forced to source the material abroad, bring it in here, put Irish brand names on it and sell it to the detriment and loss of Irish jobs extending from Donegal to west Kerry.</P>
    <P>More than 10,000 jobs in agriculture will be lost over the next ten years.  It will be a return to the original proposal of Mansholt many years ago which advocated closing small farms and leaving ranches.  Nothing in the budget will do anything for the small farmers, it is one of hopelessness and despair.  The Cabinet <Col N="474" /> were on the fringe of the quagmire, the compass went wrong and they ended up in the middle of it.  The Government is doomed to failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Callely.  The bitter lesson of recent history must be that this country is not just faced with the challenge of creating employment but with the challenge of retaining existing employment.  In this respect there is now an urgent need for a high powered job protection unit to be set up to protect employment.  There must be an immediate recognition of the fact that a newly opened industry &mdash; or indeed existing industries &mdash; cannot be allowed to operate on their own any longer because expertise at the highest level is required in many instances.</P>
      <P>In future Governments must become involved in ascertaining the needs of a given industry and satisfying those needs. It must ensure that training and retraining are available and that there is a continuous assessment &mdash; and reassessment &mdash; of requirements and fundamental needs.  A jobs protection unit would be ideally positioned to note the need for change, growth and adaptability in an increasingly competitive industrial world.  Some economic commentators have predicted that Ireland's unemployment rate will rise to more than 400,000 people by the end of the millenium. Unless we take adequate steps now to protect existing employment this figure will be exceeded.  In an increasingly mechanised and computerised world the creation of new jobs is an even more difficult task.  Accordingly, the distribution and utilisation of limited resources must be carefully considered and continuously scrutinised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eagerly awaited European funding must be narrowly focused, not just on the creation of short term employment but on medium and long term employment. We must use our Structural Funds in the most effective and efficient manner possible.  The county enterprise boards must be asked to zone in on communities to ascertain their long term productivity <Col N="475" /> in terms of job creation and infrastructural development.  The new county enterprise boards are a welcome innovation and the same applied to the Leader programme.  However, it is difficult to envisage these being of considerable assistance to the unemployed unless they are allowed to take an equity in new, small businesses.  Invariably, unemployed people would have little capital to invest.</P>
    <P>Whenever a case is made for increased employment the words &ldquo;indigenous resources&rdquo; are readily mentioned. Clearly our greatest indigenous resources are agriculture and tourism.  The former is very much dependent on the European Community whereas the latter is largely a matter for ourselves.  Our market share has increased significantly but we have singularly failed to market our products to anything like their full potential and this is largely due to political perception. The opening of a large factory is a tremendous political occasion but the unseen &mdash; and often unappreciated &mdash; employment growth in hotels and guesthouses are as unheralded as they are ignored.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte receives £21.5 million by way of a marketing grant and an increase of just £10 million would create more unseen employment than the same investment in manufacturing industry; this must change.  While we must do everything we can to support manufacturing industry the grants available to the tourist industry are totally disproportionate, there are none for creating employment in the industry. There is not &mdash; and there should be &mdash; a double taxation allowance to encourage operators to undertake more marketing in the same industry.  There is a crying need for more grants for further indoor facilities to lengthen the tourist season by increasing business in the off season, thereby reducing seasonal lay-offs.</P>
    <P>Indigenous resources cannot be developed for the benefit of our people if we continue to tolerate concerted opposition to that which is indigenous. For some time now those who strongly <Col N="476" /> oppose the siting, for example, of heavy industry here and the espousal of indigenous means of creating employment have stonewalled the Office of Public Works in their attempts to display Ireland to the world.  Their attempt to defy the State conservationist society has been strongly supported by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the chairman of the Labour parliamentary party.  This is not simply an affront to our heritage and employment but also to small communities trying to save their children from having to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I said previously that there are two kinds of environmental blackguardism, the first is the systematic rape of our mountains, valleys, rivers and lakes, the environment <i>per se</i>, and the second is the contemptuous dismissal of a community's right to utilise its indigenous resources for the benefit of its people.  Environmental élitism and armchair meandering are the champagne of the satisfied.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that the time is now ripe for the implementation of the proposal in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to people with physical disability.  Unfortunately, to a large extent we have overlooked their needs.  For example, it should be incumbent on local authorities to structure footpath kerbs to provide easy access for the physically disabled.  Public buildings should be adapted to cater for people with disabilities.  I attended an interesting meeting in Tralee, County Kerry, some weeks ago at which the views of those with a physical disability were strongly expressed.  It was stressed repeatedly that one of the main difficulties facing those with a physical disability is access &mdash; access to footpaths, houses, buildings and public transport.  Access to such places for an able-bodied human being is taken for granted, but for people with physical disabilities access to public places is a great barrier.  In saying this I stress that people with a physical disability do not want pity or sympathy; they want to be treated equally.  People should have access to public places &mdash; for example, to health board buildings to obtain a medical card.  It is clear that barriers do exist <Col N="477" /> for the disabled and this should not be the case.  Disabled persons should have an equal opportunity in what is supposed to be an equal society.</P>
    <P>In order that the nation is not deprived of Deputy Callely's words of wisdom, I will conclude by saying that as well as focusing on communities in regard to the creation of employment and in so far as that focus must be narrow to obtain the maximum benefit, it could also be said that our educational process, which is a debate for another day, is too narrowly focused and should be broadened.  The concept of an enterprise culture must be introduced to Irish education, but in doing so traditional values and beliefs must not be case aside.  If this progress is achieved in the coming years we will at least retain existing employment and, hopefully, begin to reduce the numbers on the live register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1993 Budget has received mixed reaction from various commentators and one of the leading chartered accountancy firms in Dublin stated:</P>
      <P>The budget is a mere statement of intent.  The statement of intent heard today appears to tinker with the system rather than address any major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all prepared for a tough budget on the understanding that radical measures were necessary and that the new patnership Government was expected to introduce a dynamic and creative budget geared towards confronting the challenges that lie ahead. The first necessary steps for prudent management, with a certain dynamism in relation to the Irish economy, have been successfully implemented by Fianna Fáil in the spirit of partnership between Government, employers and the trade unions.  In 1987 the foundations were poured with the publication of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is of enormous significance in the context of relations between the social partners and in achieving greater economic and social progress.  No previous <Col N="478" /> Governments were able to achieve such success and it must be stated clearly that, as with any partnership, no one party to agreements can claim all the credit.  However, I want to put on record that the achievements and agreements negotiated in recent years took place under Fianna Fáil led administrations. Fianna Fáil has made a good start and demonstrated clearly its desire to develop our economy in the best national interest and in preparation for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen proper management of the economy and addressed the serious economic difficulties which were slowly destroying this great country.  Now that, hopefully, the most difficult stage is over, we cannot relax and slip back to the old ways of mismanagement with no direction or control. In this regard I want to sound a word of caution in regard to the public perception of the recent budget and of the Government in relation to the appointment of a certain elite personnel, heretofore referred to as the golden circle and now referred to as the family circle.</P>
    <P>In attempting to assess the 1993 Budget regard must be given to the constraints under which the new Government must operate and the background of economic and budgetary difficulties overshadowed by the massive national debt carried over since the mid-eighties when we had Coalition Governments and excessive borrowings.  Of course, the continuing international recession and currency crisis do not make the Government's task easier.  Fianna Fáil's six point plan for national progress contained in our general election manifesto is included in the budget.  The first priority in that manifesto was job creation.  No other budget in recent years has made similar provision for job creation.  A job fund of £250 million has been set up to promote recovery in job creation.  An initial £25 million was provided under the county enterprise partnership boards to help develop the potential for enterprise, wealth and employment creation that exists at local level.  Exchequer funding of £149 million and EC funding of £97 million has been made available for additional enterprise <Col N="479" /> and training schemes.  This year's public capital programme has been increased by £500 million to £2,340 million.  If these funds are utilised correctly and the national development plan is properly policed we will put the country back to work and make a positive move towards reversing the unacceptable trend of rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>I welcome Fianna Fáil's initiative and fresh approach as outlined in our manifesto. In particlar, I welcome the establishment of the new Department of Enterprise and Employment which, for the first time, will bring together the relevant Departments to focus on job creation.  We recognise that there can be no quick fixes, but a co-ordinated approach with sound economic and fiscal policies will ensure continued economic growth with sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of measures introduced in the budget.  First, I welcome the budgets decision to remain within the Maastricht Treaty parameters in relation to Government borrowing.  We should continue to adhere strictly to Government policy adopted since 1987 in regard to control of our public finances.  I welcome the provision of £20 million to reduce hospital waiting lists, although this has been mitigated somewhat by the Minister for Health's decision to impose an increase in out-patient charges.  In the current climate this is a harsh measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the local authority house building programme and the increased resources which will be made available for the various aspects of the plan for social housing.  I have some reservations about the imposition of the 1 per cent levy on people whose income is in excess of £9,000 per annum.  I put down a question to the Minister recently in relation to the introduction of the youth employment levy to be allocated to programmes to create youth employment. That levy was introduced in 1987 and is still in place today.  It was changed under the Labour Services Act, 1987, which extended the levy to employment and training generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the preparation of this report which reviews the relationship between economic growth and employment growth in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> I note that, when account is taken of the role of agriculture over the past 30 years, Ireland's non-agricultural employment record is substantially better than the average for the EC.  There have been significant variations in the relationship between output and total employment growth in that period.  These reflect the impact at various times of: (i) decline in agricultural employment; (ii) the increasing share of output from manufacturing industry during the eighties which was associated with very high productivity growth, and (iii) the expansion of public sector employment in the seventies followed by a reduction in the eighties as a result of necessary fiscal correction.</P>
    <P>While Ireland did not experience the increase in employment intensity which occurred in Europe in the eighties, reflecting an increased share of output from services and a reduction in productivity growth in the services sector, the rate of employment growth here was the same as that for the EC as a whole. This reflected a higher rate of output growth in Ireland in the late eighties.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that Ireland's pattern of economic growth in recent years is less employment intensive than in the past.  While rates of employment growth have been as good as the EC as a whole, non-European OECD countries have sustained a significantly better employment performance.  Ireland needs to maintain high rates of output growth and to increase the employment impact of that output particularly in view of our high labour force increase.  I note also that the council, in conjunction with the EC Commission, will be examining policies to increase the employment intensity of growth.</P>
    <P>Finally, last week's budget represented the first step towards implementing new measures for jobs contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government such as: the implementation of the recommendations in the Culliton report; development and strengthening of the State enterprise sector; a new national development plan to draw down our receipts of about £8 billion under the EC <Col N="484" /> Structural and Cohesion Funds; a jobs fund with initial resources of £250 million to accelerate public investment in major capital projects; a community development programme for the long term unemployed; targeted wage subsidies for those over a year on the live register; new apprenticeship, vocational, education and training schemes; and major development programmes for our national resources, such as food, tourism, farming and the marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate what his Government has in mind by way of policies &ldquo;to increase the employment intensity of growth&rdquo;, to use his own phrase, whatever it means, and if the Government has any plans to implement any of the proposals made in the NESC report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question on our policies to increase the employment intensity of growth, I am sure Deputy Dukes would be the first to agree with me that although we had very high rates of growth over the past four to five years, averaging at about 4.5 to 5 per cent, we did not achieve the increase in jobs that we would normally expect with that level of growth. On a close examination it is clear that what has happened in the Irish economy is that as far back as 1965 approximately 35 per cent of our workforce was engaged in agriculture but by 1992 this was down to 11 per cent.  Quite clearly there has been a fall-out in agricultural employment; in addition, the numbers employed in the public sector were reduced and most important of all we did not capitalise on the large investment in manufacturing industry over the past ten to 15 years because approximately 25 per cent to 26 per cent of the goods and services requirement of large investment in this country are being supplied internally and the rest are being imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, there is a gap in the linkage between large investment and the jobs related to it.  We are not getting the added-value in this economy and that is what we have to strive for.  The Deputy <Col N="485" /> asked about the NESC and what our policies are and I should like to tell him that NESC is already engaged in planning how to increase the labour and employment intensity from output.  They are considering two specific areas at the request of the Government: the maximum feasible rate of growth for Ireland and whether we are under-achieving in present circumstances.  It has been asked, in view of the present large balance of payments surplus, whether we are under-investing in the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a large balance of payments surplus before the Central Statistics Office copped on to itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should look at this matter again because in the last two years the balance of payments surplus was as stated.  In 1986 and 1987 when the Deputy's party were in Government mistakes were made.  The present situation in relation to the balance of payments is on the record and the Deputy should not try to change that.  The EC Commission will also provide additional assistance for these projects and, indeed, will provide the finance to achieve policies in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Taoiseach's response that, whoever wrote that answer for him produced pure gibberish. The NESC report was not read. That report debunked the self-delusion we have been engaged in.  Does the Taoiseach know that the whole purpose of the NESC report is to examine the phenomenon of transfer pricing by multinationals? Does he know that the output on productivity to which he referred has been grossly artifically inflated by the multinational sector in order to boost their profits within this tax jurisdiction and that this helps to partially explain why the normal relationship between jobs and growth does not exist in this economy?  When taken together with the phenomenon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

May I ask the Taoiseach if, on the basis of his answer, I can reasonably come to the conclusion that the only thing that is happening about the NESC report is that the NESC is planning to have discussions with the European Commission?  Would the Taoiseach agree that this is yet another case where the Government is simply totally ignoring the little fundamental research work that is being done here in relation to our employment crisis?

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your admonition, Sir.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the table in the NESC report, for example, that shows that by comparison with our European partners productivity here was, on average, 150 per cent greater than that of any company here in the multinational enclave?  Will he accept that that is manifest nonsense?  Is he aware that the report highlights what has become known as the Coca Cola phenomenon whereby one plant here is exporting more coke than would feed the entire United States, which is manifestly a distortion of the statistics?  Why does the Taoiseach continue in self-delusion and why do we not face up to these facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always faced up to the facts.  I have never denied that transfer pricing has an effect on our statistics.  If we want to talk about transfer pricing and talk about real job creation, I am in the business of talking about job creation.  Quoting statistics such as Deputy Rabbitte has done will not create a single job.  We want to know what are the deficiencies in our economy.  We have performed as good as any country in the EC, leaving aside what is happening in <Col N="489" /> relation to agriculture.  As everyone knows no country suffered the fall-out from agriculture in the past 30 years that we did.  The Deputy should not ignore these facts.  Of course there has been transfer pricing in this economy but we have to put that aside and get down to the root cause of why we have not the jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>OECD countries with a similar growth to ours have better employment intensity from the growth than is the case here.  It is quite clear that our added value is not sufficient and we have not taken up the opportunities of linkages.  If we had, we could have produced thousands of extra jobs in the electronics sector alone &mdash; this matter relates to events of last week in Digital. Opportunities for the supply of £300 million worth of components in the electronics industry were not taken up here and until we get the linkage aspect right we will be deficient in jobs.</P>

      <P>Information on the total number of retail outlets is obtained from periodic Censuses of Distribution.  Censuses were conducted in 1971, 1977 and 1987.  The total number of outlets engaged in retail distribution in these years were 33,850, 32,332 and 31,699, respectively.  Work began in 1992 on the updating of the business register for this sector but figures for that year are not yet available.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the downward spiral of the number of people involved in the retail trade will be proved when the statistics are available.  I know this is a statistical question, but I put it to the Minister of State that the retail trade is on its knees, that small businesses are being cannibalised by the supermarkets and that jobs are being lost.  Will the Minister of State bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or unemployment?</P>

It is a premeditated endeavour at disorder, especially coming to Priority Questions for which 20 minutes is provided in the Standing Orders of this House.  It is most audacious of any Member to interrupt that precious time. If the Deputy sincerely wishes to get an answer, I have the answer for him.  My office is available to him for this purpose.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware by now that I have sent a detailed and wideranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK Inspectorate of Pollution.  This submission conveyed in the strongest possible terms the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities, and I wish to restate this position to this House.  In particular, the submission expressed the Government's grave concerns about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea.  The British authorities have acknowledged receipt of our submission and have also informed us that they are currently considering whether there is a need to make changes to the draft authorisation in the light of comments received.  Once they have decided whether, and if so how, the authorisations should be amended, the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will consider whether to afford the opportunity of a hearing in accordance with the terms of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Copies of the Government's submission were made available to all Deputies.  I have since sent copies of the submission to the EC Commissioner for the Environment and the Energy Commissioner. I can inform the Deputies that many environmental organisations have conveyed their appreciation to me on the submission.</P>
    <P>I have also written to the UK Minister for the Environment recently expressing my serious concerns at radioactive discharges into the environment from Sellafield which occurred during the week ending on 13 February.  Deputies will be aware also that at a meeting on 25 February with a delegation of directors from British Nuclear Fuels who were in Dublin for an all-party meeting, I reiterated all our concerns in relation to Sellafield and repeated the Government's call for a full public inquiry on THORP.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of international legal action over Sellafield, the Attorney General has advised that there is no evidence to date to suggest that operations at the entire complex, including the proposed operation of the THORP plant, are or will be in breach of EC law and international conventions which would sustain a successful legal action.  However, the situation is being kept under continuous review.  In this connection, the High Court case in London against British Nuclear Fuels, involving childhood leukaemia, is being closely monitored by my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that we have in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, which is a plan of action designed to provide a response to accidents involving a release of radioactivity into the environment which would pose a danger to the Irish public. A copy of the plan will by now have been received by all Deputies.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have a special responsibility for radioactivity monitoring and for the provision of information to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying <Col N="497" /> that the Government's submission would have been too late but for the fact that the British Government extended the closing date?  The closing date was 11 January and we at that date did not have our submission prepared.  Could the Minister explain why there was that delay?  Will the Minister insist that the Irish Government get a hearing irrespective of any rules in UK legislation that may prevent us from receiving a hearing following our submission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The submission was submitted within the time available.  The Department was anxious, as was I when I took up office, to give the necessary authorisation and support for the excellent submission which has been made. In relation to the possibility of a public hearing being held, UK legislation provides that the Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment must allow a hearing to take place in the case of the draft authorisation limits if BNFL should wish it.  The Secretary of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also have the statutory responsibility for considering whether local authorities or other persons should be given the opportunity of a hearing.  I understand that any such hearing would almost certainly be in public.  There is nothing in the legislation to limit the scope of the hearing, so on this basis I called on the UK authorities for a full public inquiry into the THORP plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, further to the meeting of representatives from Sellafield with representatives of this Parliament, if he is aware that we were informed by Mr. Bonson that information regarding the leak in Sellafield in early February was given to us as a matter of courtesy? Has he asked his British counterpart, the Minister for Energy, why certain guidelines are not given to the authorities in Sellafield to make information available on any unexpected emissions to both the British and Irish Governments, or will we have to depend on the courtesy of <Col N="498" /> the authorities in Sellafield to know what exactly is happening in the plant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met that delegation privately I expressed my strong concern in relation to this matter.  Deputy Liam Lawlor was in attendance and can confirm that.  In relation to the arrangements for reporting to this country incidents arising from operations in Sellafield, there is an arrangement operated by the United Kingdom authorities. Nuclear operators in the UK have agreed to report all incidents involving a release of radioactivity to the Department of the Environment's Inspectorate of Pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1986, at a meeting of the Irish-UK contact group on nuclear issues, the UK agreed that we would be notified of all incidents notified to the Inspectorate of Pollution.  This arrangement has been quite effective in operation; but there are still some incidents not involving a release of radioactivity, but considered newsworthy, which are not reported to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and consequently are not passed on to us.  In practice the Department of the Environment in London and the British Embassy try to meet this gap.  Under a separate incident reporting system in the UK, nuclear operators are required to report all on-site incidents to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive.  This requirement forms part of the licensing conditions.  The incidents reported are published in a quarterly bulletin listing all incidents reported during the relevant quarter.  A copy of this bulletin is sent to this Department.</P>

      <P>Apart from the cost of administering the Department, which formulates and co-ordinates energy policy, it is not expected that new initiatives in the energy area will represent any significant cost on the Exchequer.

      <P>In response to the Minister's reply in which he said he does not expect a change in costs to the Exchequer, may I ask him, in view of the proposal for a gas interconnector and in view of the application made by the ESB for a price increase, does the Minister then state that it is the consumer who will have to pay for any improvements in efficiency which will take place either in gas or the ESB?  Can he give any assurance to consumers that they will not have to face exorbitant increases both in ESB and gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas interconnector or any other new initiatives for the purpose of electricity generation capital projects is not envisaged to be a cost on the Exchequer.  The gas interconnector project is the responsibility of Bord Gáis Éireann.  The ESB is <Col N="500" /> responsible for providing new generating capacity.  The position of the Government in regard to the new peat station proposals is that a feasibility study is being conducted and the matter of financing that project will depend on the results of the study.  In relation to any proposed increases or applications for an increase from the ESB, I would point out to the Deputy that there have been reductions in the price of electricity during the past number of years as a result of the implementation of the ESB's energy policies.  Any proposals that come to me will have to be based on improving the competitive position of the ESB. Despite the low density population in Ireland our electricity price is less than the Community average.  Clearly, while there is no room for complacency, we will be seeking to drive those costs down at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11, 28, 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to co-operate fully with the Government in implementing the thrust of the recommendations of the Culliton report within my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of reduction in freight costs on the Irish Sea and between Ireland and the Continent the position is that the private shipping companies operating the services are not under my <Col N="503" /> control.  I understand that the vessels require upgrading in order to become more efficient, to increase frequency and ultimately to reduce costs.  To that end my Department has been pressing the EC for grant aid.  The programme for Government states that grants will be sought for access transport, especially mobile assets with special reference to investment in direct shipping services to continental Europe.  In regard to air freight services, events have now superseded the Culliton recommendation on EC deregulation of air transport.  Policy is now directed towards ensuring Ireland has an open and competitive air transport system which takes account of Ireland's needs for reliable and regular, commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry, at least economic cost.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to cost of overseas telephone calls is that the Government is committed to making the telecommunications service as competitive as possible and recognises the need to rebalance all its charges to meet competition.  Telecom Éireann has submitted detailed proposals for such a rebalancing of charges to secure a firmer long term basis for its revenue.  These proposals are being examined as a matter of urgency at present in my Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to cost of electricity, a reduction in price was effected a number of times since 1986 and the ESB considers there is no scope for any further reduction.  In fact, I have an application before me from the ESB for a price increase due to rising costs.  I am very conscious of the need to keep industrial costs as low as possible and this will be reflected in my analysis of ESB's needs.</P>
    <P>It is Bord Gáis policy that gas prices will remain competitive with alternative fuels.  Gas prices to the industrial and commercial sectors, therefore, are governed by tariffs or contracts which track the price of oil.  It is not possible at this stage to forecast what the price of gas will be over the period.  Oil prices are currently low and further reductions, if any, are likely to be relatively insignificant. <Col N="504" /> The board has recently given a commitment that prices in the domestic sector will not be increased before the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>The oil market in Ireland is largely a private sector market.  The operation of the Whitegate Refinery has a small impact on the consumer price of petrol and gasoil and it is the intention of the Government that investment in Whitegate will take place to reduce and, if possible, eliminate that impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the fact that I missed the beginning of the Minister's reply.  That was due to the fact that my office is so far from here.  May I ask the Minister in regard to telecommunications charges if he recalls that the previous Government made a decision in January last that there should be an immediate reduction in the cost of overseas telephone calls as that factor was seen as a major and unnecessary impediment to Irish business?  In view of that decision, which was to be conveyed to Telecom Éireann straightaway, and which I am sure it was, and given that our overseas telephone calls, the ones most relevant to industry and business, are, on average, about 35 per cent higher than the Europe average why has there been such a long delay in implementing that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of tariffs is a complex one.  It is necessary to ensure that any rebalancing proposals approved constitute the best possible solution.  I must make it clear to the House that any rebalancing proposals approved by me will, broadly speaking, have to be self-financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial state of Telecom Éireann, given its high level of borrowings and the emergence of competition in what were formerly monopoly areas, does not make it possible for the company to reduce charges without being satisfied that it will recoup the loss elsewhere. In considering rebalancing proposals I must consider what is best in the overall national interest while at the same <Col N="505" /> time ensuring that the revenues of Telecom are protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish Sea is described frequently as the most expensive piece of water in the world and that while it is only about 60 miles wide between the various main ports the cost of transporting goods across those 60 miles is greater than it is across any comparable stretch of water in the world?  Indeed, it is more costly to transport goods across those 60 miles than it is to transport goods 600, 1,000 or 1,500 miles in other parts of the world. Can the Minister take specific steps to ensure that this huge cost impediment to Irish industry is removed and that normal levels of tariffs or charges will be incurred in future on the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that any development or improvement in infrastructure within Ireland can be very much negatived if we do not improve access from our ports to the markets.  As I said in the early part of my reply in regard to the reduction of freight costs on the Irish Sea and between Ireland and the Continent &mdash; the Deputy may have missed this &mdash; the position is that the private shipping companies operating the services are not under my control.  The vessels require upgrading in order to become more efficient and ultimately reduce costs.  To that end my Department has been pressing the EC for grant-aid, not successfully thus far, I have to say.  The question the Deputy raises is an important factor in determining our competitiveness, now that the internal market has been completed, and it is one which has a high priority in my Department for funding under the National Development Plan which is presently being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, Sir, certainly. Would the Minister agree that one of the other factors contributing significantly to the high costs relating to shipping and exporting from this country is the level of port charges in this country, especially in Dublin?  I think the port charges in Dublin are four or five times greater than they are in Larne with the result that a surprisingly high proportion of exports from the Republic go out through the port of Larne.  Can the Minister take steps to have Irish port charges reduced and, in particular, the Dublin charges which are extraordinarily high given the very bad level of service through Dublin port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that the situation at Dublin port has improved in recent times and that improved work practices are now in place.  Clearly, one of the most practical methods of ensuring that Dublin port becomes far more competitive with Larne and other ports, such as Waterford, in the Republic is to make further infrastructural investment at the port conditional on the cost base being right and competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> other ports in the country.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Question Nos. 9 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>On 27 October 1992, the Government reaffirmed Shannon Airport as Ireland's sole transatlantic gateway for scheduled air services.  This decision was arrived at following the detailed consideration of all the submissions received, both for and against a change in policy and following consultations with all the interested parties involved.</P>
      <P>One of the submissions received in favour of a change in policy contained a study of the number of passengers who travel between Ireland and North America via airports in the UK.  The Government's reasons for retaining the Shannon stop policy were explained in detail at the time of the announcement of the decision.  I have no plans to undertake a review of that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if his Department has made any attempt to verify the figures which were given in the DKM study which showed that something like 100,000 passengers go through London?  Has he made any attempt to update those findings or to establish figures for the numbers of passengers going through Glasgow and Manchester?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The study to which the Deputy referred was based on research carried out by the British civil aviation authorities.  We would be broadly in agreement that those are the figures.  In order to address that problem it is clear that we need to ensure that our national airline is in a position to win back those markets &mdash; it has suffered a loss of market share <i>vis-à-vis</i> its other competitors.  These issues are being actively considered by the board, management and my Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>With regard to the competitiveness <Col N="508" /> of the national airline, would the Minister like to tell us what steps the Government intends to take to provide additional equity to the national airline? Will he amplify the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance which seemed to be rather vague on that matter?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement and the position of the Government, in line with the programme for Government &mdash; which is to ensure the commercial future of the airline &mdash; is that the Government would support a viable and convincing recovery plan once it is in place. As the Deputy knows, all airlines have been going through a very difficult period.  The core airline business has been experiencing difficulties for some years now.  I received a report during the past few weeks and this is being actively assessed as a matter of top priority in my Department.  As soon as the assessment on whether the measures contained in the report are sufficient to deal with the issue and to ensure a commercial future for the national airline the appropriate decisions will be taken.  As I said, this report is under active and urgent consideration in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this will be done as soon as possible. It is important that we get it right and do not jump in and make decisions in regard to this matter.  This is not in any way to minimise the difficulties the airline is <Col N="509" /> experiencing.  In the interests of all the stakeholders in the airline, the shareholders, the workforce, the management, the board and the creditors, a recovery plan will be put forward which we hope will ensure a viable and prosperous future for the airline in the years ahead.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that, as with all wells drilled, data from the well has been supplied to my Department which maintains its confidentiality for certain specified periods.</P>
      <P>However, following completion of their well the company issued a press statement on the drilling results.  The well encountered a number of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir formations and, as stated by the company, short term tests over two reservoir intervals resulted in the recovery of a small quantity of low-gravity oil.  While I am pleased to note that the well confirmed the presence of quantities of oil, the result was disappointing. The company has permanently plugged and abandoned the well and has indicated that further work will be undertaken to assess the potential of the area.</P>

Is the Department dependent on the exploration companies for the supply of updated information, or do they simply react when requested for the information? It seems extraordinary that the media have information of vital national interest which we as public representatives do not.

If data confirmed the basis of a commercial undertaking and the company who carried out the exploration was not prepared to go ahead, we would see if other people were interested in proceeding further. The whole thrust of policy is to increase the level in offshore exploration and to interest people in drilling.  Attractive licensing terms are available.  There will be some drilling this year but we would love to get back to the days where there was a lot of drilling.</P>

      <P>A national development plan, which will be the basis for the next round of EC Structural Funds programmes, is currently in preparation. Work on this plan is being co-ordinated by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. It is the Government's intention to seek EC funding, under the plan, for an integrated package of transport investment proposals, including proposals for Ireland's participation in the new Cohesion Fund.  Final decisions as to the amount of funding to be allocated to transport investment will depend on the Government's assessment of overall national priorities and on the outcome of detailed negotiations with the EC.</P>

In addition, the programme places a new emphasis on the development of public transport as well as recognising that the mainline rail network is an integral element of our transport infrastructure.

The Department of the Marine is in some way responsible for ports and sea transport, the Department of the Environment has an important role to play in motor transport and freight transportation, while this Minister has other important functions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that different Departments are responsible for different aspects of our transport infrastructure, but that should not militate against a coherent, integrated policy. Under the national development plan the Minister for Finance, as the person who will be sending the application, is the co-ordinator. In regard to the Dublin Transportation Initiative, the Minister for the Environment and I are working hand in hand to bring forward proposals to implement it, particularly the capital projects which have employment potential. We want those projects up and running as soon as possible.  The premise behind the question that one needs all these things in the same Department in order to get a coherent response may look logical, but existing arrangements do not militate against a coherent policy being brought <Col N="513" /> forward.  That will be evident where the national development plan is forwarded to Brussels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 54 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>A number of studies on energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy have been undertaken over the past few years on behalf of my Department. These have confirmed the potential for savings through improved management and the use of better technology.</P>
      <P>My policy is to promote such energy conservation to achieve financial savings, to protect the environment and to avoid waste of scarce resources.</P>
      <P>A wide range of measures are being used to achieve these aims.  These include, for example in the domestic sector, a pilot project on energy certification of houses; appliance labelling; and the provision of an energy phone for inquiries from the general public.  In the industrial sector seminars are being organised and specific advice offered to companies.  Looking to the future generations, an education pack is being developed for secondary schools which will emphasise the importance of energy and environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Such a programme cannot be static however and I have asked that an overall analysis be carried out to identify where future initiatives can have the greatest impact on consumption and the pattern of energy supply.  Nor can such a programme have finite timescale.  While initial savings may be relatively easily secured, continued effort will be required to ensure these are not lost and that the momentum is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Department has a good information programme on how to conserve energy.  Has the Department any plans to introduce any incentive to encourage people towards energy conservation?  How much energy does the Department devote towards researching new energy technology? Has the Minister any plans to expand on those?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department constantly monitor the use of energy and tries to promote an energy conscious and effective use by the general consumer both on the domestic side and on the industrial side.  In co-operation with the semi-State bodies there is a major effort being made, particularly by the ESB, to promote efficiency in electricity use.  If we were to provide monetary incentives we would be spending scarce resources. The Department believe we must educate the public in the proper use of energy and make sure that the savings they make are positively in their favour by educating people on how those savings can be made.  It is up to the Department to constantly inform the public about the importance of proper energy use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the Minister says, in particular about the ESB, how does he square their efforts to promote energy conservation and good energy use with their constant advertising encouraging people generally to use more electricity?  In particular they advertise uses of electricity which are not in most efficient means of achieving what one would want to achieve.  For example, gas is clearly a far more efficient way of cooking.  Why, therefore, should the ESB be encouraged or allowed to advocate the use of electricity for cooking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is a man of great experience in various Departments and would be the first to recognise that the ESB is a commercial company.  It has to operate on commercial criteria and compete with other <Col N="516" /> organisations who are providing energy options.  It obviously has to advertise to ensure that people are aware of the advantages of using electricity.  The ESB are promoting the use of more efficient lighting, water heating and insulation in Irish homes.  Deputy O'Malley would agree that, even though the ESB do promote more use of electricity, they also advocate more efficient use of electricity. They are also encouraging energy efficiency in the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors through promotional literature, seminars and workshops, visits to premises and various other promotional measures.  We have to recognise that they are making a very major contribution both in managing our electricity utility and in ensuring that we have an efficient use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a huge financial incentive in the investment in roads as a result of Government policy which encourages people to use cars which guzzle petrol while at the same time we see the public transport system falling apart?  It is the responsibility of the Minister when looking at infrastructural developments to identify where Government and EC moneys are spent on projects that are wasteful of energy and on projects that conserve energy.  At the moment we have a public transport system that is being run down and is non-existent in many rural areas and the only way that people can travel is by car.  That in itself is providing an incentive for people to waste energy, people who would much prefer to be able to avail of the public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy McManus has said, but I think she would agree that with the affluence that arose over the past 30 years consumers chose to acquire their own cars and use the roads and to move away from public transport.  The public transport sector has suffered as a result of that. There is now a new attitude.  The programme for Government clearly shows that there will be equal investment and <Col N="517" /> equal opportunities in all types of infrastructure and all types of transport.  This will help to bring about a balance and hopefully ensure that we are more energy efficient and more energy conscious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed by the Minister's statement that he did not consider it worthwhile to provide incentives to people to conserve energy in view of the fact that we use 25 per cent more energy to £1 of output than any other country.  It has been estimated that if we could reduce our energy use by 25 per cent it would mean a saving of £700 million to the Department of Energy and that could sustain almost 20,000 jobs. Would the Minister not therefore review his statement?  Perhaps some of those programme managers might advise the Minister on this very important issue.  I would like to hear from him then as to his views on the value of providing incentives for energy conservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that energy efficiency reduces capital costs and makes the whole operation of any project that demands energy use much more efficient. If we balance that against the cost of administering a grant incentive system or anything like that, it would not just be to the net benefit of the taxpayers of this country.  Our duty as a Government, and our particular duty as a Department, is to ensure that people are informed about the proper use of energy and about energy efficiency so that they themselves see the merit in such efficiency which will <Col N="518" /> lead in turn to them, and ultimately the State, saving money.</P>

Cablelink (Waterford) Ltd. hold the licence for the provision of cable television service to Waterford city and the Ferrybank area is within the boundary of the licence.</P>
      <P>Cablelink have advised that the main difficulty with provision of cable service to Belmont Road is the necessity to cross the main Waterford to New Ross road (N25).  Cablelink are in touch with Kilkenny County Council concerning the possibility of getting duct space to cross that road in order to get service to the homes on Belmont Road at a reasonable price.  Cablelink expect to be in a position to provide MMDS service in the Rockshire Road area in the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his reply in relation to this matter. Would he consider it reasonable to expect that a service should be provided to the residents I mentioned in my question when they are willing to pay for this service and to pay now?  Great efforts were made by the residents of the area to get a commitment from Cablelink, Waterford, and to elicit the type of information the Minister is giving to this House.  Would the Minister not agree that it would have been much easier had the company given this information to the residents rather than having a Dáil <Col N="519" /> Deputy raise the matter here?  Would the Minister and his Department take a personal interest in making sure that the company honours the commitments entered into and conveyed to the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

Does he accept that this problem mirrors similar problems experienced all around the country?  I understand that Cablelink and Telecom Éireann have reached agreement with regard to the use of Telecom ducts.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The severe traffic congestion and transportation problems of Dublin city and its immediate hinterland are the subject of <Col N="523" /> a major initiative, the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which is being co-funded by the EC authorities.  The interim report of the DTI has recently been published.</P>
    <P>The interim report contains proposals for an integrated strategy involving a programme of transportation investment involving roads, public transport, traffic management and enforcement measures for the period 1994-97 under the next phase of EC Structural Funds.  This programme is set in the context of a full transportation strategy for Dublin up to the year 2011.</P>
    <P>The interim report contains significant recommendations for major public transport investment in Dublin, including the development of a light rail system and significant enhancements of existing bus and rail services.  The strategy also involves a series of traffic management and strategy support measures, including park and ride facilities, bus priorities, parking restraint, enhanced electronic traffic signalling and detection systems and a range of other measures.</P>
    <P>The main public transport elements of the DTI recommended strategy are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The development of a light rail system, serving Cabinteely to the city centre (via the old Harcourt St. line); Tallaght to the city centre; the city centre to Drumcondra (and possibly Dublin Airport, with the further possibility of a spur line to Finglas).</P>
    <P>(2)  The development of ten &ldquo;quality bus&rdquo; corridors on selected bus corridors serving Blanchardstown, Finglas, Swords, Malahide, Bray, Churchtown, Tallaght, Templeogue, Neilstown and Lucan.  The quality bus concept involves the development of new high quality single deck coaches on specific corridors which accord a high degree of on-street priority to buses.  It also involves significant enhancements in the availability of real time information to passengers.</P>
    <P>(3)  Possible extensions of the existing DART services to Malahide and Greystones, <Col N="524" /> improvements to diesel-based commuter services and the construction of a number of new stations.  The question of constructing a mainline rail link to Dublin Airport is also to be considered.</P>
    <P>At present these recommendations are the subject of further extensive analysis by the DTI, the results of which will be reflected in the final report of the DTI, which is expected in April 1993.</P>
    <P>Both the interim and final reports of the DTI will form an integral part of the Government's input into negotiations on EC funds for the period after 1993.  I wish to emphasise to the House that the availability of significant levels of EC funds will be essential for the implementation of the public transport elements of the DTI.  This matter will be pursued as a priority issue by both myself and the Minister for the Environment, in keeping with the Government's strong commitment to the development of public transport in Dublin included in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for educating me in relation to the Dublin Transportation Initiative but, with all due respect, he did not actually answer my question.  My question asked when the programme would be implemented.  We are all well aware of the proposals of the DTI but we also know that the previous Government made specific proposals for light rail.  Specific measures were outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government and I should like to know when those measures will be carried out. I recognise that EC funding is essential, but EC funding is not needed to make a decision on when the job of work will be done.  I again ask the Minister when does he envisage that the programme of work will start.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will accept that until the final report of the DTI is available to me it would be premature to make major policy decisions on public transport in Dublin and its hinterland.  It has also been made clear that the contingency is that sufficient <Col N="525" /> EC funds be available.  It is obvious that the quantity of EC funds available for the initiative will determine the extent to which the total package can be implemented.  In relation to the Government input into this initiative, both the Minister for the Environment and I regard this matter as a priority issue in terms of improving the transportation infrastructure of Dublin and its hinterland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The mainline railway system, which has been the poor relation through the years as far as transport infrastructure is concerned and which needs major upgrading &mdash; Sligo comes to mind &mdash; has problems of which I am well aware.

Will he commit himself to ensuring that a detailed plan will be prepared within a specific time limit to enable us to avail of the forthcoming tranche of EC funds?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that, as I outlined in reply to an earlier question, the Minister for the Environment and I have already set up a co-ordinating group to look at the interim report so that we will be in a position to bring forward capital projects outlined in the interim report, quite apart from the final report.  Given the lack of traffic management in the city and the negative impact which that has on it and on the people who live in it, and those in the <Col N="526" /> outlying area, I agree that this is a matter of significance.  It should, and will, be given priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a commitment to a diesel option commuter rail network from Ballyfermot to Clondalkin and north Kildare?  It was a £32 million approved project scaled down to exclude reopening the line under the Phoenix Park but providing a commuter platform in Heuston Station.  Will that work go ahead or has it been bogged down in all this studying, reports and so on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister familiar with light rail systems?  Does he accept that for such a system to be viable it must depend largely on a big inner city population which Dublin does not have? As that is the case, the cost of subsidisation on a current basis is very substantial indeed.  Did the Minister take that into consideration when examining the prospects for a light rail system for Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, the Dublin Transportation Initiative is probably the first real attempt to plan an integrated programme for rail and road.  The urban renewal programmes and the incentives, particularly in the private housing sector, in city centre areas has been relatively successful and will continue, particularly as the business expansion schemes are being extended.  We are seeking to ensure that this will be a success in all areas and the integrated approach which the Deputy outlined is the way forward.</P>

      <P>Is the commuter line to Arklow included in this proposal?  Many commuters travel from Arklow although, strictly speaking, they are based in County Wicklow.  They are linked to the Dublin system and perhaps the Minister will consider that point.  Perhaps it is not fair to ask the question at present.</P>

    <Title>Greencore Shareholding: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much comment, both in the media and elsewhere, on the question of the State's residual shareholding of 30.4 per cent in Greencore.  I would now like to report on the factual situation to the House.</P>
      <P>I would first like to deal with the issues of the shareholding limitation of 15 per cent and the national sugar quota, both of which are safeguarded by the special shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish sugar quota &mdash; and I want to <Col N="576" /> emphasise that this is a national quota &mdash; is allocated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and is not the property of Greencore.  It cannot and will not be transferred elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Act, 1991, provided for the holding of a special &ldquo;golden&rdquo; share in Greencore by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The purpose of this share was to protect the sugar quota when the State's holding fell below 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The share confers certain exclusive rights on the Minister and the Act prohibits him from disposing of this share. It would require an Act of the Oireachtas for this share to be disposed of.  There is absolutely no question of the Government bringing forward any such amending legislation.  Let me emphasise this &mdash; the protection afforded by the golden share will remain fully in place irrespective of whatever decision is taken in relation to the State's residual shareholding in Geencore.</P>
    <P>The rights of the special shareholder are set out in the articles of association of the company.  The Greencore offer for sale document made specific reference to these rights and drew particular attention to the following:</P>
    <P>Without the consent in writing of the holder of the special share (i.e. the Minister for Agriculture) there can be neither a change in the rights attached to the special share nor a change in the limitations on shareholdings.</P>
    <P>In particular, the prior consent in writing of the special shareholder (the Minister for Agriculture) is required for <i>(inter alia)</i> any resolution to authorise the sale, transfer, or disposal of the majority of the issued share capital of Irish Sugar, any sugar quota held by Irish Sugar, or more than 20 per cent of Irish Sugar's fixed assets used in the production of processing of sugar</P>
    <P>Let me deal now with the 15 per cent limitation on shareholdings in Greencore. This limitation is not provided for in the Sugar Act, 1991, but is, rather, enshrined in the company's articles of <Col N="577" /> association.  Article 11 (b) provides that &ldquo;no person shall be entitled to acquire or to be Holder of Shares representing more than 15 per cent of all shares then in issue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the prospectus, any change in this limitation on shareholding first requires the prior written consent of the special shareholder.  An extraordinary general meeting of the company, requiring 21 days' advance notice, would then have to be convened.  Any resolution proposing amendment or abolition of this limitation would have to be adopted if required</P>
    <P>Last week, at my post-budget press conference, I elaborated on the reference in my Budget Statement that receipts of £150 million in respect of asset disposals were included in the budgetary arithmetic. I said that it was the Government's intention to proceed with disposal of certain State assets, including its residual shareholding in Greencore.  In preparing for an eventual disposal, my Department had sought advice from Davy Stock-brokers, the Department's advisers on the State shareholding in Greencore, on how best to approach the issue.  On the basis of the market information then available, it seemed that share placement was the appropriate way to proceed. There were absolutely no contacts between the Department and its advisers and multinational companies on a possible share purchase and no such contacts were mooted.  I was, however, aware of Greencore's stated strategy of growth through acquisitions and was naturally anxious to ensure that the State, when eventually disposing of its shareholding, would do so in a manner which would be supportive of the company's declared strategy.</P>
    <P>Greencore had, I understand, contacts over recent months with a series of potential trade purchasers of the State's shareholding. Neither I nor my Department were privy to these contacts or even aware of them.  On 16 February 1993 the company advised my Department that it had identified a US-based major food company which was interested in acquiring virtually all of the remaining shares. <Col N="578" /> It described this company as the ideal partner for the growth strategy planned by Greencore.  I met with a representative of the company on 18 February but made it clear that I was not in a position to address sale of the State's shareholding until after the budget.</P>
    <P>The proposal was that I should sell 25 million shares to the company identified by Greencore and to sell the remaining shares at a later stage.  Before the Government had an opportunity to consider the proposal, several Irish food companies expressed interest in acquiring the Government stake.  As a result the takeover panel will need to monitor transactions in the shares of Greencore.</P>
    <P>An Irish company with an international market in its shares has to be seen to adhere to the highest standards. The takeover code is a voluntary set of rules which all companies of good standing in Ireland and the UK adhere to.</P>
    <P>An important principle of the panel is that any party acquiring a 30 per cent stake or more is bound to extend an offer to all shareholders on the same terms.  In the event that someone makes such a purchase, or enters into discussions regarding such a purchase, an offer period is created.  The implications of an offer period mean that the panel will monitor all transactions carried out by certain parties during the period.  This would comprise all holders of more than 1 per cent of the share capital of Greencore and all connected parties, including all advisers to any party considering a purchase in excess of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The other implication of an offer period relates to any information made available by the company to any party intending to acquire more than 30 per cent.  The panel rules would insist that any such information would be made available to all other parties who have shown a similar interest.  These provisions should not create problems for the process in hand.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a press release issued yesterday, the Government has decided to afford time to all interested parties to put foward proposals, which should reach <Col N="579" /> my Department by Wednesday, 24 March.</P>
    <P>The criteria on which decisions will be based will include price and compatibility and the long term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company which could consolidate and expand employment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>My concern now is to achieve the receipts from asset disposals which have been provided for in the Estimates for public spending in the current year and to obtain a fair price for the State.  My equal concern is to enhance the capacity of the company to grow and develop, which can only be in the interest of its employees, farmer suppliers, shareholders and the economy.</P>
    <P>While the Sugar Act, 1991, empowers the Minister for Finance, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to dispose of shares held by him in Greencore, I will keep the House informed of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I hope what we have just heard from the Minister is the definitive Government view and that it will not be contradicted by other members of the partnership on the 6 p.m. or 9 p.m.  News this evening or on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>The Government again seems to be involved in internal division and recrimination. It is truly astounding that a Government, which took so long to draw up a programme and which came into office with fanfares of unity on all sides, should already be subject to criticism from members of its respective parties.</P>
      <P>The Mullaghmore affair, the Digital closure, the budget, and practically every other significant announcement, have been greeted by internal opposition. While, previously controversies involved backbenchers such as Deputies Kemmy, McDaid and Davern, the proposed Greencore sale has lifted dissention to a new plane and involved the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that over the next three weeks the parties in Government will take into <Col N="580" /> account the overall good of Greencore, of its employees and its shareholders and of the farmers who supply it with beet and cereals, and that they do not get involved in an arid ideological argument which will benefit nobody.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House heard the Minister for Finance announce on budget day that the Government would sell State assets to the value of £150 million.  Every Member of this House knew he had Greencore and Irish Life in mind and perhaps some other assets.  I cannot understand how anybody could be suprised this week, one week later, when the Minister proceeds to give effect to his announcement.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael agrees in principle to the sale of the Government shareholding in Greencore.  A passive shareholder such as the Government, who would not back a future capitalisation of the company, is of no use to Greencore in the fulfilment of its growth and expansion plans, regardless of whether those plans are drawn up by acquisition or some other means, and which would lead to the securing of the present jobs in Greencore and to the expansion of jobs as it extends its activities in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>The Government has been a passive shareholder, but the proposed American purchaser, on the other hand, would not only bring extra expertise to the company but would also be active and supportive in organising capital to enable the company to expand.  If a suitable Irish bidder could be found to do the same it would be an even more satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Serious issues do arise, however. When Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann was floated a commitment was given in this House and in the prospectus of sale of the shares that no individual or institution could hold more than 15 per cent of the total shareholdings.  This commitment was subsequently enshrined in the articles of the company, and the assurance of the Dáil was repeated when the Department of Finance sold 15 per cent of its shares to the Investment Bank of Ireland last year.  The solemn commitment given to this House has now <Col N="581" /> been broken.  The commitment to other shareholders has also been broken and a dominant shareholder holding in excess of 29 per cent of the total share capital is now being introduced.</P>
    <P>The fact that the principal bidder is foreign is also a consideration.  I believe that there are no ulterior motives in this bid and I have been assured that the American company involved has no predatory intent.  Circumstances however can change and the principals to this deal may not be the decision-makers some years hence.  New men and women would not be committed to informal commitments entered into now.  This House requires a categoric assurance from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and from the Minister for Finance that the golden share which he controls not only protects the sugar quota and maintains it in Ireland for the foreseeable future, but that also in the final analysis the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry can countermand any decision taken by the company in the future which is not in the national interest.  The Minister has given some assurances today, but he has not given the one I am looking for.</P>
    <P>It is not in the national interest if a major Irish food processing company passes into foreign ownership.  Irish Distillers is now owned by the French drinks company Pernod Ricard, Carrolls is owned by Rothmans, and Jacobs is owned by the French food company BSN.  I do not want Greencore to go down the same road.</P>
    <P>I hope this matter can be brought to a successful conclusion.  If the assurances I request are given we need have no fear for the future of the company.  I do not know the position of the Irish companies reputed to be interested in Greencore but the issue of whether an investor is committed to be an active participant in the future expansion plans of the company, and is in for the long haul, is far more important than the nationality of the bidder.  Greencore needs an active shareholder to replace the Government. I hope matters can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible <Col N="582" /> in the interests of the company, the shareholders, the workers and the farmers and that this issue does not get bogged down in a sterile, arid, unproductive ideological debate between the Government parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed sale of the State's remaining 30 per cent stake in Greencore is a logical outcome, and in my view should be proceeded with provided some key national strategic criteria are fully met.</P>
      <P>These obviously include the issue of the price to be secured for the Irish taxpayer; the protection of the strategic interests of Irish farmers and the workers in Greencore, and the vital role of this company in the Irish food industry sector. I welcome the belated decision of the Government to allow Irish companies, and indeed any other possible interested parties, to bid for this stake, and the criteria governing the proposed sale.</P>
      <P>I also welcome their statement that a key determinant in deciding who to sell to would be the long term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company, which could consolidate and expand employment in the Irish economy.  But this is not to say that the proposed sale should exclude possible non-Irish buyers.  To adopt such a xenophobic attitude, notwithstanding the raw memory of some multi-nationals here would make no sense in a European free market; it takes no account of the role that some overseas investors could play in the international expansion of Greencore; and it fails to take account of the reality that Greencore is a quoted public company.</P>
      <P>It is vital from the point of view of the general taxpayer that the best price possible is secured.  On this score I do not believe that the apparent price offer from the American bidder, ADM, is satisfactory. This will require careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the position of Greencore compared with other major Irish food companies or to quoted food companies elsewhere in the Community. Taking its trading price today, which I <Col N="583" /> understand is 267.5p per share, this represents a P/E ratio of 8.6 when related to the earnings per share of 31p at year ended September 1992.</P>
    <P>Now when we look at the P/E ratio of a number of other companies for last year we find that in many cases they are significantly in excess of the Greencore ratio, some examples which I think are comparable and Fyffes at 14.4; the Kerry Group at 12.9; and Avonmore at 9.2; a directly comparable company abroad is Tate &amp; Lyle in Britain whose P/E ratio stands at 14.  When I referred to Greencore's P/E ratio today being 8.6, that is after a very substantial increase in the price because the prices before the shares had to be suspended was 237p and the then P/E ratio was 7.</P>
    <P>I believe concerns which have been expressed about the Irish sugar quota, which is of such enormous importance to the Irish farming and food industry sectors are reasonable and must certainly be addressed in the context of the proposed sale.  I believe, as the Minister has said, that these fears are fully met by the so-called &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; provision in the Sugar Act, 1991, which ensures that the sugar quota cannot pass out of Irish State control notwithstanding the composition of the ownership of Greencore.</P>
    <P>Moreover, under present EC regulations, the national sugar quota cannot be transferred outside the State.  It is also important to bear in mind that any proposed sale of the Government's 30 per cent stake will, I presume, be subjected to the provisions of the mergers, takeovers and monopolies legislation and also the Competition Act, 1991, which I brought forward when Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>These provisions are of considerable significance in the event of any possible monopolistic developments that could arise in the forthcoming sale.  There is already a monopoly in sugar held by Greencore, but there could in certain circumstances, for example, on its purchase, be the possibility of a monopoly in flour milling, which clearly would be very undesirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> What is important in relation to the present proposal is that there be the greatest level of transparency and accountability by both the Government and Greencore on the matter.  There is a whole variety of legitimate interests and concerns, especially those of the 2,000 workers in Greencore, and the 5,000 Irish farmers who grow beet for the Irish sugar industry.</P>
    <P>At a political level, it is difficult to understand some of the political comment emanating from the Labour Party ranks.  Quite simply, they cannot have it both ways.  However extraordinary it now appears, they signed on in last week's budget for a Government privatisation programme of £150 million this year. That is amazing, given that party's strident policy of opposition to privatisation in any shape or form down the years.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I recall a chorus of statements from Labour parliamentary ranks in the wake of the recent general election that one of the main reasons why their party could not possibly do business with the Progressive Democrats, for instance, was because we support privatisation in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>How times and things and people change.  That is not the only aspect of this policy u-turn by the Labour Party we might ponder.  In recent years, when the Government of which my party was a part, did sell assets, the proceeds went entirely, as far as I know, to retire debt, and not on current spending.  Indeed, considerable opposition was expressed at the time to even the possibility that the sale of any State assets prior to this year might be applied otherwise than in reduction of the national debt.  However, the proceeds of the Greencore sale, if it is completed, and a further privatisation programme of about £90 million will have to be undertaken simply to bridge this year's borrowing gap for the Government on a current year basis.  Apparently there is no application of these moneys to a reduction of the national debt, which is a great pity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when delivering his budget speech, in referring to a privatisation programme of £150 <Col N="585" /> million was wrong not to specify then what companies or bodies would be involved.  In replying he should take the opportunity to clarify the position in regard to the State's residual shareholding in Irish Life which is quite substantial and, as far as I recall, is a larger percentage than is held in Greencore.  If there is doubt now or in the future about how the State is going to deal with its shareholding in companies that have been partly privatised it will create serious problems for the future for other companies that might be floated on the Stock Exchange.  The credibility of the State's dealing with its minority shareholding has not been high.  Unfortunately, there has been much confusion and doubt and this is creating difficulties for the future.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the account given by the Minister in his speech about how this shareholding came to be offered to this American company.  The shareholding is the State's; it is registered in the names of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Finance or in the name of one or other of them &mdash; it does not matter which.  It is the State's property and nobody else's, but it appears from what the Minister said that without his knowledge, or the knowledge of his Department, the Greencore company made contact over recent months with a series of potential trade purchasers of the State's shareholding.  It was not Greencore's business to do that.  If the State wants to sell its shareholding &mdash; I quite agree with the principle of doing that &mdash; it is a matter for the State to do so and not for the management of the company concerned without the knowledge of the Minister or the Department involved. That is unsatisfactory and if it happened in this case it should not be allowed happen in any other case.  That point should be made particularly to Irish Life.</P>

      <P>In one of his early movies called &ldquo;Love and Death,&rdquo; Woody Allen faced execution at 7 p.m. with great fortitude and humour.  &ldquo;I was supposed to be executed at 6 p.m.&rdquo;, he confided, &ldquo;but I had a good lawyer&rdquo;.  It seems the <Col N="586" /> Labour Party will be able to say at the end of the term of office of this Government, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would have sold off Greencore in April 1993 but thanks to us they did not sell it off until May 1993&rdquo;.  The public are somehow supposed to be grateful that we will now have a public auction before we sell off the State's remaining stake.  A Government floundering in the wake of the Digital debacle where a powerful multinational thumbed its nose at Ireland and Irish workers in favour of its own corporate strategic interests now proposes to sell off to a multinational the remaining State's shareholding in a major indigenous company. All the workers in Digital got was high flown Government rhetoric about implementing the Culliton report and growing our own indigenous sector. What the workers in Digital were told is in direct contradiction of what the Government now proposes to do.</P>
      <P>Greencore is a home grown indigenous company in the key food sector and, instead of using its stake to influence its future growth and expansion, it is being handed over to a multinational with no loyalty to Ireland, Irish workers or Irish growers.  Indeed, the multinational selected may have a conflict of interest in that some of its business is in non-sugar sweeteners.  The profit performance of Greencore leaves no room for complacency. We can be assured that if it were to serve the corporate interest of a multinational, one of the remaining plants could well be shut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said he hoped the Minister's contribution was the definitive word on this development.  I wonder if the House has been told all the facts and the truth about the extraordinary background to today's development. Why are the main movers in Greencore so aggrieved about yesterday's Government decision?  Why did the Labour Party not know about the proposal to dispose of the remaining shares?  Is it not the case that top Greencore personnel had the deal with Archer Daniels all stitched up even before this Government was formed?  Is it not the case that the same Greencore personnel had the approval of <Col N="587" /> the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern? Can we assume that Deputy Ahern had at least the implicit sanction of the then Cabinet?  Why was The Labour Party not informed?  Why was this House, after all the cant about open Government, not informed?  Why does the Minister continue with the pretence that the recent budget was not constructed on the assumption of the disposal of the shares in both Greencore and Irish Life?  Were the Labour Ministers awake when the Cabinet approved that budget or has the Labour Party dropped its opposition to selling off the family silver in favour of giving some of the silver to the family?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister does not expect this House to ignore the commitments given by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, former Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, during the privatisation debate on 6 March 1991 when he assured the House:</P>
    <P>Collusion will not be tolerated under the Articles of Association and no one element or group will be able to combine together to acquire more than 15 per cent.  I think all the guarantees are there.</P>
    <P>Former Deputy O'Kennedy was the man responsible at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister went into some detail explaining that we will have to convene a special general meeting of the company, that a special resolution will have to be put and so on.  All of that can be done, and we know enough about the chairman of Greencore to expect he will do so if it suits his convictions at the time.  I find it difficult to accept the assurance about the sugar quota in the context of the commitment we were given in this House by the Minister responsible at the time of the privatisation debate.  For example the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said in the House on 6 March, 1991, column 40 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the company will raise additional capital through rights issues and the Minister will have the option of increasing his <Col N="588" /> holding to maintain that 45 per cent. That is a very important element of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In other words, the former Minister told the House that it was a very important element of the legislation that the Minister could increase his shareholding of 45 per cent.  I am not trying to tell the House that I ever took a great deal of notice of what Deputy O'Kennedy said in this House, so I do not particularly want to make remarks about him when he is not in it; but he was the Minister for Agriculture. That is what we were told at the time, and this is what we are doing now. At column 61 on the same day the then Minister said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte has again said we are selling off the Irish Sugar Company, but I want to totally and utterly reject that.  It is false.  It is not going to serve any purpose for Deputy Rabbitte to keep repeating that phrase.</P>
    <P>Here we are now and Deputy O'Kennedy is gone and so, it would appear, is the State's interest in a major indigenous company.  Yesterday evening and again this morning we had to endure the spectre of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, pirouetting about the Labour Party's position on privatisation.  &ldquo;This is not privatisation&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;We are and we remain, utterly opposed to privatisation. This is just getting rid of a remaining minority interest.&rdquo;  When the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, was here he told us that this was not privatisation, that we were selling off a minority stake and that the legislation provided for us to increase our holding at any time that suited us. The question arises &mdash; when is privatisation not privatisation?</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied at all with the opening statement of the Minister for Finance.  It is not the definitive statement that Deputy Noonan sought.  I had marked the paragraph to which Deputy O'Malley referred.  It is not good enough to describe it as extraordinary that a Minister would come in here and tell us that he now understands something that he <Col N="589" /> apparently did not understand or know about on budget day.  The Minister certainly did not tell us about it.  The Minister now understands that over recent months a series of potential trade purchasers of the State's shareholding had been contacted by Greencore.  The Minister says that neither he nor his Department were privy to these contacts or even aware of them.  Is the Minister seriously telling us that after what we saw in the relatively recent history of the Irish Sugar Company and Greencore and their performance in the recent past that nobody in the Department was even aware of the fact that they were hawking the remaining State's shareholding around the world looking for potential purchasers, after all the brouhaha in this House about not having a civil servant nominee director on the board to report back to the Minister about the debacle that occurred in Greencore only a number of months ago? A few months later the Minister is telling us in this House that neither he nor anyone in his Department were aware that they were hawking these shares around the world looking for a potential buyer for our shareholding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Michael Nolan. Coming from East Cork, which is the main beet growing region of Cork, and having Mallow Beet Factory in my constituency <Col N="590" /> I know that any likely change in that industry raises great concern among the farmers, among the employees of the company and among many hauliers in the region.  Over the years amalgamations, reorganisations and rearrangements have become synonymous with job losses and naturally fear of the same is to the forefront in the minds in those employed in Mallow and no doubt in Carlow.  There are also fears with regard to the beet quota.  I am glad that the Minister has made it clear that the beet quota is not a Greencore but a national one, that it is in the hands of the Government and that the Government has no intention of introducing amending legislation to enable it to dispose of this special golden share.  The farmers will be glad to hear that the quota is held in the hands of the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance.</P>
      <P>While I would prefer to see an Irish company or an Irish consortium as the purchaser, as the level of commitment to Ireland by an indigenous group would be greater in times of difficulty than that of a foreign industry, in the final analysis what we want from the purchaser of Greencore is a commitment to the growth and development of Greencore for the beneficial interest of farmers, employees, shareholders and the economy generally. The decision that will be taken by the Minister in three to four weeks' time should take these points as the basis of making that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed sale of the remaining 30 per cent shareholding of the Government in Greencore disappoints me to an extent.  Greencore are for the first time facing the prospect of being taken completely out of the control of some Government Department.  While there are solid and sustainable reasons why it would be good for the Government to sell its 30 per cent shareholding at this time, I am concerned by the timescale set for the making of offers for such a sale. It goes without saying that in the present world economic climate it is a buyers market.  I regret the urgency in disposing of this State asset.  It makes commercial sense for Greencore to claim that it needs <Col N="591" /> an entry into the world food market by joining forces with an established player in that sector.  I caution the Government in deciding on that partnership.  Like my colleague, Deputy Ahern, I would prefer to see an Irish company &mdash; for instance, one of the co-ops &mdash; being involved in the proposed purchase of the 30 per cent shareholding.  In the light of recent events one would be far happier with an Irish company purchasing the remaining Government shareholding.</P>
      <P>The timescale startles me.  If by 28 March, which the Minister has set down as the time for the Department and the Minister to receive offers for the 30 per cent shareholding, the offers are not to the Government's liking, the time could be extended.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has confirmed that the sugar quota will remain under the control of the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Foresty.  This is a national asset and should not be disposed of too lightly.  I would warn the Minister to move cautiously in this regard.  To move too quickly could be to the detriment of the workforce in Greencore and the beet producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the future of Ireland's 5,000 beet growers. Our sugar industry is worth some £123 million annually and produces 1.4 million tonnes of beet.  My main feeling of outrage about this matter is in relation to the Minister's speech.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to undertakings given by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Kennedy.  One matter which was watertight then was the 15 per cent single maximum shareholding by any individual or corporation.  It is now clear from the Minister's speech that he intends to waive this limit and an EGM will be called.  This undermines everything written into the prospectus, it undermines the basis on which people invested in the company, namely, that there would be no single, monopolistic interest within it.  Once you get to 30 per cent it is not too far from 51 per cent.  We are now seeing a ripping <Col N="592" /> up of the Greencore rule book.  The manner in which the rules are being broken is outrageous and unprincipled. We are told that there was a 15 per cent single shareholding maximum rule but it is going to be discarded.</P>
      <P>This House should be wary about ministerial assertions and re-assurances concerning the Sugar Act because every day a litany of people are prepared to take their chances in the High Court in relation to legislation, as in the case of Mullaghmore, the X case and so on.  I am aware of a legal opinion which states that once the Government has sold all its tradable shares, this golden share will not be worth the paper it is written on because it will have no effective operation. I would like to know what was the Attorney General's advice on this matter.  It is one thing to have a golden share when one is a 45 per cent shareholder or largest single shareholder but when there is not one share left what is the meaning of this golden share.  Surely somebody who holds a 30 per cent shareholding in a company would have a greater entitlement to make decisions in relation to the company's future development than someone who holds no shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Act, as it is now shaping up, is open to legal challenge and reversal. Therefore, the assertions given in relation to the sugar quota must come under the microscope.  Those of us who take a deep interest in agricultural matters know that there is a lobby within the Council's 12 agricultural Ministers which favours the trading of quotas between member states.  Such trading does not relate only to the sugar quota, it relates to milk quotas, suckler cow premium quotas and ewe premium quotas.  It is conceivable that in the years ahead there will be agreement that quotas will be transferable across member state boundaries. In such circumstances the area of national quotas takes on a new dimension. If its principal owner produces non-beet sugar products he or she may be greatly tempted to import sugar, which would be disastrous for this country.  Such a move would jeopardise not only the jobs in Mallow and Cork but also the <Col N="593" /> livelihoods of the 5,000 sugar beet growers. I have heard repeatedly that the Minister owns the sugar quota, that is true, but only in a technical sense.  The Minister has assigned the quota to Greencore who operate and farm the quota and decide the allocation of the beet acreage. Greencore have control over and make all decisions in relation to the quota.  The only thing is that it is not on the company's balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The only credible, watertight legal assurance that can be given by the Minister is to jointly vest the quota, not in the Minister, as at present, but between the growers and Greencore.  In other words, people who traditionally had acreages of beet quotas should have them in perpetuity in conjunction with Greencore. That, in my view, would be the only acceptable protection.  There is no guarantee that once the ADM or any other group acquire a shareholding in the company they will not say a 30 per cent shareholding is of no use to us as did the Government who decided to dispose of it, those companies are in for the long haul and will make an offer to other shareholders who are cash-starved.  As we have seen in other cases such as Jacobs, Carrolls and Irish Distillers we will see that they want total control. There are companies such as Fyffes, Dairygold and others interested parties in this matter.</P>
    <P>This House should be very cautious about ministerial assurances because if this saga has taught us anything it is that previous assurances by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food are worthless today.  There is no guarantee that in a few months, never mind a few years, the same assurances being given today will not be equally meaningless.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware of the press statement issued by the Minister for Finance yesterday and his earlier speech in relation to the Government's residual shareholding in Greencore plc.  The Minister indicated that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the disposal of its residual <Col N="594" /> shareholding of 30.4 per cent in Greencore plc.  A major international food group that is, ADM, a US based company, and a number of Irish food companies have expressed interest in acquiring those residual shares and the Government has decided to give all interested parties until Wednesday, 24 March to put forward proposals to the Department of Finance for the purchase of those shares.</P>
      <P>When the Irish Sugar Company was restructured and floated on the Stock Exchange in April 1991 certain safeguards were put in place to ensure that the Irish sugar industry was protected &mdash; that is, the Irish sugar industry, the Irish quota and the jobs in the industry.</P>
      <P>Under the Sugar Act, 1991, the Minister for Agriculture and Food acquired a special share in Greencore, the holding company of Siúicre Éireann cpt.  The rights attached to this special share, which the Minister may not dispose of, are set down in the articles of association of Greencore plc.  That Act cannot be changed unless it is amended in this House.  This special share ensures that none of the following events can arise without the Minister's prior consent in writing: (a) any change in certain specified articles in the articles of association of Greencore; (b) the winding up of Greencore; (c) the sale of more than 49 per cent of Siúicre Éireann cpt. which is a subsidiary of Greencore; (d) the disposal of specified sugar assets including the Irish sugar quota which is held by Siúicre Éireann; (e) the creation of a new class of shares in Greencore and (f) the building up by one shareholder or a consortium of shareholders, other than the Minister for Finance, of more than a 15 per cent shareholding in Greencore after flotation.</P>
      <P>In summary, the special share prevents the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann or the sugar assets including the Irish sugar quota, and prevents a single shareholder or a group of shareholders acting together from gaining control of Greencore plc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me deal with any concerns which arise in connection with the Irish <Col N="595" /> sugar quota.  Ireland is allocated a sugar quota of 200,200 tonnes under EC legislation. Member states are required to allocate a sugar quota to each sugar producing undertaking in their territory.  As Ireland has only one such undertaking, that is, Siúicre Éireann cpt, the entire quota of 200,000 tonnes is allocated to that company.</P>
    <P>Current EC legislation does not provide for the transfer of any quota, or part thereof, from one member state to another.  The question of relocating Ireland's sugar quota in another member state does not therefore arise.  There are two safeguards (1) the 1991 Sugar Act and (2) European Community legislation which prevents the Irish sugar quota from leaving the country or being taken over in any way by outside interests.  I should mention also that at the time of the restructuring of Siúicre Éireann cpt in 1991, special arrangements were made to protect the workers engaged in the sugar industry.  A provision was made in the Sugar Act, 1991, to ensure that every person who was an employee of Siúicre Éireann prior to flotation, enjoyed the same rights and was subject to the same obligations after flotation of the company. In that regard also Siúicre Éireann and the unions drew up an agreement and lodged it with the Labour Relations Commission and registered it with the Labour Court.  This agreement related to employees' conditions, pay, continuity of employment, recognition of trade unions and continuation of existing procedures. This agreement gave reassurance to workers whose interests were already protected under the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employee's Rights on Transfer of Undertaking) Regulations 1980.  I want to stress that I fully endorse the contents of this agreement which I have no doubt constitutes a major protection for the rights of the employees of Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>The sugar industry is of immense importance to the Irish economy.  Some 1,300,000 tonnes of beet are grown each year by about 5,000 beet farmers.  The value of the beet is worth nearly £60 <Col N="596" /> million per annum.  I want to assure this House that the disposal of any remaining Government shares in Greencore will not affect the operation of the Irish sugar industry, which, as I have already outlined, is adequately safeguarded.</P>

Any proposals for the sale of the Government's residual shareholding in Greencore will be viewed in this context.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The sugar industry is extremely important to this country and is extremely important to my own town of Carlow.  Since it was set up in 1926 it has expanded from a production of 89,000 tonnes in 1945 to over 200,000 tonnes in 1990.  It follows that we should ensure that whatever changes come about will not affect either the production of sugar beet, the position of the workers or the rights of farmers to continue supplying beet to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed the Sugar Bill of 1990 we expressed our fears for the future viability of the company.  We were assured that section 2 (2) of the Bill referred to the special share held by the Minister&mdash;the golden share is an important aspect of the Sugar Company Bill.  It is vital to this country that the Government in its efforts to bring in some of the £150 million needed from the sale of State assets does not attempt to change that <Col N="597" /> protection for the control of the company. The Minister has assured us on this and at the same time the 15 per cent limit on shareholding which was part of the commitment will now be changed at an extraordinary general meeting.  The question is how much reliance can we put on assurances given here if there is a financial crisis for the Government?</P>
    <P>Since the closing of Digital and the loss of jobs in Lapple in Carlow we have heard much about indigenous industry. Nothing could be more indigenous than the sugar company and the production of sugar from beet grown by the farmers of Ireland.  After all, we are an agricultural country, not fully utilising our potential in many aspects, but the beet industry is a real example of successful production. For that reason I am not in favour of any foreign company getting a 30 per cent share in Greencore.  Foreign companies are perfectly entitled to make profit; otherwise they would have no interest in being involved in another country.  We have no control over boardrooms of foreign companies or of future changes that may take place but we must learn from the past.  We have tried to close too many stable doors after horses have bolted.  We have very successful businesses and co-ops in the country which have genuine concern for our welfare.  I suggest to the Government, who will have to get £150 million, to tread warily in the way they sell our State silver.</P>
    <P>If this American company can find it more profitable to produce sugar from means other than beet then they would be mad not to do so.  For that reason we would be mad to give them the opportunity to change the position of a very successful company in Ireland that gives good employment and provides good income for the farmers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes at my disposal I should like to say briefly that as far as I am concerned I believe the Government had decided before the budget to sell off this shareholding and that what we are now fighting out here in the Dáil is a charade.  On the basis that it has become public I have no doubt <Col N="598" /> whatever so far as the Government are concerned they decided in the budget that they would sell.</P>
      <P>There are a few very important aspects of this matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the House.  There must be an inbuilt protection for beet growers and the Greencore staff and for the general sugar industry in Ireland.  I am glad the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is present.  I would ask that consideration be given to the exact position of the sugar quota.  We all know it is owned by the Government and by the Department and it is not the property of Greencore.  If Greencore was taken over by a multinational on the world stage in the food sector area who manufactured, traded or were involved in products other than sugar, would it not be true to say that the users of the national beet quota would be like a man holding a horse's tail rather than the horse's head?  They would have no control over it one way or the other and it would be useless.</P>

There is nothing the Irish Government can do after the shares are gone.</P>
      <P>We have to be particularly sceptical about any takeover so far as the Tuam area is concerned.  We lost the sugar company some time ago.  We now have the engineering section of Greencore, which is very important to Tuam, and we also have the animal feedstuff division.  I sincerely hope, irrespective of what the Government does, we will not have more people on the dole because of closures in that vital sector.</P>

We have to look at the progress <Col N="599" /> of the Irish food industry and many joint ventures.  Irish Distillers and Pernod, Kerry Co-op, which is very big in the United States, Murphy's Brewery in Cork, Beamish's Brewery, Avonmore Co-op and Waterford have all diversified with foreign investment.  We have approximately 5,000 farmers who are growing approximately 1.38 million tonnes of sugar beet.  I wish to express one reservation in this area: I do not want to see the maximum tonnage or acreage of beet to any one farmer increased in excess of the present tonnage.  I understand that some of our beet farmers have quotas of the order of 5,000 tonnes or 6,000 tonnes.  That is unrealistic in an age when we have to live with quotas and protect the family farm.  I hope we will not see any further change because it is easier for a company to handle one individual grower than to handle 5,000 growers.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have security on the home market for our sugar beet industry.  For some time we have seen &ldquo;Silver Spoon&rdquo; sugar on the shelves of our supermarkets.  That is a foreign sugar which is competing with our sugar beet industry.  We will have security for Irish sugar beet growers if we have an involvement with ADM, a very large company. I believe they have the finance and the wherewithal to expand the sugar beet industry.  We have been informed of their involvement in the malt industry which would give another outlet for our grain growers who experience great difficulty because of oversupply in the feed barley area.  We have a very fine grain in Ireland which is ideal for malting, for distilling and brewing.  So in that context there would be an additional advantage if a company such as ADM coming to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my concern for the jobs at Mallow and Carlow and indeed other areas but investment by a company with the type of expertise as the one in question would minimise any difficulties for Greencore in the years ahead and instead of having a contracting industry <Col N="600" /> we would have an expanding one and greater diversification.</P>
    <P>This investment will lead to competition, which will be in the interests of Irish farmers and Irish businesses generally.  There is no competition in the importation of beet.  This has led to many problems for farmers and compounders generally.  The amalgamation a few years ago of IAWS and Halls did not help in ensuring competitive prices for feed stuffs.  The involvement of Arkady Feed Limited, which is better known in the feed industry, with Greencore, which is developing a feeding compounding business, will lead to greater competition in this area.  This will enable us to expand our livestock production, an indigenous resource.  The spin-offs from this expansion will lead to the creation of more jobs.</P>
    <P>ADM already has an investment in Cork, in Southern Mills and Paul &amp; Vincent Limited in Kilmallock.  The company employs approximately 700 people in the Cork region, and I understand it is an excellent employer.  I cannot say whether ADM will be the owners of the 30 per cent share in Greencore, but if it will be I will wish it well.  An article on ADM stated that in view of the fact that the Culliton report had recommended that American food companies should be allowed to buy stakes in Irish food companies, thereby providing access to US and European markets, ADM was thoroughly researched and the researchers liked what they saw.  ADM has invested more than £1 million in the Irish economy and employs more than 700 people.  It is one of the biggest food companies in the world, employing 13,000 people, has annual sales of £9 billion and a net value of £4 billion. Clearly this is the type of company that Government wants to maintain an active interest in the Irish economy.  This company has a substantial amount to offer this country and its further involvement with Greencore is the way forward.  I know many people would disagree with me.  Earlier I referred to a number of companies which have been involved in <Col N="601" /> highly successful partnerships and joint ventures.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, and important, that there should be a substantial injection of capital in Greencore so that it can diversify.  I hope the moneys which will accrue to the Exchequer from this will be invested in some of our ailing semi-State industries to ensure continuity of jobs and further investment in companies such as Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the remarks of my constituency colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and I am still slightly confused as to whether he is in favour of or against this proposal.  One has to commend the Fianna Fáil Members for being present for the debate; their colleagues in the Labour Party seem to have disappeared.  That is surprising because, if my memory serves me correctly, when we debated the Sugar Bill, 1991 the Labour Party put forward quite a strong ideological line and gave us a very severe lecture on the evils of privatisation.  It would appear that a few spins in the Government mercs have eliminated any of the difficulties that party had with privatisation.</P>
      <P>What we are speaking about here this evening is the completion of the privatisation of the Sugar Company.  When the Sugar Bill, 1991 was debated in the House I had no difficulty with it on any ideological grounds.  I do not think that the State had either the political will or, more importantly, the resources at that time to invest in the Sugar Company, and such investment was urgently needed.  It is fair to say that since the partial privatisation of Greencore that company has prospered.  I am reminded of an old saying, &ldquo;if it ain't broke, don't mend it&rdquo;. I am slightly worried that changes are occurring at this time as I believe Greencore has performed well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sale would appear to be based on a lack of Government finances rather than on any strategic planning in the food industry.  This is not a great basis on which to sell the Government's share in Greencore.  The decision is based on financial <Col N="602" /> reasons rather than on the introduction of a food strategy.</P>
    <P>One of the remaining two Greencore factories is located in Mallow in my constituency. There is some concern in that town about what the new proposals will mean for the plant there.  The two-factory strategy has worked well for Greencore and I hope this strategy will remain in place under any new arrangements.  Hundreds of my constituents, workers and farmers, and thousands of people throughout the country depend on the Mallow plant for their livelihood.  I am sure those people are wondering what will happen to this plant and what the Government's strategy is.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Yates, asked some pertinent questions which, unfortunately, were not answered by either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Those questions related to the status of the golden share and the ownership of our sugar quota.  Deputy Yates asked &mdash; he did not receive an answer &mdash; about the legal status of our special share: what will be the legal worth of the special share when the time comes that the Government has not even £1 invested in Greencore? It is difficult to argue, without any holding in the company, that the special share will still hold good.  This matter needs to be clarified urgently.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ownership of the sugar quota, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry pointed out that under current EC legislation there is no provision for trading, either internationally or within the EC, quotas, be they sugar quotas, milk quotas and so on. The important term he used was, &ldquo;under current legislation&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Commission has discussed, and, presumably, continues to discuss, the putting in place of provisions for the trading of quotas.  We have cause to be concerned about our sugar quota if changes occur.  Will it be possible to trade that quota?  That question should be answered before this debate is concluded. Farmers, the workers in Greencore and many other people, depend on <Col N="603" /> the retention of this quota for their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that I am the thirteenth Member, including two Ministers, to contribute to this debate and there has not been one speaker from the Labour Party.  Indeed, there is not one Labour Party Deputy present in the Chamber for this debate. Yet we have to endure the spectacle of them on the plinth outside this House in front of television cameras enunciating to the world all the difficulties they have with the potential sale of the Government's share in Greencore.  However, they have not even shown the courtesy to their partners in Government, with whom they are supposed to be sharing collective responsibility, of being present in the Chamber for this important debate.  I suppose we can take it that from here on out it is the Fianna Fáil Party which will enunciate and deliver on any policy the Government introduces, not that there will be much of that.  I very much regret the absence of the Labour Party Deputies on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party would want to cop itself on for the simple reason that it is no longer a party in Opposition which can fire out balls as it suits it for other people to grab.  It has to remember that it is in Government and that it has a responsibility.  If the Labour Party continues to undermine important decisions which can be reflected in the marketplace, how are we supposed to deal with the serious privatisation programme referred to by the Minister?  Obviously, this will have a destabilising effect on Government policy and on the ability of the Government to achieve the best possible price for its assets.  If a party in Government is going to continue to snipe from the wings at both ministerial and backbench level then the future of all State companies which require further development through private involvement will be seriously and continually undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister for Finance made some extraordinary admissions, to <Col N="604" /> which other Deputies have referred.  He said he was unaware that the management of Greencore was in effect touting the shares of the State around the world seeking a potential purchaser. These shares do not belong to Greencore but to the Government and they are vested in the Minister for Finance.  He claims it was not until 16 February that he was advised of this in his Department. The budget was announced on 24 February. Am I to take it that within a week of discovering that there was an interested party in regard to the Government stake in Greencore, the budget strategy was then developed and that this was a major part of the £150 million which was to be raised by the disposal of State assets?  Alternatively, am I to understand that it was planned, before the Minister's knowledge of the Greencore matter, to dispose of another £150 million of State assets?  Strategy seems to be made up as the Minister goes along and if there is a shortfall something must be done quickly to cover it up.  That is not responsible behaviour on the part of a person who manages the State's involvement in State companies.  It is extraordinary and unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>I refer to the position of the 5,000 beet growers.  If a major multinational becomes involved in Greencore, potentially some if not all of the raw material for processing by Greencore could be imported and the position of the beet growers could be seriously undermined. The growers have had difficulties with Greencore in the past regarding the price offered for beet and they will be deeply concerned about the future.  There are no guarantees of security for the beet growers.  We must remember that 5,000 families are involved.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to what the State is doing but the timing is bad. The prices being obtained by companies in the market are bad.  Obviously this move has been handled very badly.  The greatest benefit for the taxpayer, who owns these shares, could be obtained when there is a turnaround in the market. There are serious questions as to the best partner for Greencore.  I do not believe <Col N="605" /> we have the full information.  One multinational company based in America has been contacted, but that is not a broad enough approach.  Indigenous companies are also interested and we must look at what they could offer.  I regret that my time is so short because I have much more to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that a combination of indigenous food processing companies, probably some of the very strong organisations in the dairy sector, could see their way to putting forward an attractive proposal for a stake in this strategic processing company.  Vested in the company is the quota from the European Community.  This is not vested in the 5,000 growers, as in the dairy sector. Whatever transaction is thought by the Minister to be most beneficial, I hope the discretion as to who grows beet will be vested in the company and that there will be contractual arrangements with 5,000 farmers.  I am concerned that if a multinational organisation buys these shares there may be a proposal to merge some divisions of Greencore.  Rationalisation on a global basis could mean strategic closures in Ireland.  That would not be desirable.  We have been hoping to see our indigenous food processing organisations become big enough to be international. That might be the eventual outcome.  The Minister has had one approach from a US multinational but he is taking time to ensure that any other interested company will have an opportunity. As far as the political establishment is concerned, the growers and staff must be our priority.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties beet growers had in the past with the then Irish Sugar Company.  There was a series of contentious issues in regard to tare, weights and renewing of contracts.  We have to be aware of the conditions which have prevailed in the supply of sugar to the Irish market.  International companies have not managed to gain a foothold here and this has been to the advantage of beet growers and the staff working in the company.  There could be rationalisation within the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Should the company decide they want only 4,000 growers in a given financial year and that they will import supplies from France or elsewhere, there would be a serious effect on the beet growers and on the staff in the Irish divisions.  If companies in the food sector do not grow in the home market they will not become big enough to compete internationally under brand names.  I hope that some of the former co-operatives, now public companies, will emerge as food conglomerates capable of trading internationally and commanding supermarket shelf space throughout continental Europe thus maximising the benefits to growers and staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision to offer for auction its shareholding in Greencore is a matter of great public concern.  There have been obvious signs over the past two days that this decision was not taken with the approval of a full Cabinet but by a small group within the Cabinet.  This is probably understandable in view of the fact that the sale of assets announced in the budget had the full support of all Labour and Fianna Fáil Deputies in the course of the budget debate.  It was included in the Minister's speech at the point where he referred to raising £150 million from the sale of State assets in Irish Life and Greencore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal implications of this move, as detailed by Deputy Yates, were obviously not thought through and could have very serious ramifications for the future of Greencore <i>vis-á-vis</i> the food industry generally and beet growers in particular.  The second reason for concern is the deliberate clouding of the issue and the moves made to initiate the deals by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister says on the one hand that his Department was approached by Archer Daniels with a view to possible purchase of the Government's shareholding by that company. A spokesman for Archer Daniels on the other hand says that the first moves were made by and on behalf of the Government.  We are entitled to know the correct version of events.  In either <Col N="607" /> case it does appear that an attempt was made to railroad the deal through in favour of Archer Daniels without the full knowledge or consent of all the interested parties.</P>
    <P>However, my main concern in this issue is to put forward the case for the people who are most immediately affected by the decision which will be taken.  These are the workers and the farmers.  Let there be no mistake about the bottom line in this situation.  It is the protection of the jobs of Irish workers and Irish beet growers.  My constituency of Tipperary has had a long tradition of association with the Irish sugar industry since its foundation.  Generations of Thurles and Tipperary people gave their working lives to the development of the beet factory to the point where it was the mainspring of industrial and agricultural life in the county.  This was strengthened by the development of its sister company, Erin Foods, in Thurles.  Now, as everyone knows, the sugar factory is no longer there &mdash; a fact attributable to inept Government handling as much as to any market forces.  A whole series of poor decisions at Cabinet and board level eventually led to the closing of the factory, the loss of hundreds of jobs and a threat to the livelihood and the incomes of hundreds of Tipperary farmers.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow this to happen again. We must control the destiny of this company and we must protect the jobs of the workers at Erin Foods.  Guarantees must be given in unequivocal black and white that the future of this valuable food company will be protected in any share transfer that may take place.  The workers there have shown tremendous loyalty to the company through the lean years. They cannot now be left wondering about their future because of the whim of a Government anxious for short term shoring up of the Exchequer.  The long term view has to be taken and all the implications of the decision must be considered before any share transfer takes place.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said that all of the bids will be &ldquo;assessed on the <Col N="608" /> basis of their compatibility with the long term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company which could consolidate and expand employment in the Irish economy&rdquo;.  Those are noble sentiments indeed from the Minister. He probably will not need any reminding from me, but I will remind him in any case, that his party in Government was involved in the loss of over 2,000 jobs in the sugar company in the late seventies and eighties and in the winding down of a vibrant food processing industry, of which Erin Foods in Thurles is the sole survivor.  His noble sentiments will have a very hollow ring indeed in the ears of anyone with any connection or interest in the sugar company in Tipperary.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we are given an assurance that the long term viability of Erin Foods and the future of the sugar beet industry are not sacrificed on the altar of short term gain by a Government bereft of any real strategic plan for the development of our food industry.</P>

      <P>It is hard to see how Fine Gael can have it every way in regard to Greencore.  They voted for privatisation. it is as simple, as raw and as clear as that; and when one votes for privatisation one simply takes away the State's control. There is little point in crying crocodile tears now.  They have made their position clear.  They have walked through the lobbies and voted for privatisation and there is no getting away from that.  I gather that Deputy Cullen was concerned that the Labour Party had not made their views known on this matter.  I do not think he should be too concerned.

      <P>The events of the past few days in relation to Greencore can only be viewed with alarm.  It is unacceptable that the Minister for Finance appears not to have been adequately informed of the attempts to sell this company behind closed doors, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance owns in excess of 30 per cent of the company and is the major shareholder in the company.  It is unacceptable that the information on what is happening is made known by way of a strategic leak the source of which we do not know.  It seems that the strategy behind that is not designed to advance the interests of the workers, the producers of sugar beet or the Irish food industry generally.  This way of doing business is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The plans to sell the company outside the country are especially alarming.  It must be particularly worrying for those people who work in Greencore.  It is also worrying for the beet producers.  What is happening needs to be seen in the context of the strategic objectives for the Irish food industry and indeed for Irish industry generally.  We are weary of telling one another the importance of building up an indigenous industrial base in this country. What could be more indigenous than the Irish food industry?  Greencore is a central part of the Irish food industry and it is imperative that the Irish food industry should now try to consolidate.  It is imperative that the Irish food industry should now build up two or three major Irish food companies which will have the capacity to do adequate levels of research and development, adequately market and develop branded Irish food products. The unfortunate reality is that we do not have an Irish food product as far as the European markets are concerned.  Let anyone who has any doubts about that walk into the supermarkets of Europe, into the hotels and restaurants of Europe and look for any of the food products that we take for granted here.  We need to be able to develop that type of product and put it on European markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> If that is to happen it is essential that the food industry consolidate and I would imagine that Greencore has a key role to play in that consolidation.  One way or the other, given the acceptance which has been granted to the Culliton report, it is very foolish, indeed it is almost perverse, that this proposal should now be put in front of us while we are waiting for the report of the committee of experts on the food industry which is to be produced as an adjunct to the Culliton report and which was to be produced within six months of the publication of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>How could anybody who wants to be reasonable and try to progress and advance the Irish food industry go ahead and make the types of decisions which are now being considered without seeing what that report has to say?  I have noticed that some people have seen fit to quote the Culliton report in support of what is happening.  That is quite incorrect. Certainly the relevant part of the Culliton report in relation to the involvement of multinational companies in joint ventures with the Irish food industry talks in terms of those companies being prepared to establish significant headquarter functions in Ireland and there has been no mention of that in the context of this present proposal.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear that no final decisions have been taken in relation to proposals to sell the shares at this stage. We in the Labour Party opposed the privatisation of the sugar company.  The votes are a matter of record in this House. We opposed it in the Seanad as well and got very little support in so doing.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is very concerned at the implications of what is proposed for the development of the food industry.  No hasty decisions should be made on this matter.  We should think long and hard about the strategic implications of what is now being proposed and how those factors may influence the long term development of a viable food industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, the views, the principles and the policies of the Labour Party cannot be taken for granted on this issue, which is a major one.  Discussions and consultations <Col N="611" /> with the workers and the various other interests must be taken into account before this is resolved.</P>

The very last decision that any private householder would make would be to sell the family silver to buy food for the table.  One would expect it to be Doomsday when one had to sell the family silver to pay a bank debt.

      <P>There is no doubt that there are people in high positions in Greencore who are seeking to frighten off local industry and possible local equity partners in the shareholding.  I have no doubt that the chairman of Greencore has something to do with this matter.  He occupies a very privileged position as chairman of another State company, Aer Lingus, and he has to make a contribution to the enhancement of his own position.  He wants to ensure that he retains his chairmanship in the future.  As chairman of Greencore what better could he do than offer to the Government the opportunity for extra resources at a time when resources are very scarce?  Is this a matter of a £65 million State sell-off in order to protect his own position?  Not only that, the proposal was to make the sell-off secretly to a multinational company without telling any of the local food interests &mdash; not to mention the backbench committee of one of the Government partners &mdash; that anything was happening.  It is rubbish to suggest that any multinational company that would seek to purchase equity in one of our State companies would not go further than 30 per cent or to suggest that a multinational company with only a 30 per cent control of a company would seek to put capital into that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day it seems that Greencore is facing a position very similar to that in which other companies mentioned <Col N="613" /> by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, earlier in the debate found themselves, and in this regard I think of Carrolls, Jacobs and Irish Distillers.  Greencore could fast become a subsidiary of a multinational company with its headquarters in Chicago.  We all know what happened recently to the Digital operation in the west which had its headquarters located outside this jurisdiction.  Irish food companies should have an opportunity to further develop Greencore into one of this country's thriving food industries so that it might be able to take on some of the major food players in the European food market.  I would like Greencore and whatever equity partners it might have within this jurisdiction to make a contribution to the economy.  That would be preferable to having the decisions made for us elsewhere.  I am surprised that the Labour Party is not in a position to make sure that that will happen.  The decisions of any foreign investor in Greencore, whether or not that investor has a 30 per cent holding, will amount to nothing more than a con job.  I certainly could not support foreign investment in Greencore on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that there are not too many Members in the Chamber, at the moment at any rate, who have been beet growers or who have represented beet growers.  I have the happy distinction of having done both and I therefore have a particular interest in this matter.  I am concerned with the proposed sale of Greencore.  In the first instance the Irish Sugar Company and Greencore have played an enormous role in rural Ireland particularly in my own constituency.  At present there are 5,000 growers in the country who produce about 220,000 tonnes of sugar which yields about £1 billion per year into the pockets of many people.  In fact, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, a former Taoiseach, said that 25,000 people were involved in the sugar industry.  I should like to confine my remarks basically to growers because I think all else has been spoken about in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 1,200 growers produce approximately <Col N="614" /> one-third of the beet crop in Wexford. If Greencore were sold to the American company Archer Daniels I should be very much afraid that some of the quota painstakingly built up by this country over the years might also be sold off and that some of Ireland's sugar quota might be produced elsewhere.  If that were to happen Wexford would be most vulnerable, and that is what I am concerned about.  I am partly reassured by the Minister in his earlier statement that the golden share would be protected, but I am very anxious this evening to be assured that any sugar included in the quota would be produced only in this country even if Greencore was partially sold off.  I seek that assurance to protect the many people who are employed in the industry, whether they be growers, hauliers, workers in fertiliser and chemical factories, or agricultural contractors. No matter in what capacity people are associated with the industry, the sale of Greencore would put them under threat unless there is an assurance this evening that the sugar will be produced in this country from now on irrespective of who buys part of the company.</P>

      <P>I first wish to dispel any fears there might be on the Opposition benches in relation to the stance of the Labour Party on privatisation.  In the Labour Party manifesto for the recent general election it was stated very clearly that as a general principle the Labour Party is opposed to privatisation of public utilities and State companies in the trading sector.  It was also stated that the policy of the Labour Party was to enable State companies to grow and not sell them off to native or foreign individuals, institutional investors or speculators. That remains the policy of the Labour Party and it will continue to be the party's policy whether in Government or out of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago almost to the day the House decided to privatise Greencore, or the Irish Sugar Company as it was then known.  That was done by a combination of the Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrat and Fine Gael parties and was opposed <Col N="615" /> only by the former Workers' Party, the Labour Party and one or two Independent Members.  On that occasion I was spokesman on Agriculture and Food for the Labour Party and I warned very clearly what could happen if the Irish Government did not keep overall control of the Sugar Company.  When speaking to an amendment I had tabled at the time I said:</P>
    <P>Leaving all questions of ideology aside, the Sugar Company, one of the Irish food companies which at present cannot be bought out by a multinational will be put in jeopardy if this section is passed.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that even though the co-operatives might feel safe nothing could stop their members from voting for a takeover by an international food combine in the future.  I am sorry that that day has come rather more quickly than I thought it would.  My warning fell on deaf ears among our fellow Opposition Deputies of the time, who were in a great rush to sell off the Sugar Company.  On that occasion the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, now Senator O'Kennedy, gave the House certain assurances.  When speaking on the Second Stage debate of the legislation he said that the special share was designed principally to ensure that none of a number of events could arise without the prior consent in writing of the holder of the special shareholding.  One of those concerns was that the disposal of the specified sugar assets, including the Irish sugar quota held by the Sugar Company, could not be sold.  He also claimed on that occasion that the building up by one shareholder &mdash; or a consortium of shareholders other than the Minister for Finance &mdash; of more than a 15 per cent shareholding in the company meant that the flotation could not take place.  We know from what the Minister told us that this was not in the Bill but in the articles of association of the then Greenvale company which was later changed to Greencore.</P>
    <P>Voices of concern have been raised on <Col N="616" /> all sides of the House in relation to what is happening to this company.  I am sorry that, two years ago, such concern was expressed only on these benches.  It is true that the European Court of Justice in the case of companies &mdash; British Telecom in particular, Jaguar and the Freight Trading Company of Great Britain &mdash; which had golden shares, sanctioned their sale.  That is the history of the golden share.  It is open to any company &mdash; and indeed encouraged under the Single Market &mdash; to be involved in takeovers in the Community and if there is a conflict the issue is taken to the European Court of Justice.  I am afraid that if this American company got control of even some of the shares in this company it would be entitled to use that facility in Europe to claim the whole shares of the company if it got the support of other investors.  Undoubtedly, a very attractive share prices would be offered to other shareholders who might be induced to sell their shares through this multinational.</P>
    <P>Our concerns are real, I know that the Minister has listened to them and taken them into account.  I know that the Labour Party in Government are voicing those concerns and when the Minister replies we will see that he has taken them on board.  It is just as well that the Labour Party were in Government when this proposal was made because it is obvious that any other party in Opposition would not have the same concerns.  They voted for the privatisation of this company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, it is not a time for play-acting or tomfoolery, it is a most serious business.  I will be replying in a straightforward manner and I will not go over the top by using extravagant language because this matter is too serious for that.</P>
      <P>We can learn from the recent past in relation to Greencore because powerful, influential people have enriched themselves at the expense of the public purse by using privileged information during the privatisation of the company.</P>

      <P>People made plenty of money at the expense of the public and I did not hear too much from the other side of the House when it was going on. The food industry is too important to be left to the whim of any individual, group or company and that is why the Labour Party have taken this issue very seriously. We favour the orderly, planned development of the food industry but that did not happen in the past.  The industry is too important to be dealt with in a haphazard piecemeal way, which is what happened. The industry badly needs to be restructured and put on a new footing. It is highly competitive and it needs a practical, intelligent response to the problems affecting it.  The food industry, and the protection of jobs, are paramount on our agenda.  Companies need to be competitive and efficient, not only in the home market, but in Europe and the American market; that is the challenge facing us.  At present only the dairy co-operatives, which are small, represent any potential or capability for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives I have outlined for the food industry, development and planning, are the only feasible measures as far as we are concerned.  They are not easy to achieve in practice but they can be outlined in theory.  We should learn from the mistakes of the beef industry.  I do not have time to go into that matter today and, in any case, it is far too painful and convoluted to go into too deeply. The Government must not make hasty <Col N="618" /> decisions in regard to Greencore, it must carry out a very careful and determined policy and examine the question of costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his pre-budget press conference and said that the sale of Greencore had been mentioned.  That was the first the Labour Party knew about it.  There was also a leak &mdash; perhaps an inspired one &mdash; to the press last weekend. I do not blame the media, I live in the real world and am well able to take care of myself without help from anyone.  I speak on behalf of the Labour Party in regard to this issue; our position is simple and clearcut as far as Greencore is concerned. We want to do what is right for the people.  Ideology must serve people, not the other way round, that is the principal, basic plank of our policy and we do not have any hang-ups about the matter, good, bad or indifferent.  Our approach is practical but we must size up all the options, we must be consulted and convinced and our party will not rush into hasty decisions or be pushed into a quick decision on this matter.  The common good of the people is our own criterion in this matter and, in the final analysis, that will be the deciding principle of our party in this regard.  The public interest is paramount and that will influence our decision in this matter.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be allowed a few minutes over my allocated time to try to answer the many questions.  I thank Deputies from all parties who spoke on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Act, 1991, provides for the holding of the special golden share in Greencore by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I want to emphasise that because Deputy Noonan asked a question in regard to it.  The main purpose of the share was to protect the sugar quota when the State's holding fell below 50 per cent.  On Second Stage of the debate on the Sugar Bill, 1991, the Minister for Agriculture and Food stated that the special share was designed to ensure that a number of events could not take place without the prior consent <Col N="619" /> writing of the special shareholder, including the winding up of the company, the disposal of specified sugar assets, including the Irish Sugar quota and the building up by one shareholder &mdash; or a consortium of shareholders &mdash; other than the Minister for Finance and that a sale of the remaining State holding in the ordinary shares of Greencore could not make the slightest difference to the special share or the rights attached to it.  That is an important point which I think most Members now understand.  In difficult trading circumstances on the Stock Market a trade partner is always useful and such partners must be acceptable to the board and the management of the company whose shares are to be sold.  In the present instance it was at least useful to know that the likely proposal was acceptable to Greencore.</P>
    <P>At the time of the flotation it was made clear to all investors that the Minister for Finance was most unlikely to exercise his rights in taking up options in any future rights issue which the company might bring forward so that in the expansion and development of the company the State would not take up the options.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked me to clarify my statement.  I said that neither the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry nor the Department of Finance are privy to the workings of the board of Greencore.  I should also point out that, under the rules of the Stock Exchange, I would, as a shareholder, be excluded from any information which would not be given to all the shareholders, which is normal.</P>
    <P>What happened in this case is that last Thursday week Greencore approached a party that it knew would be interested in buying the shares; there was no question of values or money.  The only people ADM would talk to in that regard were the advisers to the Department of Finance, Davy Stockbrokers.  Greencore was not running around the world trying to sell its shares.  It may have been talking to various companies which had an interest in the company.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputy O'Malley in that any trade purchase would be subject to approval under the mergers and monopolies legislation and the competition Act and that this provides a protection against the development of a monopoly.  Not alone does the national legislation protect the quota, but the EC quota regime ensures that national quotas cannot be transferred across national boundaries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked what would happen to quotas.  Under EC legislation, the allocation of individual sugar quotas is left to member states.  Our national quota of 200,000 tonnes of white sugar is administered by the Irish intervention agency, which is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  As Ireland has only one sugar producing undertaking, Siúicre Éireann, the entire quota is allocated to that company.  Current EC legislation does not provide for the transfer of any quota or part thereof from one member state to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It may do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of re-allocating Ireland's sugar quota to another member state does not therefore arise. Under section 2 of the Sugar Act, 1991, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry holds the special share in Greencore. Greencore is the holding company <Col N="621" /> of Siúicre Éireann and the special share, which may not be disposed of ensures that Siúicre Éireann may not dispose of sugar assets, including the Irish sugar quota, without the prior written consent of the Minister and I have pointed out already the Dáil's role in that regard. Greencore has gone through a long period of rationalisation and as far as I am aware no further reduction in numbers is envisaged.  I am sure that if it received finance for further development it would help increase profitability.</P>
      <P>The Government made it clear yesterday that it will examine carefully the position between now and 24 March. Greencore could have sold the entire shares on the market before the Government had even considered the matter.  As some of my Labour colleagues stated, an outside investor put forward a proposition and subsequently a number of people from within the country had a serious interest in buying the shares; others were willing to consider it and said they would need about two weeks to decide on the matter.  I will prepare the proposals for 24 March and the Government will then consider them.</P>
      <P>I would not like people to imply from this debate that ADM is a foreign company with no interest in this country.  To my knowledge ADM is a fine company. It is a major processor of agricultural commodities throughout the world, employing 13,000 people, with sales of more than £9 billion and is the largest producer of oil seed by products in the United States.  It is also the largest manufacturer of corn produce in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the largest producer of wheat and flour in the United States and is also involved to a large extent in bakery products, mixes and formula feeds for livestock and poultry.  We spent some time last week talking about the importance of employment.  ADM has a significant commitment to the Irish economy. It has $100 million invested in the <Col N="622" /> Irish economy and through its subsidiaries, Arcady Feeds, Southern Milling, Paul and Vincent and ADM, Ringaskiddy, employs more than 700 people in this country.  I had only one brief meeting with the company but I know it did nothing wrong in regard to this matter.  It is one of the biggest employers in the country.  It was approached by Greencore and asked to meet the Minister for Finance.  It was told who the stockbrokers were and it forwarded its statement of interest.  In my view it is a fine company, fine employers in the Irish economy, and whether we do business with it in regard to Greencore ultimately will be a matter for the Government.  There should be no implication, even in a hidden way, by Members of this House or elsewhere that ADM is anything but a fine company.</P>

      <P>I referred earlier to the new 1 per cent temporary levy and the manner in which the existing employment and training levy was introduced. Essentially, the new 1 per cent is yet another burden of taxation on workers' income in excess of the average industrial wage.  While I appreciate that the Minister has a delicate balancing job to do in relation to the budget and that people were prepared to tighten their belts, I earnestly ask the Minister to give an indication of how temporary this levy will be and for how long we will be faced with it. I say this in light of my earlier reference to the youth employment levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mortgage interest relief measures are welcome, particularly at this time of <Col N="623" /> high interest rates.  I welcome the announcement today by the Central Bank of a reduction by 1 per cent in their STF rates.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the Minister confirmed in his budget speech that the Government will be prepared to support a viable and convincing recovery plan for Aer Lingus.  This begs the question as to who brought Aer Lingus to its present position and who bears the responsibility. I tabled a question today in relation to an interest rate of 53 per cent charged on borrowings of £47 million by TEAM Aer Lingus.  The Minister stated that this is not true.  However, I have the TEAM Aer Lingus question and answer document, to which the senior management have been a party, and it states clearly that TEAM Aer Lingus has been charged up to 53 per cent interest on those borrowings. It is my understanding that senior management are responsible for a number of difficulties in Aer Lingus.  If that is so, much work needs to be done in relation to a recovery plan.  I received a recovery plan and proposals for a new aviation policy from the central representative council.  What plan does the Minister propose for a viable and convincing recovery plan?</P>
    <P>The alteration of VAT rates and a reduction to 12.5 per cent on labour intensive industry is welcome.  I congratulate the various interest groups who lobbied hard in this regard, such as the motor industry, the flour, confectionery and bakery industries and, indeed, hairdressers. My wife is a hairdresser and she is delighted with the 12.5 per cent rate.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Durkan asked me that.  It is not all good news. The increase in VAT on adults' clothes <Col N="624" /> and shoes will have a detrimental effect if implemented.  By increasing VAT and lowering the discretionary purchasing power by way of the 1 per cent levy, employers have been squeezed on both sides.  I regret to say that this may have a negative effect and I now quote from the Taoiseach's speech this morning:</P>
      <P>The time is therefore approaching for a major reappraisal to ensure that there is a level playing field for all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>I ask in particular that this should be the case for the rag trade.  We may encourage a huge black market economy if we do not reduce to a realistic 12.5 per cent the VAT rate for that industry.</P>
      <P>Social welfare increases are ahead of inflation and the special increases in child benefit are welcome but the potential for carers under the existing parameters of the carer's allowance will not be reached. Before I conclude I wish to thank the Minister for Social Welfare for giving a grant of £40,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association in Clontarf who do trojan work for the disabled and should be given every encouragement.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to make a simple comparison between the amount of money paid to social welfare recipients and that paid to counsel in the Beef Tribunal.  A person in receipt of the carer's allowance or of unemployment benefit receives £53 per week whereas a senior counsel earns £8,400 for a briefing plus £1,890 a day, approximately £11,500 per week.  The carer is giving constant care and attention and probably preventing the person being cared for from having to be admitted to a State institution, thereby saving the State £300 or £400 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put on record my total disapproval of the cost of the Beef Tribunal, although I do not have sufficient time to go into that in great detail.  I tabled many questions, some of which were disallowed, but I have elicited the following information.  It has been sitting 174 days to date and has cost the State approximately £5.1 million.  It is very important that we draw a comparison between the <Col N="625" /> amount paid to a carer, £53 per week and the amount of money paid to senior counsel of £1,890 a day or £11,500 per week.  That is just short of a national scandal, something should be done about it and I take this opportunity of highlighting it.  I have tried to raise this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was particularly intructive to hear the new policy of this Government now, instead of being opposed to selling the family silver, the Labour Party want to keep the silver in the family.  The country is shocked by this.  It is outraged but I look forward to the opinion poll on that very topic to be published this weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, Labour participation in Government means ever increasing taxation and true to form we <Col N="626" /> got the first instalment last Wednesday. The first and most outrageous tax is the new &ldquo;death tax&rdquo; because not only is it the policy of the partnership Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour to tax you when you are sick, in the form of taxing disability benefit, but if you are unfortunate enough to die there is a 2 per cent probate tax to be paid.  There really is no escape from it.  One may be predeceased by one's spouse so the only offence committed in order to incur this extra tax is to have transferred whatever assets one might have to a son or daughter.  There is no lower threshold and nothing is exempted, for example, there is no such concession as exemption on up to £20,000 in respect of a cottage.  That £20,000 will incur a probate charge of £400.  There are many people who have worked hard all their lives and bought their houses.  If a house is now worth £150,000, £3,000 will have to be paid under this new &ldquo;death tax&rdquo; before the property is transferred. There is no exception.  Labour have not given a sympathetic ear or shown caring attention to those with large families or those who might have been in debt.  This is a brutal tax, a savage tax that has no regard for personal circumstances and afflicts people who may have to defer taking out a grant of administration on their parents' wills because they cannot afford to pay the probate tax on top of the high legal fees.  I want to make it clear that on the Finance Bill Fine Gael will oppose this evil tax.  We believe it is totally inequitable.  Indeed, the Labour Party promised during the election campaign to exempt family farms from inheritance tax but now they have introduced a new tax which will apply to even the smallest farm and which will raise £12 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent income levy is also an extraordinary tax.  Of course it has been pitched at a level starting at the first pound of income for those on £173 per week, that is two-thirds of the average industrial wage, thereby hitting the ordinary worker.  In other words, for the pleasure of having a job you will pay five taxes; PAYE, PRSI, the health contribution, the youth levy and, as if that <Col N="627" /> were not enough, a 1 per cent income levy.  It is quite disgraceful that there should be such cavalier disregard for the PAYE sector, and all in the interest of retaining programme managers, special advisers, ordinary advisers, and I am told &mdash; whether it is true or otherwise &mdash; that the Tánaiste's bill for representation at the Beef Tribunal, which is under the supervision of his brother Donal, will come to £1 million.  I am appalled.  This comes on top of the £830,000 which was spent on the Office of the Tánaiste, not to provide any extra public service but to maintain and massage his ego.  This is quite extraordinary.  It is a display which is akin to Ferdinand Marcos and disgusts the ordinary Irish people.  After 5 April they will realise, from their pay packets, that they are picking up the bill for this extravagance.  I fear greatly that not only will we have one instalment this year, but two because the budget is full of phoney figures.  If we look at the Estimate for my own area of responsibility, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, we see that only £1 million is provided for the Beef Tribunal. I was interested to hear Deputy Callely say how much this tribunal will cost.  May I bring to the attention of Deputy Callely that the amount provided in the Book of Estimates under the Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the cost of the Beef Tribunal is £1 million.  Does anyone believe that the Tribunal will come in at less than £7 million?</P>

      <Col N="628" /> There was a fanfare of publicity for the early retirement scheme under which up to 60,000 farmers would benefit, but only a measly £1 million has been provided to fund the scheme.  Already I believe there will be additional expenditure of £20 million or £30 million in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry alone.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Labour Party will take a Scrooge-like stance in regard to social welfare but if they do, it will be anathema to this present demeanour and the extravagances I have referred to.  I assume they will pay a Christmas bonus; it would be appalling if they failed to do so.  In any event not a penny has been provided to give the most needy in our society even a little lift.  In the event of an election though, payments can be brought forward, and at the rate we are going, the Government will probably collapse before Christmas.</P>

I find it faintly amusing, if not hypocritical, to see how comfortable he is on the Government benches side by side with his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  Long may it last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not only are there gross underestimates of expenditure in agriculture and social welfare but not one penny is being provided in the public capital programme for Aer Lingus.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of a credible national aviation plan.  My party said eight months ago that Aer Lingus was facing a crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told I was wrong when I said Aer Lingus' future was not assured. People laughed at me, but now the chickens are coming home to roost.  I still stand over the fact that Aer Lingus needs an outside equity partner because the Government will not be able to give it all the capital it needs.  By the autumn of this year there will be Supplementary Estimates for every Department in the order of at least £200 million because the figures do not add up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only are there phoney figures on the expenditure side but that is also the case on the revenue side.  A figure of £150 million is given for asset sales, but the Government cannot sell Greencore twice.  Once it has done the dirty deed it cannot do it again next year.  RTE may have a once-off accumulation of profits because it did not implement the cap but RTE cannot be raided for £30 million every year.  It is clear that these are <Col N="630" /> phoney figures.  The long suffering public are appalled at the Marcos style extravagance of this Government who are lecturing us all on ethics, and it will have another instalment for us later this year.</P>
    <P>The most serious problem facing this country, stifling enterprise and inhibiting job creation is the fact that real interest rates stand at 15 per cent.  With the projected figure for inflation at 3 per cent this year retail rates are 18.5 per cent. Anyone with £100,000 to invest in a business would be daft to create jobs.  They would run the risk when trying to make money, with all the perils of employing people, of paying PAYE, PRSI and so on.  If companies do particularly well &mdash; bearing in mind that only two out of ten small businesses succeed &mdash; they pay 40 per cent corporation tax.  A person who puts £100,000 into a special savings account is guaranteed a 10 per cent rate of tax, and the Government wonder why people do not invest in business.</P>
    <P>Interest rates here are artificially high not because of German rates but because of the weakness of sterling and the fear that we may devalue.  Therefore, the current exchange rate policy of this Government is the core reason for high interest rates and no amount of alleged fiscal discipline, which does not exist anyway, will convince the markets to reduce interest rates.  In those circumstances Government job creation targets are wrong and we are facing the horrific prospect of 400,000 people unemployed.  Until such time as interest rates are about 6 or 7 per cent, as is the case for our competitors across the water, the future will be bleak.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to agriculture. The trendy elements of this Government do not go beyond the Naas dual carriageway and there is no real concern for family farms because there is a perception that farmers do not vote for the Labour Party.  This budget will extract £20 million from the farming community. There is the unfair reduction in VAT refund from 2.7 to 2.5 per cent.  That will take £8 million from farmers.  On the input side VAT is to be increased on all agricultural services, including contracting work &mdash; the 10 and 16 per cent <Col N="631" /> rates have been increased to 12.5 and 21 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>In one of my first years in the Dáil Deputy John Bruton introduced VAT on clothing and footwear and he has been ever since demonised for so doing.  There is now 21 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear and, as it is believed that adults will abuse the system, tax has been introduced on smaller sized clothing, thereby ensuring that adults do not avoid paying tax by wearing children's clothes.  As a result teenagers' clothes are now subject to VAT.  The hypocrisy and lack of concern being shown for what were such emotional issues some years ago is quite galling.</P>
    <P>To return to the plight of farmers, Barry Desmond who was director of elections for the Labour Party made written commitments in relation to inheritance tax, as did Deputy Joe Walsh and Deputy Michael Woods who was director of elections for Fianna Fáil.  The threshold has not been increased in real terms since 1976 when the tax was introduced and small family farms now have to pay this tax.  To raise the threshold would have cost £3 million and the modest measure introduced by the Government will cost only £300,000.  This, in effect, means there is very little change in this area, and probate tax, which will raise £12 million, will more than wipe out any marginal gains.</P>
    <P>With a great fanfare the Minister said he was giving an extra £1 million to Teagasc. People believed that was a good measure but what they did not realise was that the previous week £2.5 million was cut from Teagasc's allocation in the Book of Estimates.  That body requires £38 million to run its services this year but they were allocated only £35.4 million. Therefore, let us not have the charade of great budgetary announcements and indications of largesse when Teagasc will not be able to maintain its services on the equivalent of last year's allocation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the omission from the budget of a measure which was automatically included each year, that is the provision of stock relief <Col N="632" /> on income tax for farmers.  Every year it was automatically confirmed at 110 per cent to deal with the appreciating value of stock.  This year we were told the Minister could not make an announcement, but some nebulous announcement will be made later.  That is ominous.  The fact that the matter is being handled in this way makes it clear that the measure will be watered down.  This measure, together with the new income levy will result in a decline in the incomes of the farming community.  That is not of great political importance to this Government.  Some 150,000 people, and their families, depend on the agricultural sector and they deserve better consideration than they have received.</P>
    <P>This is the most unadventurous budget I have witnessed in my 12 years in this House.  With a new programme for Government, and so many programme managers and advisers to implement it, for the Government to have laboured so much and produced so little is most disappointing.  The budget was one of the biggest political anti-climaxes we have seen for many a year in the Dáil.  It seems that the public who voted for change have got two things: a change in the Labour Party who have disowned all they previously stood for and loose change in their pockets.  There is no strategic thinking in this budget and no clear coherent economic policy.  There is no boldness and no radical tax reform.  In fact, tax reform was not mentioned in the Minister's speech.  There are no measures to improve the competitiveness of the economy. The competitiveness of the tourist industry was eroded by the increase in VAT in the middle of the tourist season. Every other year any changes in VAT were deferred to the autumn.  There has been an increase of one-quarter from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent in the VAT rate in the middle of the tourist season.  We have seen the Government's currency policy collapse.  Their budget will not hold together for this year.  We have not seen a coherent strategy to deal with unemployment.  It is clear that the primary objective of this Government and its Ministers is to keep themselves in jobs, <Col N="633" /> in the comfort to which they have so quickly become accustomed.  The public have got very bad value and can only reflect its disappointment in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government affirms the view of this Government that education is the key to equality and to the future prosperity of all our citizens.  The programme indicates the strong commitment of the Government to fundamental reform of our education system through a process of open and democratic consultation.</P>
      <P>I do not underestimate the scale of the task that I am now taking on as Minister for Education.  Education systems are notoriously large, amorphous and complex, and it is widely accepted that they are also conservative and harbour inertia. The commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that for reform to be relevant all those involved in the system need to have a meaningful say in the direction and detail of reform measures.</P>
      <P>In spite of the very difficult constraints within which the 1993 budget was agreed, I am glad to say that the Government has demonstrated a major commitment to education &mdash; and particularly to beginning the task of eliminating disadvantage in education &mdash; in the 1993 budget.</P>
      <P>This is shown by the fact that gross spending on education has been increased by 8.7 per cent &mdash; that is between two and three times the rate of inflation.  The total gross provision for the four Education Votes is nearly £1,800 million, which includes almost £200 million as Appropriations-in-aid.  The comparable gross outturn figure in 1992 was almost £1,650 million.  The amount being provided in 1993 represents an increase of 8.7 per cent over the 1992 outturn.  This financial provision is a very substantial outlay in education.  It is the highest ever provided by the State and at 6.7 per cent of GNP is one of the highest in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since by its very nature the education process is labour intensive 83 per cent of the gross non-capital provision is <Col N="634" /> required to meet salary and pension costs.  Current non-pay expenditure has not been neglected either, with an increase of nearly £30 million or 11 per cent &mdash; a significant improvement on last year's increase of 7.2 per cent.  The overall provision also includes some £84 million for capital expenditure, an increase of almost £6 million or over 7 per cent on the 1992 outturn.</P>
    <P>Although the figures are important to an understanding of the budget, they only tell part of the story.  My main agenda is the targeting of disadvantaged pupils and schools within the education system. Indeed, a recent discussion paper by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors on Education and Poverty states that educational qualifications have begun to replace factors, such as inherited property, as the main mechanisms by which poverty is perpetuated from one generation to the next.</P>
    <P>I am also reminded of the recent remarks made by the head of one of our universities who drew attention to the extremely low and falling representation of those from the lower socio-economic groups in his student population.  He expressed the fear that we are in danger of developing a &ldquo;caste system&rdquo; in the Irish education system.  These facts underline the absolute necessity to adopt a systematic approach in tackling the problem of disadvantage.  I propose to tackle the problem <i>via</i> a two-pronged approach.</P>
    <P>Having identified those pupils in the system who are disadvantaged or who are under-achieving, I intend to target additional resources to overcome the difficulties being experienced by them.  This will ensure that those children will be helped, within the mainstream education system, to achieve their full educational and social potential.  I will advance measures to help those who have already left the school system without reaching their full potential and who must be given a second chance.</P>
    <P>The provision for disadvantage was increased under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by £1 million in 1991 and £0.25 million in 1992.  The 1993 allocation includes an extra <Col N="635" /> £800,000 to assist in various areas of disadvantage at all levels of the education system.  These funds are in addition to those being provided in other ways including the £2 million provided in the 1993 Estimates for the primary disadvantaged fund and the special funding arrangements for supplying extra teachers in schools in disadvantaged areas at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>The capitation grant per pupil in primary schools was last increased to £28 in 1990.  The level of the grant has been a cause of dissatisfaction and concern to all the interests in the field of primary education including management, teachers and parents.  I have provided for an increase of £3.4 million, or 21 per cent in the 1993 provision for this purpose. This will enable me to increase the capitation grant to £33 per pupil in all schools and to initiate further measures to assist those who are most disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Demographic trends will give me further opportunities to address the issue of disadvantage at primary level.  Falling enrolments in national schools will result on the basis of the existing pupil/teacher ratio of 25 to 1, in a surplus of some 200 teaching posts in 1993.  The Programme for a Partnership Government indicates as a policy priority that the pupil/teacher ratio at primary level will be reduced to 22 to 1 by September 1996.</P>
    <P>I propose, as a first step in implementing the commitment in the programme for Government, to retain these posts within the system.  It is my intention, in line with my commitment, to target the disadvantaged, to seek to distribute these posts over such areas as remedial education, disadvantaged areas, home/ school liaison, travellers and special education. The net effect of this will be to reduce the overall pupil/teacher ratio below 24.5 to 1 in September 1993.</P>
    <P>I have also provided in the 1993 allocation for improvements in the pupil/teacher ratio at post-primary level arising from commitments made under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The ratio will be improved to 19 to 1 for appointment purposes in <Col N="636" /> the 1993-94 school year.  This will involve an increase of 150 in the number of existing teaching posts.</P>
    <P>I will also continue with the phased programme, started in 1992-93, to provide for the recognition of vice-principals and guidance teachers on an ex-quota basis as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> From September next, almost 100 vice-principals will be recognised as ex-quota thereby giving rise to a similar number of new teaching posts.  In relation to guidance teachers.  I am providing for 0.5 of a whole-time post for guidance in post-primary schools in accordance with approved criteria.  This provision will benefit 100 schools in the 1993-94 school year.</P>
    <P>In excess of £1 million in additional funding is being provided for the continued phasing in of a programme to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services in the 1993-94 school year.  This applies to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards and to second level schools with 200 pupils upwards. The phasing of the programme will be on the basis of school size, with priority being given to the larger schools.</P>
    <P>I am also providing an allocation of £200,000 to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to establish a fund to provide comprehensive career guidance counselling in second level schools. The guidance fund will enable me to establish in 1993 a national resource centre for guidance materials.  In addition, I propose to establish within my Department a national database on guidance which will facilitate the monitoring, costing and planning of guidance services on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I am committed to development and reform of the curriculum to ensure a very real change in the classroom.  To this end I have provided for an increase of 11 per cent for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  This allocation will provide for work on curriculum and syllabus reform at senior cycle, phased reform and restructuring of the primary school curriculum and ongoing <Col N="637" /> development of the junior certificate programme.</P>
    <P>I am providing also for an increase of over 126 per cent in the allocation for the National Council for Vocational Awards which will enable the council to develop programmes on a modular basis as well as national criteria for school based assessment with external moderation. This provision will enable the council to put in place assessment arrangements for VPT 2 in 1993.</P>
    <P>Targeting disadvantage continues into the capital programme.  I am extremely concerned to ensure that the physical conditions in which children are taught are improved as a matter of priority.  I am treating this area with the utmost urgency and I have provided in 1993 an increase of more than a third over the 1992 capital provision for primary schools.  This is indicative of the commitment to redress as quickly as possible the inadequate physical conditions in many national schools throughout the country.  The Programme for Government 1993-97 provides for an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing and refurbishing substandard school buildings.  The increased capital allocation will allow further significant progress to be made this year in bringing the accommodation in our national schools up to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>The 1993 allocation of £24.5 million represents an increase of almost £7.3 million or 42 per cent on the 1992 budget provision for the second level capital programme.</P>
    <P>The 1993 capital allocation of approximately £20 million for the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology represents an increase of £4.2 million or 27 per cent on the 1992 outturn.  Among the projects to be funded are the extension of information technology facilities at Athlone, Limerick and Cork, hotel training at Galway; staff research facilities at Waterford; finalisation of works at Tallaght; major works at the College of Catering and at the Bishop Street site on a third level college providing courses in business <Col N="638" /> studies, marketing and industrial design. The provision of further regional technical colleges is under active consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is proving itself to be very flexible and effective in helping long term unemployed. It is widely considered as one of the most significant developments in second chance education and training in recent years.  I am particularly pleased to be able to make provision for the further expansion of the vocational training opportunities scheme in 1993.  The establishment of a further 45 groups in September next will increase the total number of places provided on the programme by 900 to nearly 3,000.</P>
    <P>I now turn to financial support for unemployed persons attending education courses.  The growth in the number of places provided under the vocational training opportunities scheme will be accompanied by a continuation of the schemes introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare whereby long term unemployed adults may avail of second and third level education while continuing their social welfare entitlements.  In order to alleviate financial problems that may be encountered by participants on these and similar schemes I am providing a special fund of £300,000 in 1993.</P>
    <P>I am also providing for an increase of almost 60 per cent in the funding for the adult literacy and community education scheme, bringing the total to £1.57 million. This scheme has since its inception in 1985 brought great benefit to adults who cannot read or write.  It has also helped disadvantaged communities generally through courses, which meet their immediate needs, such as parenting, homekeeping and personal development.</P>
    <P>This budget affirms the Government's strong commitment to the development of our education system and underlines the importance we attach to education as the key to our future prosperity and to equality and equal opportunities for all our citizens.  The provision for education will enable me, together with the many committed people in the education <Col N="639" /> sector, to maintain and improve the quality of education and to begin to introduce the measures to which we are committed in the Partnership Programme for Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time with me.  I welcome the major commitment in the education budget to eliminating disadvantage in the education system, particularly within the primary school system.  We know that for many children the effects of poverty have occurred long before the children leave primary school.  It is for this reason there is a very clear commitment in the programme for Government to target the primary school stage as the key to eliminating the widespread disadvantage that exists within our education system.</P>
      <P>It is essential to break this link between education and poverty.  In order to do that we must develop clear strategies which will focus on those first early school years.  This in turn will give children from disadvantaged backgrounds a fair and reasonable start to their lives.  It is not when children enter primary school that the disadvantage becomes apparent; very often it starts at an earlier stage.  It is the norm nowadays for children to attend pre-school playgroups, but because we do not have State funded pre-schools many children from disadvantaged backgrounds do not have the benefit of that early pre-school education which not only awakens them to the idea of learning but also prepares them for the structures and routine of primary school.  For many of these children the disadvantage begins even before they start primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is being combated in many areas through voluntary efforts. Many community playgroups are getting together assisted in a small way through local authorities.  Another important development has been the setting up of &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo; centres within schools where parents can come in and familiarise themselves with the school their children will attend and for the children themselves to become familiar with the school.  This is <Col N="640" /> essential to the smooth transition from pre-school to school years.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin North West there are 19 or 20 schools on the disadvantaged list.  While I support the increases in capitation, home school liaison, etc. for children with disadvantaged backgrounds, I believe that within that list of disadvantaged schools &mdash; there are approximately 210 at present &mdash; there are two levels of disadvantage.  Children from many areas, particularly in Dublin and parts of Limerick &mdash; I am very conscious of areas such as this, many of which are in my own constituency, such as Ballymun &mdash; come from seriously disadvantaged backgrounds.  I am referring to schools where all the children attending that particular school would be living in local authority housing and where 70 per cent of them would come from families that have not known employment for a long time.  Obviously, there are many social problems arising from that.</P>
    <P>I put the case to the Minister and the Government in general that we need to create a new category within primary school education, a crisis school category, because not only are children coming from very disadvantaged backgrounds, but when they enter a primary school that is seriously underfunded the school itself is compounding the disadvantage that many of these children experience.  For that reason we have to create this new crisis category and to target it in a specific way.</P>
    <P>First, we need to look at the whole question of capitation.  The capitation system works well at present in that the capitation grant from the Department is supplemented by a share from the parish. Unfortunately, in disadvantaged areas the parish has no funds and is unable to make its contribution to running the school.  In areas such as Ballymun and parts of Finglas South &mdash; my constituency &mdash; there is little ability to fund-raise. Tremendous work is being done throughout the country on a voluntary basis by parents who organise fund-raising events in order to help schools make ends meet but there are certain areas where this is not possible.  Whatever fund-raising parents <Col N="641" /> do takes away from the ability of the parish to fund-raise and <i>vice versa.</i> If the parish is involved in some fund-raising event to make a contribution to the school then the parents are unable to fund-raise.</P>
    <P>We are talking about 30 schools in all which are seriously disadvantaged.  In these schools there is a shortfall of between £7,000 and £10,000 each year and there is a crisis in them.  The parishes are in serious debt and the schools are under-funded.  We would all like to see computer rooms and sports facilities in all schools but they are very far down the list in the schools with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>In relation to capitation, I would like to see that new category created.  I welcome the increase in the capital programme.  I am sure the Minister will decide on new projects on the basis of educational priority rather than political considerations, something which has not always been done in the past.  The disadvantaged schools will benefit most from the improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio.  That link between home and school is the key to eliminating the disadvantage.  I welcome the priority being given by the Minister to eliminating disadvantage.  I know that the effective targeting of these extra resources is the only way to eliminate the disadvantage which exists for many children.  The building of that partnership is the key to bringing about significant change in our education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a few comments on the budget.  A budget which does not engender some emotion, be they conflicting emotions of anger or of jubilation, is fundamentally flawed.  A budget which sets out to offer solutions to crisis economic situations must, and should, have blood on the shirt; this budget had nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is teetering on the brink of total collapse with £3 billion lost in reserves.  That has come about because of our costly brand of macho-patriotism in refusing not to devalue in time, our <Col N="642" /> slow reflex action in anticipating the markets and countering the intense international pressure from our so-called partners in relation to scarce jobs and our shrinking job pool due to our inherently weak industrial and job situation.  We are vulnerable because the headquarters of so many of our industries are based overseas and they go at the shortest possible notice.  Our massive unemployment queues &mdash; means that we have the most educated dole queues in the world.  The Government's response to those problems has been very poor and too little too late.</P>
    <P>With 300,000 people unemployed, the Digital disaster last week, coupled with the closures in Carlow, the big fear is that this country is in free-fall and that recent economic disasters could very well be the tip of the iceberg.  What was required, as Deputy Yates rightly said, was a dynamic, adventurous and imaginative budget to try to achieve the necessary economic lift.  Instead of a dynamic, energising budget we have what resembles a flat pint of Guinness which was left lying overnight, it was dull, stale, tasteless and insipid.  The public reaction, apart from the media reaction, tells the tale.</P>
    <P>The budget achieved, almost the impossible, it pleased almost nobody. The only kudos I have seen were in last Sunday's newspapers from &ldquo;Marietta&rdquo;. The full page advertisements read: &ldquo;Marietta thanks Bertie&rdquo;.  This was in response to the decision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, to reduce value-added-tax on non-chocolate biscuits.  I do not know what kind of paroxysms &ldquo;Marietta&rdquo; would have got into if the Minister for Finance had also reduced VAT on chocolate coated biscuits.</P>
    <P>The Government, at the start of its term of office, has made a fatal error, it has failed to bite the bullet.  Despite its insulation of a huge majority with 101 seats it has shirked the golden opportunity to be bold and radical.  It has postponed any tough effective decisions and has gone for a bland exercise of simply treading water.  The last thing this country needs in its current state of paralysis is a holding operation, like Mr. Micawber <Col N="643" /> hanging around waiting for something to happen.  For a Government that is fundamentally brittle and unstable, because of the inability of certain members of the junior partner to take the heat of the kitchen, the postponement of the difficult decisions at the start is fatal. When the general public were receptive and conditioned to tough decisions that was the time to have bitten the bullet. This is the rock on which this Government will perish.</P>
    <P>The increase in value-added-tax on building materials is extremely damaging to a proven high density employer, a traditional area which has given long service in terms of employment.  What we needed was a stimulus, not a deterrent, not further depressants or disincentives. While the additional 2,300 local authority housing starts are welcome they will only make a marginal difference.  I never cease to wonder at the tunnel vision of people who dismiss and discard ideas and schemes because they look no further than the top line cost.</P>
    <P>I distinctly recall that in the early eighties the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition introduced a very imaginative scheme, the house improvement grants scheme. They gave grants of up to £8,000 to refurbish, reconstruct and renovate dwellings. Thousands of tradesmen were lured out of the black economy in order to register for VAT and qualify for work under the scheme.  The vast majority of them gave up the dole.  Builders providers flourished and paid their various taxes.  There was a buzz and an energy everywhere.  Yet, on assuming office in 1987 one of the first actions of the Fianna Fáil Government was to scuttle the entire project because of the blinkered advice &mdash; in my opinion &mdash; of some economist who told that Government it was costing too much.  I am convinced that if a cost/benefit analysis had been carried out on that scheme it would have shown that the benefits far out-weigh the costs and disadvantages, and that worthwhile decisions were taken resulting in net benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago the Taoiseach told the House that we imported 181,000 tonnes <Col N="644" /> of timber in the nine month period up to September 1992.  What startled me was that we are now a substantial net exporter of timber.  In that same period we exported 480,000 tonnes of timber, raw and unprocessed.  That industry employed nobody other than the people who cut down the trees, drove the timber to the ports and loaded it on the ships.  We are crying out for indigenous industry here.  We have huge areas of land under afforestation with thousands of hectares coming on steam.  We have a potential industry based on a growing and guaranteed supply of local resources, capable of providing up to 500 jobs at a minimum at the production level, yet we are not answering the market which this indigenous raw material can produce and fill by giving to the world market a very expensive much in demand oriental strandboard.  At a minimum there are 500 jobs in wood pulp processing and timber processing staring us in the face and yet there is not a solitary mention of that either in the Programme for a Partnership Government or in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>I am amused, and disappointed, at the token recognition in the speech of the Minister for Finance of the role of small businesses.  The Minister was eloquent and, indeed, elegant in his choice of words.  He told us:</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the vital role played by small firms, especially those in the export sectors.</P>
    <P>He went on to tell us:</P>
    <P>If we are to make headway in employment we need more people in small enterprises.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not realise that the entire system conspires and militates against small enterprises and stuns and kills off small businesses?  Does he not realise that every single day jobs are being lost, people are being thrown on the dole queue and generations of old retail businesses are being literally mowed down, going to the wall and being cannibalised by the spread of the monopoly chainstores throughout the country? <Col N="645" /> I have no doubt that in another ten years the small and medium-sized retail outlets will have disappeared because of competition and monopolies and because competition and monopoly legislation is a joke.</P>
    <P>I must say I resent the comments made in the Dáil last week by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in reply to a question from me.  He said that there was absolutely no evidence to support the view that supermarket chains were responsible for the largescale closure of small retail outlets.  He went on to quote an authoritative newspaper article which suggested that the closures had occurred simply because these outlets were inefficient or had high borrowings.  I would strongly contest this viewpoint.  These businesses are not inefficient; they are thrifty, provident and run by prople who have been the backbone of Irish business life for decades.  They are now being dumped unceremoniously overboard by a Government which has little sympathy for them, which will not lift a finger to help them and which refuses to invoke the protective legislation which exists. These businesses simply cannot compete with the large supermarket giants who believe they are entitled to demand and get a minimum of three months' credit, who can bulk buy huge quantities of materials, who can import huge quantities of cheap goods from Third World countries and who pay low wages to thousands of part-time staff.  What I am saying is that unless somebody calls a halt pretty soon then the entire small business landscape of this country will be wiped clean overnight.</P>
    <P>For a small country we are very pretentious and have an enormous capacity to think big and to accept other people's definitions of what they think would be good for us.  We are witnessing the last generation of small farmers because milk quotas, cattle quotas and now sheep quotas make size the very determinant of survival.  We are closing down small butcher shops and bakeries because EC directives have set down elaborate standards which I doubt very much are being enforced in other member states.  The <Col N="646" /> result is that a whole way of life is being done away with.  We are proud to be Irish in Europe but when I see the huge bureaucracy we have established and employed in this country to police the dictates from Brussels, I honestly believe that at times we are slaves to European regulations.</P>
    <P>We have to invest in education.  I further believe we have to face the fact that we are creating an under-class.  Irish society is growing more polarised between the haves and have nots, between the rich and the poor.  There is a large and growing group who are not merely less well off but who feel alienated from society, owing nothing to society, not taxes, civil obedience or a sense of community.  At the other end of the scale we have to acknowledge that those who are fortunate enough to get to college and are able to get employment in Europe and in English speaking countries are well capable of holding their own. However, the tragedy is that we are the subject of the old law, that the poorer countries of the world must subsidise the rich with their most precious possessions &mdash; their fully grown, highly educated and most gifted children.  The sad reality is that the bright, energetic and most highly qualified are usually the very people who will be first at Dublin and Shannon for the plane to the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education was characterised in a newspaper article last Tuesday as lacking in what George Bush once called &ldquo;this vision thing&rdquo;.  Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is untrue, perhaps it is not fair &mdash; it is too early to judge.  I honestly think that in the short term many of the people involved in education would trade the division for a little more precision.  Quite honestly, I do not know why the Minister for Finance bothered to insert anything about education in his budget speech.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Education decided to call a press conference on the evening of the budget to explain the section on education. Tonight the Minister spoke about major reform.  All I know is that there were only five and a half lines in the <Col N="647" /> section dealing with education.  What the Minister did was draw attention to the pitiful additional allocation for education. Listening to the Minister for Finance one was left with the distinct impression on the night of the budget that there was cause for jubilation, that the Government was providing an additional £3.3 million to what was mentioned in the Estimates which were published the previous weeks.  However, when one examines the figures one finds that this sum is not additional at all; it is the same money merely recycled.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what it is supposed to do.  It is supposed to provide 900 extra VTOS places and set up a fund for career guidance counselling at second level. Like the Minister for Education, I welcome the 900 VTOS places.  This will help many people who missed the boat on the first occasion; it will provide second chance education, but God help the people who will be waiting for the residue in terms of career guidance counselling. Tonight we know the full facts.  The figure involved, the residue, will be £200,000. According to the Minister, the money will be for materials.  I wish to say to the Minister that we have enough materials. What we want at this stage is not materials, rather we want personnel, hands on involvement, advice on a person to person, eyeball to eyeball, pupil to teacher basis in the classhall. There is no money for that.  It is a scandal that not a single child in any school with less than 350 pupils in any part of this country has access to career guidance counselling at a time when he or she is making lifelong career choice decisions.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the OECD report, which showed that Irish education is operating on a shoe string, particularly in the context of the quality of school buildings, I think the Minister would have to concede that it is most disappointing that the very most she could wring out of the Minister for Finance, over and above the figure for last year for primary school buildings, was £1.8 million.  The sum of £1.8 million would not build a decent primary school for <Col N="648" /> 400-500 students, let alone put roofs on substandard buildings or provide toilets for some of the stone age classhalls and schools throughout the length and breadth of the country.  This is not acceptable. I honestly hoped when the Labour Party put down its marker on assuming office that it wanted the Education portfolio, that this would be a signal that that party was going to make its presence felt. I further hoped that after all its public posturing about supporting all things public, Labour would avail of the opportunity in the first budget introduced by the new Government to make a clear statement of a return to the principle of free education at both primary and secondary levels.  The Minister must be aware that free education is now a myth, it is a thing of the past.  Deputy Shortall stated that the capitation scheme works well.  I think the capitation scheme is appalling.  It is only £28 per student, and it has been like that for years.</P>

The reality of this is that instead of being eagerly anticipated by parents, school is a frightening prospect for the thousands of low and middle-income families who have to dig deeper and deeper on a daily basis in order to keep their children in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we speak today, there are 600 classes with 40-plus students.  One is not talking about education in such classrooms, one is talking about damage limitation and crowd control.  There are 581 teachers trying to cope with classes of between 30-39 students.  These are multi-class situations.  Imagine standing in front of a class of 39 students and trying to teach the syllabi for fourth, fifth and sixth classes simultaneously.  This is expecting the impossible.  Those teachers are the very people who will tell you that these are the students who are maladjusted, who need psychological care and who in <Col N="649" /> later years get involved in vandalism and crime.</P>
    <P>Remedial teaching is literally the poor relation in the education scheme. Remedial children are consigned to the education scrapheap at the back of the class because of the lack of remedial teachers and because conventional classes simply cannot cope.  There are thousands of bright, intelligent children with reading difficulties such as dyslexia who become emotional wrecks because of their frustration.  Their condition is not detected and they remain uncatered for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I expressed support for Deputy Harney's Bill and congratulated her on her initiative in bringing it forward.  Many Deputies expressed their fears for society.  I believe the battle against criminals has been lost. The only way to regain the initiative is to bring the battle to the criminals.  Society is under assault.  The old adage that crime does not pay has been stood on its head.  Crime very definitely does pay, particularly for the gangsters who permeate Dublin society.  Many Deputies expressed horror at the situation in Dublin where protection rackets have been well established for many years. That and the rising graph of murder and rape constitutes a crisis for society.  The newspapers have a daily tale of grisly and ghastly murders committed quite freely around the country.  The statistic of 31 rape cases awaiting decision in the criminal courts illustrates the extent to which society has slipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knowing the political system, I do not expect the Minister to accept this Bill but I hope she will take on board many of the worthwhile recommendations contained in it.  The Minister is no shrinking <Col N="650" /> violet and realises the enormity of the task.  I believe she will have more backbone in dealing with this problem than many a man &mdash; and I say that as a male chauvinist.  In my 11 years in this House I have come to regard it as an echo chamber. Fine words and rhetoric will not defeat criminals.  We need real action. I realise that some of the measures I advocate might be considered a little extreme by fellow parliamentarians, but I believe some of them would be heartily endorsed by the man in the street.  The Minister is aware of some of my recommendations, although I would not expect her to acknowledge them publicly.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are fighting a losing battle. The recommendations that emanate from the Garda bodies suggest that they have lost confidence in their ability to deal with crime.  The are being asked to fight crime with their hands tied behind their back.  We must give them more power, particularly in relation to the dispersal of young mobs or drunken yobs who can converge in a public place, very often in an intimidatory fashion.  Quite often we read of gardaí being injured as a result of attacks by drunken mobs.  The gardaí have to be protected as well as society.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to what I would term the criminal class. People decide to go into or to stay out of that class.  The statistics for recidivism show an alarming rate of continual and habitual offending.  In a written reply yesterday the Minister stated that 2,690 prisoners had offended while on parole in 1991.  Surely the Minister must be alarmed at that.  There is something patently wrong with the system, that allows almost 3,000 people to offend again against society while on parole.  The figures for 1990 are similar.  We must close the door on that group and protect society by keeping people consigned to jail where they belong.</P>
    <P>Every town has its corps of hardened, full-time professional criminals.  The same families in my town of Dundalk offend again and again against society. They are in and out of jail like yo-yos. The doors of Mountjoy and other jails <Col N="651" /> are like the revolving doors in a saloon in the wild west.  Is there nothing the Minister can do to improve the penitential system to allow these people to serve their sentences, which are often lenient and inadequate?  I commend the Minister's intention to introduce a Bill to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>Some months ago Dundalk was assailed by criminals.  Shopkeepers were robbed in daylight every day.  One very brave publican took a baseball bat when confronted by three armed thugs wearing balaclavas.  They took to their heels.  He still has the baseball bat to ensure that nobody else will attempt to attack or rob him.  We need deterrents.  Unfortunately, because of bleeding hearts and lily-livered people in public life, in the Legislature and in the Judiciary, law and order has been dismantled.  We must reinstate it.  Unemployment is an irritant but it is not the number one issue and it did not win the election for Fine Gael.  The real concern of citizens is protection and security.  The evening papers have stories of elderly ladies in Dublin locking themselves in at 4 o'clock on a winter's evening.  Is that a society we can stand over?  The Minister can take steps to change it.  All out war must be waged on criminals.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me suggest that one particular recommendation made by Deputy Harney be adhered to.  That is the recommendation that gardaí should not be retired at 57.  They have the experience of a lifetime in dealing with crime.  They are not old men at 57 and are far more valuable to the Garda Síochána than young 18 and 19 year old boys coming out of Templemore who have no experience of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with this matter I wish to comment on the appalling case involving incest, rape and sexual assault which has occupied our attention in the last few days.  This was a truly horrendous and extremely distressing case and it causes me great pain to think about the ordeal endured by the young woman concerned. <Col N="652" /> I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will join me in condemning the crime and expressing our sympathy for the victim.</P>
      <P>Turning to the facts of the matter, the accused in question pleaded guilty in the Central Criminal Court to two charges of rape, two charges of incest and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The maximum sentence for rape is life imprisonment.  In the case of incest the maximum penalty can be life imprisonment where the female person is under the age of 15 years and in other cases the maximum penalty is seven years.  One of the incest charges in the case related to a period when the victim was under of the age of 15 years.  The other charge of incest related to a period when she was over 15 years of age.  The penalty for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a maximum of five years. The existing law accordingly gives plenty of scope for dealing severely with cases of incest or rape.</P>
      <P>I understand that the accused in this case was sentenced to seven years for rape, seven years for incest and five years for the assaults, the sentences to run concurrently. The options which were open to the court, a Cheann Comhairle, were as follows.  In relation to the charges of rape a maximum penalty of life imprisonment could have been imposed on each charge; in relation to one charge of incest with a female under 15 years a further maximum sentence of life imprisonment could have been imposed; with regard to the charge of incest with a female over 15 years of age a penalty of up to seven years imprisonment could have been imposed.  Both of the charges of assault carry maximum penalties of five years imprisonment each.  The judge, it must be remembered, has total discretion in the matter and he exercised that discretion in a particular way.  As a member of the Government, I am precluded from commenting on his decision and I do not propose therefore to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has led to demands for an increase of the penalties for incest.  Incest was made a crime by the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, and it is a crime whether <Col N="653" /> or not the female person consents.  If a man commits incest without the consent of the female he is also of course open to a charge of rape and liable to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment that that offence carries.  I note that in this particular case the man was charged with and pleaded guilty to rape.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their examination of the law relating to child sexual abuse looked at the law on incest and recommended &ldquo;no change in the present law&rdquo;.  However, as Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach this morning instructed me to consider the question of increasing the penalties for incest and I will take action accordingly as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the real problem is that in the case of incest involving a female over 15 years the maximum penalty is only seven years.  I do not think that this is satisfactory and I will be dealing with that matter by way of an amendment to the Government's Criminal Justice Bill just restored to the Dáil Order Paper last week.</P>
    <P>Certain other aspects of the Law Reform Commission's report in this area are still under examination in my Department and the matter will be kept under review.  Other recommendations in that report &mdash; that is those dealing with the giving of evidence by video link by children and others in sexual abuse cases to reduce the trauma experienced by the victim &mdash; have of course already been implemented by the recently enacted Criminal Evidence Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter asked if I will complete the passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1993.  That Bill when passed will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to ask the Court of Criminal Appeal to review unduly lenient sentences.  I can assure the Deputy that I do wish to have the Criminal Justice Bill, 1993, enacted as soon as possible and to this end I have been in touch with the Whips to ensure that its passage is given priority.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Deputy and his party will co-operate with me in this matter. Those two pieces of legislation, among <Col N="654" /> others, amply demonstrate the concern of this Government for the victims of these tragic cases and demonstrate our willingness to do whatever is necessary to improve matters.</P>
    <P>As to the business now before us, the Government have decided to oppose this Private Members' Bill.  The principal reason for doing so is that, as Deputies will be aware, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> includes a commitment that the Government will introduce legislation to deal with street crime.  The preparation of legislative proposals to accomplish this is at an advanced stage in my Department at present and the Government's own Bill dealing with this area, and other matters besides, will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>Before I go on, I want to compliment Deputy Harney and the members of her party for producing a Bill which attempts to tackle the problem of criminality on the streets and generally.  But I do wonder why they decided to proceed with this measure in the light of the clear commitment in the programme which I have mentioned and in the light of recent statements by me and my predecessor in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill tries to tackle the really serious threats to public disorder by recasting the major common law offence of riot in statutory form and introducing a new statutory offence of violent disorder. That is all very fine; but the Government's preferred approach is to consider the whole area of public order offences, the serious and not so serious.  In this latter respect the Law Reform Commission have produced two substantial reports in 1985 &mdash; those dealing with vagrancy and related offences (LRC 11-1985) and the Dublin Police Acts and related offences (LRC 14-1985).  In other words, a complete package of measures may be required to deal with the lesser street offences, as well as the serious public order offences, ranging from the purely loutish and sometimes drunken behaviour to, possibly, the more serious manifestations of group violence.  Traditionally these latter offences have been framed to deal with behaviour which <Col N="655" /> seriously undermines public order in a pre-planned and violent way.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with the individual sections in the Bill.  Sections 2, 3 and 4 seem to have their origins in the UK Public Order Act, 1986.  That Act for the first time put into statutory form the major public order offences and it abolished the common law offences of riot, rout, unlawful assembly and affray.  I merely note in passing that the Bill is silent on the position of the existing common law offences which are to be replaced by the new statutory rules.  Do the drafters of the Bill intend that those common law offences should be repealed? If so, they should have provided accordingly and this lacuna worries me slightly because it may indicate that the Bill was prepared in haste.  I also wonder what effect the recasting of the common law offence of riot in the way proposed would have on our existing malicious injuries code as contained in the Malicious Injuries Acts, 1981 and 1986.</P>
    <P>I also note that the provision in section 6 of the UK Act, which deals with the mental element which must be present before these new statutory offences can be committed, has not been incorporated by the drafters of the Bill.  Why is that, I wonder?  Again, was it overlooked?  It certainly is an essential feature of the UK legislation and, logically, should form part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Until the 1986 Act was enacted public order criminal law in England was to be found in a variety of sources, both common law and statute.  Generally speaking that is still the position here. The principal serious offences of riot, rout, affray and unlawful assembly are the products of the common law and they have never been reduced to statutory form in this jurisdiction.  The 1986 Act in England came about as a result of decades of serious public unrest and disorder. There were race riots in the fifties; CND and anti-Vietnam demonstrations in the sixties; the seventies saw National Front and racist confrontations.  In recent years there were serious inner city riots throughout Britain.  There was also the <Col N="656" /> serious public disorder occasioned by the miners' strikes and strikes in the printing industry as well as public demonstrations and unrest on a large scale against the poll tax.  My point is that the 1986 Act reflects the extremely serious industrial, racial and other social tensions in Britain in recent decades.</P>
    <P>We do not have that background here or problems of that scale or magnitude. That is not to say that reform of the existing law on the very serious public order offences may not be overdue.  It may very well be and we are examining the matter.  But it would be wrong to suppose that we are dealing with the sort of problems that existed in Britain. Listening to the debate on the Bill so far one would be forgiven for thinking that nothing has been done in recent years to tackle the crime problem.  That is simply not true.</P>

      <P>As recently as 1990 this House passed the Larceny Act, 1990, which updated the law on receiving stolen property and replaced the receiving offence, with all its legal technicalities, with the more broadly based offence of handling stolen property and a less technical mental element necessary for proving the offence.  The Act also amended the law significantly in relation to the old offence of going equipped for larceny etc.  I shall return to this point later.</P>
      <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, bans stun guns and controls the availability and possession of crossbows, knives and other dangerous objects.  Furthermore, it contains a specific offence of trespassing with a knife or any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person.  The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, reforms the law on rape.  It improves substantially the legal protection for victims of sexual assaults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, provides the Garda <Col N="657" /> with the power to take bodily samples from persons suspected of serious offences for the purposes of forensic testing, including genetic fingerprinting.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Damage Act, 1991, simplifies and modernises the whole law of malicious damage to property and provides for compensation to be awarded by a court when convicting an offender of damage to property.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, makes important changes in the law of evidence to facilitate the admission of certain documents.  It makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in cases involving physical or sexual abuse &mdash; by means, for example, of a television link.</P>
    <P>As well as those measures, I have a substantial programme of criminal law reform under way in the Department. Just recently the Criminal Justice Bill was restored to the Order Paper of the House.  That Bill does three things: it provides a procedure for the review of unduly lenient sentences; it requires courts, when determining the sentence to be imposed for a sexual offence or an offence involving violence, to take into account any effect of the offence on the victim; it gives courts a general power to require offenders to pay compensation for any resulting personal injury or loss.</P>
    <P>In accordance with commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government I intend to introduce a Juvenile Justice Bill which will modernise the law in the area of juvenile crime and I also hope to proceed with a Criminal Law Bill which will, among other things, bring our criminal law up to date by abolishing anachronistic legal rules on the categorisation of crimes into felonies and misdemeanours.</P>

      <P>I know this sounds a bit legalistic, but these differences do complicate the law and they should be abolished.  As part of the process the law in relation to powers of arrest without a warrant will be restated in statutory form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> I should also mention that the Law Reform Commission is proceeding with its examination of the law in relation to offences against the person generally.  It has already circulated a discussion paper on the subject and I expect that its final report will be available this year.  The final recommendations of the commission will be examined by the Government as a matter of urgency and I would hope to see any necessary statutory changes effected as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>That is a substantial body of criminal law reform by any standard and it would be quite wrong to let this debate go on without drawing attention to the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that the problems we have been experiencing recently as a result of thuggery and loutish behaviour, where excessive drink has a large part to play, are part of the wider socio-economic problems which have been experienced in certain parts of the country. That aspect of the matter has been very well addressed in the recently published report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Urban Crime Problems. While I am not ruling out the inclusion in the Government's Bill of similar provisions to those contained in this Bill now before us dealing with very serious threats to public disorder, I incline to the view that this should be done as part of a package that will deal also with the somewhat less serious manifestations of hooliganism and street crime, which have been causing debate recently.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with unlawful loitering and section 6 introduces a new offence of criminal trespass, which could be regarded as a hybrid form of loitering. With regard to the proposed loitering offence, I want to direct the attention of Deputies to the comments by the Law Reform Commission made in its report on vagrancy to which I have already referred.  The relevant chapter in the report is chapter 15 and it should be noted that the commission made no recommendations for the creation of any specific loitering offence.  The commission made the point that the particular provision in the Vagrancy Act which had <Col N="659" /> been found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>versus</i> King in 1981 had been inoperative for some time and no resultant gap in the law had been brought to its attention.  However, that situation may now have changed and I am giving specific attention to the creation of a new loitering type offence which will satisfy the test of constitutionality having regard to the Supreme Court's decision in the relevant case.  That is not an easy task.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty can be seen from the commission's comments that &ldquo;even if the accused's criminal record were excluded from consideration as part of his antecedent conduct, an offence containing as an ingredient an element of suspicion engendered by the accused's antecedent conduct would probably suffer from many of the defects identified by the Supreme Court as attaching to the existing loitering with intent offence &mdash; arbitrariness, vagueness, difficulty of rebuttal, relation to past conduct, ambiguity in failing to distinguish between apparent and real behaviour of a criminal nature etc&rdquo;.  Those are the parameters which have to be met by any new general loitering type offence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed offence of criminal trespass in section 6, again the work of the Law Reform Commission is particularly relevant.  Chapter 14 of the vagrancy report examines the law in relation to being &ldquo;found on&rdquo; certain private premises.  Before I go on to outline what the commission states in the matter I want to refer to existing offences in this area which I am not aware have been found to be deficient.  I am speaking here about the recent amendment of section 28 of the 1916 Larceny Act carried into effect in the Larceny Act, 1990, section 2.  We now have a modern offence of going equipped for larceny or burglary, among other things, which replaces the former offences in section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, and the former section 28 in the Larceny Act, 1916. Another relevant offence is section 23 A of the 1916 Larceny Act dealing with <Col N="660" /> burglary.  That section was inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and it replaced the old offence of burglary with two specific forms of the offence &mdash; entry as a trespasser with ulterior intent and entry as a trespasser and committing a specified offence.  Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, also provides that every person being found in or upon any dwellinghouse, warehouse, coach house, stable or outhouse, or in any enclosed yard, garden or area for any unlawful purpose is guilty of an offence.  Apart from the outdated language the provision can still be used in the fight against crime. There is also a related offence in section 7 of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1871, but that provision must be viewed as questionable in the light of the decision in the King case.</P>
    <P>There is an area of overlap between the 1824 Act and the 1916 Act provisions but the scope of the 1916 Act is not as wide as the Vagrancy Act.  The Law Reform Commission states that section 23A of the 1916 Act: (i) applies only where a person is found in a building, as distinct from on the walls or roots of buildings or in enclosed yards, gardens or areas; (ii) applies only where there is intent to commit one of a limited range of offences and would not cover, for instance, intent to commit indecent assault or indecent exposure; and (iii) covers entry as a trespasser and so would not cover a situation where a person entered a building lawfully and while there formed the intention of, say, stealing something.</P>
    <P>The commission concluded that a new offence should be created to replace the provisions in the Vagrancy and Prevention of Crime Acts.  It would make it an offence to be found in or upon any building or in any yard or garden or in any enclosed area with intent to commit an offence.  The commission also recommends that where a person is found on such premises in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he is there with intent to commit a particular offence, this would be evidence that he was there with such intent.  In addition, <Col N="661" /> the commission recommends that it would be an offence to trespass on residential premises in a manner which causes or is calculated to cause nuisance, annoyance or fear to another person.  The penalty for both offences was suggested to be a maximum fine of £500 and-or six months imprisonment.  I favour the approach of the Law Reform Commission in relation to this type of offence rather than the provision in section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7, on the subject of racketeering and section 8 on the unlawful possession of materials and information of a criminal nature, as the Minister for Justice I have not been made aware by the Garda of any deficiencies in the existing law in these areas which hamper them in the fight against crime. I am consulting the Garda Authorities as to how they see the problem.  With regard to section 8 in particular what is wrong with the existing offence of conspiracy at common law being used in the particular circumstances?</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with special local provisions in respect of order in public places and would permit a local authority to make prohibition orders aimed at persons in general or young persons or children in particular from being in a designated place during particular times. While I will consider the matter in the context of the Bill which I will be bringing forward I would have some reservations about a provision of this kind.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 10 regarding permission for the Garda to place permanent surveillance equipment in public places is an attractive one.  We are already working on that and Deputies will be aware that the Garda now have available a mobile video camera to record details of persons and incidents.  The question of the use of permanent closed circuit TV monitoring systems is a matter under active consideration in my Department at present.  The question of any backing legislation will be considered in that context.  All I shall say about the provision in the Bill is that other provisions may be required and I am not sure that the subsection dealing with the Garda having the powers of An Bord <Col N="662" /> Telecom is helpful.  It may, in fact, be unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>All in all, I recognise that this Bill represents an attempt by the party opposite to address what they perceive are the problems.  I would have preferred more time to assess the full implications of their proposals, but, unfortunately, we had sight of the Bill only late on Friday afternoon.  Nevertheless, I do not think that they will be disappointed when they see the Government's proposals in this area, which I believe will be a more balanced approach to the problems which need to be faced.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the point made in the debate about Garda numbers, I want to give the following details.  In 1970 there were 6,551 gardaí.  This figure rose to 10,472 in January 1990 and in January 1993 the figure was 10,984.  As regards the policy on the age of retirement, the Government's attitude &mdash; and mine &mdash; is to address the matter by way of accelerated recruitment.</P>
    <P>The Government has made a clear commitment to bring in legislation to deal with the manifestation of street and other crime which have given rise to so much concern in recent times.  Since I will shortly be bringing forward the Government's proposals, this Bill, as I have already indicated, is being opposed.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on the observations which the Minister made in relation to the horrific case which has been brought to her attention in the last few days concerning the rape and incest victim in County Kilkenny.  I am very pleased that the Minister made observations in regard to this case and I appreciate that, as a member of the Government, she is precluded from commenting on the decision of the judge. However, it is fair to state that I &mdash; and most people to whom I have spoken since the decision was announced &mdash; found the <Col N="663" /> sentence imposed perplexing.  It is clear from the Minister's comments &mdash; and from the information which she has given to the House about the maximum sentences which could have been imposed in this case &mdash; that the kindest thing which can be said about it is that the judge took an extraordinarily lenient view of the crime in question.</P>
      <P>I make that point because it is regrettable that one of the Bills to which the Minister referred, namely, the Criminal Justice Bill, which has now been restored to the Order Paper, has not been enacted because it would have provided a remedy for this kind of situation.  That Bill was drafted and circulated following another case, ironically in County Kilkenny, the Levinia Kerwick case, and would have given the DPP the flexibility of appealing against a lenient sentence.  It is regrettable that, although that legislation was circulated as far back as last September &mdash; if my memory serves me right &mdash; it has still not been put on the Statute Book. If it had there would now be redress in this case, in particular to deal with the very understandable fears which the victim of the crime has in relation to the time when the person who committed the crime eventually gets out of prison &mdash; much earlier than I and other Members would like.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies, including myself, complained that the month which the Government took following the formation of the Government and the renewal of the Dáil term was not used to deal with legislation which would not, normally, have been controversial.  The Criminal Justice Bill, giving the Director of Public Prosecutions the power to appeal against lenient sentences was the kind of legislation which could have been dealt with by this House if it had been sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's response to this Private Members' Bill underscores that point because the argument she made is that the House should wait until the Government introduces its own legislation.  The trouble is that we must wait for so long for the Government to introduce legislation <Col N="664" /> of that nature.  A formula which the Government could avail of in this instance is one whereby it would allow the Bill to go through this Stage and then send it to a Committee of the House to have whatever technical and legal difficulties the Government has with the Bill proposed by Deputy Harney ironed out. That would be a much more constructive way of dealing with it; we would be getting on with our business and dealing in a practical way with some of the difficulties now before us.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to Deputy McGahon who, I am sure, would not consider himself a liberal.  I do not have any hesitation in attaching that tag to my outlook on life.  However, I sometimes resent the implication that people who hold liberal views about society are in some way soft on crime.  I consider myself to be just as strong in regard to law and order as Deputy McGahon or any other Members of the House who do not consider themselves to be liberals.  The law and order agenda is not one over which a limited number of people with a particular political outlook have a monopoly. I hold that view because I value the concept of freedom.  It is a concept which is very much abused and misunderstood in the world we live in.  It is a concept which in its grandiose form has given rise to a great deal of conflict and human suffering.  People die and, worse still, are killed for holding grandiose concepts of freedom.</P>
    <P>The freedoms about which I am concerned are much simpler.  I am talking about the freedom of citizens to live their lives in peace, to enjoy life in one's own home without fear of invasion of one's privacy, the freedom to leave one's home without the fear that it might be burgled or interfered with and the freedom to move about without fear of being attacked or molested.  Our citizens, particularly women, are being denied the feeedom to move about our cities without a sense of fear.  It is not a question of a limited number of people having to lock their doors after 4 p.m. in the evening; large sections of society are living in a state of curfew.  They cannot move about, <Col N="665" /> even in their immediate areas, without being afraid.  A sense of normal freedom must be restored to our citizens.  Those who, for whatever reason, interfere with that freedom must be dealt with quickly and effectively by law.</P>
    <P>There is no quick fix solution to the problem of crime.  We know that the crime rate is increasing.  There are regular reports &mdash; in some cases exaggerated &mdash; in our newspapers, particularly the evening editions, about the crime situation. It is easy for a person to propose some quick fix solution or formula to resolve the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>Crime must be tackled at a number of levels.  It must be tackled by providing extra gardaí and resources and by a greater concentration of Garda activity and time in the form of community policing. In this regard I welcome the initiatives taken by the Garda to liaise more closely with local communities.  I attended a meeting in my own constituency last night which was organised by the local community.  Members of the Garda were also present.  There was criticism of the Garda at that meeting, but there was also a dialogue between them and the people, which is very healthy.  I commend gardaí who attend such meetings and make an effort to liaise with the public to ascertain their complaints and concerns.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that in certain circumstances the Garda simply cannot cope because of a lack of resources and manpower.  The Garda station in the area I attended the meeting last night has a Garda force of 43.  At any given time about ten to 12 gardaí are on duty in that station covering an area with a population of approximately 25,000.  That is an inadequate level of policing and does not provide for the physical police presence necessary both to reassure the public and to deal with crime and emergencies. The absence of visible policing in an area gives rise to criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The problem of crime must be tackled also in the legislation the Garda enforce. As previous speakers stated, the gardaí are trying to fight crime with one hand tied behind their backs.  They are trying <Col N="666" /> to enforce laws which were enacted in the last century.  The type of behaviour and crime which the Dublin Metropolitan Police Act and other legislation enacted in the last century had to deal with is different to crime &mdash; much of it drug related &mdash; in a modern urban society.  It is necessary to update our legislation.  I am glad the Private Members' Bill we are debating today is attempting to do that, but the Bill is defective in a number of respects.  It does not deal with many areas of crime.  I am not being critical of the legislation because I welcome it and intend to support it, but some areas of it need further consideration.  For example, it does not deal with certain behaviour which causes concern to members of the public.  It stops short of criminal behaviour but nevertheless that needs to be dealt with.  I am talking about groups of young people congregating in a menacing or intimidatory manner on a street or near a person's house.  Such behaviour may not be of a criminal nature, but it causes a great deal of distress to citizens and restricts their freedom.</P>
    <P>Our traffic laws need to be addressed. I was taken aback when I discovered that gardaí who stop a person driving a stolen car cannot seize that car.  Apparently, the best they can do is to inquire if the driver has a driving licence and insurance and give him or her ten days to produce such documents.  The amount of damage and distress a person driving around in a stolen car could cause in ten days could be horrific.</P>
    <P>Another area which needs to be addressed is that in regard to the Judiciary, and I have referred already to the case in Kilkenny.  The public are, understandably, bewildered at the level of inconsistency in judicial decisions. This legislation provides for the imposition of maximum sentences in most cases, but the degree of discretion and inconsistencies displayed by judges in handing out decisions is quite bewildering.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing problem in regard to detention and I am sure this area will be addressed on Friday next in discussing the problem of juvenile crime.  The shortage <Col N="667" /> of detention places is frustrating for members of the public and in particular, for the gardaí who, having detected a crime, charged a youth, brought that youth before the courts and got a conviction, find there is nothing the court can do except allow the youth back on our streets because no detention place is available.</P>
    <P>Legislation is not sufficient in dealing with crime.  All the legislation in the world and a garda on every street corner will not solve the problem of crime. Therefore, it is necessary that we address not alone the effects of crime, but its causes.  I attended a seminar earlier today on unemployment.  The rise in the level of crime we are now experiencing in urban areas is directly related to the high level of unemployment and its social consequences.  One does not need to have a Ph.D. in social science to draw that conclusion.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about the social decay that results from high levels of unemployment, especially when concentrated in some urban areas, understands very well the relationship between high levels of unemployment, the lack of hope it brings with it, and a rise in crime. However, I do not take the view that high levels of unemployment, poverty or social decay excuses crime in any way. The vast majority of people who are unemployed or are living in poor circumstances do not get involved in any way with criminal activity.  Indeed, they are very often the first victims of the criminal activity in which some people engage.</P>
    <P>We have neglected to consider the question of personal responsibility when considering crime.  We need to get back to teaching, from a very early age, young people the difference between right and wrong, accepted standards of behaviour and that anti-social behaviour of one kind or another is simply not permitted.  In our systems of parenting and education the code of good behaviour should be encouraged.  This is necessary because very often we are dealing with the effects <Col N="668" /> of crime rather than its causes and that is the area that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I wish to make specific comment on a number of aspects of the Bill.  If the Minister was so disposed and allowed the Bill to go to a special committee we would have the opportunity of teasing them out in greater detail.  In responding to the Bill the Minister made a point on the concept of riot, that it derives from a set of social circumstances in the United Kingdom where the Thatcher government introduced legislation of this kind in response not so much to criminal behaviour but to curb the rights of people to engage in political or industrial activity.  There are two views of what happened during the miners' strike.  The view I am inclined to accept is that there was a great degree of police provocation and a degree of confrontation that was encouraged by the British Government at that time that gave rise to disturbances on picket lines. I would be cautious about introducing into Irish law concepts and solutions which were designed for a set of circumstances in the United Kingdom which have not arisen here and it appears there is no reason to expect them to arise.</P>
    <P>The second matter I wish to comment on is in regard to surveillance cameras and equipment.  I understand the intention behind this proposal and I can see where it would have a role in the detection of crime.  I offer two observations by way of caution about it.  First, there is the element of big brother or big sister associated with this idea.  It is perfectly understandable that one would want to detect criminal activity but we need to be careful about extending it to cover the normal behaviour of other citizens in order to detect crime.  Second, the provision of surveillance cameras does not necessarily prevent crime: the most recent example was the tragic case of the two year old child in Liverpool whom we could see being abducted on the surveillance cameras.  Certainly, surveillance cameras could be of assistance in detecting who commits a crime but they would not prevent it.  I make those points to caution Members about some provisions of the Bill.  They could be <Col N="669" /> teased out in greater detail if the Minister was disposed to allow it go to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>After unemployment, crime is the single biggest issue affecting this country.  In parts of my constituency the rate of unemployment is running at the very high figure of 72 per cent.  It can be seen that the main reason for the serious increase in crime is that the young people, having seen the abuses and scandals of recent years, are disillusioned and bitter against authority.</P>
      <P>The recent attacks on the elderly must be condemned.  Society has sunk to a new low when nuns are attacked, as happened in Cork recently.  I apologise, on behalf of the people of Cork, to the two elderly nuns in the North Presentation Convent in Gerald Griffin Street for the behaviour of the young thugs who knocked them down.  I hope they are in good health again after their ordeal.  The number of gardaí must be increased.  How can the Garda tackle the problem when the Minister is releasing prisoners from Cork prison, as she has done in the past couple of weeks, before they have completed their sentences?  An all out war must be waged against criminal gangs but how can that be done when the Government is cutting back on Garda overtime?  The prison officers are also being hindered in their task.  The Government must realise that law and order is under threat.  We must tackle the problem of crime head-on. Indeed, much can be said for the former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, and his Government of 1973-77.  We lost the following election on the law and order issue.  I wish we now had law and order here.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that tonight we are discussing the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill as it is a particularly sad time in terms of the criminal justice system, sad because of what happened <Col N="671" /> to the young woman in Kilkenny.  The criminal justice system has yet again taken a severe blow in terms of public confidence.  The recent case follows a series of cases last year, such as the X case and the case of Levinia Kerwick. With the revelation of this case the confidence of women, and men, in the justice system has to be shaken.  It is very serious that people are losing confidence in the criminal justice system.  A society obviously has to have confidence in its system of justice and I fear that has been lost.</P>
      <P>This Bill is clearly an attempt to restore the confidence of the ordinary citizen in the system of justice.  I found during the course of the election campaign that the whole question of crime is a very serious one for the people in my constituency.  I attended a meeting last week of more than 100 people from a flats complex who are extremely concerned because they feel the Garda cannot take effective action to deal with the gangs who are loitering in their hallways.  These are law abiding citizens who feel driven to take action because they feel the Garda are powerless to do so.  These people do not want to take the law into their own hands but feel they might have to.  It is extremely important that we do not allow this to happen.  This Bill would go some way towards dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention a number of other areas where action can be taken, for example, the bail system.  The number of offences committed by persons while on bail was 2,494 in 1990 and 2,690 in 1991.  This is a very serious matter and I suggest to the Minister that the whole question of reform of our bail laws be considered.  The question of whether bail money should perhaps be automatically forfeited if an offence is committed may be worth considering.  Perhaps there should be a constitutional change to give more power to the courts to refuse bail on occasions when that is necessary.  The Minister said the number of gardaí has increased, but I note from a report in <i>Garda News</i> of this month that the figures have gone down since the mid-eighties.  I <Col N="672" /> would ask the Minister what are the correct figures.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that <i>Garda News</i> is incorrect because, according to the report, the Garda are very concerned about this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the area of juvenile justice.  It is outrageous that we are operating under a 1908 Act.  One of the issues intrinsically connected with juvenile crime and gangs loitering on the streets is that of truancy.  It is extremely important that this matter is dealt with sharply and carefully and that we have an overall policy in this regard.  The present policy is not sufficiently detailed.  This should be one of the priorities of the Department of Education because truancy is the high road to juvenile delinquency. This problem will continue unless it is tackled in a coherent way.</P>

      <P>Other speakers have already referred to the Kilkenny case.  I regret very much that since this case was revealed in the media the attention of many of us has been concentrated on the length of the sentence handed down rather than on the more serious questions which the case raises, particularly the history of abuse which goes back so far in the lifetime of the unfortunate individual concerned.  It concerns me that as so many signals appear to have been sent out from this young person from the start indicating that something was seriously and radically wrong in her home, for some strange reason or set of circumstances these signals were not properly picked up so as to deliver this person from the terrible situation in which she found herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> It may well be the case that those in positions of responsibility have become so fearful of getting it wrong and of the consequences that can arise, they are reluctant to move even a small distance in checking out such cases when signs become apparent.  They fear they will suffer inordinately if their fears are without foundation.  While one can understand the rights of everybody in society to be properly judged for his or her actions and those who are innocent to be deemed innocent, nevertheless the time has come for all those who might at some stage be called to assist in circumstances such as these to be trained to a much greater degree so that they will spot much earlier difficulties when they arise.  If something such as this could happen in Kilkenny one can only assume, based on the highlighting of cases of this kind in the last number of years, that this is probably sadly only the tip of the iceberg.  A call must go out to everyone in positions of authority that when matters of this kind come to light action must be taken.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Harney, on bringing forward the Bill at this time.  It gives us an opportunity to debate many serious issues, some of which have been referred to already.  All the speakers I have listened to tonight and last night expressed great concern that the whole question of law and order is going through a change and that there is great turmoil in the community in regard to this whole area. Despite efforts made or good intentions displayed by successive Governments the position seems to be getting worse rather than better, and that is a matter that should concern all of us.  In a debate of this kind we should make a contribution by putting forward suggestions and proposals to enable the community to tackle the problems that are giving rise to great concern.  Undoubtedly the situation is deteriorating for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, are not very long in office and <Col N="674" /> that they have a busy schedule in terms of legislation relating to that Department but I hope that this matter will become a top priority in the Department.</P>
    <P>The legislation covers a fairly broad range of issues on which I will touch a little later.  We all have experiences to which certain sections of the Bill relate.  I hope the experience gained by the Minister for Justice and her Minister of State will help to galvanise activity in the Department of Justice so that essential legislation will be enacted without delay.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the Juvenile Justice Bill which has been promised by successive Governments now for 20 years.  In my short time in the Department of Health I had some responsibility for the provision of services in the juvenile justice area.  I read the history of the Juvenile Justice Bill and I found that no Department was very keen to bring forward a Juvenile Justice Bill because Departments did not want to be involved in devising legislation for children in this area.  That was unfortunate. However, by the time I left, that responsibility had been, for the first time, taken up by the Department of Justice. That might surprise some listeners.  I very much regret that the commitment given to bringing forward this legislation at the end of 1992 was for a variety of reasons not honoured.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State here to act quickly in this area because, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, it very much impinges on the subject matter of this Bill and on the report from the Committee on Crime which we will be discussing on Friday next.  The committee was chaired by Deputy Quill and produced an excellent report.  Permeating that report is the insistence that the Juvenile Justice Bill should be brought forward as quickly as possible to introduce a variety of mechanisms to deal with the juvenile crime area with which it is simply impossible to deal under the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>We all know that the people we represent demand that legislation in this area should be modernised.  There are complex issues involved which have not been <Col N="675" /> adequately tackled up to now.  The time needed to introduce the sort of legislation required to alleviate the difficulties is running out.  We could have the best of legislation, but it would be pointless without the necessary resources to give effect to it.  Lack of resources has contributed to the deterioration in law and order.  I understand that times are difficult and resources are scarce, but, in purely economic terms it is foolish to try to develop our tourism industry and spend a great deal in developing tourist facilities and on marketing abroad if two or three highlighted incidents of tourists suffering the consequences of crime can have a negative effect on that.  If resources are scarce, we need to get our priorities right and first allocate adequate resources to give effect to criminal justice legislation so that the Garda, social workers, educationists and health workers have the resources to tackle the problems in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>We must be honest in approaching this area and acknowledge that for too long the courts have been slow in dealing with cases.  There has been a consistent complaint from the community that identified offenders, particularly young offenders, are brought before the courts and are then allowed out on bail for a considerable length of time.  There is a need for additional resources there.  This would help to support any new legislation brought forward.</P>
    <P>The condition of courthouses throughout the country has been consistently highlighted in this Chamber and by justices around the country.  The physical structures to discharge the responsibilities of the courts are not there.  In Tallaght for instance, with almost 100,000 people, we do not have a courthouse because the Department of Justice says it is the responsibility of the local authority and the local authority says it does not have the money and that therefore it is really the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  There have been improvements to courthouses, but many of them leave a lot to be desired. <Col N="676" /> This problem should be properly addressed.</P>
    <P>We might be inclined to be encouraged from time to time by reports in the media from the Garda Commissioner or superintendents in relation to a fall in the crime rate.  People are pleased that the crime rate has gone down by 2 per cent in one area, 3 per cent in another or 10 per cent in another, but I do not believe a word of it.  Many people affected by crime in more recent times simply do not report the crimes.  I am referring to crimes of burglary, theft from cars, interference with persons generally and acts of that kind.  These crimes are not reported because Garda resources are so stretched that gardaí deal with the more serious crimes first and the minor crimes later. The ordinary person feels that he will not get the response to which he feels entitled and he just does not bother any more. Many individuals affected by crime on a number of occasions have given up.  That is why it might be perceived from time to time that the crime rate has fallen.  It is not fair to blame the Garda Síochána on the basis that they perhaps do not organise their responses to calls more efficiently.  It is generally the case that they simply have not the capacity to respond.  They are being unfairly blamed by the community and that militates against the ability of the Garda to be welcomed in all communities and to receive the support and co-operation of the community at large in discharging their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Sometimes gardaí have found that in certain areas they are unable to move freely and those situations have been highlighted for all of us.  It is very sad that gardaí should find themselves coming under such intense obstruction in discharging their duties.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, her advisers and other personnel in the Department of Justice and those working with the Garda Commissioner to bring about change.  For too long, unlike in the past, gardaí have tended to be isolated within their communities.  The more isolated the gardaí are from the community the more difficult it is for the community <Col N="677" /> and the gardaí to act in a coherent fashion and for that reason it is necessary to put in place formal structures to allow gardaí to interact with local communities.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with the neighbourhood watch scheme with the neighbourhood gardaí schemes, which are excellent schemes, but the linkage between gardaí and the community at parish level is very weak.  The interaction between local communities and the gardaí depends to some extent on the good offices of the superintendents.  It is important that some structure be put in place whereby gardaí will interact far more closely with local organisations, community organisations, local elected representatives and other statutory agencies working in particular areas.  That has happened in one or two places, particularly in west County Dublin where there was major social crisis, and it has worked very well.  It has been attempted in other areas and there have been beneficial results from such interaction.  The procedure for dealing with the problem is not formally structured on a national basis and I would ask the Minister of State to consider this and not just rule it out.  Once the issues are raised and the resources are in place, enlisting the support of the community is the only effective way to deal with problems of the type dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In urban areas there are serious issues which must be addressed urgently and this Bill attempts to do that.  It highlights a few positive measures and regardless of the destiny of this Bill I would like to see those measures included in any legislation brought forward by the Minister for Justice.  Other speakers have referred to the situation where old people are essentially prisoners in their own humble abodes because of the activities of anti-social elements near their homes, in the streets, or in the parks at the end of their roads.  That is a very unfortunate situation and it has been prevalent for some time.  The problem has been highlighted by Members on all sides of the House over the last number of years and we still have not been able to come to grips with it.  We have not been able to <Col N="678" /> give the Garda the powers they need to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to provide powers in legislation whereby when a crime is committed the gardaí can move in and bring the person alleged to have committed the crime to the station, carry out their investigations and so on.  However, in cases where a crime is not committed, the suggestion permeating different reports that I have read is that these problems have not been addressed but nevertheless they are just as serious for certain vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The question of intimidation is beginning to rear its ugly head here and I will refer to one or two instances in the time available to me.  There is the group, a small percentage of the population of young people, who congregate outside old people's homes.  They do not actually break the law, but they can have a very intimidating effect on the elderly person who is unable and does not have the strength to cope with the general horseplay that goes on among young people and with which we are familiar.  That can be very intimidating for old people who may have worked all their lives here, having reared their families and may now be living alone.  They may be a widow, widower or an elderly couple.  To be ending the last years of their lives in such circumstances is unforgiveable and it is up to us, as legislators, to deal with this problem now.  There is no point in saying to an elderly person we are going to introduce this legislation but it will be two or three years before it makes a difference to your way of life.</P>
    <P>Communities may decide that they do not want a particular type of person living in their community.  Under the Constitution they have no right to attempt to drive such a person out of their lawful home, but when 50, 100 or 200 people gather on the roadside outside a particular house, where there is a family legally and properly ensconced it is very difficult for that family not to feel so threatened and intimidated that they have to leave the house.  Sadly, that has happened on a number of occasions in <Col N="679" /> my constituency during my time as a Dáil representative.  Under existing legislation gardaí will be present simply to keep the peace, but there is not much peace for the family in the house, including the children who are exposed to this mass intimidation.  Any legislation that is brought forward, and I understand Deputy Harney plans to include it in this Bill, must take account of that fact and it is no longer good enough for the gardaí to say nobody is breaking the law and to allow 200 people park outside a person's home because they do not believe that person should be allocated that particular house.  That is not acceptable.  It is clear from section 1 that it may be Deputy Harney's intention to deal with this type of problem and others of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 5, I would express a note of caution with regard to the interpretation of that section.  If enacted its interpretation may give rise to problems. There have been cases where it has been left to the gardaí to interpret sections of Acts to act accordingly.  Unfortunately, that does not always correspond with what local communities think gardaí should do.</P>
    <P>In my view, section 5 is defective. There is a scenario whereby the parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas causes great annoyance to people who subsequently report this matter to the Garda.  The Garda can move these vehicles only if, in their opinion, they are parked dangerously.  The view of the local community may be that the vehicle is dangerously parked in that a young person may run out from behind it and may be knocked down by an oncoming vehicle.  The gardaí interpreting the legislation available to them may say the vehicle is not parked dangerously.  That is the reason we have to be particularly careful when we are including any section similar to section 5 so that in so far as interpretations are concerned they are set down very firmly in order that people are not disappointed by what may turn out to be weak legislation rather than legislation intended to achieve a great deal of good.  The final point I wish to <Col N="680" /> make relates to prohibition orders.  There is reference in section 9 to prohibition orders.  All of us who have served on local authorities will know how weak a prohibition order can be when it comes to its implementation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tramore (Waterford) Sewage Treatment Plant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to take the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment because of my deep concerns about the decision to locate the outfall pipe from the proposed new sewage treatment plant at Tramore in the Rinnashark channel on Saleen Beach, and I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity. I feel that a terrible mistake is being made and that the time to do something about it is now before it becomes too late.  If not, I very much fear that I will be coming back to the Minister at some stage in the future and saying to him &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; and I certainly do not want that to happen.</P>
      <P>In order to try to understand why the present proposal causes such a problem one has to know what is actually in this area.  The Tramore sandhills have been building up over the past centuries as a result of the sand being carried in by the prevailing winds and onshore currents. With the Back Strand, this area has been recognised as being of national importance as a conservation area and several rare plants are stated to be present there.  According to local knowledge, a mass grave used to bury the dead from the 1816 shipwreck of the <i>Seahorse</i> is situated in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Back Strand is a large low lying area which lies to the north of the main beach and is completely covered at high tide.  It has a delicately balanced ecology containing flora and fauna of significance. It is included in the Irish and European Commission inventories of bird sites in Ireland.  The Office of Public Works have <Col N="681" /> requested the agreement of Waterford County Council to agree to its designation as a nature reserve.</P>
    <P>The sand hills and the Back Strand are an internationally and nationally important area of scientific interest.  The ecological system of the area is so finely balanced that any tampering would destroy the natural habitat of important feeding grounds of migrant birds.  It is an EC Directive that by 1993 all sensitive areas be protected.  This area falls into that category.</P>
    <P>Under the EC Birds Directive member states are obliged to designate a network of special protection areas in which endangered rare and migratory birds and their habitats are protected.  However, the Birds Directive also indicates that other means of protecting populations are necessary.  I understand that the European Commission in April 1991 commenced infringement proceedings against Ireland under Article 4 of the Birds Directive for its failure to take adequate measures to protect the habitat of the wild birds at Tramore Back Strand.</P>
    <P>When I say that this is also an area of archaeological interest Members will realise how important it is that this area be preserved.  I am very much afraid that if this present proposal does go ahead, all of this will be ruined.</P>
    <P>At present raw sewage is discharged totally untreated into Tramore Bay 300 metres from the shore.  Despite this, fortnightly monitoring of the water since 1978 has shown the water quality consistently meeting both the Irish and the EC mandatory maximum levels for faecal coliforms.  The beach environment is in very good condition despite this discharge. I cannot understand why this present pipe cannot be extended to either 1500 metres or 2000 metres offshore where the discharge would be easily dispersed. One of the arguments used by the consultants against the bay outfall was that it could be damaged by boats trawling the area or ships being blown into the bay during storms.  I have checked with fishermen in Dunmore East and they tell me that this is nonsense. Another reason put forward was the <Col N="682" /> costs involved.  I cannot understand how laying a pipe on the seabed could be more costly than what is proposed.</P>
    <P>The proposal at present is to run a new pipe for four kilometres from the new treatment plant to the discharge point.  It will also be necessary to construct some sort of a holding tank because it is planned that effluent will only be discharged on an outgoing tide.  I fail to see how this could be cheaper than what I am suggesting, but in any event I do not think it will work.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant points to come out of the report as prepared by the consultants for Waterford County Council is that no results were available for periods when southerly or southwesterly winds were blowing.  One wonders if this biased approach is totally contrary to the concept of the environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>What happens in the event of the malfunction of the treatment plant?  This apparently is not uncommon.  In that instance raw sewage would be pumped into the channel and on the floodtide would return to the Back Strand where it would cause immense damage to the shellfish population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I am aware that an ecologist and an archaeologist will be employed during the pipe laying operation, but will they have any real power?  Rehabilitation work could be very costly and perhaps at the end of the day the location I am suggesting would have to be utilised.  Suppose a major archaeological site is encountered or the mass grave from the <i>Seahorse</i> disaster was exposed, what would happen then? I also believe there is a problem with the Department of the Marine who are refusing to issue a discharge licence to Waterford County Council at the proposed site.  For these reasons I implore the Minister to examine the situation again and please change the decision made before it is too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tramore sewerage scheme is one of a new generation of coastal waste treatment facilities envisaged in the Government's Environmental Action Programme.  Earlier practice was to discharge untreated wastes into the sea and to rely on natural dilution and turbulence to disperse these wastes.  That thinking has radically changed.  The marine environment must not be subjected to indiscriminate waste loads.  We and our EC partners are committed to suitable treatment of all discharges to the sea and to completing the necessary programme of works within a definite time period.</P>
      <P>There is another feature of recent major sanitary services schemes, including the Tramore one, which is also new. Previously sanitary services schemes were planned between local authorities and my Department without any element of consultation with the public.  Since 1990 that too has changed.  Waste water treatment plants with a capacity greater than 10,000 population equivalent must now be subjected to full environmental impact assessment.  This involves the commissioning by the local authority of a comprehensive environmental impact statement, an invitation to the public to make comments and observations on this, and an assessment by the Minister for the Environment both of the EIS and the public comments and submissions. This EIA procedure was carefully followed in the Tramore case.</P>
      <P>In accordance with statutory requirements Waterford County Council carried out an environmental impact study on the proposed scheme.  This study was made available to all those who wished to make submissions or observations within the prescribed one month period.  A number of submissions were received within this period and these together with the study report were subject to a detailed evaluation and assessment in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed scheme provides for the construction of secondary treatment facilities sized to cater for a high season population of 15,000.  It is intended that the final treated effluent will be transferred <Col N="684" /> via a pipeline along the back of the sand dunes to discharge at Rinneshark.</P>
    <P>Three outfall options were examined: a short outfall to Tramore Back Strand area; a long sea outfall due south of the beach into Tramore Bay with a continuous discharge of effluent; and an intermittent discharge outfall at Rinneshark. The option to discharge effluent directly to the Back Strand waters was not considered prudent owing to the stillness of the water in the Back Strand and the potential increase of nutrients in the area.</P>
    <P>Effluent dispersal modelling was carried out in relation to the long sea and intermittent discharge options.  It should be noted that in all cases the model was assessing the &ldquo;worst case&rdquo; scenario. From this modelling and marine survey results, it was concluded that the intermittent discharge at Rinneshark is the most suitable.</P>
    <P>This option provides for effluent to be discharged on the outgoing tide and thus would have minimal effect on water quality, given that this location provides a fast flowing body of water on the ebb tide and thus allows for good dispersion and rapid dilution.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the final effluent will be clear and free from solids and other nuisances.  An analysis of the final effluent before discharge shows that the bacteria content will be reduced by 99 per cent following the treatment process compared to the present arrangement.</P>
    <P>Having assessed the EIS and all submissions made within the prescribed period, I certified on 14 December 1992 that, subject to two modifications which I prescribed, the proposed scheme would not, in my opinion, have significant adverse effects on the environment.  The modifications relate to relocation of the sludge dewatering building and incorporation of odour controls, and to the construction of the stage 1 treatment unit in the stage 2 location.  These modifications address some of the main points made in submissions from the public.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns now expressed by Deputy Kenneally and others about the outfall arrangements for this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I do not fully understand why so many interests who are now focusing activity on this scheme did not participate in the statutory consultation provided last year under the EIA process.  I am bound by the statutory requirements of that process and I have determined the issues involved carefully and with full regard for all environmental implications.  I would urge Deputy Kenneally, and others, to accept this position and to rest assured that the new sewerage scheme will enhance and not endanger the marine environment of Tramore.  The total cost of the scheme will be approximately £4.5 million.  The proposals by Deputy Kenneally, which the EIS assessment does not envisage as necessary, would unquestionably add approximately £2 million to the cost.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to the terms of reference of the inquiry into the case of the woman whose father was convicted of rape and incest in the Central Criminal Court on Monday, 1 March 1993.  I might say here that Deputy Nora Owen gave me notice of her intention to raise the matter as to the incest case in County Kilkenny which <Col N="686" /> has shocked the whole country and the proposals, if any, which the Minister for Health has to ensure that health workers, care workers and school authorities are trained and equipped to identify and assist in the early detection and treatment of such cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. There is a need for the most comprehensive inquiry to be conducted into the circumstances surrounding this very sad and tragic case.  The full detailed history of the hospitalisation of this tragic victim of incest and physical assault must be detailed and an examination conducted into whether her medical history should have resulted in those who came into contact with her investigating her plight at an early stage.  Serious questions must be asked as to why action was not taken many years ago to afford essential protection to this young woman when she presented as a pregnant girl of 15 years of age.  The claims made by her that she informed a social worker or social workers of her difficulties and that no action was taken must also be given very serious consideration and investigated fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should &mdash; and I hope he will tonight &mdash; publish the detailed terms of reference under which an inquiry is to be conducted and state the name of the person or persons who will conduct such an inquiry.  Such an inquiry should be conducted by a person who is independent of the health board whose activities <Col N="687" /> will come under investigation.  The full results of such an inquiry should be published, as should any new guidelines which are required to ensure that where persons are victims of incest, sexual abuse or sexual assault in the home earlier protective action is taken than was taken in this very sad and tragic case.</P>
    <P>It seems that currently there are conflicting legal views as to the length of prison sentence the judge could impose in this case.  The vast majority of people would regard the sentence of seven years imposed as too lenient.  It is clear that under section 1 of the Prevention of Incest Act, 1908, that this is the maximum sentence.  However, it is arguable that a sentence of life imprisonment could have been imposed under other legal provisions.  It should not be left to future court decisions in other tragic cases to clarify the position.  In cases as grave and as serious as this one the Judiciary should be able to impose sentences of up to a maximum of 20 years and there should be no uncertainty as to the possible sentence.  In this context I ask the Government, and the Minister, to support the Fine Gael Prevention of Incest (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which I moved in the House this morning.  I also hope this Bill will not be regarded as contentious and that it will receive the support of all sides of this House and be enacted into law.  I hope, in detailing the position in regard to the inquiry, the Minister will state when a full report is anticipated.  This inquiry must be conducted in a comprehensive manner and with a reasonable degree of speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The revulsion and horror which has swept the country at the details of the Kilkenny incest case, and the brutality and torment suffered by this young woman at the hands of her father must not be allowed to take from the necessary lessons we must learn from this case.  The tears I and many others shed as we read the horrific details of this case were tears of sympathy for this young woman and for her mother who must have suffered greatly as she watched her daughter suffering <Col N="688" /> and who was herself oppressed. They were also tears of frustration and anger that these horrors can still be perpetrated against an innocent young woman in our society in the nineties.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to ensure that every element of the case is fully examined in his inquiry.  He must ensure that the roles of the health board, the health care workers, the local doctor or doctors who saw this young woman, the hospital staff who saw the injuries, the Garda who highlight such cases &mdash; here I should like to pay tribute to Garda Agnes Reddy whose vigilance and doggedness appears to have brought the case to light &mdash; and the school authorities at the school attended by this girl are examined.  Those elements must be examined not so much to apportion blame &mdash; nevertheless blame must be apportioned if it is there &mdash; but to ensure that this type of case never happens again.</P>
      <P>I regret, as is widely known, and we know from our work, this is not an isolated case &mdash; and similar cases will come before the courts in the coming months. I call on the Minister to implement all the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.  While these provisions will not assist this young woman they will certainly help to ensure that such horrific cases do not continue to occur in our society.  The Rape Crisis Centre say they are inundated with requests for training and guidance from people running childcare and creche facilities who are concerned to identify abused children but are terrified lest should they identify such abuse they will not have the necessary skills to deal with such problems.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to assure the House that there will be no shortage of resources to put in place any changes required in our system arising out of the inquiry such as proper training schemes for doctors, health care workers and school authorities and that, irrespective of any other cutback such a commitment will not be abandoned by the Government.</P>

One of the most disturbing features of the case, as described by the victim herself, was the description of her neighbour's reaction to her plight.  I wish to put this case in a slightly broader perspective.</P>
      <P>I am afraid this case forces us to ask some very uncomfortable questions about ourselves.  We are horrified as a society by this crime, yet there is a deep ambivalence in Ireland to anything that is seen as an attempt to interfere with the family.  We have a tendency to idealise the family.  We must ask ourselves if we are prepared to stand up and be counted on this issue.  I do not think we yet want to believe that such horrific crimes can take place in our midst and within the families.  The courage of this young woman in speaking out last night, and the courage of Lavinia Kerwick last year, and the Minister's inquiry could do much to turn the tide of this issue. We still have a tendency to deny that these things can happen in our society.</P>
      <P>Child care is one of the most neglected areas of policy here.  We are paying the price for this now.  This will go on unless we take some action.  I would point out to the Minister that only 17 out of the 74 sections of the Child Care Act have been implemented.  Is this what the Dáil intended when its legislation was passed? I ask the Minister to implement the remaining provisions of this Act and to also implement some pilot projects so that family support services can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry is important but it is also extremely important that no one professional group is made the scapegoat.  I ask the Minister to consider what administrative back-up was supplied to the people who had contact with this woman to deal with cases of child sexual abuse. What in-service training was available? What legal support did they have?  What supervision was available?  We must face up to what is happening to front line staff.  I have experience of working with teachers who are very keen to take action in this area but are concerned about interfering with the rights of the family.  It is extremely important that principals of <Col N="690" /> schools and boards of management adopt policies on how to handle child sexual abuse.  The same applies to all other professional groups who have contact with children in such situations.</P>
    <P>I note that in the budget there was no mention of funding for Women's Aid or Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country.  If such services had been available in this woman's home area some of this suffering could have been prevented and a stop might have been put to it.</P>
    <P>I stress that this is not an isolated case. There are many victims of child sexual abuse.  We must continue to break the silence.  We must ensure that they get adequate help and that everyone in society &mdash; parents, teachers, professionals&mdash;is alert to child sexual abuse. The suffering and pain caused to adults and children by non-intervention is horrific. I look forward to hearing in the very near future the results of the Minister's inquiry and I hope it will begin to break the vicious cycle I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely horrified at the appailing abuse suffered by the young woman.  I am shocked that she was subjected to the most degrading and inhumane ill-treatment and abuse over such a long period of time.  I share the widespread anger and revulsion which has been expressed about the case and my heart goes out to the unfortunate victim.  Everyone who watched last night's television interview with her has been deeply upset by her harrowing account of the dreadful suffering she endured.  I watched it in the Dáil studio and I was weakened by the experience.</P>
      <P>I have directed the South-Eastern Health Board to carry out an immediate investigation of the circumstances of this tragic case in so far as the health services are concerned and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the investigation team are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;to carry out an investigation, in so far as the health services are concerned, <Col N="691" /> of the circumstances surrounding the abuse referred to in the case heard in the Circuit Criminal Court on 1 March 1993; in particular to establish why action to halt the abuse was not taken earlier, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of cases of suspected child abuse.</P>
    <P>An investigation team is being appointed by the South Eastern Health Board in response to my direction.  This will be headed by Catherine McGuinness, S.C. who will be assisted by a senior official of the South Eastern Health Board and a director of community care and medical officer of health and a senior social worker, both of whom will come from another health board area.  Contact is presently being made with the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>The terrifying sexual abuse suffered as a child by the young woman happened at a time when the existence of child sexual abuse was not even publicly acknowledged. For example, the Task Force on Child Care Services which reported in 1980 made scant reference to the incidence of incest and other forms of sexual abuse against vulnerable children. This task force was composed of a number of experts in child care and its report focused on what were the major issues of the time.</P>
    <P>I make this point not in any way to denigrate the excellent work undertaken by that task force but to illustrate the lack of awareness of child sexual abuse at the time.  Since then we have all become far more conscious of the nature and scale of this problem.  A number of important initiatives have taken place since the mid 1980s when our awareness of child abuse, and particularly child sexual abuse, began to increase dramatically.</P>
    <P>In response to the increase in the reports of child sexual abuse, my Department revised its child abuse guidelines to include specific reference to child sexual abuse.  These guidelines were specifically designed to provide guidance for those <Col N="692" /> who are likely to be professionally concerned with any form of child abuse. They spell out clearly the respective responsibilities of and the steps to be taken by the key personnel involved in the identification, investigation and management of suspected cases.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area units for the investigation and management of alleged child sexual abuse were established early in 1988 at Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  During the same year a special allocation was made to each of the other seven health boards to enable them to establish appropriate services in their areas.  Services are now in place in each health board area; some of them are based in a particular hospital in the region while others are provided on a community basis.  I might mention that in the South Eastern Health Board area there is now a regional child abuse unit based in Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education, for its part, has circulated guidelines to schools setting out procedures for dealing with suspected cases of child abuse that come to light within the school setting.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that my Department is currently preparing, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, new guidelines for health boards and the gardaí on a co-ordinated approach to the investigation of suspected cases of child abuse.  These new guidelines will focus specifically on the need for greater co-operation between the key personnel involved from both authorities in order to ensure the protection of the child as well as facilitating the full investigation of any crime.</P>
    <P>Apart from the continuing process of refining procedures for the identification and investigation of child abuse cases, it is also of the utmost importance to develop programmes aimed at preventing the incidence of all forms of child abuse.  In this context I would like to refer to the child abuse prevention programme known as the &ldquo;Stay Safe Programme&rdquo;, which is currently being implemented in primary schools around the country with <Col N="693" /> the active support of my Department, the Department of Education and the health boards.  I had occasion to meet some of the people involved in my own area a fortnight ago and I am very impressed by the degree of penetration we have got already and the degree of support from parents and school authorities for this programme.  The aim of the programme is to prevent all forms of child abuse, including bullying, by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are then taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with parents.  This approach increases community awareness and makes children less vulnerable to abuse of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The response of parents, teachers and children to the programme has been very positive.  The programme has also fostered good working relationships between teachers and members of the local health board community care teams.  This has resulted in better co-operation and co-ordination at local level between the main statutory authorities concerned with the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>While primary responsibility for investigating allegations of child abuse rests with the professionals, I would like to think that the public at large would play its part by assisting persons such as the unfortunate girl at the centre of this case if and when they become aware of difficulties of this sort.  I would like to assure the House that I am concerned to ensure that every measure possible is taken to prevent a recurrence of what happened in this case.  Towards this end I will be discussing the matter with the chief executive officers of the eight health boards when I meet them this week and early next week.  In particular I will be stressing the necessity to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are in place in their areas for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Child Care Act and people will know of my interest and involvement in the passing of that Act over many years.  Seventeen <Col N="694" /> sections have become law and I am most anxious that the remainder should become law as soon as possible.  There is a number of technical requirements, including a range of complicated and inter-related regulations, that need to be worked out.  I will be having discussions with the officials in my Department to see how quickly that can be done.</P>
    <P>In the light of consultations and the results of the investigation being carried out by the South-Eastern Health Board and the investigation team they have appointed I shall be reporting to Government at an early date and I hope to give a timeframe to the House in the region of four weeks for the investigation to be concluded.  Whatever recommendations come to me I will bring to Government and the necessary measures and procedures will be taken to deal with cases of child abuse to ensure that cases like this do not recur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the present Minister for Social Welfare is a concerned man who is willing to listen to representations from Dáil Deputies, to hear about problems and to act on them where possible.  I believe also that the Department of Social Welfare is, broadly speaking, an efficient organisation.  The section that I know best, the pensions section down in Sligo, is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, therefore, very surprised, indeed very disappointed, that after nearly six months no action has been taken to give their dues to pensioners affected by the fall in the value of sterling.  These are a special kind of old age and widowed pensioner with part British and part Irish pensions.  Because of immigration and migration there are very many of them <Col N="695" /> all over Sligo and Leitrim and, as my colleague, Deputy McGinley, tells me, there are even more in County Donegal. They are all over the west, as the Minister knows.</P>
    <P>Because of the decline in the value of sterling against the IR£1 these pensioners are losing heavily since last October, some of them as much as £20 a month, some even more.  I have pleaded their case in the Dáil here by way of question and by way of special debate.  I have written to the Minister.  I have appealed for something to be done, but have got no action.  No compensation has been given to the pensioners.</P>
    <P>First we are told that the adjustment cannot be made except on a three monthly basis in order to get the appropriate average.  Three months passed but there was no readjustment for the pensioners. Then we were told that if the individual pensioners wrote in they would be looked after.  They are writing in, they are asking for it and they are not getting results.  I have been in contact as recently as today and they are not getting results.  The reason is that the Department was not able to do anything because there has been no decision about what the new rates will be.  These people are told to wait until the decision has been made. However, the pensioners cannot afford to wait.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that hardship &mdash; and it is very real hardship &mdash; is being inflicted by the failure to act.  The pensioners are entitled to their money and they are entitled to back money.  It is of no use to tell them to go and get supplementary welfare; that is not the answer.  They are entitled to this money.  Surely it is not beyond the capability of the Department to make a decision on the rates to be given and to pay up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>People in receipt of pensions from the United Kingdom can experience gains or losses in the IR£1 terms with changes in the UK/Irish exchange rate. The deterioration in the value of sterling in recent months has meant that the advantage previously enjoyed by these pensioners when the IR£1 was below <Col N="696" /> parity with sterling has been eroded.  The recent 10 per cent devaluation of the IR£1 will restore the situation for these people because it will again increase the value in Irish pounds of pensions payable from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I have directed my Department to keep the average exchange rate used in determining the means for people receiving UK pensions under review in the present circumstances.  A person who is in receipt of a UK retirement pension may also be entitled, if aged over 66, to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department.  The UK pension would count as means for this purpose converted to Irish pounds by reference to an average exchange rate used by my Department.  The average exchange rate used is that when calculating means based on EC pensions the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism used within the European Community in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.  It is a cross-Community relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We are all members of the European Community now.  I know there was no problem when the benefit was there.  Likewise, things are different now, but anyone who falls below the levels for our non-contributory pensions will be entitled to an adjustment in relation to our non-contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>A UK pensioner who is in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension and whose means have dropped as a result is entitled to a review on request of his or her means assessment.  Other people in receipt of UK pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size may contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
      <P>That is the position.  I have directed my Department to check the position in the light of the Deputy's grievance and that will be done.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 March 1993.</P>

    <P>The future disposal of cutaway bog <Col N="528" /> was the subject of a report which was published in January 1992.  The recommendations in the report which relate to my area of responsibility have been implemented.  Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that small farmers are facilitated in competing for cutaway bog suitable for conversion to grassland. Specifically such land will, where possible, be disposed of in small lots.  The other main recommendation was that Coillte Teoranta should no longer have first option on cutaway suitable for afforestation. Such lands are now offered for sale on the open market.  This enables private forestry concerns to compete with Coillte Teoranta on an equal basis.  The report made a number of recommendations in relation to the amenity, environmental and development potential of cutaway bogs.  These are not areas where I have a function as Minister but I would welcome any initiative which would exploit that potential.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna has sufficient reserves of peat to last for the next 30 to 40 years.  The Government strongly believes that peat should continue to provide a significant part of our energy requirements as long as reserves last and provided they can be exploited at reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report was very criticial of the cost burden which peat places on the shoulders of electricity consumers and I am very anxious to see this implicit subsidy reduced, and ultimately eliminated. This will require continued efforts within Bord na Móna to achieve cost savings and productivity improvements, building further on the achievements of recent years.</P>
      <P>The board is currently carrying out a feasibility study for a new peat fired electricity generating station.  If the project is feasible, it will be a major contributor in the drive to improve Bord na Móna's financial situation and to reduce the cost of peat-generated electricity.  It will also help ensure that the remaining peat reserves will be fully developed and will help to sustain levels of employment. The study will be submitted to my Department at the end of May, 1993.</P>

The raising of the upper age limits for these competitions in 1991 &mdash; the maximum age for most competitions is now 50 &mdash; has facilitated the return of married women to the Civil Service by this means.</P>
      <P>The other means by which married women may return to the service is provided for in Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.  Under these provisions, a woman who resigned from the Civil Service for the purposes of, on or following marriage, may seek reinstatement to her former position if she is a widow, if she did not marry or if she can establish to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she is not being supported by her husband.  This is the only statutory authority for the reinstatement of women to their former positions and it was clearly intended as a limited exception to the general rule that entry to the service is by way of open competition only.  The statute is quite specific regarding the criteria that have to be fulfilled in order to qualify for reinstatement &mdash; to that extent, the intention and the requirements of the statute limit the provision to specific categories of women.  In the past five years over 120 married women qualified for reinstatement in the Civil Service under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain aspects of the provisions governing reinstatement have been challenged <Col N="543" /> by the Employment Equality Agency and the matter is under appeal in the Labour Court following a recommendation by an Equality Officer in favour of the complainant.  The Labour Court has not yet issued its recommendation on the appeal.  When the Labour Court's recommendation becomes available my Department will examine the implications and take any action that may be necessary.</P>

      <Quest>the total foreign borrowing of the Exchequer, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency between 1 September 1992 and 31 January 1993; and the additional costs of the repayment of this borrowing arising from the devaluation.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, which undertakes borrowing on behalf of the Exchequer, that between 1 September 1992 and 31 January 1993 an additional £2,042 million in foreign currency was borrowed.  This figure includes a net repayment of £10 million by the Exchequer to the European Investment Bank.  Based on the opening exchange rates as of 1 February 1993 the value of this additional foreign currency borrowing was increased by £170 million as a result of the devaluation of the Irish pound.  As the Deputy will appreciate the amount actually repaid in Irish pounds will depend on the exchange rate on the dates of repayment.  In this context the Deputy may wish to note that the vast bulk of the additional borrowing has a maturity of between five to ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Central Bank that the liability to the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF) at end December was £716 million.  The Bank has further informed me that the EMCF Debtor Position at end-January is market sensitive information which will be released by the Bank simultaneously to market participants tomorrow.  The <Col N="544" /> official ECU/Irish pound rate was at 1.34526 at end-January and 1.25363 on 1 February.  This would indicate that the value of any EMCF debt outstanding at end-January would be 7.3 per cent greater on 1 February than it was at end-January. The actual additional cost on repayment of any such borrowing would of course depend on the official ECU/Irish pound rate on the date of repayment.</P>

      <P>The Government's income tax priorities are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The achievement of these aims will result in further significant benefits to all taxpayers.  A particular priority is to improve the position of the low-paid, especially families.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce income tax relief on payments made by working parents in respect of child care facilities. I would point out that an income tax relief would, of its nature, be of most benefit to taxpayers on higher incomes.</P>
      <P>The focus of income tax changes in recent years has been on reducing the income tax burden for taxpayers generally and on making special provision for low-paid taxpayers through the tax exemption limits.  As the Deputy will be aware, substantial progress has been made in these areas: the standard rate of income tax has been reduced to 27 per cent and the top rate to 48 per cent, the standard rate band has been widened by more than 60 per cent, there have been substantial increases in the exemption limits and a child addition to those limits was introduced which was further increased this year.  Lower-paid taxpayers with children have had their position significantly improved by these measures irrespective of the manner in which the family income arose.  The 1993 budget proposals again gave them priority.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the PRSI exemption scheme is to encourage employers to recruit additional employees, who would otherwise be unemployed.  Qualifying employees must have been on the live register for at least 13 weeks, must represent a net increase in the employer's workforce and be recruited during the period from the 19th October 1992 to the 19th March 1993.  This approach is in line with practice on previous occasions when the Employers' PRSI exemption scheme operated.  A condition of live register attachment of at least this duration also applies to most employment schemes operated by FÁS.  This scheme is due to expire shortly and I am having its operation examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals for local government reform are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. As part of the first phase of implementation, the following have already been laid before both Houses:</P>
      <P>Local Authority Reserved Functions: Recommendations of Working Group.</P>
      <P>Local Government Act, 1991 (Reserved Functions) Order, 1993 (S.I. No. 37 of 1993).</P>
      <P>Dublin (Preparations for Reorganisation) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 52 of 1993).</P>
      <P>Draft Regulations entitled &mdash; Local Government Act, 1991, (Removal of Controls) Regulations, 1993 &mdash; and a motion seeking the approval of same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> The preparation of proposals for the establishment of regional authorities is at an advanced stage.  Work is also in hands on a Bill to establish the new county councils in Dublin (Fingal; South Dublin; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown) and on a Bill to modernise local government law generally; the latter will confer wide by-law making powers; up date the law on local authority meetings and procedures, remove unnecessary controls; modernise and consolidate other aspects of local government law including the law on the acquisition and disposal of land; and generally to allow for greater local autonomy. A Road Traffic Bill, now at an advanced stage of preparation, will also reflect a significant move in the direction of increased local autonomy.</P>
    <P>Elections at the sub-county level will be held in 1994 in tandem with the elections to the European Parliament.  In the meantime, a ministerial committee is considering reform at sub-county level, taking account of the various issues involved including local finance and devolution of additional functions to local authorities.  Any alterations in the structure, status, role, areas, powers, functions or staffing of existing local authorities at sub-county level falls to be considered in this context; these issues must await completion of the review now underway, decisions by the Government as to future arrangements, and the enactment of such legislation as may be necessary.</P>

I should also point out that under the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, only one pay increase can be pursued on behalf of any grade of staff.  The workers in the cleansing section form part of the general body of workers in Dublin Corporation who already have a claim before the Labour Court for an increase in their eating-on-site allowance.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid suckler cow grants for the years 1980 to 1984.  It was subsequently established that he had an off-farm occupation which he did not include in his application for those years.  His off-farm income exceeded 50 per cent of his total income for the years 1981 and 1982 and he was, therefore, not eligible for payments in those two years.  As a result grants due to him in respect of the 1989 suckler cow scheme and part of the grants due under the 1991 suckler cow scheme have been offset against the overpayments made in 1981 and 1982. The balance of grants due under the 1991 suckler cow scheme and grants due under the 1985 to 1987 calf premium schemes are also being withheld against possible overpayments under the suckler cow schemes 1985 to 1988.</P>
      <P>A decision on the applicant's eligibility under the suckler cow schemes 1980 and 1983 to 1988 cannot be reached until tax assessments in respect of total income during those years are submitted by the applicant.  He has been requested to submit these documents on a number of occasions but has not done so.  The application under the 1990 suckler cow scheme was submitted after the closing date for receipt of applications and cannot be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants due under the 1988 special beef premium scheme were paid to the <Col N="561" /> person named on 5 June 1992.  My Department has no record of receiving an application under the 1989 special beef premium scheme from this herdowner. His application under the 1990 special beef premium scheme was received after the closing date for lodgement of applications and cannot be accepted.  In relation to his application under the 1992 special beef premium scheme the person named has been requested to provide an explanation regarding one animal listed on his application which was absent at inspection.  A decision regarding his eligibility under this scheme cannot be made until the applicant replies to the query.</P>

      <P>My preferred options for the provision of a fast, efficient and safe sea transport system linking Irish exporters with European markets would involve a combination of modern technology Ro/Ro and Lo/Lo shipping services backed up by adequate portal and other infrastructure and services.</P>
      <P>This is consistent with the application made to the European Commission for EC funding of external access transport services with specific priority sought for direct Ro/Ro and Lo/Lo shipping services to the European mainland.</P>
      <P>The application was based on an Access Transport Study completed in 1990 which concluded that investment in road, rail, port and other infrastructure would be insufficient without a parallel upgrading of external access transport services.</P>
      <P>Despite a negative reaction from the European Commission, who is concerned about the effects that EC funding of ships might have on competition, the application continues to be pursued with the Commission with a view to improving the quality and competitiveness of these important external links.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should perhaps remind the Deputy that responsibility for Lo/Lo shipping, maritime safety and the development of ports rests with my colleague, the Minister for Defence and the Marine.</P>

      <P>Children seen by the Health Board's school dental service are referred for screening for orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. Urgent cases, such as cleft palate, are treated as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant improvement in the level of orthodontic services as a result of the additional moneys made available since 1990.  Full-time Consultant Orthodontists have now been appointed to six health boards which will result in further improvements in the provision of orthodontic services.  These appointments will enable the boards to develop a comprehensive orthodontic service and will facilitate the provision of training in orthodontics for the boards dental staff.</P>
      <P>Health boards which have not, so far, been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists have made alternative arrangements with private specialists for the time being and will make further efforts to recruit consultants in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The recruitment of consultant orthodontists and the training of health board dental staff in the provision of orthodontic treatment will enable health boards to develop a comprehensive orthodontic service and with additional funds available to me this year I propose to develop the service further.  I do not propose, therefore, to introduce a subsidy for the provision of private orthodontic treatment.</P>
