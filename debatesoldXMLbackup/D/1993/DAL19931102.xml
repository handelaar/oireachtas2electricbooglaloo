      <P>Negotiations on an amendment to the Shannon stop policy as set out in the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement were held in Washington on 27-29 September, when, following some progress, the talks were adjourned.  Following the adjournment I visited Washington to meet the Secretary for Transportation, Mr. F. Pena, to impress upon him the political implications of achieving a successful amendment to the Shannon stop policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that following the resumption of talks on 27 October a satisfactory agreement was reached with the US.  Under this agreement Irish or US carriers who operate direct services into Dublin must operate corresponding services into Shannon.  A <Col N="534" /> similar provision has been agreed for charter services which is broadly in line with the existing regulatory arrangements under which charter services only have to serve Shannon on one leg of a round trip.  In return for these concessions the US were granted pick-up rights at Dublin to one point outside the EC.</P>
    <P>Pending elaboration of a full text of the amendments in an exchange of diplomatic notes, it was agreed to give effect to the changes from the date of the signing of the Memorandum of Consultations, i.e., 28 October 1993.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that he flew the white flag in Washington and that his capitulation to the Americans not only impacts on Shannon beyond that required under the Cahill plan but also casts doubt on the ability of Aer Lingus to compete competitively on the North Atlantic in the medium term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If anyone was to put up the white flag if might be Deputy Noonan.  It is important to point out that the dynamics of the situation have changed because there is, subject to staff approval, a negotiated settlement which changes the cost structure of the company.  Considering the implications of an open skies policy on the Irish aviation industry, particularly Aer Lingus, it is wrong to suggest that this is not an excellent deal.  An intrinsic part of the strategy, that is, a Shannon-based transatlantic fleet operated and managed from Shannon, is the availability of an amendment, the sixth change to the Shannon stop policy since its initiation.  The position has been evolving down through the years and we now have the best possible deal, which will ensure a Shannon based fleet, operated and managed from Shannon, and the possibility of increased traffic through Shannon.  I remind the Deputy that, prior to this strategy being adopted and Government decisions being taken, we were faced with a downward spiral in terms of traffic coming through Shannon. That position has changed dramatically <Col N="535" /> and there is the prospect of a very economically run developmental transatlantic operation, based and managed in Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Does the Minister not realise that the requirement of the Cahill plan was that one flight in three would go direct to Dublin whereas the Minister has now negotiated a position whereby one flight in two will go direct to Dublin?  Why did he feel constrained to give this further concession to the Americans, beyond what was required in the Cahill plan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unfortunate that the Deputy does not see the pluses in this deal for Shannon and the Irish aviation industry generally.  Under the old agreement, charters had to stop at Shannon on one leg of a return trip, either the outbound or in-bound leg.  Under the revised agreement, they can still fly the routes as above and have to do so if they are operating one charter only.  In addition, operators can now also fly direct to Dublin and back to the US, a round trip, but only if they do a similar round trip to Shannon, that is, US-Shannon-US. There is incremental traffic available on the charter side.  If there is only one flight, there will be no change because of the requirement to stop at Shannon either on the way in or out of the country.  In essence, the situation so far as charters are concerned is the same as under the old agreement &mdash; operators must match a flight to or from Shannon with a flight to or from Dublin, whether one way or return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have stated that the change will benefit charters to the detriment of scheduled traffic.  The opposite will be the case.  Up to now, charter services had an edge on scheduled services but now they must both operate under the same rules regarding the Shannon <Col N="536" /> stop.  There is no change in the position regarding charter flights to Cork and Knock airports.  As under the old agreement, they do not have to stop at Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>One must also make the basic point that Aer Lingus currently accounts for 70 per cent of the Atlantic traffic moving through Shannon Airport. In terms of expenditure, Aer Lingus pays out more than £22 million annually at Shannon and in 1992 Aer Lingus brought, directly into Shannon, 90,000 US-originating passengers who spent an estimated £40 million while in Ireland. The point I am making is that if there was no Aer Lingus there would be no Shannon.  We now have the prospect of a viable Aer Lingus and an intrinsic part of that strategy is a developing Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 8, 11, 26, 93 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, on 6 July last the Government announced that it had decided to endorse the broad strategy set out in Aer Lingus's strategic plan for the future of the company, as submitted by the board, including the need to achieve £50 million annually in cost savings.</P>
      <P>The Government, as shareholder, also agreed to invest £175 million of taxpayers' money in support of Aer Lingus's strategy: by way of one £75 million and two £50 million instalments.  The payment of these equity injections is subject to the following conditions: a full and comprehensive agreement having been reached between management and unions in Aer Lingus on the necessary £50 million annual reduction in internal costs essential for the return of the company to commercial viability; production of satisfactory evidence that the necessary measures proposed are being implemented in full; and a formal indication by the European Commission that it will raise no objection to the proposed State equity injections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking its decision on the strategy for the future, the Government noted that agreement had been reached at a meeting between the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 22 June last, on the following issues: the underlying financial position of the company was very grave and unsustainable; the core airline business would have to be <Col N="539" /> returned to operating viability; all sides are committed to achieving the reduction in numbers required in Aer Lingus through a voluntary scheme; the question of participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be explored as a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution being asked of the workforce at present; and a special enterprise development unit would be set up right away, to consist of representatives of the unions and Aer Lingus together with the IDA, Fingal County Council, FÁS, and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to identify new employment opportunities within the Aer Lingus structure.</P>
    <P>I have consistently made it clear that the Government's bottom line is that the £50 million in annual savings must be achieved.  The Government has not stipulated how they should be achieved.  That has always been a matter for negotiation between the management and unions.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place between Aer Lingus management and the unions on the implementation of the cost cutting measures in the strategy. These negotiations have understandably been vigorous and forceful on both sides. The negotiation and conciliation process has been greatly helped by the very professional facilitation of the Labour Relations Commission staff.</P>
    <P>The proposed financial restructuring of Aer Lingus, while involving inevitable job losses, will offer the prospects of secure employment for the remaining core of the company.  Without commercial viability, there would be no future for the airline or its employees.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that substantial progress has been made in negotiations and that final agreement now appears to be within reach.  It would not be appropriate for me to discuss the numbers of voluntary redundancies or the details of the negotiations which, as I have said, are a matter for the management and unions. I will simply once again urge those involved to grasp this opportunity of protecting the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> The plan for the transatlantic operations is an intrinsic part of the strategy for the future which addresses what Aer Lingus sees as the best marketing possibilities at present in the airline's commercial interest.  Negotiations on the detailed arrangements are a matter for management and unions.  I understand that substantial progress has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is Shannon's best customer and its wellbeing is vital not only for the airport but also for the region.  The Government sees the survival of Aer Lingus, with its strong transatlantic presence, as being essential for the future of the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>The employees of Aer Lingus have contributed enormously in the past to building up the airline.  The Government is fully aware that a stronger commitment than ever before will be required from all of the staff of Aer Lingus, all the way through the organisation.  As a tangible form of recognition, the Government has accepted that Aer Lingus employees should have a stake in the future success of the company once that has been secured.</P>
    <P>The Government formally notified the European Commission of its proposed investment in Aer Lingus last August. Prior to that, I had met with EC Commissioners and found their attitudes both helpful and informative.  Officials from my Department have also had a series of meetings with the Commission.  We have explained to the Commission, at both ministerial and official level, the importance of having this matter finalised in order to enable the first tranche of equity to be invested before the end of this year. The Commission has indicated to us that it fully appreciates the urgency of the matter and has assured us that it is doing everything possible to expedite its examination.</P>
    <P>Our discussions to date with the Commission have been constructive.  The Government remains confident that its investment in the airline will take place within the planned timescale and that Aer Lingus's strategy for the future will be allowed to proceed as proposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> The critical financial position of Aer Lingus, evident from the annual accounts for the year ended 31 March 1993 which were published recently, underlines the need for a fundamental restructuring of the entire operation.  I do not consider it necessary to comment further on the accounts as published beyond endorsing the chairman's statement that the past year has been one of the most traumatic in the history of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the board of Aer Lingus to implement the strategy, and I am confident it will do so.  Appointments to the board of Aer Lingus are made by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Air Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>In looking to the future, it is vital to recognise the realities of the international environment in which Aer Lingus must operate and particularly in the Single European Market which accounts for most of Aer Lingus services.  Airlines must compete in an open market where Governments can no longer intervene to regulate access to routes or pricing.  I am confident that Aer Lingus, once its costs are brought into line with its competitors, can not only survive but also develop in its main markets.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This playing for injury time is not real.  Now that he has made a both of the renegotiations <Col N="542" /> of the bilateral air agreement, does the Minister consider Aer Lingus can compete successfully with the North American carriers, particularly with the charter flights which will be able to fly the North Atlantic at lower costs than Aer Lingus into both Shannon and Dublin?  Would the Minister like to comment on the widespread view in the aviation industry that unless the package includes a partnership arrangement one of the main aviation conglomerates now being formed will not be viable in the medium term?</P>

      <P>As is clear in the Programme for Government the question of joint ventures and strategic alliances is one to be looked at in regard to what is in the commercial interest of that or any other company.  However, I would make the point that for the purpose of this company bringing something to the table, it is necessary for the viability of the company to be secured.  That is a first priority as far as this company is concerned and that is what will be sought to be achieved in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Question No. 3, I asked the Minister whether the Cahill plan for Aer Lingus was going ahead as originally envisaged.  The Minister did not answer that but it is evident from his reply that it is not.  Because of that why is it that the plan, which suggested that only one in three transatlantic flights fly <Col N="543" /> into Dublin, has been changed so that the majority of transatlantic flights will fly into Dublin?  The Minister has given figures of 612 as against 600.  Are those figures on an annualised basis because if they are all the Shannon flights will be compressed into the peak summer months?  When the Minister agreed the renegotiation of the bilateral air agreement why did he allow American airlines pick-up rights to outside the Community from Dublin and not from Shannon? Why has the Minister not yet published the agreement that was signed in Washington last Thursday in spite of numerous requests from myself and, I believe, other Deputies to his office for a copy of the agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, I dealt with that issue in my reply to Question No. 1. When the memoranda are compiled, it will be a matter for record.  What I am setting out is the truthful position with regard to the minimal change that has taken place in the renegotiations.  If the Deputy were aware of the opening negotiating position of the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to answer the questions put to me and I will answer any questions Deputy Carey may have also if it is in order.  If Deputy O'Malley were aware of the negotiating position that the United States has taken with other countries he would realise that the achievement of the renegotiation has been considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would make to the Deputy is that in relation to Shannon the question of using technical stops does not arise.  These are bona fide flights which are coming into Shannon.  There is no question of any uisce faoi thalamh in relation to this matter despite the parochial democracy which the Deputy is espousing.  What the Deputy fails to understand is that the dynamics of the <Col N="544" /> situation have now been changed completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do see how they have been changed.  Shannon Airport will be closing down for most of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will not engage in political rhetoric in relation to this matter.  The fact is that for the first time there will be a Shannon-based fleet.  Under the old system there was no year round access to the United States because during the winter period there were not seven flights per week. The position now is that every day of the year it will be possible for people to board an Aer Lingus plane at Shannon and fly to the United States.  That was not the case under the old system.</P>

      <P>That is not the case in the off-peak period.  The suggestion is being made by Deputy O'Malley that in some way we are not dealing with the seasonality issue and seasonality has always been an issue in Shannon Airport. However, by having a more competitive fares policy and a much better product to market the prospects for increased business, which people do not seem to be prepared to take on board, is far greater now than under the old system where there was a decline in business and where, because of the uncompetitive nature of the carrier, the number of indirect flights and passengers coming in over London was increasing.  We are seeking to address that issue and it must be addressed by improving the incremental flights that will be available to Shannon and improving the competitive base of the national carrier.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if the Irish Government has made a submission in connection with the consultation exercise on the Sizewell B Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) in Suffolk, England; and if so, if the text of the submission is available to the public.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk in south-eastern England, recently completed, has already been the subject of the longest public inquiry in the United Kingdom, lasting 340 days.  On 12 March 1987, following consideration of the report of the public inquiry, the then UK Secretary of State for Energy gave his consent to the application to construct Sizewell B.  At that time our Government formally protested at the plans to proceed with the construction of the plant at Sizewell.</P>
      <P>The consultation process referred to by the Deputy related to authorisations which would set limits and controls on radioactive discharges from the plant, particularly liquid waste discharges into the North Sea.  The UK Radioactive Substances Act, 1960, requires that before the UK authorities grant such authorisations they should formally seek the views of local authorities and statutory consultees. Our Department was not formally consulted in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK authorities are in no doubt as to the Irish Government's position on nuclear energy matters.  Our recent <Col N="548" /> formal submission on THORP set out our general rejection of the nuclear option in the strongest terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct that we did not offer any opinion on the Sizewell B consultation, whereas our submission on THORP &mdash; to give credit where it is due &mdash; was very good?  I detect a certain double standard here.  Will the Minister say whether there was an observer present at the public inquiry in the United Kingdom on behalf of the Irish Government and whether any report was brought back to the Irish Government following that inquiry?  Was any information relating to our involvement made available to the public so that we might observe some consistency in our Government's position regarding nuclear power rather then simple, broad platitudes of opposition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent should be fully aware, since I have answered questions tabled by him in this House on a number of occasions over the past year, that the Government is absolutely opposed to all these installations in the United Kingdom.  We have made that quite clear in various submissions, consultations and fora.  That will continue to be our position.  Our officials are monitoring it very carefully and the Minister has made excellent submissions.  Both the Minister and I have utilised our position at every opportunity to put the Irish case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether we had a direct input by way of submission or had an observer present in relation to Sizewell B or whether we ignored it, perhaps for political reasons, since it was not located in or around the Irish Sea?  I hear that, in spite of <Col N="549" /> everything, we had no input into the Sizewell B consultations.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  We have continuously opposed both installations, which are a cause of major controversy, and will continue to do so. This Government and its predecessors in office have opposed these installations at every opportunity.  Deputy Sargent is endeavouring to give the impression that we are opposed to one installation only. That is not true.  We are totally opposed to them all and have made our position quite clear.

      <Quest>the terms of reference of the study commissioned by the Department of Energy in the mid-1980s under the Agreement and lease with Tara Mines Ltd.; the action, if any, that was taken following the receipt of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the study to which the Deputy is referring was to enable the then Minister for Energy to assess the extent of the compliance by Tara Mines Limited with the provisions of its agreement and lease dated 19 September 1975.  The mine at Navan had then been in operation for about seven years.</P>
      <P>The Minister deemed it appropriate to exercise his right to examine the accounts, financial statements and records of the company because it was a major project in which the State had a 25 per cent shareholding and was entitled to royalties, dividends and taxation therefrom. It was a matter of concern to the Minister that, at the date of commissioning of the report, no such royalties or dividends had been received by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, as I have already indicated in this House, precluded by the confidentiality provisions of the agreement and lease from making public the contents of the report.  Therefore, I am unable to comment meaningfully on any specific actions which may or may not have been taken following its receipt and consideration. However, it is a matter of public record that a demand for payment of £4,788,970 in royalties, based on the profits of the company as calculated by the Revenue Commissioners for Corporation Profits Tax purposes, was issued to Tara Mines Limited on 6 March 1987.  While the <Col N="551" /> company disputed this figure at the time, the matter was resolved amicably by virtue of an agreement of 30 June 1989 on foot of which Tara Mines Limited, <i>inter alia</i>, paid $16.1 million in full and final discharge of all past and future royalties due to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being very circumspect.

What was the outcome of that investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore is not correct in what he has stated or in the allegation he has made.  There is no evidence available to me or our Department which would substantiate any of the allegations to which he has referred or which have been referred to in the press.  The lavish expense accounts to which the Deputy referred has nothing whatever to do with the initiation of the report.  The report was initiated because the Minister of the day, on the advice of the Department, felt that Tara Mines Limited should be making its proper contribution to the State.  In order to calculate what that contribution should be, the study was initiated and it considered, in totality, many other aspects also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the report examined accounts of Tara <Col N="552" /> Mines Limited.  In the course of that examination, was there any investigation regarding the concern of the State directors on the board of Tara Mines Limited that information was not being made available to them about payments being made by the company?  Did the study examine that and did it establish any evidence of such payments having been made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

We are precluded, by virtue of the fact that this case is before the courts, from commenting on this report.  The courts have decided that the report cannot be made available to the other party in the court case, rather extracts only.  I cannot comment specifically on any aspect of the report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17, 20, 100 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the National Development Plan published recently and submitted to the European Commission includes provision for an EC assisted investment programme of £185 million in the period 1994-1999 on the upgrading of the mainline railway network. In addition, a further £90 million approximately of uncofinanced investment is proposed over the period of the plan subject to the resources available to CIE.  The investment programme, which covers all the major lines on the interurban mainline railway network, will include expenditure on track renewal, new signalling systems and the provision of modern rolling stock.</P>
      <P>Finalisation of the investment programme, as regards specific expenditures on individual lines, will follow from consultations over the coming months between my Department, CIE and the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is one of the two lines not targeted for cofinancing?  Is he also aware <Col N="555" /> that this is one of our most viable and overcrowded lines?  Is he also aware of the fact that unless something is done shortly we will have another Hills-borough at Heuston Station some Friday evening?  That is no exaggeration as I have witnessed it at first hand, hundreds of passengers are kept back for the 6.05 p.m. train and corralled like animals until such time as the tape goes up and there is a massive stampede.  Recently I witnessed two nuns being knocked to the ground.  I urge the Minister to ensure that something is done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern about the Dublin-Westport-Ballina railway line may stem from the fact that both these lines have not been included for development with the assistance of EC funding under the National Development Plan. Deputies may feel this is evidence of an attempt to downgrade their significance but this is not the case.  The lines proposed for EC assisted investment are contained in the various trans-European networks and only lines contained in such networks can qualify for assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  In discussions with the Commission on the various trans-European networks we have sought the inclusion of the maximum possible number of lines.  Inclusion of the entire Irish network was not possible.  The Thames network is intended to include links with major community interests and the major criterion was the level of traffic and patronage on the lines concerned. There are no proposals to downgrade or close any lines on the existing mainline rail network.  Finalisation of the investment programme, proposed in the National Development Plan, as regards specific expenditure on individual railway lines will follow from consultations over the coming months between the Department, <Col N="556" /> CIE and the European Commission. The possibility could arise that the Commission may not agree to provide EC funding for particularly lightly used lines or may request the substitution of other lines in the expenditure programme. We must await the detail of the operational networks.  The people using that line can be assured of an investment programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a particularly trenchant speech on behalf of the Government on the vote of confidence motion last Thursday.  Why did he not direct that the Dublin-Westport-Ballina line be included in the national plan for funding from the EC?  Why is this line one of only two which will be non-cofinanced for development?  I accept there is no intention to close the line but will the Minister confirm it is not intended to allow the line to deteriorate further?  Further, will he confirm that the insurance available to Iarnród Éireann covers passengers who have to stand on that train until they reach Roscommon and the stampede, referred to by Deputy Higgins, every Friday evening at Heuston Station is most unseemly if not downright dangerous to many people?  If the Minister checks the records he will find that Commissioner Flynn, while Minister, travelled on the train announcing at every station on the route that the developments to take place would provide the best super-trains to Ballina and Westport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained in my reply to Deputy Higgins that it was not possible to include the entire Irish network in the trans-European networks.  It does not suggest that there will not be investment in these railway lines.  I would <Col N="557" /> point out that there is already a capital investment programme and that some remedial works have been carried out on lines which are causing problems.  It is clear that large amounts of money are available for our rail network for the first time in many years subject to the approval of operational programmes under the National Development Plan. The Westport-Ballina railway line on which I have often travelled, will be one of those lines.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that something must be done in the short term?  Will the Minister agree it is unacceptable that on a Sunday evening, on a train travelling to Dublin &mdash; this happened last Sunday, the previous Sunday and on 8 October &mdash; that every passenger boarding at Ballyhaunis, Castlerea, Roscommon, Athlone, Clara, Tullamore and Portarlington had to stand in the aisles all the way and that it is exactly the same on a Friday evening? Will the Minister accept that if I buy a ticket from Iarnród Éireann for £20 I am entering into a contract with Iarnród Éireann to give me a seat and at the very least there should be a token acknowledgment of this and some concession given to these passengers?</P>

      <P>I will certainly bring to the attention of CIE management the complaints and concerns Deputies raise. I am aware that problems arise on some routes at particular times on certain days. That is within the context of the total resources available to the company.  It is important that the consumer gets a fair deal.  If passengers boarding at Ballyhaunis and the following stations have to stand, it points to the need for reserved seats for those boarding at Clara station.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny's party was in Government in better times and could have done something about this problem but did not.  The fact is that on a number of lines complaints are longstanding but historically there has not been sufficient investment in the railway.  The need for new locomotive rolling stock and signalling systems is a priority with my Department.  By the combination of assistance from the Operational Programmes and our own resources we are now in a position to deal with the priority issues on all the networks, and this includes the Westport-Ballina line.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 21 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received a proposal from Bord na Móna for the provision of a new 120 megawatt peat-fired electricity <Col N="561" /> generation station to be located in the east midlands region.  The proposal is at present being examined by my Department and no decision has yet been taken on any aspect of it.  I do not propose, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, to publish the feasibility study into the proposal.</P>
    <P>Initial estimates indicate a capital cost in excess of £80 million with associated employment of around 84 permanent staff in the station including non core staff and almost 500 jobs in peat supply and with considerable additional jobs created while the station is under construction.</P>
    <P>The future of operations at Allenwood power station is not connected with the provision of a new station.  Any power station has a finite life and Allenwood has now been in operation for 41 years &mdash; an extension of 16 years beyond its original design life of 25 years.  As Deputies will be aware, the ESB has recommended the permanent closure of the station and I am considering this proposal taking into account all of the issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

Now he is saying he will persuade his colleagues in Cabinet.  What is the position? Is the Minister suggesting that a political decision will pre-empt a commercial decision, or that regardless of the commerciality of the project he will convince his colleagues in Cabinet?  Is he saying that a great deal of what is contained in the National Development Plan is simply aspirational and as the years go by it may or may not happen?</P>

In the development plan EC funding will be required to ensure that the station goes ahead and I am arranging for that eventuality. On the basis of the existing Government policy, i.e., that peat has a future and the need for regeneration for peat burning fire stations, further power stations have to become a reality.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that the study has shown that it is feasible and, if so, will the Minister inform the House on the projected cost per unit of electricity produced by the new power station?</P>

      <P>I wish to retain the commercial confidentiality of the feasibility study until such time as decisions are taken and it becomes a reality.  The feasibility study is to hand and it shows that this is a robust project.  I have been to Finland where peat technology is well in advance of our own and I am satisfied, having discussed the project with IVO, the group who carried out the consultancy study, that we have a very robust project subject to decisions being taken. It would be wrong for any Deputy to suggest that the station will not proceed on a commercial basis.  As a result of rationalisation in Bord na Móna in recent years we can provide milled peat at a very competitive price.</P>

      <P>In response to the recommendations of the Culliton and Moriarty reports the Government decided that the mandatory off-take of petroleum products from Whitegate Refinery at cost recovery prices must be terminated by end of 1996 at the latest.</P>
      <P>In order to enable the refinery to compete with market prices on an independent basis after 1996, the board of INPC submitted a plan for commercial operation of the refinery in June.  The plan includes investments costing about £26 million to improve the efficiencies of the existing plant.

Will the Minister touch on the situation at Whiddy Island?

      <P>The Programme for Government attaches a high priority to the development of modern efficient transport links with Britain, Europe and further afield and to improving access arrangements to/from Ireland.  As the regulatory authority for air transport, my Department makes every effort to ensure that there is a wide range of reliable and regular commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry, at the lowest economic cost.  However, the development of routes is a matter for the individual airlines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Outside the EC, traffic rights for air services are negotiated within the framework of bilateral air transport agreements. In order to facilitate the commencement of new services to and from Ireland, I am pursuing a vigorous policy of expanding the network of air routes to and from Ireland by negotiating air transport agreements with countries with whom there is potential for services to operate in the short, medium and long term.</P>
    <P>In line with this policy and on my specific instructions, my officials have over the past year negotiated agreements with Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Israel, the Russian Federation, Slo-venia, South Africa and Ukraine.</P>
    <P>Air transport agreements enable Irish and foreign carriers to mount services between Ireland and the relevant countries. The question of whether an airline wishes to exercise its right to operate on any specific route is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airline.</P>

      <P>Is there not a strong possibility that the national airline, Aer Lingus, is being subsidised with taxpayers' money to provide uneconomic air fares between Dublin and London in order to eliminate competition on that route and, if that is the case, as I believe it is, should the Minister not be concerned to ensure that this does not happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Predatory pricing is not and cannot be an instrument of the policy of Aer Lingus.  This is one of the issues on which the Commission is seeking clarification in relation to the application we have made to inject eligible State aid into the company.  I should make the point that the purpose of reorganising the company is to ensure the necessary cost transparency so that not only those who work in the company but also the shareholders will have a better fix on how the company is performing.  We wish to make it clear to the Commission that the company does not operate a policy of predatory pricing on that or any other route and that it will now operate on a commercial basis.  We are confident, given the cost reduction programmes, subject to agreement once certain outstanding matters have been decided at arbitration and following a ballot, that this State aid will be deemed eligible, as I mentioned earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Minister that he has an absolute responsibility to establish what the economic fare is on the London-Dublin route for Aer Lingus in particular, for two <Col N="574" /> reasons.  First, Aer Lingus has lost unconscionable sums of money during the past four years by selling below cost on the route to eliminate their competitors.  The question is whether this was done by Aer Lingus management on their own or whether the Minister's Department would not sanction the fare increases requested.  It is difficult to know where the truth lies, but both are blaming each other.</P>
      <P>The second reason the Minister should establish what is the economic fare for Aer Lingus is that his officials will have to answer this question in Brussels.  British Midland in its submission to the relevant Commissioner and Ryanair in its correspondence with the Commission claim that if one were to inject £175 million in equity into Aer Lingus on behalf of the Irish taxpayer, this will be used to sell seats below cost on the route once more. Therefore the Minister has an obligation to establish what the economic fare for Aer Lingus is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to face both directions at the one time.  On the one hand he has suggested that Aer Lingus has been involved in below cost selling, but on the other he has suggested that the Department refused to sanction price increases to allow them to compete on the route.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  The fact is that the Department has no function in the matter of pricing policy.  That is a matter for the company, which has to make commercial decisions.  Its competitors, including British Midland, will have the right to make submissions to the Commission and these will be considered by it.  We will put it to the Commission that the purpose of the viability strategy is to ensure cost transparency and that the company will not operate a policy of predatory pricing. I agree that in previous years problems were encountered when the overheads could not be met because of the pricing policy adopted.  As a result losses were incurred on what was a profitable route. It is quite clear mistakes were made in the past.  What I am saying is that if the viability plan is agreed to, this will no <Col N="575" /> longer be a feature of the commercial decisions of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister would come clean on this matter.  It is clear that Aer Lingus has been involved in below cost selling on the Dublin-London route for many years to such a degree that it constitutes a criminal activity.  It seems to be its policy to put its competitors out of business.  The Minister and the Government should be concerned about this activity.  It is blatantly obvious that it amounts to below cost selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the previous strategies adopted by the company in respect of competition on what was a profitable route, I agree with the Deputy that commercial mistakes were made.  The company sought to provide a different service for a different customer at a price it could not meet because of its cost structures and overheads.  If the company was guilty of below cost selling, which I do not admit it was, then its competitors were.  The problem was not that it was engaged in below cost selling but that its cost base was too high and it could not make a profit on that or any other route until such time as it addressed the question of the cost base of the company. That has now been addressed and that is the reason it is absolutely essential that the £50 million cost reduction programme be agreed to if the company is to be viable in the future.  I am glad to note that a negotiated settlement, subject to staff approval, is an achievable objective. This is necessary if the stragegy is to work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>There are 13 nuclear installations located on or near the west coast of Britain.  Eight nuclear power stations, three nuclear fuel manufacture and/or processing stations, one Ministry of Defence installation and one commercial source production plant for industrial, medical and research applications.</P>
      <P>Under procedures agreed at meetings of the Ireland-UK contact group on nuclear safety matters, my Department is informed of all significant incidents occurring at British nuclear installations, including Sellafield, which are notified to the UK Department of the Environment. None of the incidents was reportable under international arrangements. Under the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on early notification of a nuclear accident, only an incident which has resulted or may result in an international transboundary release that could be of radiological safety significance for another State is required to be notified.  The International Nuclear Event Scale, INES, which was developed by the IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD after the Chernobyl accident, is a tool to promptly and consistently communicate to the public the safety significance of reported events at nuclear installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> The House can be assured that the radiological consequences for this country of any incidents reported by my Department are monitored by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  We are satisfied that the contact group and the notification procedure are a valuable forum for the exchange of information and provide us with precise and up-to-date information which is essential for our overall monitoring of UK nuclear installations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the reference to &ldquo;domestic calls&rdquo; in the Deputy's question refers to calls made by domestic customers.  Preliminary information available to my Department from Telecom Éireann, which has not yet been <Col N="580" /> subjected to independent scrutiny by the Telephone Users' Advisory Group, indicates that there has been a drop of 8 per cent in the volume of calls in the residential sector and no change in the volume of calls in the business sector. The average duration of calls has fallen by about 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is clearly inadvisable to read too much into data in respect of short periods.  I have not allocated a specific budget to the Telephone Users' Advisory Group.  I stated at the inaugural meeting of the group on 15 September 1993 that whatever resources are required for the group to fulfil its mandate will be provided. The secretariat for the group is provided by my Department and the group also has available to it specialist analytical expertise from the analysis unit of the Department of Finance.  I am making arrangements to circulate the terms of reference of the group for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Terms of Reference of the Telephone Users' Advisory Group established by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Group is:</P>
      <P>1.  to carry out independent monitoring of the operation and impact on different groups and classes of customers of the new Telecom Éireann tariff package introduced on 1 September 1993 and report to the Minister thereon;</P>
      <P>2.  to assess future trends as they relate to tariffs taking into account the rapidly changing technology in the telecommunications industry and report to the Minister thereon.</P>
      <P>In discharging function 2 above the Group should:</P>
      <P>&mdash;monitor developments in other tariff systems both in the EC and elsewhere and assess their relevance to the Irish situation;</P>
      <P>&mdash;take account of market and technical developments in Ireland and elsewhere;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" />&mdash;ensure that any recommendations made to the Minister on changes in tariffs should take account of the need to achieve an overall balance which will enable Telecom Éireann to maintain financial viability.</P>
    <P>The Group may also:</P>
    <P>&mdash;examine the pattern and nature of complaints by customers in general concerning the operation of the tariff;</P>
    <P>&mdash;suggest how Telecom Éireann might deal with consumer complaints of a general nature;</P>
    <P>The Group will determine its own procedures.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to re-establish the statutory Telecom Eireann Users' Council. The functions of this council have effectively been taken over by the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act (First Schedule) (Amendment) Order, 1984. Sections 48 and 49 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which gave statutory effect to the users' council were repealed by section 3 and the Second Schedule of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The more measured approach outlined by me is correct. There has been a change of pattern which I welcome, because the whole purpose of the rebalancing was to bring in incentives to use the telephone during off peak periods. It is clear that what is now required is a marketing by Telecom Éireann of its excellent product which is now competitively priced, has a commercial basis and provides us with the opportunity to have more and more jobs in the whole tele-marketing area about which there is <Col N="583" /> considerable discussion at the moment.  I am sorry to disappoint Deputy Gilmore, but the consumers are not beng screwed and I do not believe that the first four weeks indicates the total pattern.  Despite the scaremongering efforts of the Opposition, this rebalancing has proved a success. A marketing by Telecom Éireann of its excellent product will see volumes restored.  It is interesting to point out for the benefit of the House that, although the cost is significantly reduced, users have not yet increased international calls to the volumes one would expect.  I am now saying they can take advantage of the rebalancing charges, opposed by the Opposition, who have been proved inaccurate. I would have expected the Opposition to stand up and admit they were wrong.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that the £.75 million loss indicated in the first month of the new scheduling will grow to a £39 million loss in a year if maintained in addition to the £15 million loss already in the rescheduling announced by Telecom Éireann? Will the Minister also confirm that there has been a drop in usage even of international and trunk calls by domestic users even though their costs have come down? Does he welcome that change of pattern? I put it to him also that it is a peculiar commercial mandate for a commercial State company to advocate that customers use less of their service to prevent their bills going out of proportion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 24, and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the issue of legalising deflector or community television systems on a number of occasions in this House as have my predecessors.</P>
      <P>Government policy in regard to multi-channel choice for many years now is that the best means of bringing such choice to the non-cabled public is through properly licenced multipoint microwave distribution systems, or MMDS.  Let me stress that there are no plans to review Government policy on this issue.  I would therefore like to take this opportunity, as I did in this House last Wednesday, to make it as clear as I can that the MMDS system is here to stay and that no other re-transmission system can, or will, be licensed.</P>
      <P>The basic problem with deflector systems is that they operate in a part of the UHF band which has been allocated to Ireland for television use by the Stockholm Treaty of 1961.</P>
      <P>There is simply not enough frequency space available under this allocation to enable a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements such as RTE's two channels, a possible independent &ldquo;third&rdquo; channel and the proposed Teilifís na Gaeilge. Those calling for the licensing of illegal deflector systems are in effect asking me to close off options for the future development of domestic television services in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of competition, as I said earlier, there is simply no alternative to MMDS in non-cabled areas.  The question of allowing more than one MMDS or cable operator in any particular area was examined at the time the licensing regimes were being drawn up, but was not considered practical, mainly for economic reasons.  In <Col N="588" /> addition, there is simply not enough frequency space available to allow two or more MMDS operators in a franchise area to carry the full range of available channels.  In the case of cable, heavy capital outlay militates against competing systems; neither does it make sense to have duplicated cabling in any one area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that many experts claim that it is technically feasible and practical, in accordance with international regulations, to licence community television services in the UHF band?  If it has been Government policy for many years solely to licence MMDS systems, why did the Minister's predecessors say clearly last year &mdash; admittedly prior to an election but I would expect the same words to be spoken after an election &mdash; that there would be an examination of the role of deflector systems in the provision of multi-channel services?  In relation to the competition factor, where the Minister believes there is no future for the deflector system why did his party spokes-person, the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, promise that there would be an arrangement for the examination of the monopoly position of MMDS operations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were all those promises made last November and why is the Minister now taking the hardline attitude that deflector systems are not acceptable?  What is acceptable on the east coast is not acceptable on the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Keeffe knows of experts who believe we can use deflector systems on the ultra high frequency bands available, they do not know of the availability of such bands to Ireland under the Stockholm Treaty.  They are not aware of the position.  In relation to the examination of the role of deflector <Col N="589" /> systems, I outlined in my reply the precise position in clear and unambiguous terms.  Those calling for the licensing of illegal deflector systems are in effect asking this Government to close off options for the future development of domestic television services so as to facilitate non-domestic television channels through the MMDS.  It is a higher quality product and a greater range of channels can be facilitated.  Any re-examination of that role has concluded that there can be no change in the position.  In relation to competition, I do not wish to pre-empt the result of an examination by the Department of Enterprise and Employment but it is suffice to say that the question of legalising deflector operations does not arise for the reasons I have already given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications if, in view of the protracted nature of the unofficial postal strike in Cork, the fact that new work practices in An Post are operational throughout the country by agreement between the Communications Workers Union and An Post with the exception of Cork because of the current wildcat strike, the difficulty which this dispute is creating in particular for business in Cork city and county, the dislocation for individuals, particularly pensioners, who normally receive their pension cheques by post, and the fact that intense efforts behind the scenes have so far failed to resolve the matter, he will explore and use all avenues open to him to ensure a speedy resolution of this dispute; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The postal dispute in Cork arises from unofficial action taken by a small group of workers.  I understand that the dispute has not the support of the union representing the workers and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the matter.  Efforts are being made by the <Col N="591" /> union to bring the unofficial action to an end.  In the meantime An Post has made special arrangements with the Department of Social Welfare and other bodies to minimise the impact of the dispute on pensioners and others.</P>
      <P>As there will be a general meeting of the union's Cork branch this evening to consider the matter futher, a debate on the matter would not be helpful.  I ask Deputies to await the outcome of this meeting before commenting further on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that a meeting will be held this evening, I respect his wishes.  However, I hope both sides of the House will take this opportunity to appeal to everybody concerned to think of the wellbeing of the business and commercial life of the city and to remember that hardship is being imposed on people who are dependent on postal cheque payments.  Despite the good efforts being made, not all the people on social welfare have received their cheques.  I ask that for the wellbeing of the city and county the strike be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Minister has said about the meeting due to take place this evening and I accept one must respect the due process.  I would remind the House that there were high expectations about a similar meeting due to be held last Friday, but unfortunately it came to nothing.  I join with Deputy Allen in his appeal to all those involved to try to find a way through a third party to resolve the outstanding grievances and to find a back-to-work formula.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the enormous efforts which have been made by the general officers of the Communications Workers' Union in spite of the unofficial nature of this strike.  This House owes them a debt of gratitude for their efforts on behalf of the people in Cork city and county.  I hope the problem is resolved soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has requested, we will not aggravate the position <Col N="592" /> by adding further comment on the matter.  However, the workers involved are not a crowd of wildcat militants; they are a very reasonable group of people. I do not know what misunderstanding between An Post and the union gave rise to this dispute.  There are pensioners outside the social welfare system who have not received their cheques and there are many small businesses whose cash flow is grievously interfered with because most of their income comes in at the beginning of the month.  The union has been damaged due to loss of authority and An Post has been damaged due to loss of income.  Therefore it is in everybody's interest to bring about a resolution of this strike.  I hope the Minister will not join in the chorus of condemnation of the workers because they are not, as has been implied, militant; they are very reasonable people.  I do not understand what gave rise to the misunderstanding, but it is in everybody's interest to speak softly with a view to resolving the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The fourth direct elections to the European Parliament will be held throughout the Community between 9 and 12 June 1994.  Assuming the normal practice is followed, the elections in Ireland will take place on Thursday, 9 June 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These will be historic elections.  For the first time, all citizens of the European Community will have the right to vote at European elections in their member state of residence.  This is a major step incorporated in the Maastricht Treaty and one which Ireland has been advocating since it joined the EC.  Our electoral law has permitted nationals of other member states living in Ireland to vote at European <Col N="676" /> elections since the first direct elections held in 1979.  All other member states will now be required to give the same right to EC nationals, including Irish citizens resident in their territory, subject, of course, to the one person, one vote, principle.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty also provides that EC nationals will be entitled to stand as candidates at European elections in the member state in which they live.  We are happy to extend this right to nationals of other member states living in Ireland and section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty envisages that the Council will adopt detailed arrangements for the exercise of these voting and standing rights.  A draft directive setting out proposed detailed arrangements has been discussed on two occasions by the General Affairs Council.  I am confident that a text acceptable to all member states will be finalised by the end of the year, which is the Maastricht deadline.  As EC nationals already have voting rights in this country, the directive will not require significant amendments to our existing procedures for European elections.</P>
    <P>Before moving on, I would like to put to rest a misinterpretation of the relevant Maastricht provision.  It has been suggested that the draft directive will require each member state to provide voting facilities at EC elections for its citizens living in other member states.  I would like to make it clear that this is not the case.  Under Maastricht, Irish citizens who live in another member state will be able to cast their vote and stand as candidates at European elections in that member state.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Government established a constituency commission under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, to review the European constituencies and the distribution of the 15 Irish seats.  This was the first review of the Euro constituencies since they were formed in 1977.  In its report published in June, the commission recommended the retention of the present formation of constituencies, subject to the transfer of a <Col N="677" /> seat from the Munster to the Leinster constituency.  Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill give effect to these recommendations. Thus there will be three four-seat constituencies at the 1994 elections &mdash; Dublin, Leinster and Munster, and one three-seater &mdash; the constituency of Connacht-Ulster.</P>
    <P>The other main provision in the Bill is a tightening up of the procedure for filling casual vacancies in the European Parliament in the light of experience since the present system was introduced in 1984.  The overall arrangement will remain unchanged.  Each vacancy will be filled by the person whose name stands first on the relevant list of replacement candidates presented at the election.  The changes in the Bill are intended to give a more positive role to the individual replacement candidate and can be summarised as follows: it is provided explicitly that the order of names on a replacement candidates' list must be determined before the list is presented to the returning officer, and that, subject to death, disqualification etc., this will be the effective order for filling vacancies; the Clerk of the Dáil will offer the vacancy to the person standing first on the appropriate replacement list, rather than consulting the political party under the present procedure and if the person standing first on the list is not willing to serve or fails to respond within ten days, the Clerk will offer the vacancy to the person standing next on the list and will repeat the procedure as often as necessary.</P>
    <P>It will continue to be a requirement under this Bill that a replacement candidate on a list presented by a political party at the previous election must continue to be a member of that party to be eligible to fill a vacancy in a seat won by that party.  If no replacement list was presented at the previous election by the relevant party or non-party candidate, or if such a list is exhausted, the present arrangement whereby the Dáil may appoint a person to fill the vacancy from any list presented for that constituency will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this is a short technical <Col N="678" /> Bill containing important changes in European elections law.  It is desirable that these provisions should be enacted as early as possible so that all the ground rules will be in place in good time for next year's elections.  I trust that the House will afford the Bill a swift passage into law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first to assure the Minister of State that Fine Gael will be supporting this rather routine legislation. Nevertheless, we will examine the procedure for enabling citizens of the European Community to vote at European elections in their member state of residence. An independent commission has established the boundaries for these elections and the number of seats in each constituency.  It is not appropriate to dissent from the decision of an independent commission.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the transfer of a seat from the Munster to the Leinster constituency. As a Leinster man, I suppose this recognises the major shift in population from rural areas in other parts of the country to Dublin, the Minister's constituency, Kildare, and the counties surrounding Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no vested interest in the number of seats in Leinster on this occasion.  The Deputy might be interested in throwing his hat in the ring, so to speak, as his father did during the 1979 European elections when he performed excellently.  The additional seat available in Leinster will make it more enticing for people to stand in the European elections.  However, it should be remembered that the public, rightly or wrongly, have very little interest in elections to the European Parliament.  If the Minister and the Government were more active in disseminating information about what happens in the European Parliament and the European Commission the public might be more aware of the <Col N="679" /> decisions taken in Europe and their effect on them.  One of the great challenges facing the Government and the Governments of the other member states is the proper implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.  The Government had numerous opportunities since the last European elections to encourage interest among the public about what takes place in Europe.  It had a major opportunity to do this when drawing up the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>I was extremely disappointed that the subregional review groups, which were set up on a regional basis by the Government for the purpose of devising the plans and obtaining the suggestions of the ordinary people about what should appear in the National Development Plan, were a sham.  Essentially, this involved the various social partners and some elected representative coming together on a regional basis, with the attendance of officials from the Department of Finance. However, at the end of the day they were actually told to submit generalities about the various improvements that could be made and the various plans implemented in their respective regions if and when money became available.  Effectively, this meant that the Department of Finance, the Mandarins of Merrion Street, and the Minister for Finance in particular would make the sole decision at the end of the day regarding what would affect the region and what parts of their plans, if any, would be implemented.  In the context of regional development there was no overall attempt to say that some regions were less well off than others. There was no overall plan or objective set out by the Government to state that because some regions did not do well previously it would endeavour to make it up on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of access of planning and access to information, particularly as it appertains to the European Community, the public are finding it difficult to obtain such information.  They are finding it difficult also to have a meaningful input. In particular, the regional development authorities, which the Minister is now in <Col N="680" /> the process of establishing, will have very little power other than in a co-ordinating way in their respective regions in regard to how money is spent and how plans are implemented.  They will have very little power to monitor and evaluate how particular plans are working in the various regions.</P>
    <P>I welcome one aspect of change which did not take place on the last occasion, namely, that regional authorities will now have the opportunity to make representations to the European Community if a particular plan or an aspect of a plan is not being implemented in their respective regions.  This will help to keep on its toes the Government Department appropriate to that particular representation. In establishing the committee of the regions I would hope that the Minister will allow the regional authorities to make particular nominations to the committee rather than doing what would normally be the practice under Fianna Fáil &mdash; hopefully under Labour this will not be the case &mdash; rather than what I read in the newspaper recently, namely, that the Government will make the appointments.  Perhaps the Government has already done this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the superior knowledge of my colleague, Deputy Doyle, when she says that the Government has taken it on itself to make these appointments.  That is a scandalous usurpation of the powers of the regional development authorities.  This was an opportunity for them to have a meaningful and direct input into the establishment of the committee of the regions, which is part of the Maastricht Treaty.  I am disappointed also to see that of the nine representatives appointed, eight are from Fianna Fáil and one from Fine Gael. In deference to other parties in the House I would have thought that we would have had a more meaningful input.  I would have expected the Labour Party to have representation also on the committee. The Leader of the Labour Party, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, would seem <Col N="681" /> to be taking his eye off the ball in relation to European matters.  I realise he is a very busy man at present due to the very sensitive issues in regard to the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Northern Ireland context.  Matters relating to the European Community are being put on the back burner and the Minister appears not to be <i>au fait</i> with these particular political matters as well as other matters in Europe that require our constant attention.</P>
      <P>I sincerely believe that we need a full-time Minister for European Affairs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has also responsibility for overseas development aid and he is assisting the overseas development process on a regular basis.  He frequently visits non governmental organisation projects and projects in which the State is involved, particularly in Africa.  In the context of the Structural Funds debacle and our foolish image in the eyes of the European Community, we need a full-time Minister for European Affairs who will keep a watchful eye on the issues that pertain to Ireland and who will be <i>au fait</i> with Ireland's requirements in the context of implementing the Maastricht Treaty, which was formally ratified yesterday.</P>
      <P>A Minister for European Affairs, in the Irish context, would fulfil a very important role, because we need to keep a close watch on developments in institutional reform in the context of the enlargement of the Community and the establishment of a European Monetary Union.  The various Heads of Government last week decided that the European Monetary Union was still on the rails and that the timetable for the implementation of the European Monetary Union and the establishment of a European Central Bank was still in place as originally intended.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but it would seem that he is ranging fairly widely over the whole European scene.  He has had quite some latitude in the matter, but I would like him to return to the subject matter of this Bill, which is rather restricted.  It <Col N="682" /> deals with the electoral procedure to be adopted at the next European election, the allocation of seats, the right to stand as a candidate and the provisions relating to the filling of vacancies as they arise. This is what the Bill is about.  It does not lend itself to a wide-ranging speech on European matters, generally.</P>

There will be important and new powers given to members of the next European Parliament in the context of the Maastricht Treaty.  Indeed, it will be able to hire and fire the Commission of the European Communities, which represents a fundamental change in the powers.  It has a right in terms of co-decision in matters relating to the free circulation of workers, the internal market rules and general environmental programmes.  It will have more power of implementation in relation to the various operational programmes of the European Community. This makes it all the more important for the citizens of Europe to be more informed about the powers of the European Parliament, because they will have <Col N="683" /> an opportunity to vote in the European elections in 1994 and we must&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the European Parliament certainly have been critical for a long time about the manner in which they could become involved, through their national parliaments, in having their voices heard so that they could relate more closely to the citizens who elect them.  This is a major problem, of which I know the Minister is only too well aware. Indeed, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was established for the purpose of giving an audience to Members of the European Paliament, thereby giving them an opportunity to relate to matters being discussed in which they had an interest in respect of European affairs.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I have to say it is not working satisfactorily in that Members of the European Parliament who seek to contibute to the deliberations of those committee meetings are unable to do so because of their timing.  Normally committees of the Houses meet on Tuesdays and Wednesdays whereas Mondays or Fridays are the only days that do not coincide with meetings of the European Parliament, when we could be afforded an opportunity to hear what its Members might have to say and indeed afford them an opportunity to relate to their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment to allow Members of the European Parliament to be involved in the workings of national parliaments is very important.  Indeed, this objective was promised in the programme for Government but we have not seen any progress in that regard.  If the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and/or the House in plenary session met on a Friday then Members of the European Parliament would be afforded a regular opportunity of making an input to <Col N="685" /> matters pertaining to the national Parliament and debating how decisions taken by the European Parliament will affect our Parliament.  The relationship between national and European Parliament is far from satisfactory.  Indeed the democratic deficit built up over the years, widening all the more because of the greater powers European parliamentarians will have arising from the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, will alienate us further from the type of input we should have to influence decisions of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>How often do we come across EC directives and decisions implemented under them by the European Parliament when we debate them in plenary session of the House, or at a committee thereof, after the event when we have no influence on their precise content?  This House is not afforded a regular opportunity to debate EC directives, how their contents may relate to ordinary people and constituents of Members of the European Parliament, because Members of that Parliament are not given sufficient opportunity to explain their case to this House or the people or benefit from any input we might make to those directives before they are implemented.  Because many of those directives are implemented by way of ministerial regulation anyway, it is all the more important to debate them in this House because often the electorate know nothing about them until they affect them.  The food hygiene regulations which generated much controversy nationwide is a perfect example, when the National Government interpreted the directives more stringently than the EC had intended.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a forum such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the House in plenary session should ensure that such directives are brought to the attention of the House and, in turn, to the general public.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, in view of the fact that you are restricting my wide-ranging contribution on matters that Members of the European Parliament seek to address in the context of the European elections in 1994 and the provisions <Col N="686" /> of this Bill, elections to the European Parliament in 1994 will be more important than ever since they will provide the fourth opportunity the public will have had to vote directly for the people they wish to represent them in Europe.  We should remember that the European elections in 1994 will incorporate endorsement of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and that greater powers than ever before will be vested in Members of the European Parliament. Therefore, it behoves all constituents to be well informed &mdash; because of the enormous contribution the European Parliament will be making to their activities and daily lives &mdash; particularly in relation to decisions taken which will affect them post-1994.</P>

Creidimid go bhféadfadh deacrachtaí áirithe a bheith ag baint leis an réiteach atá á moladh ag an Aire agus labhróidh mé faoi sin ar feadh cúpla nóiméad.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I accept your ruling and the Minister's reference to this as a short technical Bill and do not intend to avail of the opportunity to roam across the European stage, the Chair will be able to relax during my contribution at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill contains three main proposals. As already outlined, these are, first, to revise the number of seats for the election of representives to the European <Col N="687" /> Parliament in the existing Euro constituencies; second, to grant the right to stand as a candidate in the Euro elections to EC nationals residing here and, third, to provide new arrangements for the filling of casual vacancies in the European Parliament henceforth.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party fully supports the first two of the three main proposals but has reservations about the third.  It is interesting to note that the Bill is not being put before the House because of any initiative on the part of this Government, nor is it before the House in fulfilment of any aspiration to democratic reform contained in the current programme for a partnership Government. It is important to state that the only reason this Bill is before the House is the necessity to fulfil the statutory requirement enshrined in section 12 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as amended by section 172 of the Electoral Act, 1992, which required that a review of European Parliament constituencies must be submitted to the Oireachtas by 1 December 1993 and at least once in every ten years thereafter. Also the other requirement to extend the right to stand as a candidate to other EC nationals residing here is an obligation thrust on us by our acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will clearly be seen that the Government is responding, in both these matters, to statutory requirements. I say that because in my time in this House I have witnessed two major attempts to gerrymander the structure of constituencies to give disproportionate electoral advantage to the party or parties in power.  Blatant gerrymandering proposals were put before this House by a Fianna Fáil Minister, former Deputy Kevin Boland, in the mid-60s and by a Labour Minister, the late Deputy James Tully, in 1973.  In the interim I should like to think I played no small part in the introduction of legislation and of policy acceptance by Governments to curb the anti-democratic tendencies of parties in this House when they attain office. Indeed, as a Fianna Fáil spokesperson on <Col N="688" /> the Environment at their 1974 Ard-Fheis my proposal to have all future constituency revisions carried out on the recommendations of an independent electoral boundaries commission was accepted and subsequently put into effect by the Fianna Fáil Government led by former Deputy Jack Lynch between 1977 and 1979.  That principle has been applied to Euro constituencies.</P>
    <P>Hence, today we have before us the Bill to give legislative effect to the report of the European Parliament Constituency Commission of June 1993 which was chaired by Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton.</P>
    <P>As we know, the two great gerrymandering parties of the past, Fianna Fáil and Labour, have been in power for almost 12 months now.  I wonder if there is any significance in the fact that they have not yet implemented their partnership programme commitment to &ldquo;establish an Electoral Commission on a statutory basis to advise on future revision of constituencies&rdquo;.  I urge the Government to waste no further time in publishing this very necessary Bill.  An Electoral Commission Bill must ensure there is no political taint whatsoever about the way in which a commission does its work.  It must be totally independent of political parties in its membership and administration.  None of the work of any future electoral commission should be carried out by the staff of any Government Department.</P>
    <P>An independent boundary commission must operate in an environment completely free from political influence of any kind. To achieve this, it must appoint its own staff, it must have separate offices from any existing Government Department and its staff must have no other responsibilities while working for the commission.  Any Bill to establish an electoral commission must provide that commission with full powers to operate in an independent and transparent fashion free from any Minister, Government Department or section of any Department.</P>
    <P>The right of EC nationals residing here <Col N="689" /> to stand as candidates in the European Parliament elections is contained in the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. Implementation of that aspect of the Maastricht Treaty raises other questions in relation to common voting systems and rights throughout the Community.  It also raises the question of whether persons who have an entitlement to vote in European elections should not also have the facility of a postal vote extended to them.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party were in Opposition they brought forward a Bill to extend postal voting to persons in this country in general elections.  That Bill was voted down by the then Government. I was the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats party, who were a coalition partner in that Government, and I had to explain the difference between our party's position and that of the major party in the Government.  With two members in Cabinet, we were in favour of it.  This policy had been enunciated and adopted at our annual conference. The Government was not prepared to support that proposal on the grounds of so-called constitutional difficulties. The Minister's party is in office for the past twelve months and they have not brought forward their Bill.  We have not seen the proposals for a referendum to alter the Constitution to let the people decide whether they want to extend postal voting rights.</P>
    <P>On the question of a constitutional amendment the Progressive Democrats sought legal advice.  The advice received suggested that because the vote had already been extended to Irish nationals living abroad &mdash; to persons employed in the diplomatic service around the world &mdash; the principle had already been conceded, therefore it should be possible for the Government to introduce legislation which would extend a similar right, on a limited basis, to emigrants.</P>
    <P>The extension of postal voting to diplomatic staff residing abroad has never been challenged.  It is, therefore, assumed that the same right exists for other Irish citizens who are also living abroad.  That was the kernel of the legal <Col N="690" /> argument we presented and it is still valid.</P>
    <P>When replying perhaps the Minister of State would give a clear indication as to the Government's intention in relation to the extension of postal voting.  When Ministers of this Government travel abroad and meet emigrant groups in different parts of the globe they readily assure them that they support the extension of the postal voting to emigrants in some form or other.  When they return home they refuse to take any action to fulfil that promise.  There is tremendous frustration among those emigrant groups who have been campaigning for an extension of voting rights.  It is wrong to hold out the expectation if the right is not going to be given.  If it is determined that it is a constitutional issue then legislation should be brought before the House to enable a referendum to be held and to let the people decide whether to allow emigrants the right to vote.</P>
    <P>The Constitution relates specifically to elections to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  The European Parliament did not exist in the thirties when our Constitution was drawn up.  I am aware that by ministerial order postal voting was extended to emigrants or persons living abroad during the local elections in the mid-seventies.  Does the Minister have power to extend postal voting rights in certain circumstances to persons who may wish to vote in the forthcoming European Parliament elections in June 1994?  It would be helpful if the Minister could shed some light on this issue in reply to this debate.  It would not be helpful to have to go back to the Official Report and quote what the Labour Party spokesperson said when the matter was last debated.  It would be better to deal with it in a commonsense fashion.  In his contribution the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>That the Maastricht Treaty envisages that the Council will adopt detailed arrangements for the exercise of these voting and standing rights.  A draft Directive setting out proposed detailed arrangements has been discussed on two occasions by the General <Col N="691" /> Affairs Council.  I am confident that a text acceptable to all member states will be finalised by the end of the year, which is the Maastricht deadline.  As EC nationals already have voting rights in this country, the Directive will not require significant amendments to our existing procedures for European elections.</P>
    <P>I compare that statement with the European Parliament Constituency Commission Report 1993, on which some of the provisions of this Bill are founded. Mr. Justice Hamilton's committee stated:</P>
    <P>In March, 1993 the Parliament adopted a resolution proposing the use of a list system either on a national basis or on the basis of regional constituencies. The resolution also recognises the possibility of single-seat constituencies with a supplementary distribution of seats at national level to secure proportionality and it envisages the possibility of preference voting within lists. The parliament's proposals will now fall to be considered by the Council of Ministers, in accordance with the relevant Treaty provisions but it is not clear whether this consideration will be completed in time for the next elections which are due to be held in June 1994.  The proposals in this report are framed on the basis of the existing electoral arrangements but the provincial constituencies which are recommended are capable of use with a list system or the STV system.</P>
    <P>My party has no quibble with the recommendations of the boundary commission's report in relation to reducing the number of seats in Munster by one, from five to four, and increasing the number of seats in Leinster by one, from three to four, as it restores proportionality. It can be deemed to be fair and a commonsense solution in view of the population shifts.</P>
    <P>The proposals adopted by the European Parliament are very interesting.  The paragraph I quoted from the Minister's speech is the only reference of any kind he has made to what is happening at European level in regard to arrangements <Col N="692" /> for the exercise of voting rights.  If a resolution has been adopted proposing the use of a list system on a national or regional basis, why did the Minister not make reference to it in the course of his contribution to this important debate? Mr. Justice Hamilton's committee, on which there were very eminent people, was of the opinion that this matter might or might not be resolved in time to be put into effect for the June 1994 elections. If that was even a remote possibility, it would be a very fundamental change and one of which this House should get plenty of notice.  I hope the Minister will elaborate further on that aspect of the Commission's report and on the resolutions that have already been adopted by the European Parliament in regard to election system and the list system, in particular.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is the lack of a proper mode of communications between those whom we elect to the European Parliament and the elected members of this House, and the Government. There was a suggestion in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the elected MEPs should have the right to attend and to participate in Oireachtas committees.  I represented the Progressive Democrats at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 1987 at which I made a formal proposal along these lines which was rejected out of hand by the three main parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  It is very interesting to see that as time moves on, things move on and what seems impossible one day becomes a reality.</P>

I mention that in passing to remind some Deputies, who are advocating it with great enthusiasm, how vehemently their spokespersons, including their Leader, opposed the idea when a formal proposal was put forward by <Col N="693" /> my party before the relevant Oireachtas Committee.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate &mdash; I am not sure if the Minister has done so but I am sure he has &mdash; that we extend our thanks and appreciation to the chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Hamilton, and those who served on the commission with him. These are thankless jobs but are a vital national service.  As a Member of this House let me assure them that their work is appreciated.  I see one of the hard working members, the secretary of the Commission, is present beside the Minister.  I know this should not be referred to by Members but I cannot let the opportunity pass to assure all those who were involved in the work of this and previous commissions how highly valued their work is and to thank them for their high quality reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party has a difficulty with an aspect of the third proposal, the replacement list.  The only key mandatory requirement in this Bill is the provision of section 7, the insertion of a new section 10 (d), in page 6, lines 12 and 13.  The mandatory requirement is that the person on the replacement list in the event of the elected member standing down shall be a member of a political party.  The provision is that the Clerk of the Dáil should write to the potential candidate rather than to the potential candidate's party. Of itself this could cause major difficulties. Candidates who are members of registered political parties have the right to include the name of that political party on the ballot paper.  Whether it is an advantage or a disadvantage, most candidates who belong to a political party wish to have that recorded on the ballot paper.  In the case of some of the larger parties, this has been a great help to the candidates to get votes from people who vote for their party automatically.  The Progressive Democrats' objective is to try to get people to think before they vote rather than acting automatically. The party has a major role to play in this respect and offering the vacancy to the name at the top of the list can cause enormous difficulties.  This eventuality could arise after a period of three or four <Col N="694" /> years.  In the recent case of Mr. Barry Desmond, it is approximately four and a half years since he was elected to the European Parliament.  A great many things have changed in that time.  Different parties have different rules.  For instance, some parties have rules about the dual mandate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Some parties used to have rules about the dual mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a candidate on the replacement list is elected to the Dáil in the intervening period and his party has a rule that no member of the party can hold a dual mandate he would not be entitled under his party rules to accept an invitation from the Clerk of the Dáil to become a member of the European Parliament.  Why should the Clerk of the Dáil have the right to consult an individual rather than the political party who sponsored the candidate?  We see enormous difficulties with this.  There is a requirement also that the candidate continues to be a member of the said party and, if not, he shall be disregarded.  This means that if he is not a member of the party he is not entitled to be a replacement candidate.  If the Clerk of the Dáil is to write to the candidate who is first on the list the person may have left the party in the intervening period or may not have complied with the rules of his party.  The Clerk of the Dáil would not be aware of this before the candidates replied within the specified period of ten days.  It is extraordinary that the Government is bringing forward a proposal that a candidate on being informed of a vacancy in the European Parliament must reply within ten days and if the reply is positive he is deemed to be the member of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is bringing forward a proposal to move expeditiously in the case of the European Parliament but it is extraordinary that it can travel so sedately in regard to Dáil vacancies.  We have had a vacancy in Mayo and in Dublin for almost a year.  Did it not occur to the Cabinet or to the Minister that there is an extraordinary contradiction in <Col N="695" /> the provisions they are putting into this Bill and what they put into practice for the replacement of Deputies in Mayo and Dublin?  This brings discredit to politics. The Government has earned no respect for the way it is running away from the by-elections.  Perhaps they are afraid of political defeat.  Are there other reasons for postponing these by-elections?  It is not right that the Government should deny the people their rightful representation as laid down in the Constitution and implemented by the Oireachtas.  This is an extraordinary contradiction that does not bring credit to those politicians who try them on and this is a try-on by the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties in Government.</P>
    <P>One can imagine situations where a person included on the list may not be the choice of the political party under whose banner he stood for election.  It is entirely wrong that a provision should be put in this way.  It would be more appropriate to provide that the Clerk of the Dáil should consult with the candidate's political party and request the party to nominate a person from the list as submitted to the returing officer at the time nominations were accepted.  The Minister may have some valid response to the points I make.  We all operate in the practical political world and we know the difficulties.</P>
    <P>We should have seen this obstacle and provided in this legislation clear and unambiguous provisions to settle issues and avoid confusion.  There is confusion already because of the provisions of the previous legislation and this attempt to clarify the matter may make it worse. Sufficient thought was not given to it. Perhaps the Minister might reconsider the matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the legislation are acceptable to my party.  I hope the Minister will give a clear indication of the proposed changes that may emanate from Brussels in regard to the common procedures for election of members to the European Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is most significant <Col N="696" /> not so much for what it contains, but for what it does not contain.  Once again we are introducing electoral legislation &mdash; specifically electoral legislation relating to the European Parliament &mdash; and once again a Government has ducked the issue of votes for emigrants.  Again the demand by emigrants for a say in the electoral system has been ignored.</P>
      <P>It would have been particularly appropriate to use the next European elections as a first step in the phasing in of a wider voting system for emigrants.  Ireland is now the odd one out in Europe.  This is the only member state of the Community which fails to provide voting rights in European elections for its citizens living in other member states, and it certainly is not the case that there are too few of them.  Unless we move to bring our electoral law into line with the rest of the Community we face the prospect of yet again being forced by EC institutions to act like the good Europeans we claim to be.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have dragged their feet on the issue of votes for emigrants. A plethora of committees and working groups has been set up, but what seems singularly missing is the political will.  It is now more than ten years since the European Parliament called for the extension of voting rights in the home country to EC nationals living in other member states.  The matter was raised prior to the 1984 European election and the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition ducked the issue.  The matter was raised again prior to the 1989 Euro contest and the then Fianna Fáil Government did not want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is now the only country which does not have some provision to allow its nationals living abroad to vote in European elections.  A number of countries such as Denmark, Holland and Portugal grant voting rights only to expatriate nationals living in other member states, but other countries are more generous. For example, the United Kingdom grants voting rights to all its citizens who have been out of the state for less than 20 years.  Germany extends voting rights to all its nationals living in other member <Col N="697" /> states and to those who have lived in a non-member country for less than ten years.</P>
    <P>Time is running out and it is clear that the Community will not continue to tolerate Irish emigrants living in other member states being treated less favourably than citizens of other EC countries. It is ironic that in this legislation we are meeting the requirements of Article 8b (2) of the Maastricht Treaty which states that every citizen of the Union residing in a member state of which he or she is not a national shall have a right to vote and stand as a candidate, but we are failing to follow through on the logic of that Article by extending to our citizens living in other member states similar voting rights to those of citizens of the rest of the Community.</P>
    <P>Ritual expressions of concern about the welfare of our emigrants have become part of our political culture but, unfortunately, they do not appear to be anything more than that.  On every occasion on which successive Governments of different political hues have had the opportunity to do something concrete, such as granting emigrants a vote, even in regard to European elections, they have ducked the issue.  One of President Robinson's first actions on becoming President was to place a light in one of the windows of Aras an Uachtaráin to make a symbolic gesture in relation to the importance of our emigrants.  It is regrettable that the right to vote for those emigrants has not been a natural followon.</P>
    <P>Another major provision of this legislation is the adjustment of the Euro constituencies. While the legislation in that regard is based on the report of an independent commission, I do not believe the proposals are the best or fairest that could have been achieved.  The reduction from five to four in the number of seats for the Munster constituency was not unexpected, but closer consideration could have been given to the creation of an enlarged greater Dublin constituency rather than simply transferring the seat to Leinster.  The terms of reference laid down by the Government which spoke of <Col N="698" /> the desirability of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries limited the options open to the commission.  However, while a similar condition in respect of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries was put on the commission in regard to my county there seemed to be no problem about breaching, to no good avail, the boundary between Kildare and Wicklow. I know that my constituents of east Kildare would prefer to be represented by able Deputies from their own county, such as Deputy Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of them.  Some of them are very happy with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, Deputy McManus has not neglected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, geography has won.  I do not intend to neglect them and will continue to represent them, but in this case there is no natural reason for a county boundary to be breached.  It simply involved drawing a line on a map and it was unfortunate that people who had a natural affinity with urban centres in their county were included, rather clumsily, in the Wicklow region.  People living in urban, or at least suburban, towns around the perimeter of Dublin &mdash; Bray and similar towns in Kildare and Meath &mdash; are experiencing problems similar to those being experienced by people in parts of Dublin but because they live in a different catchment region their problems are not recognised.  We must examine how we devise the structures, which at present are fragmented and unnecessarily complicated, and streamline them on the basis of need rather than lines on a map.  At present the boundaries differ in respect of health services, the tourism authority, European Parliament representation and the regional bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No clear thought appears to be put into what is happening on the ground.  The Bray by-pass received EC structural funds but when that route reaches the Dublin-Wicklow border it becomes a rural route, even though the number of people using it is as great as that in the Dublin area.  For example, the standards <Col N="699" /> of public lighting on that national primary route are different from those in the Dublin area because Wicklow is considered a rural area.  It is difficult to know where the lines should be drawn.  I believe passionately in the county system, but that in no way negates the common grounds of concern.  For example, there are problems in regard to road subventions in North Kildare because it is treated as a rural area even though its population and traffic flows are similar to those in parts of Dublin, but that fact has never been acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will also mean that Dublin will be the most under-represented Irish Euro constituency, with 256,326 persons per member compared to 208,911 per member in Leinster. That imbalance should be addressed. This legislation also seeks to clarify the procedures to be adopted when casual vacancies occur in the European Parliament. It is certainly true that the 1984 legislation was not totally clear on these procedures and this legislation is welcome to the extent that it will remove any doubt in that regard.  There are, however, a number of technical amendments we will be tabling on Committee Stage to further clarify matters and to ensure that no undue delay takes place between a vacancy occurring and the completion of the substitution process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Power and Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>I welcome this basically technical Bill, which does not require much elaboration. I assure Deputy Molloy that Labour Party policy will continue to be to endeavour to secure legislation to provide for postal votes for emigrants whether we are in Government or out of Government.  Deputy Molloy did not mention merchant seamen, who always feel aggrieved that unlike their colleagues in the Defence Forces they are deprived of the vote because of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill justifies the argument that on the figures Leinster should have been a four seat constituency.  If this Bill had been introduced before the last European <Col N="700" /> Parliament elections, instead of being here today I would more than likely be in the European Parliament.  I welcome this Bill, particularly since I lost the last seat on the last occasion by ten votes after four recounts.  I am disappointed that the correction suggested by Judge Hamilton in the High Court is not contained in the Bill.  My reading of the judgment on the final count was that the judge was saying that it was not his responsibility to correct legislation but rather the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  The House will recall that on that occasion there were 14,000 spoiled votes, an astronomical number by any standards, due to the fact that two elections were held on the same day.  In Leinster very large numbers of voters marked their ballot papers from one to four on the Dáil paper and carried on the numbering from five to eight on the European ballot paper.  A rather unusual set of circumstances arose: either three returning officers were correct in their interpretation of the section and one was wrong, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>In hindsight the judge probably made the right decision, although it did not favour me, in so far as he left it to the Dáil and the Seanad to correct the anomaly. The chief returning officer, representing the Minister, was in the court during those proceedings.  My information is that the anomaly can be corrected by way of ministerial order under regulations attached to the Bill.  If the correction is not made, the electorate of Leinster will probably vote in the same way giving rise to the same volume of spoiled votes when the European elections and the local elections are held on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that they will and I am sure it will not be the only occasion on which two or more ballots will be taken on the same day.  We would obviously need all-party agreement on this issue.  Because of that anomaly in the Bill we spent ten months at considerable cost in the High Court after that election <Col N="701" /> to decide on the final seat in the European Parliament.  I appeal to the Minister to make the correction by way of ministerial order under the regulations.  I would hate to have to go through that a second time if I am nominated for the forthcoming European election.  I look forward to battling it out now in a four seater, if my colleagues decide to nominate me.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome the prospect of votes for nationals of the European Community living here.  Non-nationals living here should have the right to participate in the democratic process, as should Irish people living both here and abroad.  Traditionally in Europe, European elections are held on Sunday.  People whose work takes them away from home would have a much better chance of participating in an election if it was held on a Sunday as there is a greater possibility of them being able to be at home on that day.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill and I hope my points will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Stagg, on introducing his first Bill to the House.  I wish him well and hope it is the first of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fairly straightforward Bill. We had the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979 and we are now facing into our fourth direct election. Members of this House who have gone forward as candidates and have been elected to the European Parliament have <Col N="702" /> come in for a lot of criticism.  The European Parliament gives rise to a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation.  If one wants to become a member of the European Parliament, a stepping stone is to be a Member of this House; but it is difficult to understand how a person can do the two jobs at once.</P>
    <P>As things stand, it is not possible to participate fully in both Parliaments. However, if a person is a member of this Parliament there is no reason they should not contest the European elections but we should seek all-party agreement on this matter.  As we are aware, it can be approached in a number of ways.  When in Opposition, parties tend to adopt one approach and another when in government. There is no point in trying to cod the electorate as they deserve the best.  It is in all our interests therefore that we seek all-party agreement.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, the question of the way in which casual vacancies should be filled is dealt with in the Bill. In this regard difficulties arose in the past.  Without mentioning any names this matter had to be addressed and I am delighted the Minister has taken the opportunity on this occasion to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that the election will be held on Thursday, 9 June. I have said it before and I will say it again that elections should be held on a Sunday; that makes commonsense.  It is not convenient for young people in particular to cast their votes during the week. If we want to ensure that everyone is given an opportunity to vote in elections for the majority Sunday would be a more suitable day.  I would like to see the European elections held on a Sunday next year to give those who work away from home and students an opportunity to vote.  A number of years ago students attending Waterford Regional Technical College took a case and if followed through major difficulties will be encountered in future elections.  I hope, therefore, that the possibility of holding elections on a Sunday will be seriously considered with a view to holding the next European elections on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers expressed disappointment <Col N="703" /> at the current relationship between the two Parliaments.  I share the views expressed.  Although we have been electing members to the European Parliament since 1979 it appears that there is no co-operation.  We have elected some excellent members who have represented us well but their work has gone unnoticed at home.  It is vital and important from the point of view of the Government that people should be aware of the significance of the European Parliament and understand the way in which it can affect our lives.  As Deputy Hogan mentioned, very often EC Directives are not debated in this House.  In this regard we are aware of the episode during the year when it was proposed to abolish red lemonade but commonsense prevailed in the end. This should not be allowed to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of thanks to Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and his committee for the work they have done.  It appears that Mr. Justice Hamilton is called upon to perform a range of tasks.  We are indebted to him for the work he has done.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the constituency boundaries Mr. Justice Hamilton felt it was necessary that there should be an extra seat in Leinster given that the population in that region has increased.  I ask the Ministers when compiling the Estimates during the next few weeks to take cognisance of this fact and bear in mind that there is a need to channel funds towards this region, particularly those areas most in need.</P>

      <P>Almost everyone who has spoken is a potential candidate and I wish them well.  The debate that took place last week about the Structural Funds could have been avoided if members of the Opposition understood the way in which budgets are presented to the members of the European Parliament and debated and the way in which funds are allocated.  The heat and fire generated by that issue would not have been sustained if they had spent some time there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the commission and the Bill before the House and I thank the commission for the work they have done.  The purpose of the Bill is to transfer a seat from the Munster constituency to Leinster.  This is fair.  As other speakers have said the population of Leinster is increasing rapidly and there is a need for equality in terms of the number of seats in each constituency. There is no conflict between the people of Munster and Leinster but in drawing constituency boundaries there is a need to strike a reasonable balance in terms of the number of representatives per head of population.  Naturally, the contest in Leinster will be more heated.  I am sure I will be a member of the Labour Party team which will be fighting to regain a seat or seats in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament is the only democratic institution whose members are elected by the people.  Therefore it should be the most important institution within the European Community. However, as the number of member states increases the Irish voice will not be as strong.  When I first joined the European Parliament in 1973, when each of the Members was nominated there were 198 seats of which ten were held by Irish people.  In the next election there will be 576 seats of which only 15 will be filled in the Republic and three in the North.  This means, in percentage terms, that the number of seats available to this country will be reduced from 5 per cent <Col N="705" /> of the total number of seats available to slightly above 2.5 per cent.  As a consequence, our members will find it more difficult to get an opportunity to express their point of view regardless of which grouping they will be affiliated to.  While there are 166 Members in this House there will be 576 Members in the European Parliament &mdash; which meets in plenary session one week each month &mdash; who may wish to express their point of view either at Question Time or during debates on very important issues which affect all member states.</P>
    <P>There are 166 Members in this House but just imagine a one week plenary session each month of the European Parliament where 576 people may wish to put across their point of view at Question Time and during debates on important issues that affect all the nations of the European Community.  It is almost an impossibility to do so.  In this State we have had occasion to share 20 minutes between three Members but I had the experience when I was in the European Parliament of dividing five minutes between four of us and to get in a sensible comment within that time scale is very difficult.  The position has become worse since I was there in 1979.  It is one concern that should be included by our Government in its representations to the Council of Ministers and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The European Community is becoming unwieldy.  If many more join we will have to borrow the White House from Moscow, which is not in use at the moment.  It seems it would be the largest building to accommodate the numerical strength that will result if Austria, Sweden and Norway join the Community, as well as the amount of paper that will be got through to record the babble of voices saying the same thing in five, six or seven languages.  That is not referred to in this Bill; but I want to highlight that problem and warn Members going out there that they certainly will not have the latitude they have in this House to make a sensible, coherent case.  Cases will be made in the committees of the European Parliament which are not covered by the press and <Col N="706" /> which is a disadvantage to Members over there.  The result is that it seems one simply disappears out of sight when one goes to the European Parliament, although one is far busier there than one would be as a Member of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>The section that is giving some concern covers replacement and the filling of casual vacancies.  We had an example of a casual vacancy being filled by a member of a different party to the one that originally held the seat although the party that had fought the original election was still in existence.  That problem must be looked at because the reality is that that is the party the people voted for.  I have no hesitation in saying that a casual vacancy was filled by a Democratic Left candidate although The Workers' Party, which won the seat originally, is still in existence.  I make no plea for their party.  If we could have elected another Labour candidate in that area, this would not have worried me.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if this Bill covers that area.  I would like to see this included in the Bill so that the example I gave would not happen again.  Different groupings in the Parliament are joined, be they Socialists, Christian Democrats, Liberals or Communists.  Indeed, there is a Technical Group and, as it is known in Europe, the Rainbow Group, for people who are elected through the independent channel.  That raises another problem. How does one fill a vacancy created by an independent member?  How can one claim that somebody else is as independent as the original holder of the seat? It is because he is independent and wishes to maintain an independent identity that he puts his name forward as an independent. Therefore, I do not see how there can be a panel of other independent members to replace them because other independent members may have a totally different point of view.  This is not covered in the Bill, so I hope the Minister will comment on how to get around that problem.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to make my few points.  Once again, I wish all the candidates <Col N="707" /> standing in the election well.  I wish my own party's candidates success. I am glad to say that I will be helping them on this occasion and not worrying them by being a candidate myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to compliment the Minister on his first piece of legislation before the House.  I agree with previous speakers that what we are debating relates to technical provisions for the efficient execution of European Parliament elections.  I have no major reservations about the content of the Bill. The importance of the European Community in our lives was clearly exemplified last week during the confidence motion.  However, it should not be thought that we look to Europe solely for what we can gain financially.  We have contributed significantly to the creation of a new Europe in terms of the changes that have taken place even outside European Community boundaries in recent years.  We have played our part in the debates, in the negotiations and in the formulation of the new Europe and a possible enlarged European Community.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the growing importance of the European Parliament has been to the detriment of national parliaments.  The European elections next June, the fourth that we have had a direct input into, are of huge significance. A worrying aspect is the perception of the public that the European Community is far removed and of little or no consequence to them directly when in fact it is becoming as important, if not more important, than national parliaments.</P>
      <P>Another trend has been that national parliaments have lost out because of European Parliament and European Commission initiatives that have forced national parliaments to grant greater powers to local authorities and recognise the input that local communities can make towards resolving their own problems. An example is the Leader concept, the brainchild of the European Commission, which has worked extraordinarily well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is essentially a technical Bill dealing <Col N="708" /> with the allocation of seats through the various Euro constituencies.  Many of the previous speakers have, for geo-political reasons, concentrated their remarks on the fact that Leinster has gained an additional seat.  In terms of demographics, it is extremely difficult to argue against that provision.  I would like to be associated with the words of tribute to Mr. Justice Hamilton and others involved in determining the allocation of these seats through the independent commission.</P>
    <P>As a Dáil representative from Munster I would like to pay tribute to the five outgoing MEPs for the manner in which they executed their duties on behalf of their constituencies.  It is not clear at this stage if they will all contest the next European election and, if they do, the contest for four seats will prove interesting.  I am sure Fine Gael will seek to increase its representation despite the fact that the number of seats has been reduced.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up the point made previously in regard to the provision in the Bill for the filling of casual vacancies.  The point has been made that a vacancy for the European Parliament can be filled in ten days by a provision under this Bill. However, it appears there is no concern among those who draft legislation on behalf of the Government and who dictate which legislation should be given priority, and among Members on the Government benches about the fact that this House has for a considerable period of time been short of two Members, one from Mayo West constituency and one from a Dublin constituency.  It appears it will be June at the earliest before any steps will be taken to fill those vacancies and this is regrettable.  This technical legislation shows how a simple matter, such as casual vacancies in the European Parliament, can be dealt with.  I am not suggesting any unilateral solution in terms of co-options for by-elections, but if the heat were taken out of the pending by-elections we could consider in a rational manner whether it is desirable that the business of this House should be <Col N="709" /> disturbed to fill every casual vacancy that arises by way of a by-election.  Some sort of arrangement, for example, either through co-option from the party affected, the next candidate on the ballot paper of the previous election or some such system could be put in place to ensure that no sections of the population are under-represented as is the case in the two constituencies I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats regarding the filling of casual vacancies and the merits and demerits of the list system.  The list and the substitute candidates were voted on by the electorate in the last European elections.  Therefore, those on the list received an endorsement from the electorate.  Any efforts to fly in the face of that provision is undesirable. I understand Deputy Molloy's point and his fancy political footwork in respect of his reservations on this issue, however, the fundamental issue is that the list is a true reflection of the democratic wishes of the people because it has been endorsed by the people in the election.</P>
    <P>I welcome the granting of voting rights to non-nationals, those who come from other EC countries.  That arrangement is reciprocated in respect of Irish emigrants who wish to vote in European elections in other EC countries.  We read about voting rights for emigrants in the Joint Programme for a Partnership Government. The commitment in the programme will be hollow if at the first electoral outing of this Government, which will take place almost two years from when it entered office, no concrete steps have been taken to grant voting rights to emigrants.  Fine Gael has a solution to this problem which it has explained at length which is not as extensive as the commitment entered into by the Government.  However, the Government's commitment rings hollow when at the first outing those emigrants whose hopes have been raised by Government Ministers and commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government are dashed by those Ministers who will turn their backs on them and not grant <Col N="710" /> them voting rights in the European Elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Some members of the Deputy's party are still opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>No they are not.  On the contrary, Fine Gael has agreed to give voting rights to emigrants for a select number of seats in the Seanad and that is a commendable and workable solution. It remains to be seen whether the shenanigans in which the Minister is involved, the commitments which his party entered into and the constitutional difficulties which they may pose, can be surmounted or whether the commitment was a last resort to round off a partnership programme, a great deal of which is based on day dreams rather than political reality.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that there is no provision under the Bill for termination of a dual mandate after an opportune time has elapsed whereby the Member can forego his or her dual mandate.  As a member of a local authority and a Member of this House, I admit that at times it is a difficult task to serve both masters.  Presently, two Members, Deputies Cox and Blaney, have a dual mandate to serve this House and the European Parliament.  Both Members are exceedingly able contributors and the electorate have decided they are worthy of membership of both of those Assemblies. However, the question must be asked when the Deputies make a contribution in this House or in the European Parliament are they in effect in dereliction of their responsibilities in the other Assembly?  Whilst it would be a significant loss to those two Assemblies to forego representation from those two Members, I believe the national interest is not served by Members being allowed to continue to attempt to serve both masters and, inevitably, to serve both inadequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I referred to the public's perception of the operations at European level and their sense of alienation from and almost hostility towards the political process and the fact that the European Parliament is one further step removed. <Col N="711" /> The public are perhaps less hostile and certainly less aware of the operation of the European Parliament.  An opportunity was missed under this legislation to improve the linkages and accountability which our MEPs could avail of by rights of audience and attendance at committee meetings of this House, particularly the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the sub-Committee on European Communities Legislation.  They would be the appropriate bodies at which our MEPs could advise and respond to queries and facilitate a bridge-building exercise between the European Parliament, this House and the public.</P>
    <P>The media has an enormous role to play in highlighting and explaining the operations of the European institutions, not least of which is the European Parliament. Unfortunately, to date, most media coverage appears to focus on the Commission rather than on the directly elected representatives in the European Parliament.  That says much about where ultimate power rests in the European Community.  It must be recognised that after each European election, further powers are given to the elected members of the European Parliament.  Greater public awareness and accountability is, therefore, demanded and the media has an important role to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the contents of the Bill.  Certain aspects could have been adequately dealt with if the Minister had seized the opportunity, particularly in terms of ending the dual mandate and improving the bridge-building process between the European Parliament and this House which could be done by way of granting rights of audience to members of the European Parliament on special committees of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. In timely fashion, before next year's elections to the European Parliament, it seeks to put our affairs in order in relation to that Parliament.  It is a fair criticism of all Irish political parties that they have not taken the European Parliament <Col N="712" /> seriously.  A game of musical chairs, referred to earlier, has been cynically played with our representation there. This has had two effects: first, Ireland's representation in the European Parliament has not been as effective as it might have been and, second, it has increased cynicism and apathy at home regarding the Parliament.  Both these effects are contrary to the national interest.  In the European Community after Maastricht, Ireland has been ill prepared to deal with the new balance of power in the Community.  That balance is tilting towards the Parliament.  All political parties must take a much more serious view of an increasingly important situation.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the allocation of one extra seat to Leinster and I look forward to the benefits such extra representation will bring to the province. Like Deputy Power, I hope that the disbursement of funds is reflected in that extra seat.  The provisions of the Bill dealing with the filling of vacancies are especially welcomed.  I have already referred to the cynical game of musical chairs played with our representation in the European Parliament.  It is a consolation, if only a small one, that Fianna Fáil has not been the worst offender in this regard.  However, all parties, including Fianna Fáil, have not given of their brightest or best in European elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;mainly because ministerial and Front Bench duty has first call.  I join Deputy Hogan in complimenting all those who have represented us in Europe in the past.  The image of the Parliament as a retirement club or rest home for Irish politicians is not without foundation.  We must select our most able and bright people, the best in our ranks, to represent us in Europe.  By speaking on this matter nobody should believe that I intend to put forward my name as a candidate for Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of the Bill <Col N="713" /> which enables any European Community citizen to stand as a candidate in a European constituency within the Community. This deepens the concept of Community citizenship and enhances the legitimacy of our political structures.  This measure could, with a little imagination and foresight, broaden the candidate pool available to Irish political parties.  If a Dubliner can be President of Israel, a son of Wexford Prime Minister of New Zealand and a great grandson of Wexford President of the USA, there is no reason an Italian or German cannot represent an Irish constituency in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Community is not only about privileges; it is about obligations.  Our first obligation to Europe and our first duty to our own self-interest is to become more Eurocentric in our approach and our outlook. A failure to think Europe as distinct from talking Europe has cost us dearly in our preparedness for the new institutional balances developing.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn my attention to the emerging European institution framework. Since our accession to the European Community in 1973 and more particularly since the passing of the Single European Act in 1987, there has been a democratic deficit in the Community.  By this I mean that the accountability of the Community has not expanded in line with its competence.  In the western tradition of liberal democracy, traditional acceptance of political authority stems from accountability of the Executive to parliament. In the European Community this does not exist.  Political authority and legitimacy are highly diffuse in the Community. This has led to the authority and public standing of the Community's institutions being diminished.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act of 1987 was the first major adjustment to the Treaty of Rome since Ireland joined the Community in 1973.  It re-routed the EC to its original objectives, widened its policy scope and reordered its priorities.  The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 was the interim fulfilment of the objectives stated and implied by the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> The Single European Act greatly enhanced efficiency of the Community. It did nothing, however, to enhance its legitimacy.  In fact it greatly increased the democratic deficit.  By introducing majority voting at council level, the power of national parliaments was greatly diminished, but there was no consumate increase in the power of the European Parliament.  The powers to legislate and raise taxes are the basic rights and duties of any elected parliament.  The democratic deficit continues to be exacerbated by the fact that the Council of Ministers deliberates and votes in secret.  The Council of Ministers is subject neither to the effective control of the European Parliament nor, since 1987, to national parliaments.</P>
    <P>In consequence, the emerging concept of European citizenship has no corresponding sense of representation in the Community.  The institutions of the Community operate largely without reference to popular will.  In the long term, without major institutional reform, we will find that Community foundations are built on sand.  The fault lines in Community structure will be widened to cracking point by enlargement.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the process of reform has begun.  The European Parliament we will elect next year, the fourth directly elected parliament, will be an institution beginning to come to its maturity.  This crucial change in the balance of power in Europe is something to which Ireland has given little thought.  Furthermore, our political parties are as unprepared as they are unenthusiastic.  This is a mistake.  The national interest is at risk by a collectively casual attitude to the parliament and its development.</P>
    <P>In so far as Ireland has an approach to the parliament it is one developed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and expressed by successive Governments. That is a minimalist approach.  The Irish minimalist approach to the development of the European Parliament arises from our tradition of a strong Executive and a weak parliamentary tradition.  A pliant parliament is nothing new in the Irish political culture.  The grand approach to <Col N="715" /> constitutional and policy development is alien to us.  We are given to dealing with affairs on an issue by issue basis and traditionally disinclined to deal with frameworks and fundamentals.  A timid, underfunded and understaffed Parliament has, in the face of a powerful and overstaffed Civil Service, accepted this. All this must change, indeed this change has begun.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament's power of co-decision, which began in 1987, is to be expanded and its area of competence increased.  From 1995, the Parliament's control over the Commission will be increased.  The Parliament will also have the power to appoint an Ombudsman. Foundations of stone are replacing foundations of sand.  However, questions still remain to be answered.  For example, will the Ombudsman have access to national papers and civil servants?  I certainly hope he will.  If this is the case, the European Parliament will have powers denied to committees of this House. While this may be ironic, effective parliamentary scrutiny must begin somewhere. The issue of the powers to be accorded to committees of the European Parliament has still to be decided.  I favour a maximalist approach.  Only vested and inept interests with something to hide need fear scrutiny.  The Parliament's expansion, via the Council of Ministers, and its greater influence on the Commission will increase its visibility and decrease the democratic deficit.</P>
    <P>Between now and 1996, when Maastricht will be reviewed, certain matters must receive our constructive attention. For example, we must debate and decide in an open way how the national interest can be best served by the changing institutional scene in Europe.  One possible direction in which the Community could go is to make the Commission a true government of the Community, routed in Parliament.  Arguably, the first tentative steps in this direction are now being taken: the Commission would depend on the confidence of the Parliament on both a personal and policy level and the Council would reserve the right of veto and <Col N="716" /> have exclusive competence in areas such as external trade, external relations and security.  Having regard to this model, it would remain an open question as to whether the Council would act as an electoral college or an appointive body for the Commission.  An alternative option would be for the President to choose his Commission from the members of the Parliament, with national governments perhaps having a power of veto.  This and other proposals in circulation are not far fetched.</P>
    <P>The present situation and enlargement will demand wholesale institutional reform.  We must set out a clear set of priorities and an informed agenda for this development.  This task has not yet begun.  If the national consensus is against giving sweeping new powers to the Parliament then ways of enhancing the Council and Commission must be found.  A key way of furthering the legitimacy of the Council is to make its deliberations and votes public.  Such a development is inevitable and welcome in any scenario.  Regardless of the direction of events, the strengthening of the Parliament's links with, and accountability to, national Parliaments need to be examined and furthered.  The democratic deficit, enlarged by the Single European Act of 1987, must be abolished.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the much used and little understood concept of subsidiarity. Subsidiarity is taken to mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to develop the point on subsidiarity, which is closely connected to the European Parliament elections. This concept was used by Aristotle and, without giving the House a history lesson, is very important.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has knocked me off my stride and I will hand over to the very eloquent speaker on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can match the eloquence of the previous speaker or bring Aristotle into play in support of the arguments I wish to make. The feature of the Bill I want to address in particular is that of casual vacancies and the principles by which such vacancies in the European Parliament are filled.</P>
      <P>It seems that the original arrangements whereby members of the European Parliament could be substituted one for the other brought the European Parliamentary system into question &mdash; there was some degree of adverse public scrutiny because it was thought that these were sinecures.  An attempt was made to remedy this situation by the introduction of a list of substitute candidates in the previous amending legislation.  I concede that the idea behind this list was that people should not be brought from nowhere and suddenly put into the public eye as MEPs: it was thought it would take from the mandate of a member of the European Parliament to some extent if he or she had never been the subject of the slightest publicity or public acceptability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of a list of substitute candidates is somewhat defective in this regard.  I do not know anybody in the Dublin region who ever looked at a list of substitute candidates before they decided to vote for a particular party.  I do not believe any Member of this House could say, with their hand on their heart, that a member of the European Parliament was elected because of the quality of the published list of substitute candidates. Indeed, I would say that the great majority of the electorate are completely unaware of the identity of the substitute <Col N="718" /> candidates and could not care less about the list.  I do not think anyone ever decided to vote for, say, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa because Des Geraghty was second or third on the list.  I believe people do not really care about this issue.</P>
    <P>Subject to the basic proposition that the substitution of one candidate for another should not be open to abuse, there should be flexibility in terms of this list.  Having regard to the fact that the European Parliament will remain in office for a fixed number of years, during which there may be events which make one substitute more or less desirable than another, the notion of preordaining the order in which people are to be selected as a substitute for an individual is inherently flawed.  To take one example a person named as a substitute candidate might have become, say, nationally discredited in the intervening period and might for one reason or another have fallen in huge measure in public esteem. It might be that a person in those circumstances had become ill or had in the meantime changed his or her views so substantially as to make them controversial. This can happen in the context of a pre-ordained ranking of substitute candidates.  Since people have little regard for the order in which names are laid out on the substitute lists, it is foolish then to say as a matter of law that that ranking is to have significance later. Instead of having a pecking order ordained in advance, parties should be permitted to put a number of possible candidates before the electorate as substitutes of equal ranking.  It should be provided also that in the event of a casual vacancy arising, the parties themselves would select, in accordance with their own party rules, which of those persons was or was not the most suitable person to succeed to the seat vacated.</P>
    <P>That would allow a reasonable amount of flexibility.  The process whereby one becomes the third rather than the fifth candidate on a substitute list is so hidden from the public view that it cannot be a matter of great public interest as to whether the third or the fifth person is selected in any given circumstance.  Ordinary <Col N="719" /> rationality calls on us to query whether it is right to stick to the notion of serial candidates in a pre-ordained order.</P>
    <P>A point that occurs to me that doubtless has not escaped the Minister's mind is that it would be open to any party under the present regime effectively to eliminate a candidate by denying that candidate membership if it anticipated one way or another that a casual vacancy was about to occur.  If I was first in the list of substitutes and my party had decided that my views were no longer acceptable or that they wanted the number two man or woman to get the vacancy, it is open to that party simply to terminate my membership and according to the rubric laid down here, and under the existing law, I am thereby ineligible to become the substitute in the case of a casual vacancy.  For instance, it would be open to a party, if it wanted to choose the fifth candidate and was unhappy with the other four, simply to terminate the membership of the first four candidates and thereby deprive them of eligibility under the proposal.</P>
    <P>A political party is allowed, in principle, the right to deny the next person in the pecking order a seat by depriving them of membership of the party.  If such a brutal method of achieving a result is allowed, one should be willing to permit a party to engage in a slightly more sensitive approach to the same issue, namely, to set out in its rules a means whereby a substitute candidate is selected.  This could be by the parliamentary party, by a convention or by some kind of vote within the party membership since that is how the pecking order was established in the first place.  I do not see what is right or necessary about a pre-ordained and inflexible system such as proposed compared with the flexible panel system which I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>I would go even further by suggesting that even in relation to a panel, if a very good candidate emerges between one election and another, an eligible person who was not available to that party for one reason or another at the time of the first election, for instance, because he or <Col N="720" /> she was a Member of this House and did not feel that they wanted to offer themselves as a substitute candidate but had lost their seat in the interval, a political party would not be doing an injustice to the electorate by selecting such a person to be a substitute candidate. Alternatively, if a person of undeniable talent became available to a political party, in circumstances that were not foreseeable at the time that the original selection convention took place and the original pecking order was established, should the party not be permitted in that context to decide on its own initiative to put that person into the panel and to have an election within the party to fill the casual vacancy?</P>
    <P>I mention this because in elections past there has been a notion &mdash; and perhaps this is confined to my party, although I suspect it is fairly general &mdash; that the substitute panel of candidates is put in place so as to suggest an even spread across the constituency, thereby gathering local support and creating the impression of a general distribution of political appeal.  That is precisely the wrong reason for deciding who will be a substitute.  For example, if the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, was a candidate there is no reason why there should not be three other equally suitable substitutes from Kildare.  What is the point in saying that we must have somebody from Louth, Kildare, Wicklow and elsewhere in order to create an impression that party support is widespread or that the ticket is broadly distributed and representative of the entire constituency?  It is not because only one person can have the seat and unless and until one's substitute status becomes of relevance, it is entirely a dead duck.</P>
    <P>The idea of having a list of substitutes is rather inflexible.  It should be possible for a political party, by a formal process of notification, to amend a list of substitute candidates.  It may well be argued that there is no point in having a list but it might be argued also, for instance, that if an amendment was to be made at some time, say, six months before a casual vacancy arose to put somebody else in place as one of the eligible people on its <Col N="721" /> panel, in those circumstances the public would have an opportunity to see what was planned and to express some view to which the political party in question would presumably be sensitive.  Most political parties are not dominated by any one individual to such an extent that the ordinary membership of the party would be willing to surrender to its national executive or its leader an arbitrary personal choice in the matter.  However, if a political party wants to do that and if the electorate know that that is the basis on which substitutes would be selected in the context of an election, people should accept that.  For instance, if the Labour Party were to have a rule that Deputy Spring could select a substitute by virtue of the fact that he was Leader of the party, is it so terrible a notion that people voting for the Labour candidate would know that it was open under Labour Party rules, as distinct from, say, other parties' rules, for the Leader of the party to nominate the substitute rather than the general membership of the party in the constituency in question?</P>
    <P>What is so terribly wrong about all of that?  If some elementary precautions are put in place I suggest we could avoid any sense of abuse or devaluation in relation to the holding of European Parliamentary seats.  I appreciate fully that it would be undesirable if people were allowed to parade a succession of nonentities into the European Parliament for the purpose of giving them jobs, stature or whatever.  I appreciate that those are vices we should avoid.  But I do not see it follows that at the beginning of a European election we should decide, in the case of any candidate representing a constituency as large as Leinster, that the order in which people are to substitute for him or her at any time during his or her tenure of a seat is to be determined in advance by a process which is wholly invisible, wholly opaque to the people and in circumstances in which the people do not know or care what order was actually established.</P>
    <P>Could anybody put their hand on their heart and say that even 5 per cent of the electorate look at the substitute list and <Col N="722" /> say: &ldquo;Well, Michael McDowell is only a heartbeat away from succeeding to Pat Cox's seat and that influences my vote&rdquo;? Could anyone put their hand on their heart and say that any significant proportion of the electorate would be the slightest bit influenced as to who was the second on a list?  If so, I would say &ldquo;Very well, then, let us examine this matter further&rdquo;.  But since all of us in our hearts know that the electorate is completely uninterested in such a proposition, completely ignorant of it, do not care how the political parties decide the pecking order and, frankly, that even if they were made aware of it would not retain it in their minds for a second, if that is the factual position then why are we putting in place such a complex system as this, which I contend has buried within it a major flaw?</P>
    <P>One thing that interested me, which was pointed out to me by the general secretary of my party, is that the procedure envisaged in the event of a casual vacancy arising is that the Clerk of the Dáil would write to the people named in the substitute list in the order in which they appear and ask them to fill out a statutory declaration saying that they were ready to act, that they were eligible and lastly, that they were still a member of the political party concerned.</P>
    <P>It amuses me to imagine what would happen if, say, Deputy Sheila de Valera or Deputy Killeen, who have lost the whip of the Fianna Fáil Party or Deputy Desmond O'Malley, prior to his visit to Mount Street, or the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, for that matter, were asked to put their hands on their hearts and make a statutory declaration as to whether they were or were not a member of a political party on a specific day. In that context it amuses me that no distinction is drawn between someone who has flown completely in the face of the party's organisation, ignored it and maybe embarrassed it and someone who has walked out of political life.  It amuses me that in those circumstances a person can be imposed by the Clerk of the Dáil on the people because a list exists somewhere which 99.999 per cent of the <Col N="723" /> people never heard of and none of them could care about.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this procedure and consider whether it would not be desirable to put in place a more flexible system, one which would be less likely to give rise to controversy and in which a party could not simply circumvent by expelling a person.  For instance, at present it would be possible for the Fianna Fáil Party, if Deputy Sheila de Valera's name appeared at the top of the list, to crown her achievement of departure from the party by expelling her from the party for conduct unbecoming, as has happened some Members of this House.  In those circumstances that would be the end of it, she would no longer be eligible.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this scheme is impractical, has not been well thought out and that there is a far better way of achieving the same result, one which would be more flexible, more likely to give rise to good candidates being made available rather than geographical spreads producing relative nonentities on the substitute list.  We must remember that circumstances change in politics.  To take an example, somebody could, as has Deputy Desmond O'Malley, step down from the leadership of a party and suddenly become available in circumstances which had not been anticipated.  That type of flexibility would appear to me to be more desirable than an inflexible rule such as that proposed here.</P>
    <P>I would genuinely ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, to reconsider the principles laid down in the new substitute section 15 of the Principal Act, proposed to be inserted by section 7 of this Bill, and consider whether he could not bring a good deal more openness, flexibility and accountability to politics than the provisions of this Bill, as at present drafted imply.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  It is appropriate that we should discuss the electoral system for the European Parliament and all its nuances, particularly since Europe is <Col N="724" /> gaining in significance for us.  At least I would hope it is gaining in significance for us; certainly the week before last it was quite significant and, according to all reports, will be significant over the coming five years.</P>
      <P>I want to comment briefly on a couple of matters and to comment positively on the proposals in relation to voting in the European elections in general.  I might take up one of the points made by Deputy Michael McDowell in relation to the filling of vacancies.  I must be the odd one out in this debate because I honestly cannot understand why a vacancy as important as one in the European Parliament should be filled in what I might describe as a rather casual manner by way of a list system.  Although the list system is something accepted in other democracies, it is something with which I do not personally agree and cannot understand why we so readily adopt it.</P>
      <P>The only other place to which one can gain access probably is a county council. As the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg and I know only too well, two Members of this House did gain access to Kildare County Council by way of co-option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably it will defeat the argument I was about to make, with all due modesty.  It seems very odd that an institution as important as the European Parliament at a crucial time should be left to the whim of parties, or of a party leader, rather than the electorate.  If, for instance, in four years' time a casual vacancy arises which has to be filled by agreement under the list system and so on, I would have no difficulty with that. But, if there is a vacancy a year or 18 months into the term of the European Parliament, I honestly believe there should be something akin to a by-election. If Europe is supposed to be as important, as we all claim it is, then surely we should go through at least the same procedures as we do in relation to the filling of a vacancy in our own Parliament. That would appear to me to be a natural follow-up.  I know there will be <Col N="725" /> those who will ask: why should we go through all the trauma and hassle associated with a by-election when we can find an equally acceptable way of doing the job.  Well, it may be acceptable, but I am not so sure it would be as democratic as one would like.</P>
      <P>To follow through on what Deputy Michael McDowell was saying &mdash; and here I have to concede to his eminence as a lawyer &mdash; I would have to say to him, with no disrespect whatsoever, that it would be a labyrinth in which the legal profession would have great fun.  Take the case of a member being expelled from his parliamentary party or party a week or two before a vacancy was about to be filled.  I can just imagine the arguments being advanced on his behalf by his counsel to ensure that his party was not going to disenfranchise that unfortunate individual at a crucial time in his or her political career.  It is an interesting argument, but as a non-legal person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well imagine what Deputy McDowell is thinking about, a Cheann Comhairle.  Indeed I am quite sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, can envisage that as well.  But let us consider the amount of time and energy that would be dissipated in pursuit of the arguments advanced on both sides in such circumstances. I do not think it would be all that easy for a party to disenfranchise an individual because, for its own reasons, it wanted to replace him or her on a particular panel or ticket.</P>
      <P>They would find it very difficult to win that case in court.  Natural justice prevailing the learned judges may come down on the side of the individual who was put at a disadvantage by virtue of that decision.  That would not be a starter but it is an interesting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It reminds me of the kind of legal arguments that often arise when a general election is called, someone says that the election is unconstitutional for one reason or another and an appeal is made to the courts to declare its constitutionality. <Col N="726" /> We often look with a certain degree of hope at such a situation but, by and large, the courts in their wisdom, do not want to interfere too much and they generally leave us to our own devices and the electorate.  That brings me back to my argument that there is a case, despite what people may say, for having normal, standard by-elections in the case of the filling of vacancies in the European Parliament.  That is the democratic way to fill such vacancies and I see nothing wrong with it.  I do not see it as being any more expensive than holding a by-election to fill a vacancy in the Dáil, the Seanad or any other place. I am not an aficionado of the list system, I believe everybody should carry their own burdens.  That is one matter about which I feel strongly.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McDowell said, the electorate will not have too much regard for the person who is number two or number three on a list.  They will not look at its relevance when they are voting.  They may have no influence on who represents them in the European Parliament.  At a time when Europe is becoming more important how do they influence the selection of that person other than by means of the political party concerned? That does not fulfil the finer points of democracy to which we would all like to aspire.  The list system operates in many democracies throughout Europe but it is not one with which I agree.  I am sure many colleagues also disagree with it. They may not all be on the front benches but they disagree with the list system on the basis that it gives preference to one as opposed to another.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything further except to point out the importance of filling vacancies in the European Parliament given that Europe means so much to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their general support for the Bill.  As I said, there are three basic points in the Bill: first, the transfer of a seat from Munster to the Leinster constituency; <Col N="727" /> second, to extend the right to stand as candidates in the European election to EC nationals resident in Ireland and, third, to clarify the position concerning the filling of casual vacancies.  As two Members raised the latter issue I should like to deal with it.  There may be sense in what Deputies McDowell and Durkan said on this issue but we are dealing with a resolution passed by the European Parliament concerning our procedures.  They have been quite specific in stating by resolution to us that they do not want flexibility. They want a very clear definite system without flexibility.  The argument they make &mdash; and which I am now trying to implement &mdash; is that the electorate, not political parties, must have the power to decide.  Perhaps we need to bring those on the priority list to the attention of the public so that when making a decision about whom they elect to the European Parliament they will take it on board.  On Committee Stage we will seek to deal with that point more definitely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan raised a number of issues concerning the national plan which were not directly connected with the Bill. There was extensive consultation on this matter and the result is a positive dynamic plan which has a very good geographic spread.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy implied that everything positive that happened since the foundation of the State arose directly from his involvement and that everything negative was caused by somebody else.  He referred to a revision of Dáil constituencies. The census of population for 1991 indicates wide-ranging changes and differences between constituencies.  An example of this is that there are 223,718 people per one MEP in one Dublin North constituency and 19,000 persons per one MEP in the constituency of Tipperary North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conferring the right to stand as candidates at European elections on EC nationals represents a fairly substantial change in our electoral law.  The reallocation of the Euro seat is also of considerable importance, particularly to intending candidates.  Otherwise, the Bill <Col N="728" /> is essentially a technical measure and I look forward to a close scrutiny of its provisions on Committee Stage.  Because of the time constraint I will not attempt to deal with the many other points raised by Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement by Telecom Éireann that the rescheduling of telephone charges had led to a reduction in the use of telephones compounds the fiasco engineered by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and Telecom Éireann when the rescheduling was announced last May.  Today at Question Time, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications confirmed there had been an 8 per cent reduction in the number of calls made from telephones in the residential sector and the duration of calls had decreased by 6 per cent.  When Telecom Éireann originally costed its rescheduling programme it indicated that the gap between increases in concessions represented a £15 million annual loss to the company, even though it hoped to recover this loss by an increase in business.  The Telecom Éireann survey on the first four weeks of the operation of the new schedule of charges shows a loss of £750,000 per <Col N="729" /> week.  I have no doubt that the former patterns of usage will reassert themselves very quickly but if the pattern of losses were to continue the extra annual loss would be £39 million.  I believe this will not happen and very quickly we will return to the opening position of the telecommunications debate which commenced last May.  Previous usage patterns will reassert themselves and then, as the Minister knows quite well, consumers' bills will increase by very significant amounts.  The Minister cannot have it both ways: he accepts that there will either be a reduction in usage which will lead to continuing losses in Telecom Éireann or he must agree that previous patterns will reassert themselves and Telecom Éireann's losses will not continue. That leads to a situation where bills to residential customers will increase by significant amounts.  As a matter of fact, the change in usage pattern that Telecom Éireann has identified over the past four weeks or so confirms also that 50 per cent of domestic bills have increased by up to 10 per cent &mdash; and that is with the changing pattern of use.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not know, but I am sure the Minister will provide us with that information later on. My preliminary point is that one can put one's money on the changing pattern of usage not continuing in the future and Telecom Éireann recovering its temporary losses from the badly handled rescheduling or that bills will not go up, but you cannot go both ways.  Telecom Éireann and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications are responsible for the débâcle.  No commercial State company should be facing losses of the magnitude indicated by the Telecom Éireann survey.  The Minister, in seeking to blame the Opposition parties for the reduction in usage and the consequent losses, as he has done at Question Time, is being disingenuous, if not downright dishonest.  The Minister is personally responsible for the fiasco and failed to make a reasoned decision on Telecom <Col N="730" /> Éireann's submission for a price rescheduling. The message has been so confused that there has been a significant reduction in trunk and international calls by domestic consumers, the very area where reductions rather than increases were heralded.</P>
      <P>The initial announcement of the rescheduling was accompanied by a campaign of misinformation &mdash; more by accident than by design, I think.  Claims were made that all telephone bills would be reduced.  This was made by a Telecom Éireann spokesman at the earlier stages, the new schedule of charges was published in a newspaper exclusive of VAT, even though the Government had decided that the liability for VAT, which up to then was partially covered by the company, was to be totally transferred to the customer.  Increases in the cost of faxes and calls from call boxes in private premises were hidden from the consumer; call boxes in private premises were adjusted ahead of schedule in the summer; VAT was increased prematurely in early September on calls made in July and August and the Minister, under public pressure, had to intervene to reverse this decision and instruct Telecom Éireann that it was not entitled to charge VAT on calls made in July and August and it would have to compensate those charged by refunding their VAT payment and notify them that the increased VAT applied from 1 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial announcement of rescheduling was accompanied by a campaign of misinformation and this is still casting a shadow over the rescheduling of charges. The customer has been totally confused and I am not a bit surprised that there has been a downturn in usage by ordinary residents.  I am not a bit surprised that the chief executive of Telecom Éireann says that people are afraid to use their telephones.  They are afraid to use their telephones because of the manner in which the rescheduling was introduced, the claims that were made for it and the correct belief that if they continue the same pattern of usage they will face significant increases in their bills.  The Minister <Col N="731" /> was quite irate and said we were claiming that telephone bills would go up by over 400 per cent.  I never made that claim and I never heard any member of my party make that claim.  The only claim we made was that if one was on a call for a 15 minute period at prime time, the fixed period for local calls before the rescheduling, the increase in the charge would be over 400 per cent.  We did not say that would apply to the telephone bill. We gave the actual fact of the situation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I know there is no requirement for the Minister to listen to what we say and I am sure he only catches the air of it now and again, just like snatches of a song played in the distance that one tunes into very rarely and often at one remove.  That is the position.  I said the cost of calls had gone up by that amount for the 15 minute period during prime time.  However, I maintain that telephone bills for residential customers will increase quite significantly through a combination of increases for local calls and increases in VAT, which now becomes the liability of the customer.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister was as surprised as a great many other people here, as the saga unfolded, but he has responsibility for Telecom Éireann and there is no point in blaming Telecom because the buck stops at his desk.  He is not slow to claim credit when things go right so he must carry the can when things go badly.  It is time for a new approach to Telecom Éireann.  As well as providing a platform for all Deputies who are interested in debating the revolution in the telecommunications industry and the role that Telecom Éireann should play in that, I recommend the individual proposals of this Bill to Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is a very good State company.  Since it was established in 1983 it has improved the service out of all proportion as prior to that time telecommunications services were provided <Col N="732" /> by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Then Telecom Éireann and An Post were established and services have improved in both State companies beyond what we had been accustomed to when the functions were carried out by the Department.</P>
    <P>I note that investment was not made on the establishment of the State companies and certainly while it was still within the ambit of the Department.  Many changes were taking place and significant capital investment was being made, but it was made in anticipation of the establishment of the State company.  Telecom Éireann carried out its task in a commendable fashion throughout the years.  It involved itself in major capital programmes, the most modern telecommunications services were installed and to a very large degree they have been made available as a universal service throughout the country to both manufacturing and service industries.  In doing so, Telecom Éireann has enhanced this country's attractiveness as a location both for manufacturing and service industries.  One of the main complaints of industries established under the very high grant regime of the seventies was that they badly needed the grants because the infrastructure was so bad and they pointed in particular to the difficulties of making trunk calls to Dublin as well as international calls.  Good telecommunications is a prerequisite of manufacturing and service industries and Telecom Éireann has provided that service.  Workers, management and those who served on the board for nominal sums and the trade unions representing the workers over the years should be complimented not only on the improvement of the service but on the improvement in productivity in the company.  As a matter of fact, contrary to conventional wisdom, the productivity attained by Telecom Éireann during the 1980s has been at the top of the league table in Europe.</P>
    <P>Greater competitive gains have been achieved by Telecom Éireann than by any other national service provider in Europe and international statistics are available to confirm that.  It achieved <Col N="733" /> those gains at a price and from a low base and that should be recognised.  In cutting costs and paring down the company many redundancies were made, with little trauma to the company or the public at large although at personal loss to many of those who worked in the company.  In advocating change in respect of Telecom Éireann it is only proper that the proud record of that company and its workers, who continue to provide a good service, should be acknowledged.  I understand there is agreement in principle for further cutbacks in Telecom Éireann, involving 2,000 redundancies.</P>
    <P>I make those points because Government Deputies will probably misconstrue the purpose of this Bill and mislead the public by portraying the measures I propose as an attack on Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The exact opposite is my intention.  Technology is changing so rapidly and the telecommunications industry is in such a state of flux that if the Minister and Telecom Éireann do not control events by taking positive decisions in respect of the company, they will end up reacting to events from a very weak position when matters go outside their control.  That is what happened in respect of Aer Lingus and we should reflect on its problems when dealing with Telecom Éireann. Anybody who reflects on the problems of Aer Lingus will realise that the type of action now being agreed between management, unions and Government was necessary as far back as 1988 and might not have had to be as drastic if it had been taken at that time.  Nevertheless, it was necessary in terms of cost cutting, making new arrangements in respect of schedules and providing an equity injection from the Government, but the Government and management procrastinated until Aer Lingus was almost bankrupt.  I do not believe any of us wish to see a similar position develop in respect of Telecom Éireann.  In my view, certain policy decisions need to be taken shortly to ensure Telecom Éireann survives <Col N="734" /> as a service provider, is able to provide a good international service to Irish businesses and consumers and compete with competitive forces.</P>
      <P>One of the most glaring omissions in Telecom Éireann's policy is its apparent disregard for its customers.  By and large, this no doubt is due to the fact that it is a monopolistic service provider.  That cannot, however, excuse a situation whereby this year Telecom Éireann seemed to regard its customers as an inconvenience, whom it massaged with misleading information and kept them in the dark about many of its real intentions. That is no way to treat the customer.  Any commercial operation must sell more of its goods and services if it is to grow and prosper but many people do not realise that.  Telecom Éireann cannot grow and prosper if a major plank of its marketing strategy is to advise people to use fewer of its services in order to keep their bills low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB introduced a similar campaign in the late seventies when it was trying to avoid huge capital expenditure by not getting involved in the expense of extra generation capacity, but at least it advised people to switch off lights and so on to conserve energy.  It is despicable that representatives of Telecom Éireann should inform the public on television and radio that they do not have a problem, all they need do is stop using the telephone.  The ultimate logic of that is for people to disconnect their telephones and they will not have any problem.  No private company would operate on that basis, no company that did not have a monopoly, whether public or private, would adopt such an approach.  Every commercial organisation with which I am familiar, whether it is a small corner shop or a manufacturing industry, pushes extra goods or services on customers.  The basis of growth is to get the customer to buy more goods or avail of more services. Yet, we have a State company advising people that the telephone service is expensive but if they lock their teenagers in their rooms until the weekends, make calls to relatives after 6 o'clock or at the weekends and put an egg timer beside <Col N="735" /> the telephone so that they will not exceed three minutes on a call, they will not have a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is an outrageous approach to any type of commercial operation.  Consumer difficulties have been magnified by the fact that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, who should be the guardian of consumers' interests, works hand in glove with Telecom Éireann.  He and his immediate predecessors have always put the perceived interests of Telecom Éireann before those of telephone users, and the users council recently established by the Minister under pressure is no substitute for an independent telecommunications director appointed under statute who would protect the interests of both consumers and service providers and adjudicate on a fair basis when their interests clash. That is the central idea of this Bill and I will deal with that and the other proposals in the Bill later.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the question of ownership of Telecom Éireann.  I want to put it bluntly on the record that both I and my party believe Telecom Éireann should remain in public ownership. Private monopolies are probably more adverse to the interests of consumers than public ones.  At least public monopolies are subject to the control and influence of Ministers' Departments and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, competition is the issue, ownership is not.  I have no difficulty with a State company operating on commercial lines, making commercial decisions and competing with companies in the private sector if it wishes because all the advantages would lie with Telecom Éireann for some time.  Because of its strength, Telecom Éireann need not fear competition from the private sector, but when that competition comes it will put downward pressure on prices and provide <Col N="736" /> consumers with a better, more efficient and effective service.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a small amount of competition which came about on the basis of kicking in the door.  That is also what happened in the case of Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus held the old line until the door was kicked down and it practically went bankrupt.  I do not want Telecom Éireann to go down the same road.  It is prudent to make policy decisions in advance of trouble and technology is changing so fast that certain decisions should be taken now in respect of Telecom Éireann.  I am not saying we can change the mandate and introduce competition next week or next month, but it is timely that we should have this debate now.  Because of the problems arising at present and the rapid change in technology, the grand programmes initiated some years ago referring to when competition will be introduced are no longer applicable.  Telecom Éireann discovered that last spring when, despite its best efforts, it had to face competition on international calls.  Its main reason for rescheduling its charges was because of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition, not ownership, is the main issue in this Bill.  I have no doubt the Minister will point out that Telecom Éireann is not ready for competition, that its universal obligations would make competition unfair, that its level of penetration of 70 telephones per 100 persons is too low to face competition and that it will face competition when that penetration increases to the EC average of 82 telephones per 100 persons.  Only then will competition be allowed.  I am sure the Minister will argue also that capital investment during the past number of years, clearly illustrated by Telecom Éireann's debt of almost £1 billion for which the Irish taxpayer has ultimate responsibility, must be taken into account.  Of course it must to be taken into account.  I am sure the Minister will argue that, in effect, such investment and <Col N="737" /> borrowing must be protected and that the way to do so is by preventing competition. I challenge that view.  It is timely that we examine the issues to see if the position can be improved through competition.</P>
    <P>The difficulty facing us in assessing such arguments is similar to those we faced in reassessing the scheduling of costs.  Traditionally, Ministers for Communications worked hand in glove with Telecom Éireann, as was the case with the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  No independent monitoring of Telecom Éireann's proposals to the Department takes place.  The Minister and his predecessors acted, and continue to act, in the Council of Ministers at EC level as apologists for Telecom Éireann. Consequently, even though the bulk of EC countries have agreed to competition in telecommunications by 1997 Ireland, and some other peripheral EC countries such as Greece and Portugal, have obtained a derogation which allows them to defer competition until the year 2002. The rest of Europe is moving rapidly while Ireland remains in the slow lane and will wait until 1 January 2003.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will refer to those countries later.  This is a very shortsighted strategy.  It is not in the interests of Telecom Éireann or its workers.  It is not in the interests of Ireland's industrial development or in the interests of consumers.  Technology will not wait on the inactivity of Ministers. Once the technological capacity emerges to provide competition it is very hard to ward it off.  Telecom Éireann found that out to its cost very recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offshore competition in respect of international calls was the main incentive for the rescheduling of charges and the reduction in the cost of international calls.  Last year of the total of international calls made to and from Ireland 40 per cent were outgoing and 60 per cent incoming.  This is an abnormal use pattern, because when one takes into <Col N="738" /> account the millions of calls made, the normal breakdown should be 50-50.  The aberration is not due to some strange behaviour by the migratory Irish.  It arises from the fact that a significant number of calls made from Ireland are being charged to the receiver overseas.  Ten out of every 100 outgoing calls are being charged to the other side.  It is common knowledge that one can make arrangements to dial a number in the US and the company will ring back automatically, the effect being that the call is being charged in the US at a lower rate.</P>
    <P>I was abroad with Deputies from this House recently looking at the situation in South Africa.  One of my colleagues had a card from AT&amp;T and all he had to do was quote the number on the card and in that instance calls from Johannesburg were charged to his home telephone.  He was availing of the Minister's new reduced charges because calls were a bit higher in Johannesburg.  This kind of thing is quite common across the world. Anyone can acquire such a card and decide where a call is charged.  The calls of executives of international companies with the use of such cards can be charged to the location of lowest costs.</P>
    <P>The competition is there and there is no point in trying to run from it.  Telecom Éireann had to move to protect the international market last year and that is why they rescheduled charges.  It had nothing to do with the Culliton report or the IDA.  Telecom Éireann were losing market share and they had to move ahead of competitive forces.  If they had taken account of those competitive forces a year before, they would have been in a better position to make a considered decision and would not have got into the mix-up they got into.  Competition will not only continue but will multiply in respect of international calls.  Now that the technology is available to provide competitive local and trunk calls by way of mobile phones it will be difficult to keep that competition out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have a different view and by virtue of his better resources is more informed than I am, but already Mercury, the main private company in <Col N="739" /> the UK, is offering local call services at competitive rates in the London area. They say that in 18 months they will have 2.5 million customers in the greater London area.  This was impossible until recently, because the charges were too high and a mobile phone was a yuppie toy.  It is coming down in price now and we are at the stage where they can offer a mobile local calls service at charges slightly higher than those charged on the British Telecom fixed line networks. They are able to go beyond that at weekends and offer as a sweetener free calls on Saturday and Sunday.  They are targeting the business sector on a local call basis. A group of Americans and continentals are putting up satellites that fly on a lower trajectory.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister and Telecom Éireann should control events rather than react to them, as they did earlier this year.  One of the main arguments against competition in telecommunications is that Telecom Éireann will lose business and jobs will be put at risk.  This is based on the idea of a static market and misunderstands what has happened in countries where competition has been introduced.  Where competition in telecommunication services has been encouraged, the contribution of the telecommunications industry to the respective country's GDP has increased and in actual terms it is now significantly higher than the contribution to the GDP in those countries where there is no competition.  That sounds complicated.  The countries where <Col N="740" /> it has been introduced to a strong degree are Sweden, the US, Japan, the UK and New Zealand.  I have no doubt that a prudently organised, staged introduction of competition into the telecommunications industry would lead to a growth in the industry and expansion in the number of jobs.</P>
      <P>The countries who have introduced competition are also becoming more attractive as locations for manufacturing and service industries and that is very important.  Anyone who reads the newspapers knows that there is a rapid coming together of the telecommunications industry, the computer industry and the entertainment industry and those countries with the most advanced facilities available at the most competitive prices will have an edge over those who do not move with the times, as a location for the cutting edge of the telecommunications industry, the entertainment industry and the computer industry and for all modern services and manufacturing industries. This is already happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister and some members of the Cabinet appreciate how competitive the market is for mobile investment.  It is probably the most competitive market in the world, with various offers available from different parts of the world.  Money moves on a global basis.  There are no alternative models. Every place is running some sort of free market economy.  It is as likely now that part of a computer industry could set up in Moscow, if there was political stability, as in Swords, Tallaght or anywhere else. One of the key factors would be the degree of advancement of the telecommunications industry and how it interfaces with the computer industry and to an increasing degree with the entertainment industry.  It has gone so far in the US now that some of the &ldquo;baby Bells&rdquo; which were formed on the break-up of the old telecommunications industry there are ringing up people and are offering television channels down the telephone line.  That is interesting because in Ireland we have gone as far as figuring that Cablelink in certain circumstances could be used for telephone lines.  There <Col N="741" /> was an argument at one time that Telecom Éireann bought it out to prevent a competitor using the Cablelink system in Dublin.  The reverse is happening in the US.  They are not selling a telephone service anymore &mdash; they are selling the 25 channels, the 10 optional film channels and many education channels.  The sweetener is that the telephone will be included and they will take 20 per cent of the bill if the person buys the entertainment package down the telephone line.  It is important to realise the way these major industries are coming together.  It is worth looking at what is happening and keeping an open mind.</P>
    <P>When the new schedule of charges was announced last May the Culliton report was quoted in support of the Minister's case and the Telecom case.  This was done in such a misleading way that Mr. Jim Culliton wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to point out that the Culliton report was being misquoted. It is interesting to note that Culliton pointed out that Ireland suffered a competitive disadvantage because of the relatively high cost of telephone calls.  He went on to advocate continuing downward pressure on telephone calls but he never said it should proceed on a &ldquo;rob Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; basis where we would reduce some and increase others.  He said that Ireland's telecommunications costs were comparatively higher than our EC partners' and that downward pressure would have to be kept on those costs. Competition keeps downward pressure on costs and prices and establishes the lowest possible point at which an effective profitable service can be delivered. This is in the interests of the consumer and the industry.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  I am presenting this Bill for a number of reasons, the first of which is to provide a platform for Deputies in my party and others, to take part in a serious debate about the telecommunications industry at a time when it is becoming very interesting internationally and when any modern industrialised country has to take developments in the industry into <Col N="742" /> account.  Second, the debate on the question of the rescheduling of charges has degenerated into a shouting match.  The debate needs to be widened significantly.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming that this is a full and final Bill because I do not have the resources available to Government Departments or someone to draft Bills for me.  All Deputies, including Government backbenchers, understand this.  I hope therefore the Bill will not be rejected on the grounds that it is flawed. If it is, I will accept amendments on Committee Stage as long as the principle that there is a need to introduce competition is accepted.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that we appoint a statutory office holder, who would have the title &ldquo;Director of Telecommunications&rdquo;, whose primary function would be to protect the interests of all users of telecommunication services by introducing competition.  There is an equivalent office holder in the United Kingdom, the Director General of Telecommunications.  At page 2, paragraph 1.6 of the OFTEL annual report 1992 he states under the heading &ldquo;BT price control review&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Our starting point for the review was that we regard competition as the best means to improve telecommunication services for all types of users in the UK. Competition finds out how efficiently, and therefore inexpensively, telephone services can be provided.  But BT still has a very large market share and can be expected to be a dominant force in the telecommunications market for some time to come.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state there should be price controls on British Telecom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We would not dream of imposing price controls on Telecom Éireann.  We are of the view that a monopolistic State provider will always operate in the interests of the consumer and that it should be free to do so but it is interesting the report concludes that the best way to provide an <Col N="743" /> efficient service and to keep downward pressure on prices is to introduce competition.</P>
      <P>My second proposal, which is equally important, is that the power to increase telecommunication charges would be vested in the new Director of Telecommunications rather than the Minister's Department.  In respect of the commercial State bodies the position is the Department is both the body or organ which decides overall policy and at the same time is the watchdog.  I do not believe it is possible to be the poacher and the gamekeeper at the same time because there will always be circumstances where the pursuance and the implementation of a policy will be at variance with the function to be a watchdog on behalf of the consumer.  Therefore, this function should be removed from the Department and given to a person such as Director of Telecommunications.</P>
      <P>It would be a matter for the Minister by way of regulations to give this director a mandate on how he should set about introducing an equitable schedule of charges for services.  If an independent office holder, appointed under a statute enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, had considered the case made by Telecom Éireann last spring, borne in mind the interests of the consumer, including small businesses, those who provide telephone advisory services and old people and made recommendations, the rescheduling of charges would have carried far greater authority than the one authorised by the Minister when his hand was in the dog's mouth and he was faced with the competing requirements of Telecom Éireann whose market share was declining as a result of international competition on the one hand and of consumers who had no voice on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be the function of this new office holder to promote research into new telecommunications techniques &mdash; I do not think anyone is doing this at present; to help manufacturers of equipment to compete and supply inside and outside Ireland &mdash; this would have to be done in co-operation with An Coras Tráchtála; <Col N="744" /> and to investigate complaints by users.  In the 1983 and 1984 Acts provision was made for a users' council. Subsequently, its powers were vested in the Ombudsman who has been processing complaints about Telecom Éireann.  While he is doing his best his office is under-resourced.  The Minister has now set up an informal users' council. The Director of Telecommunications should have the power to investigate complaints and adjudicate in the first instance whether they are mischievous or trivial and, if so, rule them out.  He should investigate real complaints and have sufficient staff to do so.</P>
    <P>In introducing competition changes would have to be made in the 1993 Act. The provision under which Telecom Éireann is the only service provider would have to be removed.  Under another section of that Act Telecom Éireann is allowed to &ldquo;farm out&rdquo; activities.  In addition it may decide of its own volition to diminish its monopoly position but it has used this provision in a limited way. It makes sure that it only fights those it can put out of the ring with one punch.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A number of other provisions are dealt with in the explanatory memorandum and I do not have to deal with them in great detail.  Other speakers will deal with them.  The director would also have the power to issue licences.  Again, this would have to be done in accordance with regulations issued by the Minister.  For instance, if Mercury decides it could provide a service in Dublin at competitive rates it could apply to the Director of Telecommunications who would examine <Col N="745" /> its application for a licence in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Minister and issue it.  The director would have to bear in mind that Telecom Éireann has an obligation to provide an emergency service covering telephone calls to the Garda Síochána and other emergency services.  Therefore, there would have to be fair and full competition.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum is very clear and there is no need to refer to it in great detail.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on Dáil Éireann to reject this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of its introduction is intended to capitalise on an assumed wave of public dissatisfaction with Telecom Éireann by kicking it hard when it was down, removing its privileges without providing the means for discharging <Col N="746" /> its public service obligations and exposing it and all other telecommunications service providers to the tender mercies of an omnipotent Director of Telecommunications whose sweeping functions go far beyond regulation into the areas of tariff setting, research, manufacturing and consumer protection.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for opposing this opportunistic Bill.  It is internally inconsistent and out of accord with policy developments of recent years.  For example, its declared purpose is to introduce competition to Telecom Éireann and at the same time empowers the putative director to publish a schedule of prices.  I always thought that the market place operating in a competitive manner was the optimum way to determine prices, and particularly so in times of low inflation.  Publication of pricing schedules by the director could be a counter-productive rigidity in a properly functioning competitive market and undermines the declared purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another reason for rejecting this Bill is its bad draftsmanship.  The Bill appears to be the work of someone who has browsed through the UK's Telecommunications Act of 1984 with a mandate to pick out those sections with an ideologically attractive ring to them, no pun intended, and to present them in an Irish context.  Indeed, so preoccupied was he with selecting the glib and glitzy, that the draftsman overlooked the vital requirement in any legislation to describe the board by its correct legal name, which is either &ldquo;Bord Telecom Éireann&rdquo;, or, in the English language, &ldquo;The Irish Telecommunications Board&rdquo;.  Although perfectly understandable in ordinary use as referring to the board, the words &ldquo;Telecom Éireann&rdquo; are, in fact, a business name.  They are quite simply wrong when used to describe the board in legislation and this illustrates the Bill's superficial approach.</P>
    <P>This Bill is deliberately designed for its populist appeal at a time when Telecom Éireann has had to take tough decisions and it cannot be seen as a serious contribution to development of policy in the <Col N="747" /> telecommunications sector.  I will return to the content of the Bill later.</P>
    <P>All through the summer we had to listen to speculation and scaremongering from various groups, including some Deputies opposite about the dire effects of the new tariff package introduced by Telecom Éireann on 1 September.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann could only publish the facts, which they alone knew, and their best projections based on these facts and their own experience.  The preliminary information becoming available at this stage tends to confirm that there was no basis for the scaremongering.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Noonan trying to grab the headlines with opportunistic references to increases of 400 per cent and more in this House back in May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a past master at headline grabbing.  That 15-minute on peak call represents 3 per cent of total local calls.  It was suggested that that was the average.  The Deputy never denied that, never dissociated himself from the headlines.  He knew from his own experience that to suggest that every local call takes place on peak and lasts 15 minutes was unrealistic.  That is totally incorrect and has proven to be so.  We heard also from the selective survey of an unrepresentative few hundred users back in August by the unrepresentative party now led by Deputy Harney that the bills of 97 per cent of domestic users would increase by an average of 28 per cent. We now know, admittedly based on limited but accurate information available at this stage from Telecom Éireann, that 46 per cent of domestic users have seen reductions in their bills.  A further 42 per cent will see increases of less than 10 per cent on their bills for the September/October period.  The reduction in volume was only 3 per cent in total, despite the scaremongering, and only 8 per cent for residential customers. This shows that ordinary people, although being careful, did not believe <Col N="748" /> the central thrust of what was put forward by Deputy Noonan and others.</P>
      <P>Also from that survey by the Progressive Democrats we were told that 80 per cent of small firms would face increases averaging 23 per cent.  The reality from the data available at this stage is the complete opposite &mdash; 72 per cent of small businesses have experienced a reduction in their bills &mdash; again I emphasise as far as data currently available shows.  These are facts, not fiction.</P>
      <P>I now want to give the House an indication of my own thinking about the future of the telecommunications sector. I intend to take the necessary action to stimulate the development of this critically important sector without undue delay.  I am predisposed to increased competition and to independent regulation; these two go hand-in-hand.  I must also be mindful of the valuable assets and human resources which constitute Telecom Éireann and which are entrusted to my care on behalf of the taxpayers of this country.</P>
      <P>My starting point is that top quality telecommunication services should be provided to those who require them on a secure but economically efficient basis at reasonable costs.  It would be difficult to overstate the importance of success in this context.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way in the past decade or more in equipping ourselves with a modern system; indeed we are ahead of many countries in this respect. But the rapid advance of technology leaves no room for clapping ourselves on the back.  We must look forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be erroneous to think that there is no competition in the telecommunications business in this country. There has been considerable liberalisation already in the delivery of special services, in the provision of terminal equipment, in data transmission, in the provision of links between enterprises, in equipping procurement and of course there is effective competition in international traffic; in other words, in most areas apart from voice telephony.  In June of this year the EC Council of Ministers decided to liberalise <Col N="749" /> voice telephony within five years; there is a derogation for up to a further five years for some countries including Ireland.  We cannot isolate ourselves from these developments.  In fact these developments together with the pace of technological change in the sector mean that the traditional structure of the communications industry dominated by large monopolistic national companies is under assault and will have to change, because if it does not keep pace with developments it may well become irrelevant. We must control this change rather than let it control us.</P>
    <P>It is clear that allowing increased competition is an important route to greater economic efficiency.  It is also clear that independent regulation of the sector to ensure transparency and fairness is a necessary precondition to full competition. It should not be necessary for separate and competing infrastructure to be constructed where existing capacity is adequate.  This means that co-operation and competition must co-exist and this can only happen if there is a neutral referee with adequate regulatory powers.  I have already announced that the setting up of an independent regulatory authority is under urgent examination in my Department and, we are now examining this question with a view to having the appropriate structure identified and the necessary legislation prepared.  As a first step, the relevant divisions of my Department have been reorganised so that the regulatory function can be operated separately from the functions which pertain exclusively to general policy formulation and to the shareholder role <i>vis-à-vis</i> Telecom Éireann.  It is too soon in my consideration of this matter to be precise as to the role of the independent regulator but it will certainly encompass the oversight of fair competition between the market players having regard to the dominant position of Telecom Éireann and its ownership of the backbone infrastructure on the one hand and its universal service obligations on the other. The regulator would also have a role in relation to the general level of tariffs and quality of service in the context of <Col N="750" /> seeing that competition is delivering the expected benefits.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that when there is only one big monopoly player the telecommunications business is fairly straightforward.  As competition develops the complexities increase. When, for example, a mobile telephone user subscribing to a new competitor calls a fixed location Telecom Éireann customer, who gets what out of the revenue? In the opposite case, is the customer charged the normal tariff or the mobile telephone tariff which is much higher? Will new entrants to the telecommunications market be anxious to serve those areas where costs are higher? Telecom Éireann's exclusive privilege was conferred on it among other reasons &ldquo;in view of its primary purpose of providing a national telecommunications service&rdquo; and &ldquo;because a viable national telecommunications system involves subsidisation of some loss making services by profit making services&rdquo;.  I am quoting this from section 87 of the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act. This Bill would remove Telecom Éireann's ability to carry out these onerous duties which the Bill leaves intact, and at the same time &mdash; and this is another example of woolly thinking &mdash; confer these same duties on the director.  This is a problem which will have to be addressed with great care.  Ways must be found to spread the cost of the universal service obligation &mdash; which in my view should remain with Telecom Éireann &mdash; fairly throughout the whole market.  I mention those issues only to underline the importance of the regulatory environment.  Such issues are in contention in most countries and we can learn from their experiences. but we must allow ourselves the time window to do so.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need to sort out speedily the issues which collectively constitute telecommunications policy and I have started to put in place the departmental structures necessary to do so.  I also am conscious that if I were to rush the fences and arrive at wrong answers as a consequence, I would be doing a major disservice to this nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I want to turn now to the question of Telecom Éireann and my role as shareholder. This State has invested very substantial sums of money through Telecom Éireann in providing an up-to-date digital telephone system.  The staff of Telecom Éireann also contributed in no small way to this development.  Despite well-known problems such as debt overhang, continued overstaffing and a heavy ongoing investment requirement, the company can have a bright future, but this will happen only if we face-up to the problems and take the necessary decisions.  We cannot walk away from this investment, in the manner which would flow from the Bill before the House.  Telecom Éireann is an organisation of value and we must work on enhancing that value, not undermining it.  The recent rebalancing of the telephone tariff was one essential step in the process of strengthening the company and preparing it for the more competitive future.  I want to repeat that it was an essential step but not an easy one.  We took appropriate steps to alleviate worries in acute cases, for example, the free calls unit for beneficiaries of the free telephone rental allowance scheme, nationwide calls at weekends at local rates, the special provision by Telecom Éireann of assistance with freephone helpline facilities to the most critical helplines operating nationally and the instruction to Government Departments and agencies to provide efficient responses to telephone inquiries.  I am examining a separate proposal to adjust the charges of leased lines so as to make them costrelated.</P>
    <P>These are necessary steps towards preparing Telecom Éireann so that it can face competition with confidence.  They are also rapidly putting in place a new cost accounting system to increase transparency and ensure a correct relationship between costs and tariffs in different segments of the business.  This will also, of course, confine the scope for cross-subsidisation to those areas of the business where it is allowable as part of the universal service obligation.  The subsidiaries and business units will have an <Col N="752" /> arm's-length relationship with the parent and pay the going rate for services provided. I have been relating a set of measures which are preparing Telecom Éireann for the competitive future, introducing the appropriate type of regulatory framework and allowing the degree of competition to develop in step with developments in EC policy and in most of our partner countries.  If and when these developments make it necessary or appropriate, I will bring forward the requisite legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Bill before the House.  It would be contrary to the national interest, to the interest of Telecom Éireann and its staff and profligate in the extreme to abolish peremptorily the Telecom Éireann exclusive privilege with effect from a current date as is proposed in section 3.  This would throw wide open the most profitable segments of the telecommunications business to a multitude of predators and put at risk our ability to provide a high quality universal service nationwide.  I am not prepared to take this course and I do not believe this House is prepared to support it.  On a technical point, Telecom Éireann's exclusive privilege is not, as the section describes it, one of &ldquo;running a telecommunications system&rdquo;.  That is a term borrowed from the UK's Telecommunications Act, 1984.  As I said at the outset, much of the Bill seems to have derived its inspiration from that Act. There is nothing wrong with that but I should point out that the British Act is in seven parts and runs to over 100 sections and seven schedules.  This is not surprising given the complexity of its purpose, but it is not good enough to tackle such an important task in the Irish context by lifting the most ideologically attractive sections, in some cases verbatim, and cobbling them together in isolation from consequential and supporting provisions.</P>
    <P>It is wishful thinking to suggest that the director could, from day one, secure the delivery of this universal service, unless it were to be provided at the expense of the taxpayer by Telecom Éireann after it <Col N="753" /> had lost the profitable end of the business.</P>
    <P>There are many flaws in this Bill.  They are so numerous that it would be extremely difficult to deal with them in any satisfactory way by amendments on Committee Stage.  It would be far preferable for the House to leave me a clean sheet on which to write an appropriate Bill when it is needed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 containing definitions is a confused piece of drafting.  This may even be a generous description.  It uses terminology like &ldquo;Act&rdquo; and &ldquo;section&rdquo; as if they were interchangeable, for example in subsections (2) and (3).  Once again this is symptomatic of unstructured plagiarising of the UK Act.  The section contains a tangled web of definitions which go all over the place.  Definitions are normally contained in an Act to increase clarity.  In this case, I am afraid, it is the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>Section 2 dealing with the director looks at first glance to be pretty standard. However, it is curious that the Director of Telecommunications is to be a Government appointee but the Minister can sack him.  The independence from the Minister of the director in the discharge of his functions is something to be taken seriously, as it is in the UK Act, for example by the clear separation of their respective functions.  The section provides for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for the director and his office.  If and when I move in the direction of a Telecommunications Regulatory Office, I intend that it will be a self-financing operation, charging for its services.</P>
    <P>I have dealt earlier with the content of section 3 and I will not repeat my opposition to it.</P>
    <P>I find section 4 difficult to understand and it appears badly flawed.  It deals with the director's functions &mdash; I think.  Subsections (1) and (2) set out things to be considered by the director in exercising his functions while subsection (3) seems to see those things as functions in themselves. The explanatory memorandum suggests the latter.  This is simply bad draftsmanship.</P>
    <P>If the latter is what is intended, then it <Col N="754" /> would seem that some of the functions duplicate the work of the Industrial Development Authority and give the director a very wide remit indeed.  This is not desirable.  Subsection (4) is the most puzzling.  The very idea of schedules of charges is anathema to competition. There is ample evidence in other economic sectors that the scheduling of charges serves as an invitation to operators to charge those charges leading to a failure of competition or worse a failure of the company concerned.  There may, of course, be other functions associated with the regulation of the radio and telecommunications industry that could usefully be conferred on a regulator and I will take this into consideration when we come to assign functions to that office.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 are innocuous and deal with the further duties of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 dealing with complaints about the telecommunications service is wideranging and general, but it could cut right across the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and possibly that of the Ombudsman, both of whom are dealing with complaints in a satisfactory manner.  I am not in favour of having separate consumer protection agencies for different sectors of the economy.  This leads to proliferation, unnecessary cost and potential for inconsistency.</P>
    <P>Section 9 dealing with licences is lifted from various parts of the 1983 Act and would not be contentious in the context of proper legislation for telecommunications.  In relation to section 10, I cannot see what it adds to section 5 (3). The idea of making regulations appears for the first time in this section &mdash; without, alas, a general power to make them. The subject matter of section 10 (2) is already tightly regulated by national and international provisions regarding type approval.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for a plethora of advisory committees.  I counted no less than three mandatory advisory committees and there is scope for further optional ones.  We all know that the Deputies opposite are seeking urgent <Col N="755" /> ways of broadening their appeal, but I find it hard to believe that they are serious about this method of doing so.  I might add that sections 12 and 13 give us a corresponding plethora of annual reports.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the proposer of this Bill has copied selectively and incoherently from the UK 1984 Act.  I am pleased to note a curious twist from today's newspapers, where it is reported that British Telecom is following our example by introducing a nationwide weekend call at 10p, although in its case for only three minutes; not the ten minutes which we have given.  This is a clear case of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery.</P>
    <P>I am moving forward in a determined manner in the development of telecommunications policy.  I have changed the relevant organisational structure in the Department to begin separating regulatory functions from other functions.  We have settled the Telecom Éireann pricing package which was overdue, however unpalatable it might have been.  Telecom Éireann was losing ground and its preexisting pricing arrangements left it very exposed to the loss of international traffic which, in turn, subsidised domestic traffic. It could not have faced the more competitive future unless this handicap was removed and that future competition is inevitable.  Indeed, I expect to announce very shortly a tender competition for a second national operator in the mobile telephones business.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to take the drastic step of abolishing the Telecom Éireann monopoly in the peremptory fashion advocated in section 3 of the Bill before the House.  Neither am I prepared to acquiesce in setting up a string of advisory committees appealing to every conceivable interest group in Irish society.  I thought we had an end to that kind of appeasement some years ago.  I set up one broadly representative Telephone Users' Advisory Group to provide independent monitoring of the effects of price changes, and that one group is quite enough.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that it is far <Col N="756" /> more responsible and reasonable to deal in facts, not fantasy, in relation to Telecom Éireann and its prices and their effects on consumers.  The emerging facts speak for themselves.  Indeed we should all stand back from that debate for a couple of months until the reaction to the price changes settles down and we can have meaningful information, cold analysis and especially the reports which will be made by the Telephone Users' Advisory Group which will be made public.  I reiterate my outright condemnation of this Bill and trust in the good sense of Dáil Éireann to reject it.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister's closing debate last Thursday, his reaction to this Bill does not surprise me.  At least he is consistent in his remarks but it is disappointing that he sees no merit in the Bill.  We are getting negative, sterile opposition from the Government and it refuses to accept a constructive measure like this Bill.  I compliment Deputy Noonan on preparing the Bill and precipitating this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us during the summer months were very conscious of what was happening in Telecom Éireann.  The Minister appears to be clutching at a report, published today, of the initial findings of Telecom <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new charges.  Of most concern are the charges for residential customers, and the latest survey reveals that 46 per cent experienced a reduction in charges, 42 per cent experienced increases of less than 10 per cent and, I assume, the remaining 12 per cent experienced increases of more than 10 per cent.  Many people, particularly families in which a number of people use the telephone, were very concerned about the increase in charges and the initial reaction was to restrict use of the telephone. I will be interested to see the change from 1 April next year when, I assume, VAT will be increased to 21 per <Col N="757" /> cent, an increase that will be borne by the residential customer.  I anticipate that by that time many people will have reverted to their old habits and will be making greater use of the telephone.  We will then see a true reflection of the changes in telephone charges.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made of the concessions given to certain sectors, to groups such as the Samaritans, the Rape Crisis Centre and Childline.  A derisory sum of £500,000 was made available for this purpose.  In my constituency in Limerick a group called the Limerick Cancer Support Group, which does tremendous work, has complained that with increased charges it is no longer possible to make essential telephone calls.  Representations have been made from time to time to accommodate these people but without success.</P>
    <P>The question of increased telephone charges was handled extremely badly. The Minister implied we said the changes would result in a 400 per cent increase in the cost to residential customers, but that implication is wrong.  We said that a nine minute 'phone call which previously cost 11.17p would cost more than 40p, an increase of about 400 per cent.  The Minister should not be disingenuous in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify a quotation in the <i>Financial Times</i> of Monday, 11 October which states:</P>
    <P>When news of the Cable and Wireless talks broke in the spring, Brian Cowen, Ireland's communications minister insisted that &ldquo;privatisation is not on the agenda&rdquo;.  Yet in accepting that alliances were vital to maintain Telecom Éireann's position &ldquo;in a sector which is moving at an accelerating rate&rdquo;, he highlighted the dynamic likely to prompt privatisation sooner or later.</P>
    <P>I will also quote from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 23 May lest people think that Deputy Cowen was alone in his thinking on this matter.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did have some discussion with former Tory Trade Minister, <Col N="758" /> Lord Young, who is now Chairman of Cable and Wireless about them taking a stake.  But that was during the previous coalition with the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I imagine the position has changed in view of the fact that the coalition is now with the Labour Party.  I would like the Minister to comment on the statement that &ldquo;he highlighted the dynamic likely to prompt privatisation sooner or later&rdquo;. He should point out this evening the future direction of telecommunications and Telecom Éireann rather than making negative, sterile comments.  It is very easy to criticise a Bill such as this and to say it is lacking in terms of parliamentary draftsmanship and content.  We do not have the battery of resources available to the Minister to dissect and analyse a Bill such as this.  It would be better if the Minister was constructive in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>A recent Telecom report &mdash; it is very good at producing glossy annual reports &mdash; states that customers will be consulted periodically about all aspects of the services it provides and their experience in dealing with the company.  I am sure that if people were asked about their experiences in dealing with Telecom Éireann, it would be very disappointed with their reaction.  I had a recent visit from a person who believed that a letter she received from Telecom Éireann was almost a form of blackmail.  She had neglected to pay her bill on time and, as we all know, in cases such as this Telecom has the ultimate sanction to cut off service. I do not know if the Minister's phone was ever cut off but mine was on one occasion and in these circumstances it just goes dead.  However, it rings in the exchange and the person making the telephone call also hears it ringing.  What tends to happen is that people pay their bill in the local post office, but it takes a few days for the money to be transferred to the Telecom centre in St. Stephen's Green.  In some cases the money is not sent directly to the Telecom head office. Some people have had their telephones disconnected during this period.  The sad thing about all this is that people have to pay a reconnection fee, which is included <Col N="759" /> in their next bill.  The letter sent out by Telecom Éireann to people who have had their telephones disconnected usually reads as follows:</P>
    <P>We regret to say that your next bill will include a reconnection charge of X amount.  However, should you decide to pay us in the future by direct debit this charge will be waived.  If you communicate with us in the mandate provided herein that you are prepared to pay in future by direct debit this charge will be forgotten about.</P>
    <P>This is a type of blackmail of vulnerable people who have had their telephones disconnected.</P>
    <P>The handling by Telecom Éireann of this issue was exacerbated by the Minister at the time.  As we know from the Glackin report, Telecom paid £9.4 million for a site which does not have planning permission. As rural councillors know, one would not buy a site from a farmer for £5,000-£6,000 unless it had planning permission. Yet Telecom Éireann has countenanced the decision to purchase this site and justified the introduction of these charges.  Is it any wonder the general public is sceptical of Telecom?  Many Telecom employees had to put up with criticism from people because of stupid management decisions and improper public relations.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann advertises itself as Ireland's telephone company.  Perhaps it should advertise itself as Ireland's &ldquo;only&rdquo; telephone company.  The monopoly position enjoyed by this company has led to arrogance among its management.  This Bill, which proposes to go in the right direction, is not being supported by the Government.  This does not surprise me because I believe any constructive proposals put forward by the Opposition at present would be opposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>When Telecom Éireann introduced these increases it said it was rebalancing the charges &mdash; the buzz word at the time was &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo;.  At the time Mr. McGovern projected that these increases would lead to a loss of £15 million-£18 million per year for the company.  It now seems that the company cannot predict <Col N="760" /> the potential losses.  People are not making as many phone, calls as they used to make and Telecom Éireann states that it is losing £750,000 a week as a result. Telecom does not seem to be able to get its sums right.  The Minister appeared to be rather joyful about the reports in today's newspapers.  However, I would say to him that he should wait until next April or May to see the results of the increases in the charges.  I think he will be pleasantly surprised by them.  Telecom Éireann's fixed monthly rental charges have a reputation of being among the highest in the EC.  It is understandable why the company did not increase those charges.</P>
    <P>I am sharing my time with my two colleagues, but there is a lot more I could say on this issue.  I am delighted a member of the Labour Party has decided to come into the House to listen to this debate because at the time the increases were announced the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, stated on television that she had no trouble accepting the increases.  I hope she will be able to say the same next April or May.  People who previously fought for the oppressed members of our community seem to dramatically change their priorities when they go into office with Fianna Fáil.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on introducing this Bill which highlights the present difficulties in this sector.  If Deputy Noonan, the Opposition spokes-person on Tourism, Transport and Communications, did not debate this issue he would be accused of neglecting his duty.  He has been chided by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications for asking salient questions about his Department.  Both at Question Time today and in his contribution to this debate the Minister tried to give the impression that he is concerned about arriving at the truth and that he wants to give the relevant data to the public.  However, even Telecom Éireann admitted today that the data it was comparing related to July of one year <Col N="761" /> and September of another year.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether it is a July-September comparison.  If this is the case, it is an apple and orange comparison, so to speak.  The Minister is running away from his responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>He is charged with responsibility for ensuring that Telecom Éireann provides a service which will increase job opportunities.  Yet the first decision he took was to impose the extra charge in VAT which Telecom was not charging.  The Minister made that decision.  I wonder how much of the £750,000 in losses being experienced by Telecom is as a result of the increase in VAT.  How much consideration did the Minister give to this increase in VAT before he imposed it?  If all the details of the survey were published then perhaps people might understand the reasons for the increase.  As I said, an orange and apple comparison is not fair either to the public or the company.</P>
      <P>In framing this Bill, Deputy Noonan had a larger vision for Telecom.  We believe Telecom should be competing in the overseas market as an international company, a flagship company for this State.  Deputy Noonan's proposals, which would leave the consumer in a competitive position, have been criticised in a spurious way by a Minister who considers himself to be more learned than the rest of us &mdash; he talks down to us.  As Deputy Noonan said, the Bill may be flawed in some respects.  It should be remembered that some Private Members' Bills introduced by Fianna Fáil when it was in Opposition were also flawed.  Indeed, some of its Bills were totally flawed.  If I recall correctly, the things Fianna Fáil in Opposition said it would do in regard to Telecom when it came into office have not changed much either.  The Minister implied in a report in the <i>Financial Times</i> that he might privatise the company.  He has certainly changed his tune now.</P>

      <P>I would like Telecom Éireann to be given broad scope and yet, to a certain extent, the Minister to retain control through a director, as is proposed in this Bill.

We have an opportunity to take a forward-looking view and I recommend that the House support this Bill.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I support the Bill produced by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on the basis that it is better to face reality now than to wait until we reach a situation such as that which has arisen in Aer Lingus and in regard to which nothing other than a harsh proposal has come by way of resolution.</P>
      <P>I listened with some interest today at Question Time to the Minister of State's rather &ldquo;buckish&rdquo; stance on the whole question of Telecom.  I notice in the media recently he was attempting to change his image but I would have to point out to him, no disrespect intended, that he was even more &ldquo;buckish&rdquo; than ever today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is another word one could use in that context.  I wish to point out, with all humility, that while that might sound well in the House and be a quick reflex to put down the Opposition, it will not put down reality.  The reality is that the public have greatly reduced their usage of the telephone service in the past month or so.  It is a sad reflection on the <Col N="763" /> Minister's position that he suggested to a Deputy on this side of the House that we deliberately hyped up the situation and contrived an example to illustrate our position.  It shows little regard for the intelligence of Members and, more important, for the intelligence of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not presume that because telephone costs are reduced to some extent it is an indication that the new hyped-up charges are acceptable.  They are not.</P>
      <P>The public are afraid to use the telephone. They are afraid to call their relatives. It is all very well to say that they can use the telephone after normal business hours at a cheaper rate.  As Members know, the cost of using our telephones in the past month or so has increased by approximately 30 per cent on average, notwithstanding our knowledge of the increased charges.  That is a fact of life and no amount of painting over the problem will change that.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be well advised to recognise that that is the position.  He should either face up to the problem now or we will have a major problem in one or two year's time.  He should not forget the statistics that were released this morning in relation to losses in Telecom Éireann.  Does the Minister want these losses to continue?  Is it not better to do something at an early stage to correct the problem rather than to find some years from now that we have the type of scenario that has unfolded in Aer Lingus?  I do not believe we want to repeat that mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to competition, some years ago various Ministers announced that we had to expect more competition in the future.  For example it was decided at that time to divide CIE into different companies.  I do not understand why the Minister seems to be burying his head in the sand in regard to this issue.  He is not facing up to his responsibilities.  He should realise that increased competition for Telecom Éireann will cause problems in addition to the problems created by <Col N="764" /> the increased charges.  The combination of those two factors will lead to a very interesting situation for the Minister in, perhaps, two years time.  It may not take that long and I am a person who is totally committed to a national public service.  If nothing is being done to streamline a State service that service faces slow strangulation which will cause a public outcry.  We will then have broad-ranging solutions which at the end of the day may actually exacerbate the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests that the monopoly be removed from Telecom Éireann.  This does not mean that Telecom Éireann will be damaged in any way or that the impact of the service it provides will lessen.  It simply means that the company will have to face up to reality at an early stage and provide for its customers the kind of service it will have to provide if it faces competition.  If the company cannot do that now, it certainly will not be able to do so in five years time.</P>
    <P>Technology is advancing rapidly and nowhere more so than in the area of telecommunications.  We should be improving the mobile 'phone service and making it available to more people and in turn, making greater profits.  The capital outlay involved is relatively small and the maintenance element of that service is not as great as it was with the old-fashioned crossbar systems that were used in telecommunications.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about preserving public ownership, he should enable the company to become more competitive, more aggressive and provide better service to more people.  He should not remain behind a high wall hoping that if he stays there long enough all his problems will go away.  That will not happen.  The losses which are occurring on a daily basis will not disappear. The Minister should accept his responsibility in the interest of the future of the people employed by Telecom Éireann and in recognition of the fact that we cannot afford a lengthening dole queue. The Minister should ensure that the company remains healthy and does not drift into a situation of enforced strangulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the content of the debate <Col N="765" /> so far, particularly the contributions by Members of the Opposition.  One would have expected this debate to be about the increased telephone charges recently announced, the rebalancing act or whatever one may like to call it.</P>
      <P>The Minister commented at the outset about his disappointment that this Bill is not really concerned with a fundamental look at the future direction of Telecom Éireann, and a comprehensive view of the policy options facing the State and the company in regard to telecommunications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is essential that accessible and appropriate education be provided for people affected by autism. Although some of the difficulties experienced by people with autism are shared by those with other forms of disability, there are particular difficulties inherent in autism which require understanding and specialised educational techniques.  I read that from the schedules to the basic charter adopted by the International Association Autism Europe Congress held in The Hague, Holland, on 10 May 1992 they have a list of 19 rights in their charter for persons with autism.  No. 3 refers to the right of people with autism to accessible and appropriate education.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to be as straight as possible in dealing with my request that the Department of Education, as a matter of urgency, recognises the autism syndrome.  At present children with autism are mixed with children who are emotionally disturbed.  I gather that the Minister will acknowledge there is a specific difference that will and should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a basic need for individual educational programmes, with parental involvement, if children with autism are to have their requirements met.  I am pleased to inform the Minister that the findings of a recent study of autism in Ireland undertaken by Michael Fitzgerald, <Col N="766" /> John O'Connor, Gail Birkbeck and Pat Matthews, the final draft of which is being prepared, will be made available to her shortly.</P>
    <P>Within the limited time available to me I want to highlight the fact that staff training and awareness of autism are totally inadequate at present.  To illustrate this point I will give the House a couple of statistics.  For example, 50 per cent of staff involved in autism services reported that their knowledge of autism arose from an in-service seminar, 16 per cent had no training whatsoever and 45 per cent only used the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; when discussing children's needs with parents; they were inclined to refer to a child or children with disturbed behaviour, mental handicap and so on.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Minister and the Department of Education gave the special recognition deserved by children with autism.  Why does the Department of Health recognise the existence of autism and through its professional staff implement suitable programmes of care and training for children up to approximately four years of age, while the Department of Education has refused persistently even to recognise its existence? It is indisputable that education and training are the constitutional rights of every child and, in particular, those with autism.  Why has the Department of Education refused consistently to provide for their special educational needs?</P>
    <P>I have one or two other simple questions to put to the Minister.  First, in appendix I of Dr. Michael Mulcahy's submission to the Department of Health on the future needs of persons with autism it is stated that the Department of Education provides services &ldquo;specifically for persons with autism within the emotionally disturbed categories of children&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Callely for having raised this matter.  I might inform the House that this matter will be the subject of a Private Member's debate in the Seanad tomorrow evening, quite a lengthy one, when I shall be expanding on my reply of this evening.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to say I do indeed recognise the special educational needs of children with autism.  This condition is one of the most severe developmental disorders affecting children, characterised by acute difficulties with communication, relationships and behaviour. In addition, usually it is associated with a variable degree of mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The nature and level of provision to be made for children with autism will depend on the degree of disability, which may vary from case to case.  In this connection early identification and intervention are essential to enable appropriate provision to be made.  Early diagnosis and prompt referral will enable the health authorities to implement a pre-school programme for each affected child.  Home-based programmes will usually be supplemented by pre-school attendance by the age of three.  Depending on the level of intellectual impairment and additional handicaps, the child may be appropriately placed in a local pre-school or a child development centre.</P>
      <P>At school age the child with autism requires an education suited to his or her assessed needs.  The provision in each case should take account of social, language and cognitive development. Depending on individual circumstances, educational provision can be made in any one of the following: (a) an ordinary national school with the support of a remedial or resource teacher; (b)  a special class in an ordinary national school; (c) a special school for mentally handicapped children; or (d) a special school for children with emotional and/or behavioural disorders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that no one type of educational provision will meet the needs of all children with autism.  There is a continuum of special educational needs which is best served by a corresponding range of educational provisions.  Accordingly, <Col N="768" /> some needs may be catered for in the ordinary school, while more acute needs can best be met in a more specialised setting.</P>
    <P>The particular requirements of children with autism have been examined by the special education review committee as part of its remit covering all children with special educational needs.  While generally supporting the flexible strategies outlined above, the committee made specific recommendations in relation to the level of teaching support for autistic children enrolled in special and ordinary national schools, the adoption of a standard classification system for identifying and describing autism and the appointment of child care assistants in schools and classes with autistic children.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made at present for the publication of the committee's report and my Department is actively considering its recommendations. Also, in keeping with the policy of encouraging the maximum amount of discussion and debate in relation to educational issues, a seminar dedicated to special education and the committee's report is being organised for 6 December next in the Royal Marine Hotel, Dún Laoghaire.  Among the objectives of this seminar is one to allow those involved in special education, either as deliverers or recipients of the service, to convey their views on the nature and development of provision in this vital area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Minister, at this crucial time in terms of the compilation of Estimates, the very urgent matter of three schools within a triangle which, between them represent the fastest growing area of population in the country and, indeed, in Europe.  The schools in question include Maynooth post primary school which has an enrolment of 673 students but which has accommodation only for 500.  In the current year 30 students, many of whom came from areas where there are no schools, were rejected.  I am aware that the Minister visited the school, is familiar with the circumstances and is doing the utmost to bring about a resolution of the <Col N="769" /> problem.  I should say that in response to a recent parliamentary question it appears that the Minister is relying on plans lodged with the vocational education committee and which are awaited in the Department.  There appears to be some confusion surrounding those plans and the speed with which they are likely to emanate from the vocational education committee.  I strongly urge the Minister to recognise that the problem is much more serious than the perception. For example, there is no provision for a transitional year due to the cramped accommodation; no provision for repeats and no provision for secretarial or PLC classes.  The school authorities have utilised cloakrooms, project rooms, catering rooms, the career guidance room, libraries, etc. every possible space in the school has been used with the result that they are still overcrowded.  The same applies to a number of other schools.  There is an extremely high standard in the school despite the fact that teachers and children do not have the facilities they require.</P>
      <P>The situation in Scoil Iognaid Ris in Naas is similar. In 1985 the Department of Education contacted the school authorities and requested proposals for an extension to the school on the basis that another post-primary school would not be built in that area.  The school authorities responded and in the meantime we wait.  In fairness to the Minister, she attempted to expedite matters.  The question now revolves around how fast the Minister can respond.  It may well be said that seeking extensions to two or three schools in one area at a particular time is not on; in this case it is and it is most urgent for the simple reason that it is the fastest growing area of population, if something is not done the situation will get much worse.  For example, there are 679 students on the roll where the accommodation is for 450.  The library, the prayer room, science rooms and every possible space is utilised for classroom purposes.  There is no provision for a transitional year, no provision for repeats and no recreational space for up to 90 students on a wet day.  The result is that their safety is put at risk.  There is also a shortage of shower and toilet facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, St. Wolstan's, a vast school, is <Col N="770" /> due for replacement in 1997 or thereabouts. The conditions under which teaching takes place there are not desirable in terms of safety, fire standards and so on.  The case for the replacement of St. Wolstan's is self-evident.  The Minister's office has agreed to the location of the replacement.  Will it be possible to make the necessary arrangements now to ensure we do not have a repeat of the problems encountered in Scoil Iognaid Ris or Maynooth post primary school in four or five years' time?</P>
    <P>The case stands for itself as it is the fastest growing area of population.  The three schools listed are equally in need in terms of a response.  I hope the Minister will give a favourable reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the situation with regard to these three schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of Maynooth post primary school it has been agreed with County Kildare Vocational Education Committee to provide an additional seven classrooms, including specialist accommodation, at the school.</P>
      <P>The planning arrangements for the proposed extension are under discussion with the vocational education committee at present.  The architectural planning of the project will be processed as quickly as possible as it is fully recognised that there is an urgent need for this additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Scoil Iognáid Rís, Naas, the bills of quantities for the proposed extension are currently being examined by my Department.  When this examination has been satisfactorily completed the project will be ready to proceed to tender.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to indicate when these two projects will proceed to construction.  However, both projects will be considered for inclusion in the 1994 capital programme in the light of objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Holy Faith Sisters informed the Department that they intend to withdraw from the management and trusteeship of St. Wolstan's Secondary School, Celbridge, <Col N="771" /> in 1997.  As a result of this it has been decided to develop a new post-primary school for girls in Celbridge to compensate for the closure of St. Wolstan's.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently examining the suitability of a site which has been identified near the existing Salesian College in Celbridge.  If the site is suitable for the new school the Department will negotiate its acquisition.  A schedule of accommodation has also been drawn up and it is hoped to initiate architectural planning in the near future.</P>
    <P>Capital funding will be available for the purchase of a site for the new school as soon as terms have been agreed. However, as architectural planning will take some time to complete, it is not envisaged that the building will commence in 1994.  Every effort will be made to expedite arrangements as far as possible and the inclusion of the project in the capital programme will be considered when planning has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter to give the Minister an opportunity to clear the air about the future of the Irish Steel plant at Haulbowline, Cork.  It is unacceptable for the workers and the public to read comments emanating from the Minister's Department about the future of Irish Steel last weekend in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  The paper quoted senior sources at the Department of Enterprise and Employment who said that the Irish Steel plant at Haulbowline will close down next April with the loss of 550 jobs unless the company secures £1 million worth of cuts in payroll costs, lays off at least 60 workers and finds a partner to invest in it.  On 2 November, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> quoted a consultant who recommended that the plant should be closed down if new work practices in Irish Steel cannot be agreed on.</P>
      <P>In a city and county still shell-shocked by widespread industrial job losses, the most recent being Youghal Carpets and Beamish and Crawford, this leaked report creates a further air of depression in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> I am asking the Minister this evening to inform the House &mdash; which is the proper place &mdash; of his plans for Irish Steel both short term and long term and if he has carried out an investigation into how the highly sensitive and confidential document in his Department was leaked to a Sunday newspaper.</P>
    <P>Was it a planned leak by his Department to test public opinion and to shock the workers into taking a certain line of action or is it his Department's way of making public potential job losses in Irish Steel?</P>
    <P>We have heard for a number of years about potential foreign interests in both Irish Steel and the Irish Refining Company. At Question Time today another Government Minister said that a foreign party may be interested in the Irish Refining Company.</P>
    <P>We are tired of waiting for foreign investors to come forward and it is now becoming obvious that we can overcome our difficulties in Irish Steel and Irish Refining only by taking hard decisions ourselves on the level of investment required.  Let me remind the House of the last occasion a foreign investor invested in Verolme in Cork &mdash; we were promised 400 jobs by the Taoiseach &mdash; and we now have four people working there.</P>
    <P>The type of misinformation being circulated in recent days on the level of payment to the committed workforce in Irish Steel is unhelpful and is being used to pressure the workforce into making further concessions.  I am appealing to the Minister in a responsible way to come clean on this whole affair, to outline his plans for Irish Steel, and give guarantees about its survival rather than having reports leaked from his Department in a selective way in order to misrepresent the situation.  Irish Steel is reported to be losing £1 million per month &mdash; if the reports in the newspapers are to be believed &mdash; but the consequences of its closure cannot be contemplated at this stage.  It would be an employment and economic disaster for the greater Cork area and an industrial disaster for the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am appealing to the Minister to act responsibly in this matter.  I am <Col N="773" /> also asking management and unions to step up their efforts to reach agreement on the measures necessary to secure the future of the plant.  The workforce must not be asked to carry total responsibility for the problems at the plant because over the years workers have performed in a most unsocial working environment. They are committed to the plant if it gets sufficient Government support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the points raised by Deputy Allen and which were raised on a previous occasion by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Mulvihill from Cork.</P>
      <P>We are discussing a State owned company that is in difficulties because of a depressed market with poor prices and a costly and less than satisfactory production arrangement.  Hopefully, the market will pick up in time.  We cannot do anything about it.  However, the company and its workers must address the things it can do to improve the situation. If this mill cannot address its problems &mdash; in the way, I suggest, that the Aer Lingus workforce has addressed its problems &mdash; then there could be risks of a business failure.  Failure would not arise because of any official decisions by my Department.  It would happen, if it happens, because the operation cannot go on producing steel at costs which cannot be covered by the proceeds of selling steel.  Deputies will be familiar with the figures for last year.  It is our business in this House to encourage management and workers to avoid such a situation by making such adaptation as can be made to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speculate about the company's cash flow or if it might run out of cash.  It would not assist the company's affairs if I or any other Deputy were to do so.  I can say, however, that the situation is very serious.  I must, therefore, emphasise very strongly the urgent and immediate need for management and unions to agree on savings and on work arrangements to put this mill on a level of performance that compares with any mill in Europe for efficiency and production costs.  That is absolutely essential. <Col N="774" /> Quite frankly, this has not been adequately addressed in the present climate.</P>
    <P>The mill must be more available to management to produce steel and to do so at a lower cost.  That requires some adaptation by workers but also by management. I regret that progress on achieving savings and more efficient and profitable arrangements is too slow.  I strongly urge both sides to discuss the speedy introduction of improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be very careful about going into the details of the company's finances.  Let me make it clear that Irish Steel is a company with promise and potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The details are in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am still making the point because Deputies have to be careful how they respond to items in the newspapers and I am reiterating that in relation to this issue.  Irish Steel is a company with promise and potential, provided the economics of steel production are right.  However, it is not open to any Government in the European Community to invest in or to aid its own steel companies.  In the Community, loss-making companies are having to close. That is the situation.  The rules are quite clear, we would need the unanimous agreement of the European Commission and the governments of each member state to permit us to fund or to invest further in Irish Steel.  The only way in which we could get that agreement would be if we could offer capacity reductions at the plant to counterbalance the aid. As has been made clear in this House previously, we cannot offer such capacity reduction because we have only the one mill.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious problem with getting the unanimous consent of the Commission and member states for giving funds to Irish Steel.  Member states are adamant on the need for respect for EC rules that prohibit aid to steel, as was clearly stated in this House by the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, in the spring of this year to my colleague, Deputy Mulvihill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> There is, however, some hope that following agreement on setting reduced costs and new arrangements to increase the availability of the mill's capacity to management, this company could then attract the interest of a strong outside steel maker &mdash; a partner who could participate in some appropriate way to bring the mill forward on a more secure basis which would help it to continue and to succeed in business.  In any event, with or without such a partner this mill, being a highly capital intensive plant, would require ongoing capital investment.  Even to contemplate justifying such normal but needed investment requires agreement on cost savings and greater availability of the existing plant.  On current costs and performance such an investment simply could not be justified.  Cost savings may involve some reduction in job numbers, though not necessarily immediately.  That may be related more to investment plans. However, that too should be a matter for discussion between the management and workers.  The detail of it is certainly not an appropriate matter for the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the explanation as to why we are discussing such things at all is that the union-management talks seem effectively to have stalled or, at any rate, seem to be moving at far too slow a pace.  I must stress the need for both sides to get back to the negotiating table and to agree solutions &mdash; we have seen how flexible and courageous Irish unions, in particular SIPTU, are and they have demonstrated their capabilities in relation to Aer Lingus.  This, after all, is a business like any other business in that it needs strategies that will ease and improve its cash situation.  Businesses that cannot adapt and improve to cover costs can and do fail.  If this business cannot make the <Col N="776" /> necessary adjustments, it certainly will not be helped to stay in business indefinitely. I urge the unions to give the problems much more urgent consideration and I urge management to negotiate for the maintenance of the greatest number of jobs.  If there is hardship as a result of adjustments, it should, in my view, be spread equitably throughout the entire workforce, including top management.</P>
    <P>Finally, this plant is not a unique situation. All steel makers in Europe are in difficulty and all are making adaptations. The European Commission has identified a need to reduce capacity in Europe.  This would result in some 70,000 job losses. We are not included in those reductions. We want to realise the full capacity of the existing mill as a result of negotiating new work arrangements.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has been very successful in its marketing, sales and distribution and if it could improve its production it could become a competitive mini-mill and accordingly would become a much more desirable partner for inward investment from another steel manufacturer or producer. As a consequence, it could become a very successful player in the European steel industry.  It has the potential and it is Government policy to encourage that potential.  The issue that confronts management and the workforce is the present difficulties over achieving more efficient and lower cost production.  This House should send out a message to all Irish Steel on the need to move quickly to negotiate improvements, which we believe can be achieved. Without them, the economics of steel making in Cobh will not be very auspicious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards those elements within my <Col N="593" /> area of responsibility, I would like to emphasise that my ongoing policy of encouraging increased competition and efficiency in the haulage industry is aimed at providing a more effective service at the lowest possible cost.  This policy includes the application and enforcement of professional standards for admission to the occupation of haulier.  It also includes increasing as much as possible the degree of access for Irish hauliers to international markets by securing EC and ECMT (European Conference of Minister for Transport) multilateral licences and authorisations for our hauliers.</P>
    <P>Other factors which could be said to militate against a lower cost base for the haulage industry such as inadequate roads and port facilities have been progressively addressed by my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and the Marine through the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality and this work is to continue with substantial investment under the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i>.  Under these programmes, the State continue to invest heavily, with EC assistance, in major improvements in transport infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan specifically identifies the need to ensure that energy is consumed as efficiently as possible as a primary objective of Irish energy policy.  In pursuit of this objective, it is proposed to provide considerably increased funding over the life of the plan for a series of efficiency measures which will focus directly on boosting the efficiency of energy use by the consumer.

      <P>I am entirely satisfied that all regional airports are treated equally in the matter of State and EC funding.  All such funds are allocated on the basis of development proposals furnished to my Department by the individual airport companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> As regional airports are private limited companies, responsibility for drawing up development plans is a matter for the board of directors of each airport company, having regard to present and anticipated market potential, the infrastructural improvements necessary to cater for that potential and the company's ability to raise the required cofunding element.  Development proposals are subjected to rigorous examination by my Department.</P>
    <P>State funding for the development of regional airports amounting to £15 million was paid between the years 1981 and 1989.  This assistance was of a &ldquo;priming&rdquo; nature for the purpose of putting in place basic airport facilities.  There has been no Exchequer financial assistance for capital development works at any of the regional airports since 1989.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, a major new capital investment programme of £19 million was announced by my predecessor for the development of regional airports.  That programme, which will finish on 31 December 1993, is co-financed equally by EC Structural Funds and by the regional airport companies.</P>
    <P>In addition to capital grants, as an exceptional case, I have set up a Marketing/Promotion Fund of £1.5 million for the purpose of assisting the regional airport companies in 1993. Pending agreement with the regional airports on specific marketing programmes under this scheme, final allocations have not been decided upon.  However, interim payments have been made to three regional airports as follows:&mdash; Connaught £112,000, Sligo £49,000 and Donegal £58,000.</P>
    <P>Exchequer grants totalling £1.32 million were paid to Kerry regional airport between 1982 and 1989.  An allocation of £6.4 million has been made to the company from the EC Structural Funds under the Operational Programme on Peripherality on condition that the company provide matching funds of £6.4 million from their own resources.  To date, £3.2 million of the allocation has been paid to the company.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the accuracy of a report in the Financial Times of 11 October 1993, to the effect that Telecom Éireann has the lowest productivity of 12 European Telecom systems listed, in terms of number of employees per 1,000 lines; the reasons for this; its implications for phone and fax charges here; if this productivity trend is a recent long term development; and if any targets have been set for the future productivity of Irish Telecom services in comparison with competitor countries in Europe.</Quest>

      <P>The report referred to is accurate in relation to Telecom Éireann.  It is recognised that Telecom Éireann continues to have a staff surplus even though the index of employees to lines has improved dramatically since vesting day in 1984. Having said that, caution is needed in making comparisons of the type contained in the report.  For example, complexities such as whether employees of subsidiaries are included or not or the extent to which contract labour and bought in services are used can have some distorting effect.</P>
      <P>Productivity targets are set for Telecom Éireann in the context of rolling five year corporate plans and a further improvement of 50 per cent is targeted by 1999.  Considerations such as low population density militate against achieving the lowest ratios achievable elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Clearly factors such as lower staff levels and better productivity would inevitably result in relatively lower prices.  It should be noted that telephone tariffs have been declining steadily in this country since 1986.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan which was recently submitted to the European Commission includes provision for an EC assisted investment programme of £220 million which will enable the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative Recommended Strategy to be substantially implemented by 1999.  This investment programme includes provision for expenditure of up to £200 million on the development of a light rail transit network for Dublin.</P>
      <P>A further £20 million has been included in the plan for other public transport projects in Dublin including the development of public transport interchange facilities, integrated ticketing and the upgrading of suburban rail services, including DART.  These issues are being examined in detail at present in the context of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and the preparation of the draft operational programme on transport. Decisions have not yet been finalised in relation to the allocation of the proposed expenditure of £20 million to individual transport projects.</P>

      <P>As the National Development Plan makes clear, there will be structural investment of £870 million by Telecom Éireann during the plan period.  Telecommunications is an inherently profitable sector and it was, therefore, never intended that EC co-financing would be as significant as that required for investment programmes in the non-traded sector.  It is a key strategic objective of Telecom Éireann to maintain its present ability to finance core business capital investment entirely from internal sources.  No action is required on my part at this stage to enable Telecom Éireann to continue to finance its investment programme.</P>

      <P>Since the renewal of the civil war in Angola over a year ago, Ireland and its EC partners have <Col N="599" /> supported the actions and initiatives by the international community to bring the fighting and suffering in Angola to an end.  The Twelve have directly appealed to both sides to the conflict to adhere to and respect the terms of the 1991 &ldquo;Acordos de Paz&rdquo; (Bicesse Peace Accords). The UN Secretary-General's special representative and the troika of Portugal, the US and Russia have repeatedly attempted to bring the two parties together to bring an end to the civil war. Following the ceasefire declared by UNITA on 20 September, talks were convened under the auspices of the United Nations between the Government of Angola and UNITA.  I understand that these talks were postponed at the weekend.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council on 15 September 1993 adopted Resolution 864. Under the terms of this resolution, UNITA was given notice that unless a ceasefire was established and agreement reached on the implementation of the peace accords, an embargo on the sale of arms, military equipment, military assistance and oil would be imposed on UNITA.  UNITA did not comply with the resolution and the embargoes came into effect on 25 September.  Ireland and our EC partners have taken the necessary steps to implement the measures.</P>
      <P>The Security Council recently reaffirmed its readiness to take further measures against UNITA should the situation warrant it.  The report of the Secretary General to the Security Council of 27 October recommended that action to impose further measures against UNITA be postponed until 1 December 1993.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EC partners believe that it is important to maintain pressure on UNITA and encourage the Government of Angola to build on the momentum of the talks in Lusaka.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government envisages that the percentage of GNP committed to ODA will increase from 0.2 per cent in 1993 to 0.4 per cent in 1997, which will put Ireland on a par with most of our EC partners.</P>

The general purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community.</P>
      <P>If the passholder is unable to travel, it is not possible for a spouse under 66 years of age to use the free travel pass in his or her own right.  To do so would involve significant additional expenditure in a scheme which already costs of the order of £30 million a year.</P>

    <P>In 1990, I introduced the free travel <Col N="606" /> companion pass which allows any person over the age of sixteen years to travel free with certain passholders.  The companion pass was designed for the benefit of people who qualify for free travel but are unable to travel alone.  Many people with disabilities, such as mental handicap, were entitled to free travel but gained very little benefit from it unless they had a fare-paying companion to accompany them.  The companion pass was available initially to people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance whom the health boards considered were unable to travel alone.

In the year 1991/92 she has a record of 26 Class A and 26 Class S contributions.  In 1992/93 she has a record of 52 Class S contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> Class S contributions are not reckonable for Maternity Benefit purposes, so on the basis of her insurance record she would not appear to satisfy the contribution conditions.  Moreover, as the Maternity Benefit Scheme applies only to women working for an employer, she would be ruled out on this ground also if she is still self-employed.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the Old Age Contributory Pension, a person must have entered insurance at least 10 years before <Col N="608" /> pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961 and applied to self employed people in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Self employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the Old Age Contributory Pension.</P>
      <P>Detailed consideration was given to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the Old Age Contributory Pension to people who entered insurance for the first time as self employed contributors less than 10 years before pension age.  It was estimated that the net cost of paying Old Age Contributory Pensions to all self employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £765 million over the lifetime of the group of people concerned.  The additional contribution which would need to be paid by self employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions are being examined by the National Pensions Board and they will be reporting on this and other issues in their final report which is expected shortly.</P>

With regard to the Deputy's suggestion, the position is that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for Garda operational matters including the creation of the types of units referred to by the Deputy.  While I strongly welcome the timely initiative by the Commissioner to establish the quick-response unit to deal with attacks against financial institutions, it does not necessarily follow that additional special units to tackle the problems of drugs, car-theft and joyriding is the right way to go about things.  If the Garda Commissioner, in his professional judgment, were to advise me that this was an appropriate course to take, then I would certainly take that advice very seriously, but I have not received any such proposal to date.</P>

Training is for a period of between 13 and 52 weeks.  Trainees receive the appropriate FÁS training <Col N="616" /> allowances from the employer who may recoup 75 per cent of the allowance from FÁS.  Companies may top up the allowance.</P>
      <P>With regard to this company, I understand that they have recently experienced difficulties and are seeking some 40 redundancies.  FÁS has informed the unions involved that participants on the JTS receive training for a set period and are not employees of the company.  This clarification was accepted by the unions.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention that JTS participants should displace existing employees.  I would be most concerned if any company attempted to do this.</P>
      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, an employee shall be taken to be dismissed by reason of redundancy where the dismissal is due to the complete or partial closing down of his place of employment or a decrease in his employer's requirements for employees of his kind and qualifications. The employer may need fewer employees due to reorganisation of business or a trade recession.  The test is generally whether the employer needs fewer employees to do work of a particular kind.  The responsibility for deciding whether an employee is redundant or not rests with the employer in the first instance.  In the case raised by the Deputy, if the proposed redundancies fulfil the above criteria they will qualify for statutory redundancy payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): The Air Pollution Act, 1987, (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987, specify air quality standards for the most widespread pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO²).  Section 54 (5) of the Act requires a local authority to make such arrangements for monitoring as may be necessary so that it can determine if an air quality standard is being complied with.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure an adequate monitoring programme in support of the specified air quality standards, a formal direction was issued to local authorities from my Department in October 1987 requiring monitoring of the specified pollutants by a number of local authorities. A network of monitoring sites for NO 2 has been established covering key urban and major industrial sources; the results of monitoring show compliance with the specified standards.  The recent imposition of significantly lower limit values for exhaust gases from motor vehicles, which are a primary source of NO 2 emissions in urban areas, considerably improves the overall control regime on this pollutant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for various functions to be carried out by the agency in relation to environmental monitoring including the preparation of programmes for monitoring the quality of the environment and the general supervision of monitoring <Col N="619" /> carried out by local authorities.  The Agency is being mobilised at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether it be a private individual or a local authority.  The Department of the Marine's role is to work in conjunction with local authorities on the management of the coastal zone rather than on individual sites.</P>
      <P>EC Structural Funds are being sought under the National Plan to help address the growing erosion problem.  A sum of £5.5 million is to be made available over the period 1994 through 1999.  In order to draw up a national coastal protection plan, all maritime local authorities were invited to submit proposals for addressing serious erosion problems in their administrative areas.  These proposals are with the Department and are currently being examined with a view to their possible inclusion in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> The cost of the proposals submitted far exceeds the moneys available for this purpose under the National Plan.  As a result, the Department will only be able to grant aid local authorities in respect of the most urgent coastal erosion problems proposed, having regard to economic, environmental and ecological impacts.</P>
    <P>Further consultation with local authorities will be required before a list of urgent coastal erosion projects for inclusion in the programme is finalised. In addition, an Operational Programme to enable the EC funding to be drawn down remains to be agreed with the Commission of the European Communities. Pending completion of these exercises it is not possible to identify which projects will be included in the finalised programme. That being said, I am familiar with the particular problem at Bray, County Wicklow and am giving full consideration to its inclusion in the programme.</P>

      <P>The present position in this regard is that work is underway in the Department preparing for the continuation of EC aid for development works at the commercial seaports.  The aim of our overall strategy will be to ensure that our seaports have the capacity and quality of infrastructure to meet the trading conditions of the 21st century.  To achieve this, a comprehensive port development programme, involving expenditure of £100 million over the years 1994 to 1999, is included in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>In so far as port projects are concerned, the Department has identified portal requirements and is now in the process of identifying projects to meet those requirements.  The process will be concluded as soon as possible.  Officials of the Department will be in touch with Drogheda Harbour Commissioners in the very near future in relation to their port development proposals.</P>

      <P>The Government regards peat as an important element in Ireland's energy mix and under the National Development Plan, the Government is committed to continued use of peat for electricity generation provided the costs are not excessive.  Bord na Móna has recently submitted to me a proposal for a new peat-fired electricity generation station which envisages the utilisation of an additional 1 million tonnes of peat per annum.  It is proposed to provide Structural Funds aid for this project.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna is also looking to expand output in their Horticultural and Environmental Products Divisions, particularly in overseas markets.  My objective in relation to Bord na Móna is to see the organisation develop as a solidly structured company capable of continuing to make a valuable contribution to Ireland's energy requirements and sustaining viable employment into the future.</P>
      <P>The future development of Bord na Móna is inhibited by its financial situation with current borrowings of around £180 million.  The immediate priority for the company, therefore, is to restructure this debt in a realistic manner and the Board has recently submitted proposals to me in this regard which are at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>For its part, the management and workforce in Bord na Móna has made enormous progress in recent years in reducing costs and improving productivity. This is borne out by the fact that operating profits per employee have risen by a factor of 4 over the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the present stategy of Bord na Móna in concentrating on the control of costs and undertaking investments <Col N="644" /> that provide a realistic rate of return will reinforce the achievements made to date and allow the continued use of peat for the national benefit.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the need for up-to-date research data on substance misuse generally and, in particular, among young people, if we are to monitor trends and evaluate the effectiveness of health promotion interventions.  I understand that the national alcohol policy which is currently being finalised has identified gaps in the research area and will be making recommendations on how the issue should be addressed.</P>
      <P>However, a number of studies has been carried out in relatively recent times on teenage drinking and drug abuse. Since the early eighties a series of studies on these issues have been carried out on second level school pupils in the Dublin area.  The most recent of these, a three-phase study in 1991, 1992 and 1993 examined drinking and other drug use among 2,000 second level pupils in Dublin.  This study is due for publication in early 1994. At a national level, a survey of alcohol use among a national sample of second year second level students was also carried out in 1990.</P>
      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit also commissioned a major national survey of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in relation to alcohol use and smoking earlier this year.  The results of the survey, which covererd 4,000 young people, are currently being analysed and a report will be published in 1994.</P>

      <P>The patient concerned is on the in-patient waiting list for ophthalmic treatment at University College Hospital, Galway but it is not possible to give an admission date at this stage.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of admission to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel concerned about his condition he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the £20 million major action programme which is now underway in relation to hospital in-patient waiting lists was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  The Western Health Board has been allocated £2,192,600 from the waiting list fund which is the largest allocation to any health agency. This will enable the board to carry out an additional 1,884 procedures this year of which 250 will be cataract operations. This should impact significantly on the average waiting times in these areas.</P>

As regards legislation to regulate the position arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, I have already stated in the House that the issue is a complex one and that I will be engaging in widespread consultation before finalising my proposals.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Stay Safe</i> is an Irish programme which was developed by Irish health professionals and was designed to be culturally appropriate and easily implementable within Irish schools.  The <Col N="659" /> programme was originally introduced into twelve schools on a pilot basis in the 1989/90 school year.  Following the success of the pilot project the programme was extended to all primary schools in the Eastern Health Board region and, subsequently, was extended nationwide.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed for use in primary schools and covers all forms of child abuse including bullying.  Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any overseas data on the effectiveness of this particular programme.</P>
      <P>Early indications suggest that the vast majority of people, both professional and lay, including the Education Partners support this programme and consider that it can have a positive influence in this difficult area.</P>
      <P>In light of the commitment of resources for the training of teachers to ensure correct implementation of the programme at classroom level, my Department will be carrying out a review of the impact of this programme on Irish primary schools.</P>

      <P>In 1992 a special grant scheme was introduced whereby following an application process grants were awarded to individual boxing clubs for the purchase of items of equipment.  The level of grant was based on the membership of each club.  Under this scheme which was implemented in co-operation with the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, grants totalling £181,025 have been awarded to 214 clubs.  In addition, a grant of £18,500 was also paid to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association for the purchase of five computer scoreboards.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's Circular M8/88, which issued to post-primary schools in June 1988, sanction for the operation of a transition year option was confined to schools which offered such courses in the 1987-88 school year or which had four-year junior cycles in 1985-86.</P>
      <P>The terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provide for a six-year cycle of post-primary education &mdash; which will involve a three-year senior cycle &mdash; for pupils entering the senior cycle in September 1994 onwards.  My Department informed post-primary school authorities on 7 July 1993 of the interim arrangements for pupils entering senior cycle in September 1994.  These arrangements offer schools the option of running a three-year senior cycle, which may include a transition year programme, in 1994.  Material on the curriculum for that programme will be issued to all post-primary schools during this school term.  Schools will then be invited to indicate what senior cycle structure they wish to make available to pupils in the school year 1994-95.</P>
      <P>Each application to conduct a transition year will be considered by such criteria as the nature of the programme on offer and its likely capability of achieving the identified objectives of the extra senior cycle year and the qualifications and expertise of the teaching staff to be involved in the programme.</P>
      <P>The transition year allows students to spend an extra year in second-level education and gives them a year's break from the pressures of examination preparation. It gives them an opportunity to gain experience of the world beyond the walls of the classroom, thus broadening and enhancing their general education. It prepares them for a smooth transition to the world of work or to the next stage of their education.  They develop a spirit of initiative and self-reliance and, as they grow in social and environmental awareness, they learn to become responsible and caring citizens.</P>
