      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will be as concerned as other Members at the reports in the media about kickbacks and commission undisclosed in business, and the rekindling of concern about ethics in business.  Will the Taoiseach agree that we should show an example by putting our own house in order?  In that context when will the Ethics in Public Office Bill, which we were told was the first item on the Government's legislative agenda, be introduced?  Is there division between the Government parties on the contents of this Bill?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Government has specifically promised legislation in regard to financial intermediaries which would cover the payment of commission by an insurance company to the director of a building society on a secret basis?  May I ask for a specific commitment, in view of the concern which many mortgage holders have that they are paying over the odds because of this sort of commission, as to when the legislation to regulate this will be introduced?  If this item is low on the Government's priority list they should revise their order of priorities so as to bring this higher up.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1993,</P>
    <P>copies of which Regulations in draft were laid before the Dáil on the 28th day of April, 1993.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979 and their purpose is to reduce the financial contribution by the farming community towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes by a sum of £2 million which sum it is proposed, will be saved on the estimated running costs of this year's programme.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in cattle was first introduced in Ireland in 1954.  The scheme was successful by the mid 1970s in reducing the endemic levels of disease in the national herd to an animal incidence of approximately half of one per cent.  Progress toward final eradication had, however, slowed at that level and persistent difficulties were encountered in achieving further sustained reductions in disease levels.  Clearing residual levels of any infectious disease is difficult but it is surprising that achieving further reductions in the level of TB has proved so difficult.</P>
    <P>In 1988 as a new initiative, ERAD &mdash; the Eradication of Animal Disease Board &mdash; was established by the then Government as a specialised agency to implement a vigorous four year bovine TB eradication programme.  This arrangement operated from 1988 to April 1992.  The main conclusion to be drawn from the ERAD experience is that eradication is more difficult than had originally been envisaged; that high volume of testing per se is not the answer; that special emphasis needs to be placed on the development of technological tools including a computerised movement permit system and a blood based diagnostic test to supplement the existing skin test together with a possible vaccine for cattle and wildlife.  Consideration is currently <Col N="1895" /> being given to the type of arrangements appropriate for the next four years of the programme.  In the meantime, however, it is necessary to continue the effort to systematically and progressively reduce the existing levels of the disease. Ireland's economy depends to a large extent on exports of beef and dairy products and we must continue to pursue the long term objective of eradication.</P>
    <P>When ERAD was established the Government undertook that, in addition to meeting the administrative costs of the scheme, which this year will come to about £18 million it would maintain a financial commitment to the running costs of the schemes.  The current running costs are shared by the Exchequer and the farming community.  The farmers' contribution is provided through levies collected under the 1979 Bovine Diseases Levies Act.  In 1992 farmers contributed £29 million by way of levy.  For 1993 the amount now proposed for collection will be approximately £27 million while the estimated running costs of the schemes for 1993 will be reduced from £43.5 million to £41.5 million.</P>
    <P>The background to the proposed new financial arrangements relate to the establishment of the EC Veterinary Fund under which member states can seek funding for disease eradication measures in the context of reaching a common animal health status to facilitate animal movement in the Single Market.  Ireland has made application to the Commission for EC funding for part recoupment of bovine TB reactor compensation and testing costs amounting to a potential drawdown of some £20 million per year. While the application is technically acceptable to the Commission Services it has not yet been approved as the veterinary fund budget is fully taken up for 1993 and cannot, for the present, fund a number of member state programmes, including Ireland's bovine TB programme. However, I am continuing to press that the money be made available at the earliest possible date.  The availability of EC funding is central to the provision of the amplified resources needed to push <Col N="1896" /> for a sustained reduction in the residual incidence of bovine TB and I intend to continue to ensure that securing of that funding remains a priority.</P>
    <P>Securing this level of EC funding will, of course, allow for the possibility of a significant reduction in the financial burden of the eradication schemes on both the Exchequer and the farming community. However, pending the drawdown of the EC funding it is necessary for trading and veterinary reasons to proceed with an adequate monitoring of the national herd and this year's TB testing programme has, in fact, commenced.  It is proposed that a full round of TB testing will be completed before the end of the year.  This will involve a test for every herd together with any necessary consequential testing arising from reactor disclosure.  In addition, the national herd will continue to be monitored for brucellosis through a combination of milk testing of the dairy herds and blood testing of the non-dairy and suckler enterprises.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations it has been possible to identify agreed savings of £2 million through an adjustment in reactor compensation and a slight reduction in the amount of testing originally planned for this year's programme.  These savings will allow for a reduction in the bovine diseases levies of the order of 0.1p per gallon of milk processed and 60p per animal slaughtered or exported live.  It is proposed to pass back the full amount of the savings to the farming community.  The savings, while relatively modest, have been accepted by the farming organisations as a recognition of the significant cost to herdowners in the context of tightening enterprise margins.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a number of areas of the eradication programme which have caused some controversy in recent times, particularly the role of wildlife. It has been said that my Department is operating a badger slaughter policy. This is simply not true.  The position is that my Department operates a research programme against the background that it is now widely recognised that badgers <Col N="1897" /> play a role in the transmission of bovine TB.  There is a growing body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.</P>
    <P>With regard to control, badgers are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may only be removed under licence.  Where my Department is satisfied that there is a probable link between badgers and an outbreak of bovine TB in cattle, application is made to the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works for a licence to remove badgers for post mortem.  Applications are considered in the context of an agreed programme aimed at determining what role the badger plays in the transmission of bovine TB.  Badgers are humanely removed by shooting and are brought to the most conveniently located veterinary laboratory for post mortem examination and disposal.  The number of badgers removed from the population is minimal. Also, road casualty badgers are fully utilised as research material.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will appreciate that given the overriding requirement to reduce the incidence of bovine TB, a thorough analysis of all the factors involved in disease transmission, including the role of wildlife, must be a key element of any eradication programme. On the overall question of research, the TB investigation unit has been in existence for four years now and has carried out a variety of projects in relation to factors which militate against eradication. It has carried out a considerable amount of analytical work on statistical data.  Nineteen projects were completed in 1992 and an extensive programme of work has been mapped out for 1993. Valuable work is also being done by my Department's veterinary research laboratory especially on culturing post mortem samples and on the evaluation of blood tests.</P>
    <P>Work is continuing on the development of a blood test which has been identified as a major research priority not just in this country but in others having a bovine TB problem.  My Department is participating in EC funded trials, and we are also carrying out our own research <Col N="1898" /> projects and collaborating with research elsewhere in this area.  Although the project is as yet very much at an experimental stage, and progress is slow, the objective is to get to a situation where the blood test would be reliable under practical field conditions and could augment and back up the tuberculin test in certain situations.  If perfected it could be of particular use in clearing out the last vestiges of disease where chronic breakdowns have occurred.</P>
    <P>Research is also in train on ways to address the wildlife factor.  This is a difficult and complex area.  There is a number of related projects in progress including a study on the feasibility of using a vaccine in wildlife.  A project is almost complete also on a census of the badger population.  There are lessons to be learned from other countries where wildlife infection became endemic, and we are collaborating with research workers in these countries.</P>
    <P>Work on the computerised movement permit system is progressing well and, when completed, will be of enormous benefit to the administration of the eradication programme.  The system will be extensive and complex and will form part of the current overall computerisation of my Department.  In the meantime herd owners should consider the benefit of keeping their own records of the movements of cattle into and out of their holdings. In any event, such record keeping will shortly be a requirement arising from the introduction of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The question of value for money spent on the disease eradication schemes has often been raised.  In this regard a recent comprehensive cost-benefit analysis carried out by Professor Séamus Sheehy of UCD has shown that the TB Eradication Scheme has been substantially of benefit to the national economy.  In its absence, the Irish cattle and dairy industries would have remained at a very low level of development and would have been at a severe competitive disadvantage.  The conclusion of the analysis indicated that the benefits exceeded the costs by a minimum of 86 per cent or a rate of real return of 16 per cent on the investment in the <Col N="1899" /> scheme to date.  Given the anticipated improvement in the disease situation it is envisaged that this rate of return will be maintained or enhanced over the next number of years.  The experience of ERAD would indicate that the goal of eradication is more difficult than originally envisaged.  However, I believe that with the full co-operation of all concerned it will be possible to break the back of this disease once and for all.  I commend these regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed that the Minister of State said that he is not in a position to tell us that there will be any substantial new breakthrough in the near future in this area.  I had hoped that perhaps he might have better news for us than that.  Apparently that seems not to be the case.  There are a few reasons for that which I will come to in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a levy of this kind is being reduced.  It is not often that happens and although the reduction is rather small, approximately 7 per cent, everybody concerned will welcome it. There is a number of areas where we need a little more information and a little more application.  It is for that reason that I objected to the Government's request to take this matter in the House without debate.  It did not seem to me to be appropriate to let this pass, if only for the sake of giving the Minister of State, or somebody on the Government side, the opportunity to refer to the study carried out by Professor Sheehy on the eradication programme.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say nice things about Professor Sheehy's study, which are well deserved.  I hope it means that the Labour Party has now come to accept that it is worth spending money on disease eradication. There was a time when the Labour Party, both in Government and in Opposition, targeted expenditure on disease eradication as the first place for cutting public expenditure.  It seems now that saner counsels prevail in the Labour Party and that may be an indication of <Col N="1900" /> more good sense in the future than we are used to from that quarter.</P>
    <P>We all agree that we would wish to see work going ahead as quickly as possible on the development of vaccines both for cattle and for wildlife.  I will return to the wildlife aspect in a moment but the work on developing vaccines for cattle, if it were successful would considerably ease the problem of eradicating this disease. Of course, the main immediate impact of this disease on farming is in regard to the profitability of stock farming rather than anything else.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which do not get sufficient attention.  One of those is epidemiological research where I am aware some work is taking place but there would be greater rewards for expenditure in that area than there might be in some of the other areas where money is being spent.  The second area is in relation to cattle husbandry.  It is clear that in the areas where bovine TB is still a problem there are, undoubtedly, deficiencies in husbandry that contribute to the maintenance of reservoirs of this disease and the occasions when flare-ups and outbreaks occur.  Those two areas, epidemiology and husbandry, seem to me to require more vigorous attention.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister of State say that he is not yet in a position to give us any guarantee that the funding sought from the European Community under the new veterinary fund can be assured.  Is he in a position to tell us when it is expected that a final decision may be made?  The securing of money from this fund and, indeed, the setting up of the fund itself, was trotted out to us some time ago by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as being a victory for him, or a feather in his cap, when he came back from Brussels.  I am disappointed to hear the Minister of State now say that the money cannot yet be made available. He said he would continue to press for the money to be available at the earliest possible date.  That is the type of phrase that covers a multitude.  It could mean there is a chance that it might be decided next week.  It could equally mean that there is not the slightest hope that it will <Col N="1901" /> be made available before the end of next year.  It is Department speak for keeping your options open.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am delighted, along with everybody else involved, to see that we will have a full round of TB testing this year.  All of us concerned with this matter would like to see the rhythm of testing and of the programme maintained. There have been too many occasions in the past few years where there were disturbances of one kind or another in the process and I am delighted that will not be the case this year.  Indeed, if I am correct in my information I gather the process has already started and is fairly well underway.</P>
    <P>I am aware that farmers have already agreed with the modifications in the programme that lead to these reductions in the levy.  It would be remiss of us and would leave the record of this House incomplete if we did not challenge the Minister's remarks that the adjustments in reactor compensation which are part of this package have been welcomed with open arms by the farming organisations. The Minister is aware that they were accepted with a certain amount of reservation because compensation for reactor animals is still a problem for many farmers.  The Minister should not try to tell us that the argument is over just because an agreement has been arrived at in the context of this package.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to wildlife, specifically badgers, in relation to the spread of bovine diseases.  I have been involved in this area in one capacity or another for over 25 years since I first went to work for what was then the National Farmers' Organisation in 1967.  I have seen fashions come and go.  At one time crows and badgers were blamed for spreading TB, indeed weird and wonderful cases were made in regard to its spread.  When I feel particularly foolhardy I am inclined to say that, in relation to the link between badgers and TB, I suspect that very often badgers catch TB from cattle.  The Minister stated that it is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB but I am not convinced.  People have also said that the <Col N="1902" /> spread of bovine TB comes from nose to nose contact between badgers and cattle, usually at night which sounds very romantic but rather unlikely.  The Minister went on to say that we need a thorough analysis of all the factors involved in disease transmission, including the role of wildlife.  Having stated we all know that badgers are involved in the spread of the disease, he then goes on to say there must be more analysis.  I am not convinced, having seen the results of the research and the presentations that we can make that kind of assertion.  It is clear that in all these cases we need to consider the husbandry side.  I realise that husbandry presents many difficult problems because not much is known about how and why TB can survive for so long and how reservoirs of infection which have been dormant for years can suddenly flare up.  To blame the poor badger in the way it has been blamed appears to be seeking an escape route.  I fear the day will come when we might decide that the poor badger was not to blame, by then there will not be many poor badgers left. The Minister said that the badger is a protected species and referred to how testing, culling and removal is done and how road casualty badgers are used and so on.  However, the Minister cannot give us an assurance that badgers are killed humanely.  I am not convinced that the badger plays the kind of role ascribed to it in the transmission of bovine TB.  For that reason, when we are carrying out research and planning disease eradication programmes, we should plan those programmes overtly and specifically on the basis that cattle on our farms will have to co-exist with wildlife.  If we want our cattle to be healthy and to flourish in co-existence with wildlife we will have to take the steps required to look after them better.  We should never operate a programme where the price for maintaining healthy cattle is the removal of wildlife. There is a much wider dimension to all this than the simple question of bovine TB and badgers, but by chipping away at the edges of sanity and reality, society gets itself into stupid positions.  In the future we might regret the mythology <Col N="1903" /> which has grown up in regard to the badger and which the Minister cultivated in his loose language today.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that work on the computerised permit system is progressing well and referred to what will happen when it is completed.  What does he mean by &ldquo;progressing well&rdquo;?  When will the work be completed?  This appears to be another part of the patchwork quilt of insane bureaucracy being introduced to farming.  We are at the stage in farming where, thanks to the new formula, the integrated administration and control system, work cannot be done on farms without involving officialdom.  Few jobs can be done on Irish farms without obtaining permission from officialdom. Unless something is done work on this computerised permit system will be an addition to the many things farmers must do to carry out their normal operations. There are rumours in some quarters that another new system for identifying animals is being considered.  I would hate to see any further extra complications introduced for farmers unless they would entail substantial advantages.</P>
    <P>Disease levies are not the only levies payable by farmers which go into the coffers of the State in connection with the cattle industry.  There is also a levy to support the activities of CBF separate from this levy before us.  However, a levy is a levy to a farmer selling cattle. Farmers will continue to pay to fund the operations of CBF and activities which will produce the type of results we want in terms of marketing food and food products.  I heard the news this morning that it has been decided, apparently as part of the post-Culliton convulsion in the Government, that all matters of trade will remain within the remit of An Bord Tráchtála.  I gather also that it has been proposed, contrary to views of the expert group on food that the activities of CBF and other food marketing operations should be subsumed in An Bord Tráchtála. An Bord Tráchtála would set up a subsidiary company and CBF, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Glas would amalgamate to form that subsidiary, that <Col N="1904" /> would be a very grave error, notwithstanding the protests of Senator Fergal Quinn who referred to a CBF and a Department of Agriculture that ceased to exist some years ago.  My fear is that if the marketing of food supported by farmers' levies is allowed to disappear into the maw of this outrageous bureaucracy which the Government is establishing with Fobairt, Forfás, employment protection units, An Bord Trádála and subsidiary companies, we will have endless reports and arguments about who is responsible and very bad value from the levies and taxpayers' money which has been invested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom a rá nach bhfuil an Páirtí Daonlathach sásta leis an gcóras Stáit a bunaíodh agus atá i bhfeidhm sa tír seo chun an galar seo a leigheas.  Cé go bhfuil an scéim ar siúl le suas le daichead bliain agus a lán airgid &mdash; breis agus billiún punt &mdash; caite air, tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil an dul chun cinn dá réir déanta chun an aidhm seo a bhaint amach.  Tá an rún seo faoinár mbráid anois ag moladh go ndéanfar laghdú ar na levies maidir leis na hathruithe ach nílimid ag dul i gcoinne sin mar, dar ndóigh, tá mo pháirtí ar son cánacha <Col N="1905" /> a laghdú, is cuma cén sórt cánacha iad, agus is dócha gur cánacha iad seo.  Dá bhrí sin, cé go bhfuilimid ag glacadh leis an moladh atá ag an Aire inniu, caithfidh mé a chur ina luí air nach bhfuilimid sásta go bhfuil scéim fhiúntach á feidhmiú ag an Stát agus ceapann a lán daoine nach dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal go dtí go ndéanfar athruithe móra, agus tá roinnt moltaí agam chuige sin.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the levies paid by farmers on cattle and milk, totalling an estimated £2 million, which is now proposed is a joke and can be so described under a number of headings.  First, for the farming community as a whole, it is a case of giving with one hand, and taking with the other, since the £2 million which farmers will save from the reduction in the rate of levies on live and slaughtered animals and on milk sold to the creameries will be largely recouped from a reduction in the State's compensation fund for reactor animals.  Second, the disease levies reduction is intended as a sweetener for farmers given the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to secure agreement in time for the new EC-backed disease eradication programme, which would have seen Ireland pick up approximately £20 million annually from Brussels towards the cost of an intensified eradication programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May, last, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, announced the new EC-backed scheme, and promised that as a result the levies paid by farmers could be reduced by a third, or £10 million approximately, which, of course, would be a significant saving to farmers who paid £29 million in disease levies last year.  Therefore, we are talking about a significant contribution from the farming community.  However, failure on the part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to finalise the terms of the new scheme with farmers and veterinary surgeons, largely because of the veterinary surgeons, meant that when we finally got our act together, the response from Brussels was that all the money was gone.  To make matters worse, when we <Col N="1906" /> sought to secure the first annual tranche of £20 million for this year, the same thing happened.</P>
    <P>Sadly, therefore, our failure to get our act together in time in agreeing a revised and intensified eradication programme acceptable to Brussels has meant that we effectively lose out on the enhanced funding of £20 million annually for two years, 1992 and 1993.  We have lost £40 million already.  Of course, this messing is only the latest round in a sorry saga of bovine disease eradication here, which does no credit to any of the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Next year, the eradication programme will be 40 years old.  In the meantime, well over £1 billion has been spent, in excess of two million animals have been slaughtered, and we still have not rid the country officially of bovine TB and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the former Senator, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, once described the disease eradication programme in the Seanad as a major scandal and the greatest waste of public funds undertaken under any public programme of which he was aware?  Added to that, in some respects the position is getting worse.  For instance, when ERAD, the special board to oversee the eradication of these diseases, was established in April 1988, its official target was to halve the then incidence of bovine TB in an intensified four-year programme.  At the end of that period last year, the overall national figure showed no improvement, and some counties showed a significant deterioration.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that over the past 40 years or so, disease eradication has proved a costly failure, but worse than that, it has become an industry which many veterinary surgeons especially would not like to see ended.</P>
    <P>It is time, therefore, that we gave serious consideration to the whole basis on which the eradication of bovine disease is currently structured.  Some years ago, the Progressive Democrats proposed a radical change in the operation of the bovine TB eradication programme which was acknowledged by <Col N="1907" /> many people in the industry as the only common sense and effective way of achieving real progress towards the goal of eliminating bovine TB altogether, that was to effectively privatise the operation, and make it an exclusively farmer-vet operation.  In other words, to give the farmer responsibility for the health status of his herd, and let TB testing and its cost be entirely a matter between the herd owner and his veterinary surgeon.  That would remove the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry from the administration of the scheme, and confine it to a policing role.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to adopt the Progressive Democrat proposal it would mean that the disease levies paid by farmers would be discontinued altogether and the cost of the State's involvement, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry would be reduced substantially.  Under such a system the full compensation for reactors would be paid only to herd owners who comply with regular testing requirements and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry would be given the power to slaughter at-risk herds where the farmer fails to co-operate in routine testing and disease control.</P>
    <P>If such a system were in operation I have no doubt that the cowboys and carelessness that is the cause of much of the disease problem would be quickly wiped out.  All farmers would realise that it was in their own interest that proper and effective testing of their animals was carried out regularly and that proper precautions were always taken to avoid careless spreading of disease, particularly during the transportation and change of ownership.  The health status of each animal would become the personal concern and responsibility of individual farmers rather than that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, as is the perception of some unscrupulous farmers at present.</P>
    <P>Making the farmer responsible for testing his own animals is in line with the EC principle of subsidiarity and coupled with a blood test for TB instead of the present <Col N="1908" /> unsatisfactory system should guarantee that Brussels would readily approve its contribution towards disease eradication here and the £20 million mentioned would help the Department meet the full cost of compensation for reactors.</P>
    <P>In the interest of taxpayers and the majority of farmers who are conscientious and diligent in observing disease prevention measures, the present unsuccessful system which has cost more than £1 billion cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>One has only to compare the lack of success in eliminating bovine TB here with the outstanding success achieved in the other jurisdiction on this island to realise that our failures relate more to the way we have organised our eradication programme as compared to the UK Government's effort in Northern Ireland.  I would like the Minister to refer to the position in Northern Ireland and explain to the House why they can achieve such a high degree of success and we cannot.  Blaming the badger for the spread of this disease is taking the easy way out.  I have spoken to senior veterinary surgeons in the Minister's Department who do not believe the badger is to blame for spreading TB among our cattle herds.  There is no definitive scientific proof available which can lead one to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>I think this problem has more to do with the way we have organised the scheme and, in particular, the type of test applied.  Vets will tell you privately, but not publicly, that they and their colleagues have a vested interest in the scheme; this scheme has been the source of very substantial income for many vets. If the skin testing method referred to by the Minister in his speech is not a success, then it is incumbent on us to change to a system which will achieve a higher degree of success.  From advice I have received in discussions with vets, I am of the opinion that until such time as a blood test for each individual animal is introduced we will never succeed in eliminating bovine TB from our cattle herd.  The sooner we make that change the better for the reputation of Irish farm produce and <Col N="1909" /> meat products.  I urge the Minister to take serious account of the views expressed, both inside and outside this House, about the huge amounts of taxpayers' money which have been spent under this scheme which has not, as yet, achieved any reasonable degree of success.  He should cast aside those who may have vested interests in placing obstacles in the way of the changes necessary in the scheme in order to achieve the success which is vital.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our primary industry.  It is an indigenous industry of enormous value to this country both as a revenue earner and an employer.  Farming is a way of life for many of our people.  During the debate on the Animal Remedies Bill, it was emphasised by all speakers that we need to achieve the highest possible standards in our farming enterprise so that our farm produce will have the highest reputation in the market place.  We can never make this claim until we eliminate bovine TB and take the right steps to do so.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear this morning that there was to be a reduction in the levy paid by farmers for disease eradication.  I thought that at last the powers that be had seen the light. However, on further reading I discovered that the reduction would amount to a mere pittance, a mere 60p reduction from £7.90 to £7.30 per animal.  The milk levy will be reduced from 1.4p per gallon to 1.3p per gallon, a reduction of 0.1p per gallon.  While any reduction is most welcome, those reductions are derisory.</P>

    <P>Reference is often made to the financial aids given to farmers for the activities in which they are engaged.  However, one must bear in mind that such financial assistance is not of benefit to farmers only.  Approximately 15.3 per cent of our workforce is directly involved in farming while a further 16.5 per cent is directly <Col N="1910" /> involved in agriculture related industries. This means that approximately 32 per cent, almost one third, of our workforce, is directly involved in farming and agriculture-related industries.  Therefore, any benefits which accrue to the primary producer also benefit the country in general.</P>
    <P>The money spent on disease eradication was essential and paid great dividends. If our disease status was not at its present level we would have forfeited our markets.  There is no point in farmers having huge numbers of animals if there is no market for them, as we discovered a few years ago when it was perceived by other countries that there was an outbreak of mad cow disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, in our herd. This is the reason we lost our market in Libya.  That perception by the Libyans was not correct.  I understand that some of our competitors on the Continent broadcast that impression.  As a result, we lost our Libyan market for three years.  When this market was re-established in February, as a result of the efforts of the Minister and his predecessor, there was an immediate upsurge in the price of cattle which benefited farmers tremendously, both financially and psychologically.  It is essential that we have a disease-free herd.  Any money spent in achieving this is money well spent.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EC farmers were told that they should increase their cattle herds and sheep flock numbers.  Farmers responded in a major way to those requests.  Maybe they responded too heartily in so far as sheep numbers are concerned because they are now getting less for their lambs than they got heretofore. However, that is a matter for another day.  For the first time in our history there are in excess of 7 million cattle in this country.  This has been brought about as a result of the response by farmers to the requests by the Department and the EC to increase numbers. The number of breeding cows has increased from approximately 1.9 million eight years ago to 2.3 million today.  The number of breeding ewes has increased <Col N="1911" /> from approximately 2 million in 1985 to approximately 5 million today.  This increase in numbers has been brought about as a result of the tremendous response by farmers to the requests by the Government to increase numbers.</P>
    <P>It will be a pity if farmers, having responded to the requests to increase stock numbers, discover at the end of the day that there are no markets for their animals.  It must be borne in mind that a farmer who invests his money in extra stock has to tighten his belt in terms of expenditure in other areas of farming. He cannot afford to go out on the town every night if he wants to invest some of his profits in his business.  I must compliment the farming community on their tremendous response.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that testing for the incidence of TB and brucellosis had actually begun because I had not thought it was to begin so quickly.  I understand that, within a 12-month period, there will have been in the region of 9 million tests undertaken, a tremendous amount.  The costs of testing, apart from administrative costs, are in the region of £43 million of which farmers pay £29 million out of their pockets, the Exchequer bearing in the region of £13 million or £14 million in costs.  While it is good to note the Exchequer is bearing that amount we must keep in mind the huge pressures being placed on the farming community for the eradication of those diseases particularly when we remember that so many of our people rely on the primary producer, namely the farmer.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear what Deputy Dukes had to say about the badger and its association with the incidence of bovine TB.  There is quite an amount of evidence demonstrating that the badger is involved directly in the spreading of TB.  I might add that some experiments carried out in County Offaly approximately five years ago clearly demonstrated a link between the two.  Yet the association of the badger with the spreading of the disease may not be quite as extensive as had been thought.  Deputy Dukes contended that it was the badger that contracted the disease <Col N="1912" /> from cattle rather than <i>vice versa.</i> I contend that if the badger can contract the disease from cattle it is logical to conclude that the badger can pass on the disease to other cattle.  However, I would not be in agreement with widespread eradication of the badger or of any wildlife. But if evidence proves that, in certain cases, wildlife is responsible for the spreading of the disease, then we must be cruel to be kind and must remove those nests of wildlife responsible, which would appear to be the approach being followed.</P>
    <P>We must realise that there is much more involved in the eradication of disease than the mere abolition of all and sundry animals affected.  In this respect greater attention to hygiene on farms and in the transport of cattle from one farm to another is much to be recommended and constitutes the right path to be followed in the eradication of disease. Farmers in their approach to the eradication of the disease, as well as cattle dealers, must accept responsibility for much of the incidence of disease which has occurred from time to time.  When I refer to greater hygiene on farms I am thinking of machinery used to spread slurry and so on.  While there may not be conclusive evidence, it would appear that where a contractor spreads slurry in a given area, TB appears to surface there, which pattern may follow throughout the territories in which he may have deployed his machinery.  We should pay much greater attention to both hygiene and husbandry.</P>
    <P>Professor Séamus Sheehy undertook an interesting survey on the eradication of bovine disease.  Deputy Molloy was critical of the moneys spent on the eradication of TB over many years.  Perhaps his suggestion of engaging private contractors in the eradication of both TB and brucellosis is worthy of consideration. Forty years ago, when the TB eradication scheme was first introduced, I doubt that such a suggestion would have gone very far.  According to Professor Séamus Sheehy, even at an expense of £1 billion so far, it was a wise investment on the part of successive Governments, in that <Col N="1913" /> he calculated that such investment yielded a dividend of 15 per cent over those years. Professor Sheehy has calculated that the benefits of eradication exceeded costs by some 86 per cent.  Since Professor Sheehy is a well-known agricultural economist I would be extremely slow to disagree with anything he might say, despite statements on the part of former Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are told by ERAD that eradicating bovine disease is proving more difficult than had been thought originally.  We must bear in mind that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.  Present indications are that 3.3 animals per thousand fail tests but we should never relax until the figure had been reduced to zero, though it may prove exceedingly difficult.  We should acknowledge that we have progressed a long way in the 40 years since the scheme was first introduced and that there was an improvement wrought in those figures even over the past two years.</P>

      <P>The history of TB eradication has been one of continuous abject failure.  For example, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, a former Governor of the Central Bank, who should know much about financial scandals described it as the greatest of all in the history of this State. More colloquially, many people have described the eradication scheme as the vets' dole.  The fact that the scheme was launched in 1954 and we are still discussing the possibility of the total eradication of TB is indicative in itself.  I was a small child when that scheme began; I am now a grandmother.  I wonder how many more generations must pass before we will have been successful.  The experience in other countries has been rather different where they have been able to enjoy the full, unconditional support of farmers for their policy of TB eradication. Here we have been hampered both by the attitude of our farmers to this eradication programme and by the rather cosy relationship the vets have enjoyed, very lucrative for them, but very unsuccessful when we examine the return we have got for our investment of £1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all welcome the use of <Col N="1914" /> improved technology but the question arises also of structural changes in the manner in which the scheme is operated. One could also ask whether it would be more cost effective to train technical staff to carry out this work rather than employ expensive vets whose record is one of failure rather than success.</P>
    <P>In relation to the inspection of meat plants, last week agricultural officers threatened to take industrial action on the question of staffing and overtime. Again, the question must be asked whether we are obtaining the best return for the money we are investing or concentrating too much on investing in vets as opposed to technical officers who could be trained and equipped to do the job.  In the case of one cold meat plant someone made the point that a vet is rather like a doctor at a morgue and somewhat superfluous.</P>
    <P>Under these regulations a certain proportion of the cost will be shifted away from our farmers and the taxpayers, who have been bled dry during the years, and towards the European taxpayer who will be expected to carry some of the load when we can get our act together.  We have to look at the way in which this money is being spent to ensure that the problem is eradicated once and for all.</P>
    <P>In this regard, too much of the blame has been attached to the unfortunate badger which is suffering as a consequence. The Minister of State may be correct when he argues that it may well be a carrier.  I strongly believe, however, that the badger is not the cause of this problem but rather the victim.  Northern Ireland has been cited as an example, where the badger is clearly TB free. Therefore we need to face reality rather than make this unfortunate animal a scapegoat.  It does not deserve this reputation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we debated the question of animal remedies and touched on the development of the food industry.  It is clear and should be stated again that we have failed to monitor and ensure proper standards right across the board.  This has proved damaging and is most evident in relation to the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> This is a difficult and challenging time for agriculture.  Although there are great opportunities to create jobs and wealth, farmers also face difficulties in coming to terms with these challenges.  We need to ensure that the highest standards are maintained and if this means that new and radical measures are required then we should introduce those measures. However, it is most disappointing that there is no evidence in the Minister of State's speech that a new and radical approach will be adopted in relation to the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion.  Reductions in levies are seldom announced &mdash; in the main, they are increased.  While criticism has been expressed in relation to the amount concerned I would never be critical of any moves to put £2 million into the pockets of our farmers.  This is a substantial sum of money even if it is to be divided among 172,000 herd owners.  Indeed, it is nine years since the last reduction in the levies.</P>
      <P>Many areas which were free of TB from the early fifties to the seventies now face serious problems.  In some places brucellosis has reared its ugly head again. In relation to administrative costs, which amount to £43 million while the amount concerned, £7.90 for each cow slaughtered, may be considered small when inspection fees and insurance costs are taken into account the overall cost to the farmer is substantial.  Last year I brought the case of a farmer who had a small number of stock and was confronted with a major problem to the attention of the Department but the amount he was given for each of the animals did not amount to twice the levy.  Therefore some allowances should be made in the case of farmers who obtain a low return for their animals in regard to price and compensation payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's assurance that pending the drawdown of EC funding it will be necessary to proceed with an adequate monitoring of the national herd and that this will involve a test for each of the herds arising from the <Col N="1916" /> reactor disclosure.  Deputy Dukes made great play of his policy but the Government of which he was a member adopted a stop-go approach in regard to testing. Every effort should be made to clear any obstacles to secure the £20 million we have applied for.  In a press release the Minister indicated that a management board would be set up while today the Minister of State said that funding will be made available for new technology.  Even though many surveys have been carried out this is still a recurring problem in many areas.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister of State's assurance that the rates of compensation will be reviewed.  Having regard to the fact that the value of livestock has increased substantially a reasonable level of compensation should be paid so that farmers will be in a position to restock their farms as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for the system of animal tags and numbers to be computerised and we would like to see the Minister working speedily.  In this regard the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Work on the computerised movement permit system is progressing well and, when completed, will be of enormous benefit to the administration of the eradication programme.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that &ldquo;in the meantime herd owners should consider the benefit of keeping their own records of the movement of cattle into and out of their holdings&rdquo;. For a number of years I drew the attention of agricultural policy committees and two Ministers to the system operating in Northern Ireland where there is a stock register in which all purchases and sales must be registered.  If we were to adopt a similar approach here all transactions could be easily examined.</P>
    <P>The blood test has been mentioned.  In my own area we have had many problems with TB down through the years and we are still not completely free of it.  While one can carry out all the surveys one likes farmers are very sharp and sometimes are much better at analysing trends than the scientists.  Many will tell us that there is a need for double fencing between <Col N="1917" /> holdings.  If it is at all possible there should be a subsidy for those who are willing to erect double fencing.  This could be carried out on a pilot basis.  I believe this is the type of approach we should take because lateral contact seems to cause problems.</P>
    <P>The livestock industry continues to be very important, not only for farmers but in downstream activities like processing and exporting. I believe this is the area that has the greatest potential for job creation whether in slaughtering or in downstream processing.  Seasonality of supply still causes problems for the industry. The payment of slaughter premiums in the spring may improve the situation. The problem arises because farmers are not rewarded for the intensive feeding of their cattle over the winter months with the result that a greater number of cattle come on the market at the end of the year and prices fall.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in the number of sheep and suckler herds. The quality of stock has improved.  At present because of subsidies there is a demand for a certain type of beef cow and this will result in much higher quality carcases.  It is important that we cash in on this and get the best value from it.  I believe we should set up a committee in the Department to examine the potential for job creation in agriculture.  If necessary we should employ expert knowledge, for example in the fields of industry and technology, because one has only to go to a supermarket to see the massive number of imported meat products. There are opportunities if we were able to cash in on them and we could create many jobs in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reduction of £2 million in the cost of levies to farmers.  While one cannot but welcome this it must however be compared with the possibility of a reduction of £10 million if proper action had been taken over the past number of years to get the agreed EC funding that was made available a number of years ago.  Five years ago a senior EC official spoke at a <Col N="1918" /> farmers' conference and he made it clear that money was available provided a proper programme was put forward.  I fully appreciate the sincere efforts of recent Ministers and the present Minister and his staff to bring forward a programme that would be acceptable to Brussels.  Unfortunately, some sectors involved in the negotiations put their personal sectoral interests before the wellbeing of the national herd.  As a result, the cut in levies amounts to only £2 million, instead of a possible reduction of £10 million to £20 million.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to learn that a full herd test will be carried out this year.  In my area the incidence of disease is higher than we would like.  It is very important that a test of all herds is carried out each year and that the district veterinary offices are properly staffed.  Because of staff shortages, a great many herd owners do not know when there is an outbreak of disease on neighbouring farms.  I believe we can do a great many things to tighten up the disease eradication programme. My constituency colleague, Deputy Leonard, said it was crazy &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that the levies at the factories were as great as the amount paid for the total carcase, especially for small animals.  I hope his colleagues in Government were listening to him.  These are very sad situations and people need to be helped rather than hindered.  We need to ensure there is proper compensation paid for small animals and animals in calf. There are a great many ways to improve the scheme to make it more effective for farmers and the industry in general.</P>
      <P>We export 80 per cent of all our beef and dairy products and it is vital, therefore, that a proper scheme is put in place and that staff are available to man it and that we carry out research so that farmers may be better informed on the reasons for the outbreak of the disease.  I agree with Deputy Leonard's comments on double fencing.  However, in our constituency there are extremely good farmers who have double fenced their holdings and who have done everything right and yet there are outbreaks of this dreaded disease in their herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> The badger has been mentioned as one source of the disease and there is no doubt that it and deer have created problems in some areas but in the main the problem is caused by people who totally reject the scheme's conditions &mdash; people who switch tags, those who deal illegally in cattle and move cattle illegally.  These practices must be stamped out.  The only way we can do this is to have a properly controlled computerised permit system so that we will be able to trace, on a daily basis, where our cattle are and where they should be.  Progress has been made on computerisation but I was saddened that the Minister was not able to tell us if and when it will come into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to say some few words on this subject.  I probably have more experience than anybody in this area.  I was surprised at the contributions of some of the Members, for instance, Deputies Dukes, Molloy and McManus.  The other contributors, however, have some experience and have worked at the coal-face of the eradication programme.</P>
      <P>In 1954 the late Canon Hayes promoted a pilot scheme in disease eradication in my native parish of Bansha. We carried out intra-dermal tuberculin testing and compensated the farmer by replacing the animal that was taken away. That was the beginning and end of State intervention in farmers' business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then we have moved from the saga of turpentine testing and the complete disregard for technical experience available through the Department.  As a past member of the Animal Health Council &mdash; I served with many people on that council including the current President of the IFA &mdash; the advice available within the Department, and from their veterinary staff, was not always acceptable either to the veterinary profession or to the farming organisations.  We have come through a phase of colossal spending <Col N="1920" /> by the State in this area, which is the responsibility of the State.  In this regard I disagree totally with Deputy Molloy who talked about privatisation and said the farmer should be responsible for this aspect of animal husbandry.  I remind the Deputy that responsibility for the national herd and its health is a matter for the State.  In that area lies the international dimension of trading, whether in live animals or meat exports.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries of this scheme since its initiation have been the factories which took advantage of farmers in difficulty, the hauliers who would not even clean their trucks and the veterinary profession who are paid on a headage basis. There is no incentive to provide management or husbandry advice to farmers. Because payment is made on a headage basis these people are interested only in getting in and out of a farm as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my appreciation, and that of many people, for the efforts of Dr. Downey who published his view on how this should be developed. The major responsibility for testing lies not alone with the farmer but also with the veterinary profession.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise in that animals become desensitised to the continuous use of tuberculin and as a result do not react to the normal intradermal testing. Advanced technology in the area of tuberculin is necessary.  In some cases animals that do not react are later found by the factories to have positive lesions. As a result farmers lose faith in the whole process of tuberculosis testing.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his contribution and his assurance that further money will be invested in epidemiology and finding the root cause of diseases.  He said consideration would be given to the lateral spreading of disease from wildlife. Badgers have been identified as carriers of disease but nobody knows whether it is transmitted to them from other animals. A blood testing system should be introduced to identify tuberculosis, thereby resulting in a more effective system than exists.</P>
    <P>Farmers have contributed much <Col N="1921" /> money by way of levies but not one farmer has made a half-penny from the scheme.  They have incurred losses with depopulation of stock, loss of markets and herds being locked up.  Farmers would like to see the eradication of disease so that no testing would be necessary.  The incidence of disease is decreasing but the State has a major responsibility to ensure the protection of the health of our national herd.  I commend the Minister for his efforts and I will monitor progress in this regard.  We all have a responsibility in this area irrespective of the views expressed by Deputy Dukes that socialists hold different views on this matter&mdash;one could not but have a different view to that of Deputy Dukes. The Labour Party has played a major role in this scheme from its initiation and has always defended the rights of herd owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first refer to some of the points made by Deputy Dukes in relation to expenditure on disease eradication.  As I said, and as has been mentioned in the debate, the farming community makes a very sizeable contribution, in the order of £29 million, to the overall funding of disease eradication &mdash; the State's contribution amounts to about £80 million. There may have been over-emphasis on the taxpayers' contribution as referred to by Deputy Dukes.</P>
      <P>As regards the vaccination of animals, this is a matter the consumer would not be very happy to accept, and it is not being pursued in the Department.  The areas of epidemiology and husbandry need greater attention.  As regards scientific investigation, the extra funds being actively pursued by the Minister at European level will play a big role in this area.  The funds being sought, £20 million annually for three to four years, would reduce considerably the financial burden on both the Exchequer and the farming community.  I emphasise that this year under the scheme 9.8 million tests will be carried out on our herd of 7 million animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> There has been much comment in relation to the badger and slaughter of that animal.  I referred to that matter in my opening speech.  The estimated population of badgers here is in the order of 250,000 and the number removed annually for health and scientific purposes is between 1,500 to 1,800.  Obviously, the Department takes advantage of road casualties among badgers for use in scientific research.  The number of badgers removed each year in a humane way is not significant in terms of the overall population&mdash;the badger population here is equivalent to that in Sweden.  The solution to the badger problem lies in the development of a suitable vaccine and, as I indicated, work is proceeding in this area.  Deputy Dukes referred to the effect of badgers on cattle in rural areas.  Even though responsibility for wildlife lies with the Office of Public Works, my Department is anxious to ensure a continuation of the wildlife population.  However a balance must be struck.</P>
    <P>In the promotion by CBF in British and other European markets the quality of our product is emphasised.  CBF have made tremendous strides in establishing a quality image for the Irish product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was saying that nobody would condone the actions of some people in using angel dust and I accused them of being guilty of second degree murder.  If illegal organisations use angel dust in order to raise funds and farmers continue to use it, we have a double <Col N="1923" /> enemy.  Enhanced powers of enforcement for the Garda and officers of Customs and Excise to deal with the misuse of regulated remedies are essential in order to protect the excellent reputation of Irish meat and food products at home and abroad.  If our image becomes one of having diseased or contaminated food it will do irreparable damage to our reputation which we have spent much public money in promoting overseas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions for stiffer penalties for persons found to have imported, sold or administered the growth promoting substance regulated by this Bill.  It is a matter of grave concern that residues of animal remedies should remain in meat products.  Angel dust is a highly dangerous animal growth promoter. The hormone in the substance can cause heart attacks if taken in sufficient quantities.  There is evidence to suggest that a high intake of angel dust by a pregnant woman can result in permanent damage to the foetus.  Hormonal imbalance caused by eating meat contaminated by growth promoters has caused premature adolescence in children elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>Administering angel dust to a beast reduces the natural fat content and enhances lean meat or muscle, which is why farmers use the product.  They see fast profits from it.  Farmers who do not use growth promoters and who return their cattle to the same mart for sale can identify the farmers who use angel dust. When it comes to selling a product reared on the best grass in Europe as against the product reared on angel dust, they are not even in the market.  It is a disgrace that there is a network of distributors of angel dust throughout the country and that there has been for a number of years, despite successive Ministers' efforts in this regard.  It is time we addressed this scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that in my county people living in the heart of the Golden Vale should resort to this drug.  In 1990 the Minister for Agriculture appointed a task force to monitor incidents of positive testing for angel dust.  By April 1991 only <Col N="1924" /> 97 herds had been tested out of a total of 150,000 herds.  That gives an idea of the extent of the problem.  More than 10 per cent of the herds sampled tested positive for illegal substances at that time.  That is an indication that this Bill, while necessary, is almost too late.</P>
    <P>The legal back-up which will be given to Department officials to search for and confiscate angel dust is necessary.  I commend this Bill to the House on behalf of all of us who are interested in promoting our food products at home and abroad. Any action we can take to protect our good image will benefit future producers. The powers the Minister requires should be made readily available by this House. We should publicise the fact that we are out to get these criminals who damage the health of humans and animals.  We also want to get the people who use this product to gain illicit funding for illicit operations.  I would ask the Minister to be vigilant in operating the new regulations. I would ask the courts to impose the maximum possible penalties.  If the penalties are severe enough, as they were in the past with regard to the use of antibiotics in cheese products and so on, it will hurt producers in their pocket, where it hurts most.  Only then will there be some movement away from the use of these products and towards living within the normal requirements of natural production of some of the best quality food in the world, of which we should be very proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crawford and Connaughton. I am glad of the opportunity to support this Bill.  My only doubts relate to whether or not it goes far enough and whether or not we will implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that a minority of farmers are prepared to damage the good name we have achieved with regard to food products.  This minority are not farmers in the strictest sense of the word. They are commercial enterprises who are simply there for profit and the consequences do not enter into their minds. These people are quite well known in many cases.  It is known who they are <Col N="1925" /> and from where they operate.  They are known in the Department and in the meat factories.  When cattle are being booked into meat factories the question asked by meat factory owners is if the cattle are being fed on dust, and if they are they fetch a higher premium.  There is no doubt about that.  If cattle are not being fed on dust the factories are not interested in some cases or else they pay a lower premium.  That is how these cattle are getting through the system.</P>
    <P>My doubts about the legislation and about implementing it arise from a question I put to the Minister almost two years ago on Thursday, 4 July, 1991 as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has satisfied himself that the inspection and testing of carcases at abattoirs and meat factories is adequate to detect the use of substances such as angel dust and/or jungle juice in the production of beef by some large scale beef producers in this country; if not, whether he intends introducing new legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>In reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the testing regime in place at meat factories and the powers available to veterinary inspectors to detain and sample suspect animals and carcases are adequate to detect illegal usage of growth promoting substances and to ensure that meat containing such residues does not enter the food chain.</P>
    <P>If that was the case the problem should have been eliminated.  It is not the case and these people are getting their cattle through the system.  Somebody somewhere is not doing his job.  About 95 per cent of farmers are honest, decent, law-abiding people and far too often for minor offences they are treated as criminals. This is a major offence by people who are highly involved in producing bulk meat, irrespective of quality.  The question must be asked as to how they can get through the system.  At the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry we learned that officials were <Col N="1926" /> not doing their job and turned a blind eye to what was happening &mdash; it is probable that there was money on offer.  This was only a small number of people but they were in key positions.  There are excellent diligent and conscientious officials who were troubled by what they saw happening but when they brought it to attention they were demoted.  Both I and the Minister know that for a fact and nobody need deny it.  While that is happening this problem will continue.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a name for quality meat which is produced on grass or silage without any additives and there is a market for it.  We are talking principally about food products.  In the dairy world we made a household name of an Irish brand called Kerrygold where we could not supply the market because of the huge demand.  That market can be damaged by unscrupulous people who produce low quality meat.  One meat factory owner told me that carcases treated with angel dust or jungle juice when put into cold storage would not set but turned into a rotten slime.  We saw evidence of that at the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry.  When an animal falls ill it has to be treated and must be retained for a certain period.  Sometimes, animals are fed in the morning and sent to the factory in the evening.  The Minister has the support of my party and that of every decent honest farmer in Ireland in ridding the system of those people. This would result in a levelling of the playing field and everybody would be given a fairer opportunity to compete in the market place.  We have proved that there will be a market.  All the experts said that farmers would have to be prepared to accept lower prices but the markets have opened up.  I assure the Minister of my wholehearted support and that of the farmers I represent in Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to lend my support to this Bill.  It is sad that we need it because we had all hoped that the people involved in the use of illegal substances would have been brought to justice long ago.  I want to emphasise that <Col N="1927" /> we do not want to see ordinary small farmers or small time operators being used as scapegoats for the real criminals in this business.  There is a danger that the powers that be will find it much easier to go after the ordinary farmer who has been misled into using this substance and that he may be portrayed as the real criminal.  I do not condone any person who uses this substance but we must ensure that we go after the real criminals, those who hope to make huge sums of money by whatever means and regardless of their long term interests, which are definitely not the Irish farmer, the food chain or the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>As one who has been involved in meat promotion for some years I realise how damaging a discussion such as this can be as it can be used against us by our competitors.  For once and for all we must take this issue seriously and ensure we do not find ourselves in the same position as the Belgians and others who had bans on all these substances many years ago and who are still openly flaunting the use of growth promoters of the worst kind. This could easily be seen when one walked into a cattle market and lifted up an animal's tail.  These growth promoters were being used under the direct eye of the European Commission so they know how difficult it was to put a ban into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real danger is to the ordinary commercial farmer who wants to do his job properly and remain in business.  The fact that some people have been allowed to use growth promoters, angel dust etc., has meant an increase in carcase weight. This has come about because proper action was not taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and it has meant that the European Commission has decided to introduce a carcase weight limit.  Commissioner MacSharry actually agreed to introduce a 340 kilo weight limit.  This means that those genuine livestock farmers who are trying to upgrade their herds to continental standards and want a good carcase weight and good quality for our European markets &mdash; which are becoming more important on a daily basis <Col N="1928" /> because of the curtailment of intervention and third country export refunds &mdash; are being asked to bear the burden of the carcase restrictions, partly because we failed to curtail the use of illegal growth promoters and other substances.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his belated action in ensuring that this matter is properly handled.  I assure him I will both publicly and privately give him all the support necessary to ensure that these people, be they subversives or otherwise, are brought to justice.  I emphasise that I do not want the ordinary small operator made a scapegoat to justify the actions of the Minister and the Government and that the real criminals must be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  From my previous experience I should say that everybody in Agriculture House is firmly resolved to stamp out this practice in so far as it is possible.  I have one major reservation about this Bill which will be the main plank of my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer first to the overall scene.  I do not think the farmers, the processors or the marketeers of the agricultural community fully understand what will hit us during the next couple of years.  Intervention was the system into which we put 80 per cent of our steer beef.  It is the avowed intention of the EC that intervention will be phased out.  We experienced much difficulty in selling one quarter of our produce direct to the supermarket shelves in Europe; in fact we were not able to do it.  What type of difficulties will we face if we have to sell four, five and six times that amount of produce because we will not have the crutch of intervention?  Suddenly it becomes a huge selling task.  I do not have to inform the House that the environmental lobby is like a huge roller coaster not alone throughout Europe but throughout the world.  Everybody is more concerned about the air they breathe and the water they drink.  There is no reason to believe they will not be just as conscious about the meat they will eat.  I am concerned that there appears to be some sympathy for a point of view that there <Col N="1929" /> is nothing wrong with natural growth promoters.</P>
    <P>My two colleagues who have spoken extremely well came to the central point, which is whether we have the technology to identify drug residues in a carcase.  I do not think so.  Many years ago the creamery industry used milk that was contaminated with antibiotics, penicillin and intra-mammary injection residues. Then a system of inspection was adopted so that the milk could be analysed.  Before we knew where we were the processors were saying that the farmers were giving them substandard milk and the milk was sent back to the producer.  The same thing happened in regard to brucellosis.  A milk ring test was introduced and farmers could be notified a few weeks later if there was something wrong with their herd and it would be tested.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in 1986-87 I asked the veterinary inspector if he had the technology to detect in a carcase the fact that angel dust had been fed to an animal at any time during its life.  I was told that the technology to do this did not exist at that time but that it was being perfected.  I suggest that that technology is not there now.  If an animal gets a does of angel dust a week or two or even three weeks before it is presented for slaughter there is no problem in detecting it in the system then.  What I want to know is if it could be detected if the animal had been dosed six months or ten or 12 months previously.  I suggest that the technology to do that is not available yet because if it was we would know that a carcase was contaminated.  We might not know who fed the angel dust to the animal but we would certainly know who got the money for the animal.</P>
    <P>That is entirely different from the checks and balances included in this Bill. They are good and I will go along with them as an effort to cut out the middlemen. I have a horror of the intervention of the subversives.  Angel dust is available not only in dust form but in liquid and tablet form.  There is no place for anybody who injects or contaminates animals <Col N="1930" /> with this kind of terrible substance except behind bars.  I am long enough in the tooth, and so is the Minister, to know that if there is money to be made unscrupulous people will get involved. The only thing that will stop them is the knowledge that if their animal is caught with the illegal substance they are very likely to be taken to court and put behind bars.</P>
    <P>It is my view that nine out of ten of the small percentage of people involved in this illegal practice genuinely believe that they cannot be caught.  If they thought they could be caught they would not be involved.  The stakes are high and that is why they are involved.  Everyone would agree with giving the Garda greater powers of access to farms and with trebling or quadrupling the fines.  I will accept that, because my opposition to the trade in angel dust is unqualified. However, if it is not possible to identify residues in the carcase this Bill will fail.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this Bill that I would like to address but what I have just said is the central one.  If we cannot get over the problem of technology we will be back here in a few years looking for new powers for the Garda.</P>
    <P>My final point, which I must make quickly lest the Chair rules me out of order, is to ask the Minister of State to give more assistance to farmers in filling in the area aid application forms between now and 14 May.  There is murder in the country and there will be huge problems. Let me leave the Minister with that pleasant thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my colleague got in that parting shot.  He will get a lot of support from everybody here.  Some of us do not have the time to do a degree in agricultural science in order to fill in forms.  I welcome this Bill.  I appreciate the opportunity Members of the House have to express their abhorrence at the misuse of animal remedies, mainly angel dust, by some farmers for their own short term financial gain.  This is to the detriment of the long-term potential of farming, both here and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland are very proud of our <Col N="1931" /> image of green fields, fresh air, clear lakes and streams, and we have used those images to pomote Irish produce as being of very high quality, wholesome and naturally produced.  Why spoil that image?  Given our peripheral location in Europe and the formidable task that is facing the food industry post-CAP reform and GATT, we must target the quality segment of the world market.  To this end assurance of quality of a product from farm to retail outlet is a key factor.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues opposite about the soft touch of intervention.  This is going to be removed and we will have to wake up and fight against some of the big world names, particularly the New Zealanders, and do our best to promote our own produce and corner that market niche.  I hope this Bill will help that aim.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the consumers dictate to the market and they want hormone-free produce.  I wish producers would listen to them.  The beef industry has had adverse publicity in this country and in Europe in recent times.  If we can guarantee the exclusion of prohibited substances, as CBF are trying to do at the moment in the beef quality assurance scheme, it will go a long way towards allaying consumer concerns.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me and of people in this House to give the impression that the majority of farmers condone the use of illegal substances.  This would be an unfair assumption, I know the majority of farmers are concerned about the quality of their produce and that they work within the law but we cannot allow a minority of people to ruin the reputation of the livestock and meat industry.  I know there is a train of thought in some farming circles that natural hormones should be reintroduced and legalised which would, perhaps, reverse the trend of the black market sourcing of growth promoters.  This is a nonsensical argument. It has been expressed to me on occasions in County Donegal because some farmers feel that people abroad get away with using growth promoters.</P>
    <P>I listened with concern to what my colleagues said in relation to the fact that <Col N="1932" /> within European countries, even though it is known that growth promoters have been used, it is very difficult to do anything about it.  Some Irish farmers feel it is difficult to compete with that unfair competition abroad.  However, we should not take that reason into account. As a result of the changes in relation to carcase weights, tighter controls in relation to the movement of cattle and the proposed cattle register, responsibility will revert to the source of the meat.</P>
    <P>In his speech on Tuesday the Minister indicated that the European Commission has issued a discussion document on the use of hormones in livestock production. If accepted, as it should be, it will ensure a common approach within the Community in relation to the use of hormones.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one or two sections of the Bill in particular.  The Minister proposes to increase the membership of the consultative committee which will advise and assist him in making regulations under the Bill.  Perhaps he might consider appointing consumer representatives to get an input from all interested parties.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is important and relates to implied conditions in certain contracts of sale.  I realise there are reservations in relation to this but responsibility must revert to the farmer.  I hope this will be a deterrent to the use of illegal substances.</P>
    <P>The Bill also increases substantially the powers of authorised officers.  Deputy Dukes expressed concern regarding the extent of these powers.  Given the serious nature of the problem these powers are necessary and will, in fact, be needed only if there is a serious misdemeanour. Too often we introduce legislation that does not give sufficient powers to deal with dangerous and difficult circumstances. There is then an outcry when action has not been taken by the relevant Department.  As we are dealing with a drugs problem similar to the problem pertaining to illegal cannabis, heroin, etc., I am glad that a tough line will be taken, as provided for in section 11 of the Bill.  This section is similar to the <Col N="1933" /> provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>I have spoken almost exclusively of the use of illegal substances by farmers and producer responsibility but resources will also have to be put into preventing the manufacture and sale of such substances. In particular, there should be closer co-operation with our neighbouring authorities. This is imperative given that subversives and drug barons are responsible for supplying drugs, especially angel dust.  As a representative of a Border county I hope there will be close co-operation between the Northern Ireland and Irish authorities in this regard.  Close co-operation between the farmer, the factory and the Department inspector will also help in breaking the drug rings and, I hope, halt the availability of illegal substances.  The increased penalties under section 24 of the Bill and the threat of disqualification from farming, cattle dealing etc., will be an expensive lesson for those found using illegal substances. Regardless of size, farmers would not like to receive a fine of £25,000 or a threat by the courts to remove their livelihood. This section is a strong signal to the farmer and to the courts in particular that we take this problem seriously.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive legislation is needed to consolidate former legislation and regulations and to give the necessary powers to deal with a self-defeatist exercise by some farmers.  We depend on our food industry for jobs and for the safety of the consumer and I hope the introduction of this Bill will help to stamp out illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I know there is tremendous support for this Bill within the House, many farming and consumer organisations also support it.  I hope, given adequate resources and the proposed extensive powers to authorised persons that we will clamp down on the use of such illegal substances and their availability.  It is a difficult task but not an insurmountable one.  If we are to grow and develop as an agricultural country and compete with world producers we must guarantee quality; it is only by working together that we can achieve that aim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> I commend this Bill to the House and hope that the livestock and meat industry will once again flourish.  The consumption of meat has reduced in some parts of the world but I hope that with the promotion of a quality product we will increase consumption of meat.  I listened attentively to Deputy Molloy when he said that farmers were almost doing themselves an injustice by making the consumer a vegetarian.  I do not want to see that.  I hope that meat consumption will increase and that the promotion of our quality product will be intensified given the stiff competition from other world producers.  I want farms large, medium or small, to flourish.  Like my colleagues I am aware of the problems of small farmers and it is unfair that they have to compete with unscrupulous farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will use the powers in this Bill to ensure that illegal activity is stamped out and that we will have a natural product.  We should promote our green image to bring prosperity to the meat industry, the beef sector in particular, given the various scandals that have been associated with it, perhaps unfairly on many occasions over the past number of years.  I hope that another Bill will not have to be introduced in this House and that the scandals associated with the industry, the backbone of our economy, will be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill to fruition.  As I have only spoken on agriculture matters at Question Time and on the Adjournment, I take this opportunity to wish the Minister well in his portfolio.  I know he has farmers' interests at heart and that he will not be able to make very many changes because he will have to deal with a very strong farming lobby within the House, but I wish him every success.  I hope this Bill will help the promotion of agriculture and the re-creation of jobs within the sector.</P>

      <P>Cuireann an Comhaontas Glas, the Green Party, fáilte mhór roimh an Bhille seo, Bille um Leigheasanna <Col N="1935" /> Ainmhithe, 1993, agus, is cinnte, tá anjab le déanamh ag feirmeoirí an lá atá inniu ann.  Aithním é sin agus aithníonn an Comhaontas Glas é sin, agus tá anmheas agam ar a bhfuil á dhéanamh ag feirmeoirí.  Cé nach feirmeoir mé féin tá gaolta agam atá ag dul don fheirmeoireacht i gContae na Mí agus i gContae Longfoirt.  Tá cur amach áirithe agam ar chúrsaí feirmeoireachta dá bharr sin agus de bharr na suime ginearálta atá agam san fheirmeoireacht.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very welcome as it contains necessary measures.  The Title of the Bill refers to animal remedies, presumably it relates to non-domestic animals even though the thrust of the Bill relates to humans not only in regard to health factors but also in regard to profit and economics.  Perhaps a Bill for animal and economic remedies might be a more apt title in some respects.  As Deputies are aware, the background to the Bill has been greatly publicised and it relates largely to the beef industry and what is euphemistically called the use, or misuse, of angel dust.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the effects of that substance on humans.  In medicine there are a great deal of general remedies. They include what are known as beta-blockers or propandadol, which I understand is used by 1 to 2 per cent of the population, which is a large percentage from the medical point of view.  The use of such substances would be very important in the treatment of asthma and blood pressure.  The misuse of such a very dangerous substance as clenbuterol or angel dust acts against medical prescriptions and for that reason it is extremely dangerous.  It has the effect of being a beta-agonist and results in, for example, increased agitation for people with asthma.  It is also dangerous to women and unborn babies when taken during pregnancy.  It has a severe and dangerous health implication which is being addressed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of the misuse of that substance extend beyond the health area. The health of the beef industry is also at stake.  There has been adverse publicity <Col N="1936" /> in that regard, some of it was warranted, but it has had the unwelcome effect of tarring with the same brush, many people who have nothing to hide.  Profiteering by subversive organisations is completely unacceptable and must be addressed in relation to this Bill.  Apart from the health effect there are many other effects which come within the remit of this Bill. This legislation which prohibits the use of angel dust is welcome.</P>
    <P>I would question whether the title accurately reflects the intent of the Bill. The use of the word &ldquo;remedy&rdquo; suggests something that would make people better.  I would question whether some of the substances covered can be properly considered to be remedies, for example, bovine somatotropin, a substance for increasing milk production.  It may be a remedy for increasing milk yields but it is not a remedy for animals.  I would question also whether a substance such as nuvan, used in fish farming, can be considered a remedy.  It has a devastating effect on the eco-systems, particularly in some areas along the west coast.  In the short term, that substance is intended to kill off lice on fish but it does much more damage.  There are other substances which do not relate directly to farming covered in this Bill.  I would like to know if the unlicensed substances used for putting down animals, for example, dogs, are covered under this Bill.  I would question whether they could be called remedies. I would welcome the Minister's reply in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>The Government policy underlying this Bill is interesting.  It has not been stated clearly but one can be read between the lines that the use of substances is often necessary, but we must control their use and ensure they are not misused.  If the Government policy was adapted along more Green Party lines there would be less use for such <i>alter ego</i> substances and perhaps that would be beneficial both economically and in health terms.  I recall that concern over the misuse of substances, not only angel dust but other substances, for example, chemicals used in animals, was often dismissed as hysteria.  I am pleased that we <Col N="1937" /> are facing up to the reality that there is misuse and it must be tackled by legislation. I welcome that change.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the Department take account of the alternatives to the use of such a large range of chemicals.  For example, the use of such chemicals could be minimised and a more natural means of rearing animals could be adopted which would be cost effective and would not cause the stress which intensive agriculture often promotes to counteract the use of chemicals. It is also necessary to ensure that we supply high quality products on the international market and reduce the use of chemicals, or rule them out where possible. Even if we do not produce the same quantity but produce good quality we should not need to rely on intervention which has involved a huge cost to the EC in general and to Ireland also.  The health benefits that would result must be measured also.  They would not relate to the Minister's Department, they would relate more specifically to the Department of Health, but we should approach this matter in a holistic way.  Savings in terms of health by a reduction in the use of chemicals, in farming or in general, would be offset by savings in the cost of dealing with sickness and disease.  A recent study carried out in America dealt with drug induced sicknesses and the medical profession there now acknowledge that some prescribed drugs, instead of curing a disease, cause other problems. We should be conscious of the cost involved and realise that it is not helpful economically, ecologically or healthwise. A reduction in the use of chemicals would also be more humane to the animals involved and that aspect of the problem should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Bill does not indicate a trend from a dependence on conventional drugs.  The Bill refers to control and regulation, but that is merely fire brigade action.  I would like to see more positive action in favour of homoeopathic remedies which do not involve the use of conventional drugs.  It should be acknowledged that the rearing of animals can have a bearing on the use <Col N="1938" /> of chemicals in agriculture.  The promotion of extensive, rather than intensive, agriculture would improve our international as well as our domestic trade.  Intensive agriculture gives rise to animal sickness and hence more drug use. I ask the Minister to make some reference to agricultural methods in the Bill although they are not directly related to it.  It should at least be acknowledged that more extensive agricultural methods would reduce our overall dependence on chemicals in animal farming.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee but I would appreciate more detail in regard to representation on it.  For example, consumer organisations should be represented so that the committee would have the benefit of a wide range of opinions which would be helpful to all concerned.  Farming organisations, animal welfare groups and the people producing the substances should also be represented.  There might be a temptation to include only representatives from the chemical industry as they would have a keen interest in being represented on such a committee. That is understandable, but in an overall context we should ensure that there is widespread representation on such a committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill evokes a sense of the past because it does not deal with genetic engineering which will probably become more and more an issue in the future as the use of chemicals in agriculture becomes a thing of the past.  In future the breeding of animals and crops will be based on genetic engineering and this area should be dealt with in legislation so that certain standards and conditions can be put in place.  Progress in that area &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;progress&rdquo; with some hesitation &mdash; will include increased milk production which is guaranteed under genetic engineering.  Tillage farming and aspects of agriculture dealing with animals will also be dictated by the boundaries of genetic engineering.  Control in regard to genetic engineering appears to be covered in EC regulations and lack of independence from a national point of view is evident.  Such control could be <Col N="1939" /> covered under the provisions of this Bill. The Dáil should have control in that area and the veterinary profession would like more involvement from an Irish point of view.  It should be noted that genetic engineering often leads to widespread vivisection and animal experimentation. The method of production, as well as its effects on humans and animals, must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The increased Garda powers provided for in the Bill are part of an overall scheme to deal with abuse of chemicals. Are those powers equal to those which the gardaí exercise in searching for armaments? The Animal Remedies Bill, to an extent, also relates to subversive activities. Searching for armaments and angel dust is similar in that the people who abuse those substances and their effect on human and animal health relate to profiteering and subversive activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister should state the amount of funding which will be provided for implementing and monitoring the provisions of the Bill.  By monitoring its provisions we will be aware of our success in solving the problem.  Will an annual report in the form of an ongoing assessment of the success of this Bill, be published? Those are my main concerns from a Green Party point of view.  I would welcome a reduction in the use of conventional drugs and a reduction in intensified agriculture, as that is intrinsically related to the use of chemicals in agriculture in general.  Representation on the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee should be wide-ranging and there should be safeguards regarding the use of genetic engineering in agriculture.  Will the Minister also refer to the Garda powers, the funding and monitoring of the provisions of the Bill and the publication of an annual report?  I welcome the Bill, but would like more detail in regard to those areas so that the Bill would be holistic in its approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will refer to the interesting and important point made by Deputy Sargent relating to the relevance of genetic engineering in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> Some aspects of genetic engineering, its use in animal production and so on are covered in the definition of &ldquo;animal remedy&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill which may deal with some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Sargent.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the introduction of this legislation is the use of angel dust as a means of enhancing the value of an animal by between £100 and £150.  The Bill is welcome inasmuch as it will help to reduce the abuse of this drug in animal production.  The term &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; is something of a misnomer.  It is a term that was used to describe a specific hallucinogenic drug used in human medicine during the fifties.  The use of this drug as an anaesthetic was discontinued because of its undesirable side effects.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; in the context of the Bill refers to a group of drugs known as beta-agonists.  In simple terms, these drugs have the capacity to alter the composition of the carcase of an animal by directing the food towards the production of muscle and away from the production of fat.  This improves the grading of the animal and adds to its value by approximately £100-£150.</P>
    <P>The main beta-agonist used in this country is clenbuterol, whose effects are similar to those of adrenalin.  There are between ten and 30 beta-agonists available on the market.  A number of these are being tested extensively in laboratories throughout the world.  Some of the major drug companies still hope it will be possible to have these beta-agonists legalised in some countries and put into the markets there.  While the use of these drugs in animal production as repartitioning agents is legal in some countries, it has been made illegal in other countries where it was legal heretofore.</P>
    <P>The value of these drugs in enhancing animal production only became apparent during the eighties.  As I understand it, the first report on the value of these drugs as repartitioning agents for use in animal production was published by the American drug company Cyanamid in 1983. These drugs, which have been around for a long time, have been widely used in human medicine for the treatment of <Col N="1941" /> many disorders.  They were developed for use in human medicine and it was only later that someone in the pharmaceutical industry realised that they could be used with great profit in animal production by changing the composition of the carcase of beef animals.  The main driving force behind the use of these drugs in animal production is that they increase the value of the animals by changing the composition of the carcase.  It is only in recent times that the Europeans realised that they were being used in animal production. In an effort to curb the use of these drugs it has been proposed that there should be a limit of 340 kilograms on the carcase weight of an animal.  This is one way of getting on top of the enormous problems caused by these drugs.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers said, many farmers have died while using this drug, which is particularly dangerous for people who suffer from heart and respiratory disorders. The people who died inhaled the dust into their lungs while dusting it onto animals feeds.  The people who manufacture this drug have got around this problem by producing it in liquid form. This has the advantage of being less likely to poison the person who uses it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there can be any doubt about the widespread misuse of these drugs in this country.  Anyone who analyses the data on the composition of carcases produced in this country will see clearly the sharp and distinct change in animal production after this drug became available.  It has been said in the past by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that the sharp changes in Irish beef production may have been due to new animal breeding methods.  Anyone who knows anything about animal breeding knows full well that such sharp changes in animal composition cannot be brought about in such a short period of time.  If the Minister consulted the technical people in his Department he would be put right on this immediately.  I have no doubt that the significant change in the composition of the carcases of Irish beef is related to a large extent to the <Col N="1942" /> abuse of this drug.  There is no other plausible explanation for this change.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer further to the extent to which this drug has been abused.  In 1981 the then Minister for Agriculture, Michael O'Kennedy, saw fit to summon factory executives to a private meeting in his office to warn them that his Department had information which showed some people in the beef industry were encouraging farmers to dust animals, which is the term used in the trade to describe the abuse of this drug.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it recognises the extent of this problem.  It marks a welcome change from the attitude adopted by the then Minister in January 1991 when he said that he had all the powers necessary to deal with this problem.  I am glad the Minister recognises the major threat this drug poses to the beef industry and agriculture generally.</P>
    <P>The manner in which angel dust has been abused illustrates a very Irish phenomenon.  The use of angel dust has been condemned in the strongest possible terms by the Minister for Agriculure, Food and Forestry, farming leaders of all persuasions, departmental officials, agricultural scientists, veterinary experts and consumer representatives.  Everyone who has spoken on this topic in public has condemned the use of this drug in the most vigorous manner possible.  In spite of these warnings, this drug is still widely used.  This tells us much about the Irish character and the significance attached to the quality of food produced in Ireland. I have also condemned the use of this material.  I had my eyes opened when I met the parish priest in a certain area who told me that some of the people in his parish had heard me on the radio the day before and that I would be well advised to mind my own business instead of condemning the use of angel dust.  He was very much in touch with his flock.</P>

      <P>No, but many of his parishioners were.  Many Deputies who have contributed to the debate have referred to the value of Irish products <Col N="1943" /> and the perception of the quality of Irish products in Europe.  I suppose some people still have the perception that our products are produced in a healthy, wholesome, green environment. However, at the rate we are going and having regard to the commitment which seems to exist to destroy that image, we will soon get the message across to people in Europe as to what has actually been happening in this country.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes as far as a Bill of this type can.  We would be naive if we thought we could eliminate the abuse of these drugs through the introduction of legislation. The simple reality is that the forces which fuel the use of these drugs are much stronger than the capacity of any legislation to eliminate their use.  We would be simple minded if we thought that anything we did or said would eliminate the use of these drugs as long as there is the incentive of an additional £100-£150 per animal to encourage people to use these drugs.  The people who use these drugs are foolish and shortsighted.  There are always people who will put short term gains before any long term considerations. We tend to continue that practice <i>ad infinitum.</i> Any of us who has doubts about the difficulties of controlling abuse of drugs need only look to their abuse in human medicines here and the enormous market obtaining for their illicit use in the case of human beings.</P>
      <P>The Minister has his hands full endeavouring to deal with this problem because the small amounts of this drug being used, quantitatively, can wreak enormous changes.  It is relatively easy to import a very small weight of drug, of enormous value presenting enormous challenges to the people endeavouring to police the importation and/or use of such illicit materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are wide-ranging, particularly those allowing an authorised officer to enter premises and so on which are to be welcomed.  These provisions should prove fruitful in curbing the abuse of this product.  Anybody engaged in the beef industry should be able to make a fair guess at whether an <Col N="1944" /> animal has been treated with this drug based solely on the appearance of the animal, bearing in mind that it changes the composition of the body of the animal and the fact that subcutaneous fat is very low in such animals.  This should allow somebody clued into animal production to make an educated guess at whether such animals have been treated with the drug.  Anybody who works in a meat factory should be able to make a fair guess at whether animals have been treated because of the composition of the carcase and the colour of the meat, which tends to be dark and, when cooked, tends to be somewhat bland and tough, the reason being that the meat itself will contain a relatively small amount of fat.  It will clearly be seen that, in many cases, the very appearance of the animals themselves gives the game away.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days there has been much discussion about the implications of the GATT round of negotiations on food standards.  There is an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> and there were others in some of the British newspapers last week, indicating that pressure would be exerted on us by the Americans to lower our standards in relation to residues permissible in foodstuffs. I understand pressure will be exerted again to allow the use of hormones as an aid to animal production.  We should resist any such pressure as vigorously as possible.  The changes that will be brought about as a result of the GATT negotiations will open up enormous opportunities for this country in terms of producing wholesome food required by the European consumer.  But if we continue in the manner we have been doing, we will wreck such opportunity and destroy the good image of our food products. We should endeavour to exploit our good image further.</P>
    <P>There is considerable debate and scientific argument about the value of hormones in beef production but, in a sense that is quite irrelevant to what the consumer wants.  What is relevant is what the consumer wants and the consumer simply does not like the use of such products. Whether they be good or bad, whether <Col N="1945" /> scientists expound their merits or demerits, is beside the point.  The consumer is perfectly entitled to express his or her preference.  It is rather like people having preferences about the colour of their clothing, or their choice of motor car or its colour.  The consumer is perfectly entitled to have those prejudices which some people in the scientific world would argue have no scientific base.  It would be a great pity if we lost sight of that reality.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate a number of Members spoke about the opportunities obtaining in Europe for Irish beef, the need to get our beef onto European markets and so on.  The simple reality is that there are no brands of Irish beef which have any impact on European markets. In many ways, we are putting the cart before the horse in talking about such matters.  We are selling such beef in the form of commodities, we are cutting the carcase down the middle, putting it into vacuum packs and toddling off to supermarkets in Europe to sell it.  If we are to exploit such markets we must produce wholesome Irish brands.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the recent report on food which had absolutely nothing to say about getting down to brass tacks in production and or marketing.  When the provisions of this Bill are enacted, we shall simply not be able to exploit such market opportunities unless we can produce our own brands.  In order to do so, it is absolutely essential beyond any doubt that we consolidate our food industry.  Proposals to deal with that matter are conspicuous by their absence from that recent food report.  Goodbody stockbrokers in their report on the dairying industry, spoke in terms of the need for £2 billionworth food companies to be established and developed.  I am bewildered as to why the people who published that food report within the past few days did not address that fundamental, central question to the development of our food industry, in order to generate the type of brands which European consumers can identify and continue to purchase, knowing they are products produced in a healthy, <Col N="1946" /> wholesome environment free of contaminating chemicals.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill go as far as one could reasonably expect.  I commend the Minister, his Departmental officials and others who prepared it.  There is much more to the development of our food industry and to exploiting the potential of healthy, wholesome Irish beef than is contained in the provisions of this Bill. I hope we shall endeavour to exploit such possibilities in ensuing years.  If we do not, the world will move away from us and we shall continue to lose great opportunities in European markets which would lead to the creation of jobs both in the food industry and farming sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on the serious view he has taken of its provisions.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill outline a comprehensive approach to tackling recent problems experienced in relation to the usage of illegal animal growth promoters in cattle.  There was considerable focus on the use of angel dust.  There are other matters in relation to animal health highlighted by the provisions of this Bill. The gravest damage is being done to our beef industry by the use of illegal substances. Indeed the scandal of angel dust has been nothing short of a national disgrace. Frequently we witnessed the most terrible abuses, when the authorities within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry were almost helpless in preventing such criminal acts.</P>
      <P>The use of illegal growth promoters is bordering on national sabotage.  Our beef industry is being damaged not just here but worldwide.  At a time when the image of our beef industry is already under severe scrutiny and the subject of a continuing tribunal, we must welcome the provisions of this Bill which will do much to restore our tarnished reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> We must examine the reasons people engage in such anti-national activity.  Of course, there are short term financial gains for greedy individuals but the damage they do the nation is enormous, with long term implications.  We are particularly vulnerable, being an island community dependent on exports for our economic survival.  We are also dependent to a large degree on intervention. The challenge facing our beef and food industry must be to increase our marketing effort abroad.  We cannot hope to be successful if our image is constantly damaged by a minority who continue to abuse angel dust.</P>
    <P>The great challenge facing us is eloquently outlined by the fact that the European Community is self-sufficient in beef this year.  There is now too much beef in storage, a problem which must be tackled.  The difficulty was openly acknowledged by the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Rene Steichen, on a visit to the Kinsale Food Forum.  He said that he would hold talks with Irish Ministers and officials in a bid to allay their fears.  I welcome this commitment and commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for adopting an innovative approach towards promoting the finest Irish foods.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the definition in the 1956 Act of the animals to which this new Bill will apply has been broadened and extended to include all mammals, birds, fish, bees and any other animal whose produce is intended for human consumption.  Therefore, this Bill will have a bearing on the future development of our food industry.  The Minister's new plan aims to transform that industry into one of the most modern and vibrant in the world.  I wish him well in this new undertaking but, unless we are serious about stamping out the use of angel dust and other abusive substances, we will start with an inbuilt disadvantage.  We face severe competition in overseas markets and cannot afford to carry any self-imposed disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased fines and <Col N="1948" /> prison terms to be imposed on those found guilty of offences under the Bill. Our resolve to end angel dust abuse must be backed up by the Garda and court action and I welcome the provision in this regard.</P>
    <P>For the past three years the leader of Ireland's family butchers, Mr. Noel O'Connor from Limerick, has waged a one man war against those involved in the abuse of angel dust.  He has stated the case for the beef industry on numerous occasions and was the first to propose a prison term for convicted offenders.  He is convinced that Ireland produces the best beef in the world and I share that conviction.</P>
    <P>We have a green, lush country with pure and natural resources and instead of destroying it through the abuse of some chemicals we need to build on the organic natural advantages our deep seas, rich land, clean water and fresh air provide. We cannot throw away the advantages of these scarce natural resources in a world where we are envied for the quality of our environment.  We should let the world look on with envy and ask ourselves why we continue to shoot ourselves in the foot by abusing animal remedies. Make no mistake, the importance of the food chain is growing and consumers are becoming far more aware and educated about the way our food and food products are manufactured.</P>
    <P>There is a gradual move towards a more healthy lifestyle and a drift from traditional outlooks which has serious implications for those who produce and market food products.  We are all behind the Minister in the moves to develop new international markets for our food products but, for too long, the food industry has been the Cinderella of Irish manufacturing.  This is about to change and I welcome that commitment.  As a farmer who comes from the heart of the Golden Vale I know that the vast majority of people are shocked and horrified by the use of illegal growth promoters in the food chain, their concern is reflected by the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased powers proposed under the Bill for the Garda <Col N="1949" /> and the officers of the Customs and Excise.  These include the powers to stop vehicles and to enter any land, premises or grounds where they suspect illegal activity.  People will also be required to give relevant documentation to investigating officers and officials.  Documents may also be requested if there is reason to believe that such material may be destroyed before a search warrant is obtained.</P>
    <P>There are also new provisions which will allow gardaí to search and to arrest, without warrant, persons suspected of having committed a crime of this nature. While concern might be expressed by or on behalf of those who will see this proposal as too powerful a move, it must be remembered that very often gardaí are frustrated by inadequate legislation. Innocent people have nothing to fear, only criminals and subversives should be worried about the determined drive by the Garda to bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that offences are proposed in relation to corporate bodies. It is about time that such bodies were made fully aware that the law applies to them.  Recent developments indicate that we are at last becoming more aware of the nature of corporate crime.  There is no disguising the fact that the corporate sector is not immune from engaging in questionable activities.  While such activities may not be criminal they are morally questionable at a time when the vast majority of our people are suffering from the dispiriting effects of a prolonged economic downturn.</P>
    <P>In these difficult times there is a temptation to turn to questionable activities and the penalties must be severe, to prevent such developments.  The provision in the Bill under which convicted offenders will be banned from re-entering the food trade is significant and welcome and should bring home the seriousness with which we view the matter.  At stake is not just the reputation of the beef industry but that of the food sector while the green image we currently enjoy would be damaged forever.</P>
    <P>We must view this Bill in a broad context and it will be of help in protecting <Col N="1950" /> our environment.  Recent research shows that we lag behind our European partners in the protection of the environment &mdash; 82 per cent of all Europeans regard the task of protecting the environment as an urgent problem.  Taking into account what I have said, especially the need to safeguard the image of our natural environment and food industry, I welcome the Bill and urge people to have a reasoned, rational and wide-ranging debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clohessy for agreeing to share his time with me. This Bill is welcome and the Minister should be complimented for introducing it.  It is vital that it proves a success.</P>
      <P>Each year we export £1.25 billion worth of beef and cattle.  In the past much of this was sold into intervention.  In 1992, 750,000 tonnes of beef was sold into intervention but by 1997 this figure will be reduced to 350,000 tonnes.  This means that we will have to find a market for an extra 400,000 tonnes of beef by that year. We already have our hands full in maintaining our current markets and it will be quite a problem to find a market for that extra 400,000 tonnes of beef.  We need all the advantages we can get and can do without the disadvantages associated with beef produced with the aid of banned chemicals.</P>
      <P>In the past it was considered acceptable in farming circles and by consumers to use certain chemicals in producing beef provided a period of between 60 to 70 days elapsed between the last dose and the date the animals were presented for slaughter.  It does not matter one iota whether the chemicals are harmful to humans because if consumers are of the opinion that such chemicals are injurious to health they will not buy any meat which has been produced with the aid of banned chemicals.  Lest anyone is in any doubt, three years ago we were exporting in the region of 120,000 cattle to Libya but we lost that market because it was their perception that some of our cattle were suffering from BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known colloquially as &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of that disease was minimal, <Col N="1951" /> in the region of 20 animals were found with it and each one could be traced to having been imported or to having been fed with imported meal which contained sheep by-products. Because our customers thought our animals had this disease they no longer bought our product.  If we continue to use banned chemicals, as sure as night follows day the same thing will happen to our beef trade to the European Community. There would be no uphill battle to find markets because there would be nobody to battle with.  Consumers would not buy our products and the bottom would fall out completely from our export cattle and beef trade.  In the midfifties &mdash; perhaps those who are old enough will remember &mdash; we had a very good lamb trade to the French market. Things were going very well but certain &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; people exported mountain ewes instead of lamb to the market. It did not take the French housewife very long to realise the difference between a chop from a Wicklow mountain ewe and a chop from a succulent well fed Roscommon lamb.  We lost the lamb trade to Paris and for almost 14 years.  We did not penetrate the French market for a 14-year period, during which every Irish sheep farmer paid very dearly for the sins of the few.  The same will happen again if we do not stop the use of the banned chemicals by a few unscrupulous people.</P>
    <P>If this is the case why do farmers continue to use those banned chemicals?  It is for financial reasons.  Farm income goes up and down and farmers will tell you that it is more down than up.  Each animal treated with clenbuterol or angel dust is worth in the region of £100 to £150 extra at the factory.  Stories are doing the rounds that factory managers and directors are advising farmers to use angel dust.  That does not make sense, but rumours are circulating that factory managers are not only advising farmers to use angel dust but telling them where they can get these banned substances.  We have a big fight on our hands if we are to overcome this.</P>
    <P>I believe the IFA, the ICMSA and <Col N="1952" /> the United Farmers Association could do more to educate farmers, who must be educated not only on the damage they are doing to their trade and the country but also the fines they are liable to pay if they are caught.  The fines are in place and people have come a cropper in the recent past.  In some cases they suffered the forfeiture of their animals, which are worth in the region of £1,000 each.  If farmers are advised on the possibility of being caught, and I imagine that after the enactment of this Bill the possibilities of being caught will be greater than heretofore, it would be extremely foolhardy of them to use those substances.</P>
    <P>I discussed this topic with a very highly qualified person in the scientific field.  I explained to him how I was told in the region of 50 per cent of farmers were using angel dust.  He replied that this was not correct.  He told me that it might be a different thing if I said that 50 per cent of the animals slaughtered had been treated with angel dust.  There is a subtle difference.  That leads one to believe that farmers with bigger feed lots are responsible for this.  If we do not tackle the problem and find a solution to it, our beef exports and our economy will be in dire trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any tests that may be carried out to identify animals that have been treated with those chemicals.  I understand that people who are used to handling cattle can make a good guess but it is a different matter to stand up in court and state this for definite.  As we do not have such tests at present, further research must be done in identifying carcases that have been treated with these banned substances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred earlier to the quality of Irish beef, but he said there was no point in having a high quality product unless it could be identified as a product of Irish origin.  That stands to reason.  I hope Deputy Upton, who now moves in Government circles, can bring his thinking to bear on the Minister, who no doubt will go along with it.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee will comprise of seven people while in the past there were <Col N="1953" /> five.  The powers that be think that seven will be more representative and I go along with that.  One member will be appointed by the Minister for Health and the other six will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. They will have special interests in the manufacture, distribution, sale or use of animal remedies.  However, there is no mention of a representative of the people who really matter &mdash; the consumers.  I believe there should be a consumer representative. Needless to say manufacturers of the chemicals will be boosting their own product and it is fair to say, without being too critical of them, that they may be slightly blinded in one direction. I believe there should be a representative of the consumers on that body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.  As I represent an urban constituency I will bring into focus in a clear and practical way the concerns of the consumer in this regard.  I do not think it can be stated often enough how important the meat industry is to the wellbeing of this country.  Many contributors have referred to various aspects of the industry and how it has helped our economy to develop and expand and how this industry in times past has been instrumental in creating a very fine image of our food produce in foreign markets.  I compliment the Minister for bringing this legislation forward at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times there was a number of highly publicised seizures of illegal growth promoters and pressure was put on the Minister to respond quickly with legislation.  However, I am glad the Minister took his time in bringing together all the important issues that needed to be addressed in legislation rather than taking the more populist approach of rushing through legislation which might contain defects.  I compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing forward comprehensive legislation which will make a significant contribution <Col N="1954" /> towards dealing with this serious problem in the meat industry.</P>
    <P>Other countries frequently refer to their richness in natural resources, particularly mineral wealth.  We are entitled to refer to our richness in food production resources.  As other speakers indicated, we need to be more aggressive in this regard and to put the Irish name on products as we try to find new markets abroad. We should ensure that these products are of the highest standard, that is what this legislation seeks to address.</P>
    <P>I will draw to the attention of the House two incidents that had a very serious effect on food and associated food products.  Some years ago a certain imported tinned salmon product became contaminated.  Consumers were extremely concerned about this matter and overnight its position on the Irish market was destroyed &mdash; I am sure the same happened in other markets abroad. I do not believe that product has ever recovered from such a major setback.</P>
    <P>The same applied to a table water from France.  The consumer, backed up by investigations into the product, became alarmed at what appeared to be a contaminated product and again the market here for that product was obliterated.  At that time similar native products were coming on the market.  The Irish producer has held that market since and is also developing export markets.  These are practical examples of how the consumer, concerned at what it sees as a contaminated food product, reacts &mdash; by simply not buying the product.  That is precisely what will happen in the meat industry if we do not come to grips with the illegal use of growth promoters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton made the point that in his role as a public representative he met a priest who, when this matter was raised with him, told him to mind his own business. Another Deputy asked whether that priest was in the farming industry. If that individual or his parishoners are involved in the cattle industry and continue to use illegal growth promoters neither they nor their families will be in the industry for very long.  Those who manufacture, sell and use illegal growth <Col N="1955" /> promoters are &mdash; I do not say this lightly &mdash; terrorists of the worst kind.  They know where use of this product will lead, it will damage a most important sector of the economy and destroy the livelihoods of countless families.</P>
    <P>Severe penalties must be imposed on those convicted for engaging in this activity.  The Bill provides for fairly stiff penalties but I ask the Minister to consider in the future, perhaps on Committee Stage, the seizure of assets of those engaged in this illegal activity.  I know there are constitutional difficulties but these matters need to be addressed. Those who engage in this activity should know that their illgotten financial gains will be taken away by the State, that the State will not simply impose a fine or a term of imprisonment.  Any individual, manufacturing organisation, distributing group or individual, should suffer the gravest consequences, losing everything they own through the seizure of assets.</P>
    <P>In the illicit drug trade, for example, it is generally accepted by experts in the area that the total number of seizures in any one year probably represents about 10 per cent of availability of the illegal drug.  If the same criterion was applied to illegal growth promoters one would see there is a great amount of this illegal substance in the country.  A number of Deputies brought to the attention of the House information, personal experience and local knowledge of this matter, which proves that we are faced with a grave problem in regard to the use of this product.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the continued expansion of the agricultural sector is of vital national importance.  The meat industry is one of the most important in that sector.  In the past year one of the most talked about events in that industry was the Beef Tribunal.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be happy to hear I will not go into that debate for a variety of reasons, one of which would be brought to my attention, but the reality is that the consumer knows that this industry is in serious trouble.  The issue being addressed in this legislation is one more pointer <Col N="1956" /> to the consumer who will decide whether to eat meat and meat products.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are reports of the seizure of illegal growth promoters.  I am not an expert on the distribution of this product but I am told that in some cases it is sold from the backs of vans in public places such as those close to cattle marts.  If that is denied I will accept it.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address this problem in its widest sense.  If it succeeds it will make a major contribution towards reestablishing and enhancing our reputation as a clean producer of stable food and obviously will make its own contribution to the development of this industry, which must be above suspicion when it comes to producing hormone free and antibiotic free meat and meat products.</P>
    <P>The consumer will play a significant role in the fight against the use of these substances.  The Minister can introduce comprehensive legislation, ensure that it is effectively implemented and that he has the support of the statutory agencies, particularly the Garda, agricultural organisations and farm representative organisations but in the end, to be successful, he will need the support of the consumer.  If consumers make it clear that they are becoming increasingly concerned about the reputation of this industry, producers will have to take note if they want to survive and prosper.  The effectiveness of the legislation will depend on the Minister's ability to monitor the industry and to provide the necessary resources to make sure that the legislation is effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in line with the EC Commission approach to food law.  The legislation covers food labelling, flavours, additives, solvents and food nutritional use.  Section 4 of this Bill requires that animal remedy containers should display the composition of the  and should also appear in any advertisements for the remedy.  For too long this was not done and the consumer suffered.  Section 5 covers labelling, and false expectations are not conveyed.  I am glad about this.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession have a major role to play in the implementation of this <Col N="1957" /> Bill.  They are at the coal face in the production line.  They are the profession who oversee the industry from the farm to the retail outlet.  In this respect they are to some extent the guardians of the industry.  The appointment of veterinary officers as authorised officers is essential. Will the Minister give careful consideration to this suggestion?</P>
    <P>With regard to tests and analyses, it is essential to use a quick, reliable test. There is no point in discovering that a sample has proved positive a week after the meat has been distributed and sold. How will the Minister deal with this important aspect of the Bill?</P>
    <P>How does the Minister expect to differentiate between natural and synthetic hormones under this Bill?  I understand that they are both practically indistinguishable from the chemical point of view.  It appears that the Minister is proposing the use of a different test in the event of a court challenge.  I hope that when the various organisations involved are successful in bringing suspects before the courts, the case will not be thrown out because of a technical defect in producing the evidence, which would be very embarrassing.  I know the Minister has the capacity and tenacity to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>The powers granted to authorised officers might seem to be unconstitutional at first glance in that a search warrant might not be necessary.  The reason for this provision is that the relevant material can be destroyed quite easily.  If the Garda or other officers of the State wish to act, they must act quickly.  The community will be prepared to accept the necessity for swift action and, therefore, will be prepared to go along with what appear to be fairly draconian powers.</P>
    <P>Section 14 authorises the Garda to arrest, without warrant, persons suspected of having committed an offence. This too is a fairly draconian measure. We depend on the community to go along with it and not to criticise it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be applauded.  Its contents are wide-ranging and comprehensive. Evidently the Minister and <Col N="1958" /> his officials put a great deal of time into drawing up this Bill which will have a major impact on the meat industry.  It will enable us to clean up the meat industry and retain the sort of industry of which we can be proud.  I wish the Minister well and I call on other elements, in attempting to tackle this serious problem, to cooperate with the Minister, the Department and the Garda on this legislation. If we work together this problem can be successfully tackled.</P>

      <P>The Bill aims to put an end to the abuse of angel dust, clenbuterol, jungle juice and other so-called cocktails which are very efficient in some cases in converting the muscle formation of animals and in others, in helping to remove the extra fat from animals in a very short period.</P>
      <P>Hormones first became available here in the mid-seventies when we began to copy our compatriots in Europe who used them long before we entered the EC.  At that stage we saw the unscrupulous side of this industry.  Some people did not observe the regulations with regard to synthetic hormones and did not allow for the 60 day period between implants being put in place and the slaughter of animals. In some cases people decided, mid-way through the term, to double the dose. These things were commonly accepted. The net result was that people lost all sense of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those involved in the use of this substance felt they were quite justified in using it and that all that mattered was the end product.  They forgot that this product had to face the consumer, who could well be affected by the consequences of their actions.  At that stage the departmental tests were minimal.  In some cases it is well known that the Department and some of their research institutes were involved in carrying out trials regarding the use and misuse of <Col N="1959" /> some of the drugs.  The records will show that this was the position.</P>
    <P>We progressed to the drugs of the eighties, namely, angel dust, the jungle juices and the other cocktails.  These are the most lethal substances that can be administered by any farmer to livestock.  Not only are they a danger to the health of consumers at a later stage but they are also a major source of danger to the people who administer them.  None of us wants to identify persons but we all know people who died as a result of the use of angel dust without realising the consequences. We all sympathise with the families of those who suffered as a result of the use of it.  What toll would it take on people who regularly consume meat that has been treated with this type of product?</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the problems which were created for this country when the BSE scare took place and we saw the effect it had on our meat production.  It took a long time to gain access to the markets we lost and we have regained access to them only in the past six months.  If we were found to have further irregularities we could lose those markets again.</P>
    <P>Farmers are not totally to blame.  For many years those at the processing end were prepared to pay premiums for very lean and heavy carcases which gave enormous yields when it came to deboning for intervention.  Perhaps because intervention was the final home for some of this beef they felt it was not unscrupulous to have hormones, angel dust and other substances used in the cattle.  That is criminal because this is a consumer product that has to be consumed by somebody at some stage.  The people involved in this trade have a lot to answer for.  The effect it has had on the sales of red meat in this country and throughout Europe is frightening.  I have heard people in restaurants and hotels who were eating fish or vegetable dishes ask on seeing somebody eat red meat whether it was angel dust free.  That is frightening.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Bill but we also have to look at the use of farm drugs, <Col N="1960" /> pesticides and all the other substances used in day to day farming activities. Certain pesticides are semi-banned and there are problems in regard to farm drugs.  I disagree with Deputy Flood when he said that these drugs are sold from the back of vans.  Anybody who is aware of someone involved in such activities has a moral responsibility to make the local veterinary officers aware of it.  Many legitimate van men have been affected because of regulations which have been introduced.  The net result is that farmers who could buy generic products which were not dangerous for every day use are being forced to buy products which are two and three times more expensive.  We must examine the proposed regulations regarding van sales and rather than put the smaller traders out of business the controls should be such that they are answerable at all times for the commodities they carry in their vans and which they hold in their stores 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  If that power were given to veterinary inspectors it would be sufficient to ensure that nobody took the risk of trying to deal in any of these banned products.  I appeal to the Minister to consider carefully the regulations being made in regard to farm drugs and to ensure that those people who derive a livelihood from selling harmless drugs will not be gravely affected.</P>
    <P>While we speak about angel dust and other products we should also look outside this country at other producers in the world market.  In recent times it has been made clear that some non-EC countries are still allowing open use of some of the drugs and hormone products which have been banned.  This is frightening when one considers that in some cases the EC is importing meat from some of those countries using hormones.  That is a matter that should be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>It is reputed that the use of hormones is prevalent in South America, in the large American feed lots and in some of the Eastern countries.  When we see this we have a duty to look at our own house and to put it in order.  We are in the market place trying to sell a quality product.  If we cannot guarantee that it is residue free <Col N="1961" /> we cannot guarantee the quality of the product we are trying to sell.  Therefore, we must be ever vigilant in regard to the product we sell.</P>
    <P>People who use illegal growth promoters are deserving of the full rigours of the law.  The law seeks to protect consumers and to protect the quality of our product and the image of Irish meat products in the market place.  Some of our competitors are using every opportunity in the international media to highlight even the smallest case that arises in Ireland with regard to the use of hormones, despite the fact that it may have been two years since the event took place.  We have to deal with these problems on the international front.  In dealing with these situations let us not lose sight of the need to stamp out abuse of these products in Ireland.  The abuses of which we are aware are frightening.  If we allow this to continue we will shortly lose our reputation for producing a superior product.  We will lose our reputation and we will lose our markets and that would be very serious for farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceist Tosaíochta Uimh.  1 agus Ceisteanna Uimh.  8, 19 agus 24 le céile.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993, which I presented to the House on 21 April, 1993, is designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to remove the limit imposed by section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 on the revenue which RTE can earn from advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion.  This Bill can be regarded as the first step in a package of legislative proposals on the reform of the structures of broadcasting in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My primary overall objective is to ensure, as far as possible, that the structures in place allow Irish radio and television programming to be of the highest quality and remain the preferred choice of a majority of Irish viewers and listeners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that I regard local commercial stations as an important part of the mix of broadcasting services available to Irish audiences.  However, I am concerned that listeners to these services should not be regarded as market segments but as citizens with rights within a <Col N="1963" /> communicative order.  In formulating my proposals for the longer term, I will be considering measures to ensure that commercial local radio remains viable and addressing other general broadcasting issues.  The question of appropriate sources of funding for the private broadcasting sector will be addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to competition in the provision of national radio and television services, the statutory framework for the establishment of such services by the Independent Radio and Television Commission already exists.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission have also statutory responsibility for the development of the independent broadcasting sector within the parameters laid down in the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  As part of my review of existing structures, I will of course be looking at the way in which this Act has operated over the past five years or so.  RTE, of course, already operates in the most competitive broadcasting environment in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that my recently announced measures will have a significant impact on existing independent radio stations.  These measures will do no more than restore the advertising environment to that in which operators sought their contracts from the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>I have no statutory responsibility for the newspaper industry.  However, I am convinced that the continuation of the advertising revenue and minutage restrictions contained in the 1990 Act, would have resulted in permanent damage to broadcasters, independent programme makers, advertising agencies, and indigenous companies seeking to advertise their goods and services on a strong domestic television medium.</P>
    <P>I understand from RTE that, since the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, up to the end of 1992, the revenue derived by RTE from advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotions in broadcasts exceeded the limit set in that Act by £17.9 million.  The Deputy is no doubt aware <Col N="1964" /> that the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that £4.5 million of this revenue will be used to commence work on the construction of the transmission infrastructure for Telefís na Gaeilge and that the remainder is to be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister said that the Broadcasting Bill to be introduced next week is but first step.  I am sure the Minister would agree that what we need at present is comprehensive provision for all aspects of the media in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In regard to the development of the independent radio sector, I know the Minister had a meeting recently with representatives of the Association of Independent Radio Stations.  Following that meeting and the information passed to the Minister about their fears for the future of their sector, does the Minister intend to look at the question of transmission costs and maintenance of transmission and at the development of an independent radio news service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for her question.  It is true that I had a meeting recently with the representatives of these independent commercial local stations at which a number of issues were discussed, including the ones the Deputy has mentioned.  That meeting was preceded by a number of other meetings between officials of my Department and representatives of the different stations.  I have also sought to collect as much information as possible on the precise situation in each of the stations.  There is a great difference between stations that are experiencing difficulties and those that are not experiencing difficulties.  There are differences within those who are experiencing difficulties &mdash; there are those who are seeking mergers and those who are avoiding mergers. The items mentioned by the Deputy were indeed raised at the meeting, as were a number of other items raised by me, such as measures which could be examined and which would impact on the future viability.  They did expand beyond <Col N="1965" /> these other items.  It was a very positive meeting and we have agreed to remain in touch to see how we can advance the various proposals put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the Programme for Government the reference to funding that has arisen in this way is in relation to Telefís na Gaeilge.  I have dealt with it in another question and I do not want to stray into the area of the other question.  In this Bill I am removing what I feel is a restriction that was damaging in section 3 of the 1990 Act and I am making provision for the independent film sector.  That Bill will not only make provision for the independent film sector and make requirements of RTE but will also define independent film production.  That is as much as in that legislation.  In regard to the other matters in broadcasting, including the question of viability of local radio with its balance of local commerce and local community, I will be addressing these issues when I bring forward further broadcasting legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 17, 20, 29 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>On 30 March, 1993, I announced my intention to reactivate the Irish Film Board &mdash; Bord Scannán na hÉireann &mdash; and to establish a film production fund to promote the Irish film and audiovisual industry.</P>
      <P>I have decided to appoint Ms. Lelia Doolan as chairperson of the board and I hope to announce the membership of the rest of the board before the end of May.  The funding which will be provided to the Irish Film Board is currently under consideration, but I can assure the Deputy that adequate funding will be provided for the board this year to enable it to impact upon the Irish film and audiovisual industry in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the setting of targets for the promotion of indigenous Irish film will be a matter for the board to decide, but I would expect that such targets will indeed be set.  Similarly, it will be for the board to decide the way in which the funds made available to it will be allocated subject, of course, to the provisions of section 6 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.  Section 6 (1) provides that the <Col N="1970" /> board &ldquo;may invest in, or make a loan or a grant to defray in whole or part the cost of the making of a film wholly or partly made in the State.  Section 6 (2) provides that &ldquo;the making of an investment, loan or grant under this section shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may think proper, including terms and conditions relating to the repayment to the Board of any moneys paid by it and payment of interest on any such money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that there is at present an adequate range of technical facilities available in this country to ensure that the funds which I will put at the disposal of the Irish Film Board can be spent in Ireland.  Since my announcement there have been welcome indications of investment in the industry and we can confidently look forward to the provision of further technical resources. The existence of a strong network of independent film producers and of a major studio facility at Ardmore Studios are just two cases in point.  The whole reasoning behind my decision to develop the industry by means of a two-pronged approach &mdash; namely, the reactivation of the Irish Film Board and my proposals in relation to independent television production contained in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993 &mdash; is precisely to exploit the technical facilities available in Ireland at present and the imaginative and creative skills which exist in that industry which have been underemployed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board and An Chomhairle Ealaíon are separate entities established by statute and there is no formal relationship between the two bodies. However, Deputies should be aware that &ldquo;the cinema&rdquo; was added to the definition of the arts by virtue of the Arts Act, 1973. This has enabled the Arts Council over the years to fund film-related organisations and to provide non-repayable grants to an amount of £100,000 per annum to film makers.  At this stage, there are no proposals to discontinue the role of the Arts Council in this area but it is my intention to ensure that there will be no duplication of functions between the council and the Irish Film Board.  I <Col N="1971" /> see them as being complementary to each other.</P>
    <P>Although no formal relationship exists between the Arts Council and the Film Board, I am glad to say that the council is currently providing the board with the necessary administrative support while start-up arrangements are being put in place.  I express my gratitude to the Arts Council and its director for this facility.</P>
    <P>While the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> committed the Government to the preparation of a White Paper on the film industry, I am of the opinion that the report of the special working group on the film production industry, which was submitted to the Taoiseach last December, takes into account adequately the views of the industry and the key state agencies.  I was very pleased, therefore, to have obtained Government approval to move faster and bypass the preparation of a White Paper and to proceed with the publication of this report.  I expect to be in a position to publish the report of the special work group on the film production industry next month.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the action he has taken since I tabled this question.  In relation to the membership of the board, will the composition of the board reflect all the interests in the film industry, producers, directors and craftspeople?  Will there be a strong emphasis on including people who have a marketing expertise, by which I mean the exhibitors in the business?  Will the Minister agree that there is little point in encouraging the making of good films in Ireland if those films are not marketed vigorously both at home and abroad?  I ask him to take that principle on board in deciding the composition of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act specifies that seven people should be appointed to the board and I have nominated Dr. Lelia Doolan as chairperson.  I am very grateful to Dr. Doolan for responding so quickly and graciously to this challenge.  This leaves six other members to be <Col N="1972" /> appointed.  It is very clear from the Act that the appointment of the board is ultimately my responsibility.  I will appoint the very best people to ensure that the Irish Film Board is the success I am sure it will be.  Therefore, people will be less representative of interest groups.  The members will be appointed on the basis of their experience and the contribution they can make.  The Deputy made a valid point about the need for marketing films to be borne in mind and I am well aware of the need for this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the making of films, before I brought back the board and set about establishing a film industry, a small provision had been made for script writing and tax relief for post-production. The missing part was production, which is in the middle.  In appointing the board, I will bear in mind all the skills and expertise necessary, including the marketing function to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware my Department's responsibilities embrace five major areas &mdash; arts, culture, Gaeltacht-gaeilge, heritage and broadcasting.  In the context of the EC Structural and Cohesion Funding, my Department has recently prepared a comprehensive programme for incorporation in the National Development Plan.  Our proposals are based squarely on the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997,</i> that arts and culture will form part of overall job creation strategy, and on the acknowledgement in the programme that the cost of creating a job in the arts is considerably less than in any other sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>The case which I am making for Structural Fund assistance for my areas of ministerial responsibility, therefore, is that these areas can play a major role in promoting the economic and social development of the State, in creating sustainable employment and significant value-added to the economy, in energising local communities and in raising the morale of our citizens in general, by deepening and enriching the cultural space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí oifigigh mo Roinne i gcomhairle le heagrais éagsúla ar nós na húdaráis áitiúla, Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus na hinstitúidí eile a thagann faoi scáth mo <Col N="1974" /> Roinne nuair a bhí an Clár á réiteach agus is le déanaí a cuireadh ar aghaidh é chuig an Roinn Airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Bhaist mé an teideal &ldquo;Tionscnamh na hOidhreachta/The Heritage Initiative&rdquo; ar an gClár seo agus is é mo thuairim go rachadh sé chun leasa na tíre dá gcuirfí an clár sin ar aghaidh mar chlár chuim-sitheach aontaithe in áit na moltaí a scaipeadh i measc go leor clárache eile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this is probably a unique opportunity to put an infrastructure in place for the development of the arts.  The Minister said that his Department submitted a comprehensive programme covering his areas of responsibility.  What consultation has there been with regional groups in the formulation of this programme?  Will he indicate some of the priority areas he hopes to tackle with the funding which becomes available in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, it would be inappropriate for me to indicate such details at a time when the plan is being debated.  However, I can tell the Deputy that there has been far more consultation in the Department since I took office than previously.  For example, I am aware that the consultation I initiated is in stark contrast to the lack of consultation on the first proposals, which were put forward before I came into office.  As I said &mdash; it is important to give as much information as possible &mdash; there will be comprehensive proposals on my five main areas of responsibility.  The main aim is to create jobs and to secure funds for team areas.  There will be an opportunity, when dealing with the project evaluation, to have further consultations, and I will be delighted to have them.</P>

My question was whether the Government had any plans to commemorate the centenary of Conradh na Gaeilge.  The Government should supplement the programme of Conradh na Gaeilge.  When I had responsibility for the public service I established &ldquo;Lá na Gaeilge&rdquo; for the public service and, perhaps we should have a Seachtain na Gaeilge for the public service, or some such programme to supplement the plans of Conradh na Gaeilge itself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course &mdash; and it arises on other questions &mdash; there is a stated constitutional position for the Irish language.  Over the years there have been many articulations of how this was proposed to be effected in policy statements on the restoration of the Irish language. I want to deal very straightforwardly with the Deputy's question.  It is now clear that the policy of different Departments has been to achieve dhátheangachas, but if one were to do that one would have to improve the position of Irish as it is <Col N="1979" /> spoken.  The grant to Conradh na Gaeilge acknowledged that they would have exceptional expenditure in a year in which they would be celebrating 100 years of existence.  Their contribution was not just to the language but to the sense of féinmheas that the country had. I might add that that expenditure by Conradh na Gaeilge of £75,000 be widely distributed nationwide and elsewhere, indeed, to the Irish community abroad who are interested in celebrating the fact that the language has survived and needs very much more encouragement.</P>
      <P>I take the other point the Deputy made.  It is not my intention to suggest that there is a single hegemonic cultural tradition in this country.  There are not only different cultural traditions but very many different versions of different cultural traditions.  Everything I am doing in the cultural area accepts that, as a road to peace, for example, and very much acknowledges cultural pluralism.  But I have responsibility, and will exercise it, in ensuring that the Irish language, which has been made weak, will be able to be made stronger so that we can achieve that richness of culture.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that my purpose in tabling the question and that of my colleagues raising supplementaries was to heighten the awareness of the centenary of Conradh na Gaeilge and, second, to support in any way the efforts Government may make &mdash; and hopefully the further reference they will make now arising from this question &mdash; to help in recognising the centenary of Conradh na Gaeilge and in the promotion of the Irish language? Finally, would the Minister accept, even for those of us who are not very fluent, that there is a responsibility on us all to try and have the cúpla focal here, perhaps the odd question and so on, and that such lead and example might form part of the Government programme within the context of this centenary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With no disrespect to Deputy O'Keeffe, I may say that, without <Col N="1980" /> the inspiration of his question today, I had written to all Departments suggesting that they needed to make a new and special effort in this year to ensure that people who wanted to use the Irish language in dealing with the agencies of the State, locally and centrally, will have their rights respected.  I have also suggested that new facilities, techniques and approaches would be made available through Bord na Gaeilge to assist them in achieving this purpose.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other question the Deputy raised, it is very important that nobody ever should be dissuaded from using any little amount of Irish they have in this House.  I want to assure Deputies that I will welcome questions in Irish and will entirely welcome the efforts of those who are coming into Irish, as it were, who wish to use the very little Irish they have.  It will be encouraged by me and my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Donegal South West):</i>
        <Col N="1981" /> Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  7 agus 21 agus Ceist Scríofa Uimh.  91 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Is buille tubaisteach é go bhfuil an máthairchomhlacht sna Stáit Aontaithe chun an tionscal &mdash; Telectron na Farraige Móire Teo &mdash; atá á reachtáil acu i monarcha de chuid Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an Eastát Tionscail sna Doirí Beaga a dhúnadh agus go gcaillfidh breis is 60 duine a gcuid poist sa chuideachta sin. Tuigtear gur toisc nach bhfuil éileamh ann ar bhonn leanúnach do na táirgí teil-eachumarsáide a dhéanar sa mhonarcha sna Doirí Beaga atá an cinneadh sin déanta ag an máthairchomhlacht.</P>
      <P>Le tamall maith anuas bhí mise féin go pearsanta agus ardbhainistíocht an Údaráis i gcomhairle go leanúnach leis an máthairchomhlacht féachaint an raibh aon bhealach ann chun na poist atá i gceist a chaomhnú agus tá gach is féidir déanta chun na críche sin.  Mar iarracht dheiridh chuaigh mise i dteannta le Príomhfheidhmeannach agus Leas Phríomhfheidhmeannach (Forbairt) an Údaráis chuig na Stáit Aontaithe le déanaí chun bualadh le hardbhainistíocht an mháthairchomhlachta i dtaobh na ceiste.  Is mian liom a threisiú nach easpa chúnamh Stáit breise a thug ar an máthairchomhlacht an tionscal a dhúnadh.  Chuir an tÚdarás moltaí áirithe lena mbainfeadh cúnamh Stáit breise faoi bhráid an mháthairchomhlachta maidir le féidearthachtaí éagsúla gnó don mhonarcha sna Doirí Beaga ach, d'ainneoin na dtairiscintí sin, chinn an máthairchomhlacht ar éirí as dhéantúsaíocht ar an láthair sin.  Tá an chuideachta sin sásta comhoibriú leis an Údarás, áfach, chun bealaí éagsúla a scrúdú d'fhonn tionscal ionaid a bhunú sna Doirí Beaga in áit Telectron na Farraige Móire Teo.  I dtaca leis sin de tá meitheal oibre le bunú go hantapaidh chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach.  Fiú inné bhí cruinníu agam chun clár oibre na meithle a phlé agus tá i gceist agam go mbeidh sé i mbun oibre gan mhoill.  Tá curtha in iúl ag an máthairchomhlacht go dtabharfaidh siad tacaí-ocht d'obair na meithle oibre agus go gcomhoibreoidh siad léi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anuas ar na poist atá le cailliúint i dTelectron na Farraige Móire Teo agus <Col N="1982" /> an 10 bpost i nGarn Teo in Ard an Rátha atá i mbaol, is buille trom eile é do Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall go bhfuil breis is 30 post le cailliúint i Nuvotem Teo i gCro-ithlí.</P>
    <P>Tar éis dom toiliú tamaillín ó shin le togra ón Údarás chun tuilleadh infheis-tíochta uathu a dhéanamh sa chuideachta sin, tá dóchas agam go mbeifear in ann na deacrachtaí iomaíochta atá ag Nuvotem Teo a shárú agus go gcaomhnófar fuíl-leach na bpost sa chuideachta sin.</P>
    <P>Is cúis imní líon na bpost a chailltear i dtionscail agus, cé go gcaithfear glacadh leis go mbeidh poist á gcailliúint i gcónaí &mdash; go háirithe nuair a bhíonn cúlú eac-namaíochta domhanda ann &mdash; bíonn iar-rachtaí á ndéanamh an t-am ar fad chun na caillteanais sin a laghdú oiread agus is féidir.  Mar shampla tugtar comhairle agus cúnamh do chomhlachtaí chun iad féin a láidriú go háirithe ó thaobh bain-istíochta agus saineolais theicniúil. Freisin bítear ag iarraidh tionscail a spreagadh chun deiseanna forbartha a thapú a chuirfeadh bonn níos láidre futhu nó a chuirfeadh poist bhreise ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tuilleadh fostaíochta a chru-thú i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall agus sa Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne tá gach is féidir á dhéanamh ag an Údarás chun na críche sin.  Anuraidh mar shampla cruthaíodh 975 phost nua i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás ach is é an trua é gur cailleadh 920 post ar chúiseanna éagsúla, rud a d'fhág nach raibh ach glanmhéadú de 55 phost i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis.  Den 975 phost a cruthaíodh, bhain 315 phost díobh le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall agus, den 920 post a cailleadh, bhain 370 post díobh le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall i.e. glanlaghdú de 55 phost.</P>
    <P>Tá comharthaí dóchais ann maidir le fostaíocht a chruthú i mbliana agus amach anseo.  I 1992 cheadaigh an tUd-arás 570 togra don Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne le sprioc fostaíochta de 1,440 post iontu nuair a bheadh na tograí faoi lánseol. Bhain timpeall 200 de na tograí sin le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall le breis agus 500 post iontu ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad ráithe den bhliain reatha <Col N="1983" /> cheadaigh an tÚdarás 150 togra don Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne le sprioc fostaíochta de 340 post iontu nuair a bheadh siad faoi lánseol.  Bhain 53 de na tograí sin le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall le breis is 160 post iontu ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol.  Chomh maith leis sin tá tograí eile ar ceadaíodh cúnamh dóibh i mblianta roimh 1992 a bhfuil fostaíocht á cruthú iontu de réir a chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá fostaíocht shéasúrach/pháirt-aimseartha an-tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht mar cuireann sí le maoin agus ionc-aim áitiúil.  I 1992 mhéadaigh líon na bpost sin faoi scáth an Údaráis sa Ghael tacht de 320 post, i.e., ó 2,260 post i 1991 go dtí 2,580 post i 1992.  Bhain 40 post den 320 post sin le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do Theachtaí is obair fhíordheacair í poist a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht ag cur san áireamh na deacrachtaí móra a bhíonn le sárú ag an Údarás, ar a n-áirítear laigeachtaí bhunstruchtúr na gceantar Gaeltachta, agus iad ag iarraidh tograí fiúntacha a aimsiú le lonnú inti. Táim sásta go bhfuil aghaidh á tabhairt go dícheallach ag an Údarás ar an obair sin.</P>

An aontódh an tAire Stáit chomh maith nach inniu nó inné a chinntigh an comhlacht atá i gceist tarraingt amach as Tír Chonaill, ach roinnt blianta ó shin nuair a bhí 220 ag obair ann sa mhonarcha agus 63 anois; tá an cinneadh déanta le tamall fada.  Agus an cheist deireanach: an bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá, cén uair a bheidh an meitheal oibre i mbun oibre ar thionscail úra don mhonarcha seo.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Glacaim leis na fíricí go raibh 220 nó níos mó ag obair ansin i rith na n-ochtóidí agus nach bhfuil ach 60 ansin <Col N="1984" /> anois.  Ach, ar ndóigh, thug mé féin cuairt ar an Bhreatain anuraidh ar 10 Márta 1992, i gcomhar le príomhfheidhmeannach Údarás na Gaeltachta nuair a chonacthas dúinn go raibh an cinneadh á ghlacadh agus chuireamar ina luí ar an bhainistíocht sa Bhreatain cé chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí sé na jabanna seo a chaomhnú.  Dúirt muid leo, dá mbeadh deacrachtaí acu leis na táirgí a bhí á dtáirgeadh ansin, tá an comhlacht sin chomh mór sin agus réimse leathan cuimsitheach earraí á dtáirgeadh acu gur cheart táirg-eadh eile a aistriú.  Glacadh leis an moladh sin ag an am.  Ina dhiaidh sin, is é an ceardchumann, chun an fhírinne a rá, a ghlaoigh orm faoi seo.  Bhí cruinniú agam leis an bhainistíocht anseo i mBaile Atha Cliath, leis an stiurthóir bainist-íochta ón Bhreatain; in a dhiaidh sin d'iarr mé cruinniú leis an leasuachtarán sna Stáit Aontaithe agus an stiurthóir atá acu thall agus chuireamar moltaí éagsúla faoi bhráid na hardbhainistíochta ansin. Chuireamar ina luí orthu go mbeimis sásta airgead a chur ar fáil i bhfoirm dheontais fhorbartha agus taighde, agus deontais le haghaidh traenála agus atraenála ach ní raibh an comhlacht sásta glacadh leis sin.  Ceapaim go gcruthaíonn sé sin go bhfuil tréaniarracht déanta againne.  Ní fadhb airgid atá ann ach fadhb éilimh ar na hearraí atá á dtáirgeadh ansin i láthair na huaire.</P>
      <P>Bhíomar sásta i gcónaí, i gcomhar le hÚdarás na na Gaeltachta, cabhair a thabhairt don chomhlacht seo.  Maidir leis an meitheal oibre, bhí plé ag an Aire agus mé féin leis an cheardchumann agus leis an fhoireann an tseachtain seo caite i mBaile Átha Cliath agus chinneamar go mba cheart meitheal oibre a chur ar fáil, os rud é go bhfuil monarcha ansin agus gur le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta é; go bhfuil innealra ann, foireann oilte agus gur cheart díriú ar an cheist seo chun comh-lachta eile a bhunú agus táirgí ar an dul seo a tháirgeadh ansin.  Mar a thug mé le fios cheana bhí cruinniú agam inné faoi seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an meitheal oibre i gceann oibre go luath agus go mbeidh seans ann cuairt a thabhairt ar an mhonarcha go luath chun iad féin a chur ar an eolas.</P>

Nuair a chuirtear an slua maith daoine atá fostaithe ag an Údarás ann san áireamh bíodh is go bhfuil futhu tionsclaíocht agus fostaíocht a chur chun cinn sna Gaeltachtaí, is léir ón tuairisc a thug an tAire dúinn inniu go bhfuil <Col N="1986" /> postanna á gcailliúint de réir mar atá postanna nua dá chruthú.  Nuair nach bhfuil méadú ag teacht ar líon na bpost ann, an bhfuil gá le hathrú polasaí chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na postanna nua níos seasmhaí ná mar a bhí go dtí seo.  Is í mo cheist ar an Aire ná cén tairiscint atá aige le líon na bpost a mhéadú sna réigiúin Ghaeltachta agus ní dóigh liom gur fhreagair sé fós í.  An bhfuil sé de chumas ag an Údarás deontais, iasachtaí agus cabhair eile a thairiscint le go meall-faí tionscail go dtí na ceantair Ghaeltachta?

Athruithe in éileamh ar na hearraí a tháirgítear ann is bun leis an gcailliúint.  Maidir le polasaí, táimid ag díriú anois ar phostanna a chao-mhnú; tá sé fíor-riachtanach go n-éireodh linn.  Tig liom mo lámh a chur ar mo chroí agus a fhógairt nár cailleadh post amháin ceal airgead breise ón Roinn, ón Údarás ná ón Rialtas.  Sampla ná Telectron na Farraige Móire ar cuireadh tairiscintí rompu ach nach raibh an comhlacht sásta airgead breise nó deontas a ghlacadh faoi choinne athstructúrú nó atraenáil, tai-ghde nó forbairt.</P>

      <P>The funding available to the National Gallery for acquisitions in 1993 is £100,000 and the 1968 wing of the gallery is being refurbished at a cost of £6 million to the Exchequer.  This work is expected to be completed by 1995. Moreover, the Office of Public Works has recently handed over houses at 88-89 Merrion Square to the National Gallery and refurbishment is at present taking place.  The acquisition of these two houses by the Gallery will facilitate the relocation of its administrative staff from its core building and the release of significant additional exhibition space within that building.  The Deputy will appreciate that total Exchequer assistance being provided for the gallery is significant by any standards.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> the current and capital funding needs of our national cultural institutions i.e. National Library, National Museum, National Gallery, National Archives, etc., will continue to receive a high priority so as to enable them in many cases to complete modernisation and refurbishment programmes.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the funding available to the National Gallery for acquisitions is significant, but I do not agree.  In terms of value of collection, our National Gallery compares with the Uffizi museum in Florence, which receives the equivalent of £6 million per year for acquisitions, and the Rijks-museum in Amsterdam which receives the equivalent of almost £8 million for acquisitions.  By that comparison the funding of our National Gallery is hardly significant.  There is also the difficulty in the National Gallery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the question.  The Minister referred in his reply to making available further space for administrative staff at 88-89 Merrion Square.  Will these premises be used for exhibition purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood my reply which I thought was sufficiently clear.  The acquisition of additional buildings for administrative staff will result in the availability of further space for exhibition within the core building of the National Gallery.  The Deputy is as aware as I am of the riches available to the galleries in Firenze to purchase additional works of art.  Would that they were available to us here.  I have given a commitment that in the next couple of years the needs of the gallery will be generously provided for.  It is important that staff are brought together in the two buildings, making the gallery administratively effective.  The State is spending more than £6 million on this project, a very significant investment by any standards.  As the Deputy will <Col N="1990" /> appreciate, the gallery will then have more space for exhibition purposes.  He is quite right to draw attention to the challenge faced by the Government to provide additional resources to ensure greater availability of our rich collection. It is always appropriate in answering questions of this kind to acknowledge our indebtedness to the donors in the private sector whose generosity has enabled us to build up the national collection.</P>

      <P>The heritage initiative to which I referred, which covers proposals in the five areas for which I have responsibility, includes development plans for all our great national institutions, including the National Gallery. It is my hope that these proposals will result in better facilities for the staff. I am very impressed by the number of people who visit the National Gallery &mdash; more than 1.5 million in any one year.  It makes great sense, not just for tourism-related reasons, to make available every possible assistance to the gallery.</P>

      <P>If having provided additional exhibition space it emerges that works of art remain in rooms that are unopen to the public, will the Minister initiate a policy of putting such works on touring exhibitions and lending them to galleries such as the Crawford Gallery in Cork and to galleries in Galway, if that city is not already saturated with artistic works, Waterford and other provincial cities and towns?  That works of art are left behind closed doors, unavailable to the general public, is a great waste.</P>

      <P>In spite of being tempted by Deputies opposite, I must not stray into matters local.  One difficulty that will be addressed is the indemnification of works of art and in that context I will address the issue raised by the Deputy in relation to touring exhibitions. Procedures for indemnification of foreign visiting collections have to be put on a statutory basis.  When doing so I will take the opportunity to ensure that the maximum number of people see these great cultural riches as part of their normal education.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, in a few years time the money made available by way of the Shaw bequest to the National Gallery will be used up. Has the Government any plans to make provision for the resulting shortfall? While the additional exhibition space is welcome, it will necessitate the recruitment of additional security staff.

      <P>I will be brief.  The Minister invites one to look in four years' time at his glowing legacy but I prefer to look forward, specifically with regard to the question of national collections, be they in museums, art galleries or wherever. Aside from the question of touring exhibitions, has the Minister any plans in his submission for Structural Funds for the permanent location outside Dublin of parts of national collections which are incapable of display within the facilities available in the capital city?</P>

      <P>I am anxious to assist you, a Cheann Comhairle, in making progress. The submissions I have made, which I obviously cannot discuss in detail, include such capital provision as would facilitate what the Deputy is suggesting. In relation to future capital provision, one has to take into account regionalised expenditure.  People are entitled to see what national resources are available to them without great difficulty.  This requires capital provision in a regionalised way and I have looked at that.</P>

Ní hionann é sin is a rá, áfach, go bhfuil dearcadh cúng againn maidir le ról níos leithne a bheith ag an Údarás san obair sin.</P>
      <P>Faoi alt a 9 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, is féidir&mdash;d'fhonn forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ó thaobh teanga, cultúir, sóisialachta, gné-ithiúlachta agus geilleagair &mdash; cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás le hordú ón Rialtas.  Sula bhféad-faí a iarraidh ar an Rialtas aon ordú mar sin a dhéanamh, bheadh sé riachtanach don Údarás féin cás iomlán a leagan amach a léireodh go cinnte go bhféadfadh siad cúram áirithe atá ar eagras eile faoi láthair a láimhseáil níos éifeachtaí i gcás na Gaeltachta ná mar atá sé á láimhseáil ag an eagras i gceist.</P>
      <P>Ach cás mar sin a fháil ón Údarás, beifear sásta é a scrúdú go báúil agus gach tacaíocht is féidir a thabhairt dó i láthair an Rialtais.  Tugadh an méid sin le fios nuair a bhí díospóireacht againn anseo sa Dáil tamaillín ó shin maidir leis an mBille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1993, agus threisigh an tAire féin an méid a dúirt sé ansin nuair a bhuail sé le comhaltaí an Údaráis le fíordhéanaí.</P>

I gcomparáid le húdarás ar bith eile tá siad chomh héifeachtach, nó b'fhéidir níos éifeachtaí, más féidir é sin a rá.  Is é mo bharúil féin, tar éis dom bheith thar sáile le m'fheidhmeannaigh le déanaí, go bhfuil an-obair á déanamh acu.

Is the Department reviewing the operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta in the light of the experience of Údarás na Gaeltachta since it was founded to decide what its role should be and how effective it should be in the nineties?  I completely understand the <Col N="1996" /> great difficulties of Údarás in establishing industry in the Gaeltacht areas.  Indeed the DKM report admitted that it is a virtually impossible task.  I am getting confusing messages from the Minister. The Minister says that if Údarás makes a case under section 9 of the Act, the Department will consider it.  I want to know whether the Department is actively, on its own initiative, reviewing the operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta, and if not would the Minister not agree that it should review the operation, to pursue the objectives it has, not only in relation to industrialisation of the Gaeltacht but in relation to the development of the use of the language in the Gaeltacht areas which is clearly in decline.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: Deputy Deenihan &mdash; The crisis facing 300 farmers because of the failure to reach agreement with the ESB regarding the funding of the ESB/Government subsidised farm electricification scheme; Deputy Sheehan &mdash; The proposed closure of Dunmanus national school, Goleen, County Cork, without consultation with the board of management or the parents of the pupils concerned; the reason the Minister for Education did not give consideration to the amalgamation of this school with Goleen national school which is in the same catchment area; and whether she is now prepared to offer free transport to Goleen national school to the pupils concerned; Deputy Upton &mdash; The need for appropriate educational facilities for disruptive students (details supplied) in the Dublin 8 area who do not attend any school despite the fact that they are aged approximately ten years.  Deputy Finucane &mdash; If, in view of the urgent necessity for a group water scheme at The Hill, Abbeyfeale, County Limerick, the Minister for the Environment will indicate when ths project will be approved and if he will make a statement on the matter; <Col N="2035" /> Deputy Boylan &mdash; The up to date situation in relation to Cavan swimming pool; and the reason this development has not yet been sanctioned.  Deputy Mulvihill &mdash; The necessity for an early commencement of the Whitegate sewage scheme in order to eliminate the pollution of the Whitegate area of Cork Harbour; Deputy de Valera &mdash; Given the crisis in the Mid-Western Health Board area, that the Minister for Health immediately establish the mentally handicapped as a priority within his Department by committing further funds now for the immediate and urgent provision of residential care, sheltered work shops and respite care.  Deputy Shatter &mdash; Whether the Minister for Justice will explain the circumstances relating to the early release of a person convicted of dangerous driving whose driving caused the death of a person (details supplied); Deputy Jim Mitchell &mdash; The urgent need for extra class rooms and teachers at St. Declan's boys' secondary school, Nephin Road, Dublin 7, before September 1993 and the equally pressing problem of the shortage of secondary school places for girls in the area; Deputy Theresa Ahearn &mdash; The regulations governing special arrangements for students, with problems such as deafness or dyslexia, who are sitting the junior certificate examinations and leaving certificate examinations in June 1993; Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; The failure to secure suitable premises for the All-Irish second level school for Tallaght, County Dublin, which was sanctioned during the last General Election campaign.</P>
      <P>I have selected for discussion the matters raised by Deputies Shatter, de Valera, Sheehan and Upton.</P>

    <Title>Animal Remedies Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I fully support its provisions.  It is <Col N="2036" /> right and proper that the image of this country has been promoted at home and abroad through the years as one of good agricultural produce by the Department of Agriculture and various agencies.  It is important to have a central Authority which deals with the question of animal welfare.  If that central Authority breaks down it can lead to chaos and big losses for farmers.  There was a perfect example of this in Italy when there was an outbreak of the dreaded foot and mouth disease.  We must ensure that the legislation is effective and that our good image as a strong agricultural country is promoted in the future.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is competition in the agricultural field, particularly in relation to cattle.  I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland, for gaining access for our farmers to the live trade.  It is important to maintain a balance between live trade and factory trade which helps the primary producer.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise the question of the effectiveness of this legislation and how we will reap the benefits.  I recall some years ago, when there was much controversy concerning antibiotics and residues in milk, a great scare among consumers.  We must not lose sight of the important role of the consumer in all this. It had reached the ridiculous stage where some milk delivery vans had signs up indicating there were no antibiotics or residues in the milk.  Supermarkets or meat shops should not erect signs stating there are no hormones or residues in the meat they sell.  Such signs do not allay fears but raise questions in the minds of people as to why they have been erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reminded of a person in Galway who wondered why he was told to install a filter in his water supply as he felt sure Galway Corporation was not trying to poison him with the existing water supply.  Some people over-react following the erection of these signs. Obviously people have to promote their products and in the case of milk state whether it is pasteurised and homogenised. When replying perhaps the <Col N="2037" /> Minister of State will give an indication of how residues will be detected and the technology available to do so.  One of the reasons we are discussing this Bill is because of the importance of our image and exports.  There are many new EC regulations and legislation covering hygiene, health and safety and animal welfare.  The IFA's proposal to Government on the use of Structural Funds stressed the importance of assistance for farmers in the area of hygiene and animal welfare.  Submissions on behalf of the North Connacht farmers by the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme and the cooperatives also stated clearly that they needed some assistance because of the new EC standards.  They mentioned in particular the regulations for milk assembly which would necessitate the introduction of milk tankers which, in the western region, would add considerably to the cost of milk collection services.  I hope the Minister will take these matters into consideration.</P>
    <P>In the context of hygiene and animal welfare, water supply is also very important. This is an issue in my own constituency in County Galway with 129 applications for grant assistance for group water schemes lodged with the Department at the moment.  There is about £3 million in the Estimates this year.  However, in 1982 we were spending £8 million on group water schemes and at the moment there are 18,000 houses and 8,000 farms looking for water supply which would be of tremendous assistance, particularly to smallholders.  I hope we will be able to get the necessary funds because this is most important in the context of animal hygiene and animal welfare.</P>
    <P>In the present programme there is £74 million for grants for the control of farmyard pollution.  One would need to double that figure to £148 million and I hope that that will be available in the new programme.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the consultative committee.  I am glad that the Minister is increasing the number of representatives on this committee.  I hope consumers will be represented.  We can <Col N="2038" /> produce as much food as we like but if we are not producing what the consumer wants, we are wasting our time.  It is, therefore, important to have a representative of the Consumers Association on that body.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in fines.  On summary conviction it is £1,000, and on conviction on indictment for a first offence it is £25,000.  They are substantial fines, as they must be, because this is such an important issue.  I hope this legislation is put through quickly.  I hope also that the questions raised by the Western Region Committee will be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle and content of this important legislation. I am pleased the Minister of State is here because he has substantial practical experience in this field.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is our largest single industry and its reputation at home and abroad is vital.  Evidence at the beef tribunal on the use of illegal drugs on livestock is an indictment of our stewardship.  The idea of &ldquo;the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo; is as relevant today as when James Fintan Lawlor coined the phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land remains our only renewable natural resource.  In the 1840s people were being driven from the land by rack-renting and starvation.  Today rural depopulation is fuelled by unemployment. This legislation forcefully tackles a potentially lethal blow to our hopes of rural employment and development. The end result of our efforts to create jobs depends on our ability to sell our goods and services abroad.  That ability hinges on our reputation for quality and excellence.  We have a precious reputation for being a green and pollution free island.  This perception is an invaluable marketing tool in regard to our produce and our country.  Those who tamper maliciously with the food chain by using angel dust and other poisons for selfish short term gain are an economic fifth column.  They are the enemy within. What hope have our farmers and manufacturers of competing in an international <Col N="2039" /> market when their produce is being contaminated at source?</P>
    <P>The formula for halting the flight from the land is at best a complex one. Rigorous enforcement of the legislation is a definite and necessary precondition. Substance abuse by a small minority of farmers and the pushers who supply them is not only economic sabotage, it is political sabotage.  The evidence of para-military involvement is damning. Manufacturing and supplying angel dust fulfils the role of the fellow traveller to perfection.  Those people actively finance and abet a campaign of vicious genocide. We must ask if the bombs that killed the two young boys in Warrington were bought and paid for in an Irish cattle mart.  The facts are that the IRA is in part financed and supplied on the back of Irish agriculture.  The Provo godfathers are literally living off the fat of the land.  In Northern Ireland and in Great Britain people die and families are rent asunder.  Here in the Republic the task of job creation is made more difficult. Entire communities continue to stagnate and disappear.  Our reputation in the marketplace is like a licence.  Without it we cannot even get on the road.  Let me cite the example of Austrian wine and Perrier mineral water.  These two products have never fully recovered their potential after the scandals that beset them in the eighties.  We cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our beef industry or any of the job sources here.</P>
    <P>At present our beef industry is worth £1 billion.  EC intervention will decline from 750,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes which leaves no market for approximately 200,000 cattle.  The development of consumer markets is of great urgency. Unless our efforts are guaranteed by quality at every step of the process our hopes will be doomed from the beginning.</P>
    <P>This Bill regulates into one Act what was previously a legislative maze.  It aims to ensure for the farmer the safety and well being of his stock.  This will ensure that his labour and investment are rewarded.  For the consumer it holds the <Col N="2040" /> promise of a guaranteed quality product. In this day and age this is no less than a basic right.  Modern consumers are educated and sophisticated purchasers with many choices available to them.  Unless Irish produce is the best it will not sell.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the updating of the penalties.  Previously no realistic deterrent existed; ten years in jail or £100,000 fine is fully in keeping with the offence being dealt with.  I welcome, in particular, the ultimate penalty, the fact that repeat offenders can be put out of the food trade entirely.  If the land of Ireland is to be made work for the people of Ireland it must be rid of those who would so vilely misuse it.  The land is the basis of a chain of production that is the chief source of wealth here.  It is, in a true sense, the national treasure and it must be jealously guarded.  I welcome the Bill and recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for their contributions and to express my appreciation for their solidarity and general support of all the provision of the Bill.  Rarely have I seen such a unified force in this House in terms of the total opposition to the use of illegal drugs and the support for the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a matter which transcends political boundaries because we are all trying to achieve the same objective.  I am glad to clarify the points which have been raised and want to assure Deputies that I appreciate the constructive spirit of their contributions and I am willing to listen to suggestions on Committee Stage.  It is also fair to say that a number of common points have been raised in the various contributions.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that this Bill is designed to consolidate existing legislation, to give greater effectiveness and flexibility to tackle the problem of the use of illegal substances. It is comprehensive legislation and there is no ambiguity on our position in relation to those substances, whether they are natural hormones or other types of substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> The Bill is designed to tackle the problem as it exists and is drawn on our experiences to date.  The penalties are extremely prohibitive and are designed to leave offenders in no doubt.  It will be the most far reaching legislation in this area in any member state of the European Community.  I will be taking steps to ensure that the Community fully understands the initiative that we have taken in this area of operation.</P>
    <P>The issue of powers of authorised officers has been raised.  This provision has been inserted in the light of experience of the operation of the existing regulations. We are not in the business of witch hunts but we want a situation where authorised officers can act effectively in what can be very difficult circumstances. Deputies have given some vivid accounts of the type of people involved in rack-eteering in these substances.  It is provided that an authorised officer may exercise some or all of the powers conferred by another authorised officer.  It is, therefore, possible to restrict the exercise of certain powers if necessary.  In relation to members of the Garda Síochána and Custom and Excise officers, similar powers are already available to such officers to deal with matters such as narcotic drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Where we will require to exercise the more extensive powers we will be dealing with similar situations.  It has been said and I support the view that the vast majority of farmers have no dealings with these substances.  I take the point already made by Deputies this morning concerning that particular issue.  I want to acknowledge that the vast majority of Irish farmers are law abiding citizens committed only to the production of quality food products.  It is nothing short of a shame that their good intentions and endeavour to produce a quality product are being undermined by a small number of people.  The question of penalties has been raised.  We are seeking penalties which will be proportionate to the crime. The House will recognise that the courts determine penalties on prosecution.  The purpose of the Bill is to create a proper framework and to get over the present <Col N="2042" /> limitation which exists because of summary offences.  The provision for indictable offences addresses this problem. Compared with penalties in other EC areas the proposed penalties, as has been acknowledged by all speakers this afternoon, are very strong.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that some Deputies indicated we were not going far enough.  That is also an indication of their determination to co-operate fully with me and the Government in dealing with what is a serious matter not only for the country but for individual farmers as well.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission's recent document which has been referred to by a number of Deputies is a statement of intent.  It has to be followed by specific proposals.  There is no conflict between the Bill and the Commission's views; we are ahead of the Commission in this area. The possibility of losing premia, for example, already exists in some Community regulations; we will support this concept and it can be best addressed across the Community by amending the relevant regulations.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the regulations already in force under the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, the Poisons Act, 1961, and the European Communities Act, 1972, are being continued in force.  As soon as the Bill is passed &mdash; it is my intention to have this Bill and its provisions operational as soon as possible &mdash; these regulations will apply as before but with the increased penalties provided for under this Bill.  This should allay Deputy Molloy's concern when he raised this matter in his very constructive contribution to the House yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>Regulations to implement Council Directives 90/676 and 90/677 are under preparation in my Department and will be introduced shortly.  The implementation date of Directive 90/677 was deferred to 1 April 1993, because of delays at EC level in the adoption of related measures which were required for the operation of the Directive.  The implementation of this Directive also requires the repeal of the Therapeutic <Col N="2043" /> Substances Act, 1932, which is provided for by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of licensing distribution channels for animal remedies, which was raised by a number of Deputies, is being addressed in the implementation of Council Directive 90/676.  The distribution of animal remedies in Ireland concerns a number of different groups.</P>
    <P>In introducing legislation in this area it is important that the opportunity should not be exploited by any interested party to introduce restricted practices which are not warranted on public health grounds.  I am sure the legislation is fair and reasonable.  Officials of my Department have been involved in consultations with interested parties.  The scheme envisaged is broadly in line with that proposed by the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which was referred to yesterday evening by Deputy Molloy. Much order has been introduced into this area already, for example, many Deputies referred to vanmen who have to take out a licence now.  Another example is that of importers and wholesalers who have been subject to a registration system since 1980.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee, it is policy that the members of the committee are recommended to the Minister by representative organisations.  The present committee has members who were initially nominated by the Veterinary Council, the Pharmaceutical Society and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries. There is also a farmer representative. This policy will be continued with wider representation of interests due to the extension of the number of members.  It is not considered appropriate to actually name nominating bodies in the Bill as representative associations change, merge and often disband and a sector can have more than one representative body.  It is considered that the present system ensures that the nomination can be sought from the body which is most representative of a particular sector and every effort is made to ensure a proper balance in expertise.  I will examine <Col N="2044" /> Deputy Fox's recommendation regarding the inclusion of a consumer representative on the committee.  The matter was raised by other Deputies including Deputy Coughlan.  I am sure Deputy Coughlan would like to see a lady Deputy serving on that committee.</P>

      <P>In relation to products manufactured for export, I wish to assure the House that this area will be tightly regulated.  The provisions of section 4 (7) merely relate to the labelling provisions for such products.  Just as we in Ireland require all products being imported to be labelled in accordance with our labelling regulations we have to allow for products being exported to be labelled as required by the importing country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the protection of consumers, provision is made in the veterinary examination regulations that any use of illegal substances or the presence of residues of animal remedies are grounds for condemnation of carcases.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Sargent's concerns I wish to assure him that authorised human medicines do not come within the scope of the Bill and are specifically excluded in regulations made thereunder. The definition of animal remedy is taken from Community law and is all encompassing.  BST (bovine somatotropin) and Nuvan come within the scope of this Bill and their use is dependent on their being granted valid authorisations. The definition also includes homeopathic medicines and regulations in accordance with the recently adopted Council Directive on homeopathic veterinary medicines will be introduced under this Bill before the end of the year. The provisions of the Bill will also apply to a genetically modified organism if it is included in an animal remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of seizure of profits derived from criminal activities is being addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  Provision is being made that <Col N="2045" /> profits from illegal activities under this Bill will be included.</P>
    <P>In relation to the import of meat and meat products into the Community it is a requirement that only animals raised on holdings which do not use hormonal growth promoters are supplied.  It is my policy to ensure that these requirements are adhered to when discussions of approval for such imports take place at Community level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised a specific point regarding testing systems.  We test live animals through urine tests.  Carcases are tested at the point of slaughter.  The detection of any residue depends on withdrawal periods; this is not peculiar to residues of veterinary substances.  We are looking at methods to improve the test in order to allow detection after a longer withdrawal period.  This would be very important and relevant to the points raised by many Deputies who contributed to the debate here this morning. It is important to recognise that if a long withdrawal period has to be observed then the use of those substances becomes uneconomic.  In regard to resources there is a special squad dedicated to this work. In addition, the full staff on meat inspection service is used.  I totally reject any suggestion that any officers have been asked to be less than vigorous in their approach to this matter; in fact the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Deputies who acknowledged this morning the commitment of the officials of my Department who operate in this very difficult and sensitive area.  They are totally committed to joining with us in tackling this serious crime.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal to farmers and the industry to assist me in my efforts to safeguard this important sector of our economy.  It is necessary to protect the health of our people and the income of our farmers not only by refusing to use those lethal products but also by helping in bringing the pushers to the attention of the authorities.  I agree with the view that this problem cannot be overcome by legislation alone.  We have a relatively low incidence of drug abuse and I agree <Col N="2046" /> with Deputies who stated that we should not over-exaggerate the extent of the problem.  To do so would damage unnecessarily the image of our industry and the reputation we have for producing a high quality meat product.  I do not accept the figure of 50 per cent of animals having been illegally treated.  The provisions contained in the Bill will, with the co-operation of all concerned, eliminate for all time this very serious threat to an industry, which is worth in excess of £1 billion annually.  Let there be no doubt that the dubious short term gain from using those products would in the medium to long term be offset by a reduction in the market both in demand and in price.  A quality meat product commanding a premium price is the only way forward and this Bill will help to ensure that this goal is achieved.</P>
    <P>I remind this House that this Bill is not solely concerned with the use of illegal products.  It also provides a regulatory framework to ensure that safe, efficacious animal remedies are available to farmers and that those quality products are used responsibly and correctly where necessary.  As I stated in my introductory speech, this Bill is necessary even if we do not have to address the issue of the illegal use of substances for growth promotion. The provisions of this Bill lay the regulatory foundation to ensure safe quality food.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the various Deputies for their constructive contributions which indicated total solidarity and support.  I realise that legislation alone will not deal with this serious matter.  For that reason I appeal today to all those associated with our agricultural industry, from the producers to the processors, to join together as a team.  I would hope to meet with them, when this Bill becomes operational, to see if we can unite in tackling what undoubtedly is the most serious threat we have ever had to our valuable livestock industry.  On Committee Stage I will endeavour to deal with some of the other points which I did not have an opportunity to deal with in my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The early completion of the Animal Remedies Bill means that there are not many spokes-persons in the House to talk on this Bill and I have been asked to take this amendment on behalf of Deputy Gilmore.  This amendment seeks to restrict the seeking of a warrant by the Defence Forces to <Col N="2048" /> circumstances in which members of the Defence Forces are being investigated. We would like this power restricted in so far as possible to ensure that it does not become a factor whereby two arms of the security forces of the State compete with each other in investigating certain matters. The Defence Forces would seek a warrant only in circumstances where the security of the State is threatened, but that is also within the remit of the Garda Síochána.  It would be more appropriate to confine the issuing of warrants in relation to the interception of postal packets or telephone conversations to the Garda Síochána.  We are not concerned that the Defence Forces might abuse or misuse such power, but because it involves an infringement on the privacy of the citizen it would be more appropriate to confine this matter to the Garda Síochána bearing in mind, of course, the importance of defending the security of the State.</P>
      <P>From a cursory glance at sections 2 and 5, which relate to section 6, it is not clear that the Minister of the day would be presented with a <i>prima facie</i> case in support of a warrant by an officer of the Defence Forces.  The Bill requires that the Minister must be satisfied in regard to certain matters, but the type of assurances that must be given by an officer of the Defence Forces is not clearly defined in the Bill.  The Bill states that the officer must indicate that other more mundane inquiries have failed to produce the evidence being sought in regard to either a proposed act against the security of the State or an Act already being carried out against the security of the State.  I am concerned that the checks and balances which apply to the Garda Síochána may not apply to the Defence Forces.  My understanding is that under the law the Defence Forces may act only in public under the control of the Garda.  They may not operate road blocks except in the company of gardaí or act in any other way outside the control of the Garda Síochána, unless an emergency is declared.  This section gives the Defence Forces a power which should be confined to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 5a are being taken together and although they are related their impact would be totally different.  Amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies Browne, Mitchell and Harney seeks to transfer from a military officer not below the rank of colonel to the Army Chief of Staff the right to make the application for an authorisation.  I assured Deputy Mitchell that I would consult the Department of Defence to find out if they would have any objection to my accepting the amendment in his name.  Following discussions with the Department of Defence and with the Army I am glad to report that there are no such objections.  I will accept the substance of amendment No. 5, but I am advised by the draftsman that I may not accept the amendment as drafted.  First, it will require some consequential amendments, for example, amendments to the definition section of the Bill, and section 7 will also require amendment as such officer is referred to in that section. Some alterations will be required to the wording of the amendment.  However, I will accept the substance of the amendment and undertake to put down an amendment and consequential amendments on Report Stage which will meet the substance of the case made by the Deputies involved.  I thank them for bringing this matter to our attention and the Bill will be a better one for having accepted the substance of their amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under amendment No. 5a only in circumstances where the activities under investigation mean that the security of the State is endangered and those activities relate solely to members of the Defence Forces, is it possible for the Chief of Staff as opposed to the Commissioner to apply for the authorisation to intercept suspected communications. In other words, even if the security of the State is threatened and people other than the Defence Forces are involved or suspected of being involved in an espionage ring, it would be a matter for the Commissioner to apply for authorisation to intercept the communication.  I regret I cannot accept that amendment as it <Col N="2050" /> would restrict the powers of the Defence Forces to apply for an authorisation only where a member of the Defence Forces is under investigation.  That proposal would ignore the important role played by the Defence Forces in preserving and protecting the security of the State and could, in certain circumstances, undermine the security of the State.  In that regard, it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy De Rossa's point that similar checks and balances may not be provided for the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner.  Section 4 sets out the conditions which must be satisfied before the Garda Commissioner decides to apply for an authorisation to intercept and section 5 refers to the Chief of Staff. Those two sections appear to be identical and having regard to Deputy De Rossa's point I will undertake to examine them more closely between now and Report Stage to find out if there is anything in section 4 which is not contained in section 5.  Obviously, they must be drafted in a slightly different way because we are talking about two different matters, serious crime and the security of the State.</P>
    <P>If Deputy De Rossa is in any way concerned about the Defence Forces continuing to perform its present function in relation to authorisations after the enactment of the Bill, I should like to put his mind at rest by making the following points.  First, the Defence Forces can only apply for an authorisation where the security of the State is at issue.  Second, under the proposed new arrangement, only the Chief of Staff will have the power to initiate the application.  In addition, he must submit the application to the Minister for Defence who will have to recommend it before it is submitted to the Minister for Justice.  Third, the application must contain sufficient information in accordance with section 5 to enable the Minister for Justice to make a decision.  Fourth, the nominated officer in the Department of Justice who receives the application initially will have the duty of scrutinising the application and seeking any further information, etc., he deems necessary to <Col N="2051" /> enable him to make a submission to the Minister for Justice.  Fifth, and most importantly, under section 8 the designated judge will have the power to keep the operation of the Act under review and the duty of ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with.  He will also have the duty of reporting to the Taoiseach at least once every two years.  It is envisaged that, in addition to this general report, at least every two years he can report from time to time on any matter which concerns him directly to the Minister for Justice about an individual incident or trend developing in the operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Any authorisation under the Act will be given in the knowledge that it can come under the scrutiny of an independent judicial authority of high standing. This is the best guarantee that an authorisation given under the Act will be a proper one.  From the point of view, I am happy to accept the substance of amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies Browne and Mitchell.  I cannot accept amendment No. 5a for the reasons I stated.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance of this amendment.  It is important that the officer in the Army is equivalent to the officer in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment in the names of Deputy Gilmore, will the Minister clarify whether the Army intends to <Col N="2052" /> use these provisions as a kind of intelligence mechanism rather than a security mechanism?  I imagine that security related crimes will go through the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in any event.  Will the Army use telephone tapping as a way of gathering Army intelligence? I ask the Minister to clarify this point as it raises certain issues.  I am not saying that I am necessarily opposed in this practice, but we need to be clear about what we are doing in this legislation. As I understood it initially, the purpose of the legislation was to assist the Garda in the main in detecting crime and finding out what is going on.  I did not anticipate that 'phone tapping would ever be used as a way of aiding and abetting Army intelligence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Harney, I forgot her name was on the amendment.  I confirm that the amendment I am accepting in substance is the amendment proposed by Deputies Harney, Mitchell and Browne.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, an authorisation can be sought by the Army to intercept a telecommunications message where the security of the State is an issue.  I wish to make two points in this regard.  First, the purpose of the Bill is to put on a statutory basis the present administrative practice which has been administrative practice since the foundation of the State 70 years ago.  Second if I was to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment, it would give rise to a peculiar situation.  For example, if the Army was investigating a case of espionage, which is basically what we are talking about, and the people involved were all members of the Defence Forces, one person would be empowered to apply for the authorisation.  However, if 20 members of the Defence Forces and one outside person were involved in a case &mdash; even if that person's phone was not being tapped &mdash; the Garda Commissioner would have to make the application for the authorisation.  That does not seem correct; it seems a bit odd to say the least of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is envisaged that the authorisation <Col N="2053" /> will be used in Army intelligence but only where the security of the State is at risk.  Not only will the Chief of Staff have to be satisfied that the security of the State is at issue, the Minister for Defence will also have to be satisfied that it is at issue &mdash; the authorised officer in the Department of Justice will have to be satisfied that it is at issue and, ultimately, he or she will have to satisfy the Minister for Justice.  Several safeguards are built into this provision and I do not envisage that it will be used on a widespread basis in terms of the Army intelligence aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I recently attended a meeting of the Friends of the Mentally Handicapped for the Mid-West Region at which the tremendous pressure parents and all those caring for the mentally handicapped are under was highlighted. This pressure is due solely to a lack of facilities caused by a dearth of consistent and inadequate funding.</P>
      <P>It will no doubt be argued by the Minister that money is short and that the Government has managed to increase allocations to agencies funded directly by the Department of Health from £39 million in 1981 to more than £104 million in 1993, an increase of 167 per cent. While such increases are very encouraging, we must look at the reality, there is now a crisis in the mid-west region. The report drawn up by the Mid-Western Health Board on mentally handicapped services, published in 1990, pointed out that an investment programme of £6.295 million was needed immediately to deal with the immediate and urgent needs of children and adults in that region alone. I want to contrast this with the funding provided by the Department to deal with the problem nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding must be adequate and planned <Col N="2054" /> over a number of years so that a high level and consistent service can be provided.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to compliment the voluntary bodies who give a consistent and ongoing service to those who suffer from mental handicap.  Without these voluntary bodies and the carers involved in this sector we would not have the existing excellent service which is due to the commitment and ongoing concern of carers for the mentally handicapped.  What worries me is that these carers are not being given the back-up funding to do the job they would wish to do.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to the problems obtaining within the service which must be addressed as a matter of ugency, not least in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  These concern adults blocking children's beds and the absence of children's community services.  Funding for the provision of sheltered workshops must also be given priority.  The only way of fully recognising the invaluable work done by people such as the Brothers of Charity at Gort Road in Ennis is by the provision of funds so that they can continue the work of giving our young adults the dignity and respect each citizen deserves and has a right to expect.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west region there is urgent need for day care services, respite care, educational facilities and hostel places. The need for genetic counselling is also being stressed by the Mid-Western Health Board in their report.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the figure to which the Mid-Western Health Board referred in their report published in 1990. That health board has said they cannot continue to provide the service without an immediate injection of £6.295 million. Referring to such a figure is not a scare tactic because those involved in the service have said that, without such immediate financial aid, the orderly development and provision of services already obtaining in the mid-west region will grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated £8.5 million in the 1993 budget, based on a figure of 1,600 people nationally in need of this assistance and help.  However, the <Col N="2055" /> 1993 figures show there has been an increase in the numbers of people needing help, now standing at 2,756.</P>
    <P>I want to demonstrate what the moneys actually mean in real terms in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  Although we are talking about an increase of £8.5 million in the budget, what that means nationally is £6.5 million for new services for 1993.  That is the national figure whereas there is need for the Mid-Western Health Board also to receive over £6 million to continue those services.  What this increase will mean for the Mid-Western Health Board alone will be just £458,000 for 1993, compared with a figure of £275,000 in 1992.</P>
    <P>I regret I have not more time to highlight the very serious problem obtaining within the Mid-Western Health Board area with regard to the mentally handicapped, causing great anxiety, concern, frustration and indeed disillusionment on the part of carers who have provided such a consistent and high standard of care to the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to ensure an immediate increase in funds for the mentally handicapped in the Mid-Western Health Board area to allow the carers there provide the service they would wish to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy de Valera for having raised this matter.  I know of her genuine concern for the victims of mental handicap in the Mid-Western Health Board region.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Minister has made it clear that one of his priorities is the improvement of services for people with disabilities and in particular those with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to develop and expand the services for people with mental handicap.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to enable the recommendations of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;<i>Needs and Abilities</i>&mdash; to be accelerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> In the budget this year the Government made available an additional £8 million for improving and strengthening the health services to people with a disability, in particular, those with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In addition to this a sum of £2 million has been made available from within the Estimates of my Department to strengthen the funding base of some of the direct-funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions, of which £458,000 has been allocated to the mid-western region.  This money will be used to provide a very broad range of additional services along the following lines: 90 residential places for the provision of on-going care and for emergency and respite care; 200 day-care places for a wide variety of community-based services; the improvement of the home support programme which was initiated last year; the continuation of the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate hostel accommodation in the community; the creation of further early intervention and child education and development services; the improvement of services in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane, and the commissioning of new bungalow accommodation at the Daughters of Charity on the Navan Road in Dublin.</P>
    <P>With reference to the funding which has been made available to the mid-western region, provision has been made in this allocation for persons who will be transferred from services in the Southern Health Board area this year.</P>
    <P>The precise services to be provided in each region will be agreed by the local mental handicap co-ordinating committees within the guidelines issued by my Department and will be approved by my colleague, the Minister for Health. These allocations were determined on the basis of the waiting lists for services and on the current level of service provision in each area.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made also for the capital investment necessary to support <Col N="2057" /> the initiatives which will be put in place this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee and approved by the Department of Health.  This is by far the largest single allocation ever made to services for persons with a mental handicap and is a mark of the determination of the Government to give a very high priority to the development of services for persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In all, the total amount being spent this year on services for persons with a mental handicap is £209 million.</P>
    <P>An additional £5 million revenue and £1 million capital was provided in 1992 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap.  Of the £5 million revenue, £275,000 was allocated to the mid-western region which enabled additional residential, respite and day care places to be provided and a home support service to be initiated.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Western Health Board offered eight places in Aras Attracta, Swinford to residents in mental handicap centres in the mid-west who were from Mayo and who wished to return to their native county, thus releasing places within the mid-west region for persons on the waiting list there.</P>
    <P>The mid-west region also received £172,000 towards capital developments associated with the above-mentioned services.</P>
    <P>While both my colleague, the Minister for Health, and I are aware of the problems which exist in the mid-western and other regions and are conscious that much more needs to be done to meet fully the needs of all persons with a mental handicap who are on a waiting list, we are satisfied that this injection of £8.5 million on top of the £6 million made available last year &mdash; which is being repeated this year &mdash; will provide a real improvement in the services and I intend to build on this in future years.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy de Valera, I have a very personal knowledge of the problems in this, my own region.  I had discussions <Col N="2058" /> with the Minister for Health about the matter today.  He has agreed to meet a deputation from the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  We look forward to that meeting at which I hope to be present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me raise this matter.  At 11 p.m. on a night in March last year Sarah Vickers and two teenage friends were hit by a car driven by a 24-year old man, one Brian Kennedy.  Four days later Sarah died in hospital.  The driver of the car was given a three-month prison sentence at Dún Laoghaire District Court having been convicted of dangerous driving.  He was also fined £300 for driving while uninsured and disqualified from driving for two years.  A further fine of £200 for the unlawful use of the car, which was owned by his mother, was also imposed.  Hit and run summonses were struck out.</P>
      <P>There was considerable public disquiet at the leniency of the sentence imposed. At the very least it was to be expected that the sentence would be longer in this case.  Less than two weeks after commencing to serve the three-month sentence the man responsible for the death of Sarah Vickers was released from prison.</P>
      <P>It is an outrageous scandal that that person was released so early from prison. His early release has caused great anguish to the parents of the late Sarah Vickers. Despite requests having been made to her, to date the Minister for Justice has offered no explanation as to why such an early release took place.  In my view it is inexcusable that not more than two weeks of such a minimal sentence was served for such an appalling offence.  I also regard it as inexplicable that only a three-month sentence was imposed in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some recent comment from the Minister about the need for the Judiciary to impose harsher sentences in <Col N="2059" /> particular types of cases and for a uniform sentencing policy.  There is little point in the Minister engaging in such criticism of the Judiciary if she is unable to keep her own house in order and ensure that, when sentences are imposed, they are fully and properly served.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain to the House why the minimal sentence imposed in this case was not fully implemented; tell us if she received any representations regarding an early release and further explain why, when the Vickers family sought an explanation from her, a letter was received by them which was wrongly addressed to their deceased daughter?  Apparently, a second letter was then wrongly sent to the deceased girl's dead uncle.  Finally, after this, a letter was received by her tragic parents, Joan and Leo Vickers, but it shed no light on the events.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Department of Justice with this tragic family has been a litany of hamfisted, thoughtless, bureaucratic bungling which has been added to by the Minister's refusal to tell the family the full story, by her callous use of the family to cover up both her own and her Department's ineptitude and by seeking some worthless personal publicity, when it became known that this man had been released early, by arranging a meeting with some members of the Vickers family and others who are concerned about the lenient sentences imposed by some members of the Judiciary for dangerous driving offences.</P>
    <P>Joan and Leo Vickers are entitled to straight and honest answers to their questions. Instead of answers they have been treated with contempt by the Minister responsible for the early release of the person who killed their daughter and despite the Government's so-called commitment to openness it has until today refused to explain the extraordinary events I described.  Will the Minister give the family the explanations to which they are entitled?  It should not be seen as a matter for secrecy; giving them the explanations to which they are entitled <Col N="2060" /> will not endanger national security.  I hope the Minister will tell the House the full story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply conscious of the fact that, while issues of general policy and practice arise in the context of this debate, it takes its origin in the death of a young girl who lost her life in a traffic accident.</P>
      <P>Sarah Vickers' death was a tragedy and I share fully with every other Member of this House an understanding of the grief which the loss of this young life has visited on her family and friends.  I have met members of the family and I know of their pain.  It was a matter of the deepest regret to me that a letter I sent to the family, subsequent to our meeting, which was wrongly addressed, caused them further distress.  That error was inexcusable. As Minister, I accept full responsibility for what occurred and I immediately apologised both personally, by telephone and by letter, for the lapse in standards which the error showed.  I believe that we should take the greatest care today to ensure that nothing is said which adds to the family's distress.</P>
      <P>This case, like all others, was the subject of a Garda investigation, prosecution, trial and sentence.  I have no control over nor any function in relation to any of these processes in individual cases.  As a lawyer, Deputy Shatter knows that it is not the function of my Department to decide what charges, if any, should be preferred in a particular case &mdash; that is a matter for the DPP &mdash; and it is a matter for the courts to determine the conviction and sentence. My functions arise in relation to the subsequent management of sentences.</P>
      <P>In this case the sentence which fell to be managed was a three month sentence imposed by the court for dangerous driving. That sentence, with the standard one quarter remission, amounted in practice to ten weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of sentences &mdash; all sentences &mdash; involves decisions as to whether individual offenders should be granted conditional early release.  The <Col N="2061" /> power to grant such releases is vested in the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, in fact it is one of the major &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; to custody, and an option which was, incidentally, advocated by the Whitaker Committee.</P>
    <P>In deciding on temporary release, a range of factors is taken into account including the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, any previous criminal history, behaviour while in custody and, where necessary, a Garda assessment as to whether the offender would be a danger to the community if released. Temporary releases, when granted, are always subject to conditions, the breach of which may lead to revocation of the temporary release.  Conditions may include an undertaking to be of good behaviour, to accept supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, to report to a Garda station at specified times etc.</P>
    <P>The prison system is operating at maximum capacity i.e. around 2,200.  The policy is to use these places for the optimum benefit of the community e.g. to accommodate all committals as they arrive, but, especially to accommodate all offenders who are convicted of serious offences and who would, if free, constitute a real and substantial danger to the public.  To ensure that this policy can be maintained, some latitude is exercised in relation, for example, to prisoners serving short sentences, whose release would not constitute a danger to the public.  The objective is, as I said, to make optimum use of the available accommodation.</P>
    <P>The offender in this case was released by reference to the aforementioned criteria. The sentence imposed by the courts was relatively short, he had no criminal history, was generally of good character and was considered not to represent a danger to the public if released &mdash; in other words, he was considered suitable for temporary release.</P>
    <P>While it is not the practice, for very good reasons, to go into the circumstances of individual releases I think that, in the exceptional circumstances of this case &mdash; and I emphasise that I am making a single exception &mdash; the decision <Col N="2062" /> to release the offender in question, and others, on 16 March 1993 was made for purely operational reasons.  They were released to ensure that sufficient prison spaces would be available over the bank holiday and the following weekend to accommodate all new committals.  The decision, in other words, was taken in the context of making optimum use of available prison spaces under general guidelines which have been operating for years under successive Ministers for Justice. There were no improper motives or other pressures involved.  The official who sanctioned the release, did so in what he saw as a correct application of existing criteria and against a background where the advice available to him, including Garda advice, was that the particular release did not pose a threat to the public.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Vickers family subsequent to our meeting that I did not think it would be helpful to them if I were to go into detail about the circumstances of this release.  I do not for one moment expect that by outlining background circumstances now to this House, I will in any way ease the grief and sense of loss experienced by those who were bereaved by the death of Sarah Vickers.  It is important, however, that the House should have a frank statement of the realities involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is appropriate, given the circumstances I have just outlined, that I should also inform the House that I have commenced a major review of the policy in relation to the prison system and the treatment of offenders generally.  A wide range of options is being considered in this context, including the provision of more cell spaces, the wider development of community-based sanctions as an alternative to prison custody and the development of more appropriate parole arrangements.  I will be making a further statement in the matter when my review is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann <Col N="2063" /> Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  As you said, the two children concerned are aged approximately ten years and are running wild in a flat complex close to the centre of this city.  They are not attending any school although they have done so in the past.  However, because they were disruptive and unsuitable the school authorities in the area are now either unwilling or unable to deal with them.</P>
      <P>One of the students was assessed extensively at a number of centres. Recently when I raised this matter by way of a Dáil question the same student was offered the opportunity to be assessed in Belfast.  This student comes from a broken family and is living with his father.  His mother is not residing with them.  Unfortunately, his father was not prepared to allow the student go to Belfast to be assessed.</P>
      <P>The other student is running around the flat complex in question and is constantly in trouble with the Garda Síochána who are doing their best to cope. Apparently there is little they can do because of the way the law is structured. As a consequence, this youngster is proving a problem in the flat complex which, in any event, is confronted with many other problems.</P>
      <P>These children, as I said, come from broken homes which have faced many difficulties during the years.  If nothing is done problems will arise in the future.  I gather that a garda who spoke recently at a public meeting said that by looking at a seven year old child he can make a reasonably educated guess as to whether that child will be a criminal 20 to 30 years on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt at all that the garda in question is quite right as it is easy enough to identify the factors that lead young people to become criminals.  If we do not intervene, obviously that is what awaits these students down the line.  Even if we do not take that aspect into consideration they are creating problems for the people who live in the area who, as I have said already, have enough difficulties as things stand. <Col N="2064" /> Over the past few days there has been a heightened interest and awareness of the problems that some children face.  A survey was published in the past few days which shows that out of a total of 2,000 students in 11 schools in Dublin, some 78 students were mildly disruptive and 76 were very disruptive.  This is part of a widespread problem.  The survey shows that 7 per cent of the students in that sample were giving rise to problems, of whom 3.5 per cent were giving rise to very serious problems.  The parents of these students are at their wits ends and they feel very little is being done to deal with the problems they are trying to cope with in difficult circumstances.  The social agencies and the social support organisations and personnel in the area are also very concerned and indeed I have had quite a number of representations from them in this regard.  Indeed, I had representations on this matter as recently as this morning from a person who is involved in the social services in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to do something about this problem generally. I wish to appeal specifically to the Minister to try to have something done in the case of these two youngsters, whose details are available to him.  They live in an inner city flat complex, and that has its own difficulties.  I honestly believe the people there have enough to contend with without this type of problem festering away.  The families are under enough pressure and they badly need support.  I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to do something positive about this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the cases referred to by Deputy Upton and the difficulties which have been encounted to date in securing suitable educational placements for these boys.  The first child mentioned attended Scoil Eoin Special School in Crumlin since he was five years old until December 1992.  Prior to this, he attended St. Joseph's nursery off Cork Street.  The school authorities in Scoil Eoin, which caters for children with mild mental <Col N="2065" /> handicap, felt that he was not suitably placed there and referred him to the Eastern Health Board for psychological assessment and a recommendation on a more suitable educational placement for him.</P>
      <P>On completion of that assessment by an Eastern Health Board psychologist, it was felt that he was inappropriately placed in Scoil Eoin as his current level of intellectual functioning is estimated as being within the upper limits of the moderate range of mental handicap.  His academic skills are very weak and the psychologist is of the opinion that he would benefit from attendance at a school for moderately mentally handicapped children.</P>
      <P>The psychologist recommended that he be considered for residential care where both his educational and psychiatric needs could be addressed.  Such placement would be the responsibility of the health authorities and I understand that the Eastern Health Board are currently pursuing the question of a suitable residential placement for him.</P>
      <P>The fact that this boy is now at home and not attending school is cause for serious concern.  The Department's inspectorate is currently endeavouring to have him placed in a special school for moderately mentally handicapped children on a day basis pending the outcome of the health board's efforts to have a suitable residential placement made available for him.  The Minister will inform the Deputy of progress in this case as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second boy mentioned by the Deputy, the position is that a psychological assessment report was produced on this boy in February 1993 by Warrenstown House.  The boy had spent five months in this residential treatment centre prior to his assessment.  He had earlier been in voluntary care in a hostel for a year.  The referral to Warrenstown House was made by a social worker because of concern over the boy's behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of the psychological assessement report, the school attendance service was alerted and contacted a <Col N="2066" /> number of schools in an effort to have the boy enrolled.  The school attendance service encountered difficulty in securing an appropriate placement and recently requested the assistance of the Department of Education in the matter.  The Minister for Education has since instructed her Department's inspectorate to pursue the question as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate are currently in contact with relevant school authorities with a view to having the boy catered for in the most appropriate setting without further delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise the important matter of the closure of Dunmanus national school, Goleen, County Cork on 30 June 1993.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister why this school is being closed down on that date without consultation with the board of management or the parents' association?  Is this course of action now accepted departmental policy?  Both the board of management and the parents are highly incensed by the lack of dialogue on the matter.  Two years ago an opportunity to amalgamate with another school presented itself.  If that option had been chosen, the children of that school would have been offered free transport to Goleen national school.</P>
      <P>In view of the Department's decision now to close the school and that the opportunity to amalgamate was not investigated at the time, will the Department ensure that justice is seen to be done and if it is necessary to close the school on 30 June to offer the children concerned free transport to Goleen national school?  This course of action would be in line with the wishes of the parents.  I believe the Department of Education are aware of their wishes but up to the present they have been kept in the dark on future transport plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Goleen, which is my home parish has a history of school closures during the <Col N="2067" /> past four decades.  In the period 1940-50 this parish had eight national schools, both Catholic and Protestant.  Today there are only two national schools left in the parish, one two teacher school in the village of Goleen and, I believe a one teacher school in Lissigriffin from 30 June next.  Goleen parish is the most south-westerly parish in Ireland and the clergy, teachers and parents are fighting to hold on to their identity as a parish.  It is most important that if a school closes within the catchment area of a parish its pupils should be transported by the Department to the nearest school operating in the parish, which in the case of Dunmanus is Goleen national school.</P>
    <P>I wish to ascertain from the Minister if a decision has been made about the transport of the children concerned to Goleen national school in the event of the closure of Dunmanus national school?</P>
    <P>Every parish likes to hold its identity, particularly when it comes to Confirmation day.  When the Bishop comes to officiate at Confirmation he will find that the school population has become so depleted that the pupils have been absorbed into adjoining parishes.  I believe this is the wrong approach.  I hope the Minister has good news for me and that it is proposed to retain the few pupils we have left in my little home parish so that we can ensure that the parish of Goleen can hold its identity in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education of outlining the position in relation to the closure of Dunmanus national school, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as the early seventies, the Department of Education sought to provide a central school in Goleen parish, to include the Dunmanus and Goleen schools initially and Lissigriffin national school at a later stage.  Despite protracted discussions at that time agreement could not be reached on the proposal.  The question of amalgamating Dunmanus national school with Goleen national <Col N="2068" /> school was considered in the Department on a number of occasions.  However, the indications were that such an amalgamation would not be supported locally.</P>
    <P>The enrolment in Dunmanus national school declined to the point where there were only eight pupils on roll in September of 1991 and nine in September 1992, two of whom, I understand, left the school subsequently.  There is apparently no reasonable prospect for a significant improvement in the school's enrolment in the foreseeable future.  An additional factor which has to be taken into account is the fact that the Dunmanus school building is over 100 years old and in need of major refurbishment.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances as outlined above, my Department informed the chairperson of the board of management on 12 November 1992 that grants would be withdrawn from the school with effect from the end of the current school year. In situations like this where a school has an extremely low enrolment the question of an amalgamation with another school does not arise.</P>
    <P>As far as transport is concerned, the Department of Education has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 169,000 primary and post primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  We also have responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for money expended on the provision of this service.  It does not come cheaply in the current year, the nett cost to the State will be some £35.20 million.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, transport entitlement is determined on the basis of the shortest available walking distance to the nearest school.  Much confusion arises because it is assumed that parish boundaries are the determining factor.  Parish boundaries are not relevant for a variety of reasons, mainly because school transport is basically there to enable children with a means of transport to attend an accessible school regularly.  Both in the School Attendance Act and for all practicable purposes, accessibility is determined by walking distance rather than parish or other boundaries such as county boundaries. <Col N="2069" /> It would create a very confusing situation if any criterion except distance was to be used in regulating a transport scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, the children are entitled to B-type transport to Schull national school, because they live in the Lowertown closed school area, which was amalgamated with Schull.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That should not have been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, if their parents opt to send them to Goleen national school, with one exception, the most that can be offered them is concessionary fare-paying transport.  One of the five children involved lives 0.3 miles closer to Goleen than to Schull and would, therefore, qualify for free transport to Goleen national school.</P>
      <P>However, were it decided to ignore Lowertown closed school, and offer A-type transport, the children, with the same exception are closer to Schull.  The relative distances are:</P>

    <P>While there are insufficient numbers to justify the establishment of a separate service for these children, my Department would be prepared to cater for them on an existing service to Schull national school.</P>
    <P>In either case, where the ineligible children opt to go to school in Goleen, they could be granted the fare-paying concession only, subject to the written agreement of the Schull school authorities to their being transported outside the school's catchment area.  I should add that they could be accommodated only when all eligible children had been catered for, and provided that no extra cost was incurred, either by way of a larger bus or an extension of the existing route.</P>

I very much welcome the fact that the Green Paper argues the need to move away from traditional modes of learning &mdash; centred on the acqusition of facts and skills &mdash; towards those which favour the development of creativity, critical thinking, problem solving abilities and individual initiative.  However, the Green Paper virtually ignores the arts in this context and presents science and technology, business-enterprise studies and European languages as the areas most amenable to the achievement of progress in this regard.  Moreover, I am concerned that the Green Paper renders the arts expendable in terms of a framework for the future funding of education.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies who tabled these questions that I have already entered into discussions with the Minister for Education on this subject and that I have available to me submissions from An Chomhairle Ealaíon and individual arts interests on how the proposals in the Green Paper might be improved.  My officials are currently studying these submissions and, following this exercise, I will submit my detailed proposals to the Minister for Education setting out how arts and culture should be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Cathedral at the Rock of Cashel.  I understand that in recent years the Vicars Choral has been restored in order to provide better facilities for visitors and work is proceeding at Cormac's Chapel to restore and protect the very important frescoes there.  Once Cormac's Chapel has been restored, it is proposed to begin a major programme of conservation works to the Cathedral which will take a number of years.  These works will include masonry and plasterwork conservation and restoration of the roof of one of the chapels of the North transept to shelter the box tombs.  There are no plans at present to roof the entire Cathedral.</P>

I view these officers as important elements in the development of the Arts throughout the regions and I fully support the efforts <Col N="2005" /> of An Chomhairle Ealaíon to develop and increase their number.  However, it was in recognition of the fact that progress in extending the network of local authority Arts Officers has been relatively slow that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> states that &ldquo;each local authority will be encouraged to appoint an Arts Officer with requisite staff organised in an Arts Department&rdquo;. I intend to enter into discussions with the Minister for the Environment and An Chomhairle Ealaíon to establish how this commitment can be most effectively implemented.</P>
    <P>As regards the role which local authority Arts Officers can play in promoting artistic endeavours by women, I am prepared to see how best the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women can be implemented for the benefit of women artists.  I will be happy to address the Deputy's specific concerns, as they apply to local authority arts officers, in the context of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The provision in my Department's Vote in respect of grants for regional and country roads in 1993 is £4 million less than the 1992 provision.  This is reflected in the discretionary grants allocated to Meath and other county councils.  The reduction in the overall grants provision was determined having regard to the continuing need for tight controls on public expenditure while simultaneously making available sufficient funds to attract the maximum possible support from EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for road improvement purposes.</P>
      <P>During the four years 1989-1992, discretionary grants totalling some £250 million were provided to county councils to supplement expenditure from their own resources on regional and country roads.  The provision for 1993 represents a substantial level of support and is the maximum possible in the light of current economic circumstances and the funding requirements of national roads.</P>

      <P>Neither the Department of the Marine nor BIM provide grants for the replacement of machinery in the fish processing sector.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine administers the FEOGA Operational Programme for the fish processing sector.  To qualify for assistance under that programme, projects must first receive an enabling grant from a relevant State agency such as the IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta or BIM.  Those agencies' policies in relation to grant aiding projects are governed by legislation relating to industrial policy generally. By and large that legislation precludes grant assistance to projects which do not entail growth in value-added or employment.</P>
      <P>In the light of the foregoing, a special scheme was introduced last year to allow the Department of the Marine to give enabling grants for FEOGA purposes to fish processing firms to upgrade their plant and premises in compliance with the terms of the Community Hygiene Directives.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £75,000 has been made under this heading in the 1993 Estimate for the Department of the Marine. Under this scheme, 22 companies have been selected to date for upgrading assistance totalling £817,000 in FEOGA grant-aid. The resultant total investment will be of the order of £1.8 million and will consolidate an estimated 375 full-time and 376 part-time jobs in the industry.</P>

      <P>The position at the moment is that An Comhairle Ealaíon has a policy of ensuring equal representation for men and women in organisations over which it has direct control.  This policy is rigorously implemented.  The council ensures, in so far as possible, that all panels which assess bursaries and other awards have got a good gender balance. Boards appointed by An Chomhairle Ealaíon are also, in so far as possible, formed with a good gender balance.  I believe that An Comhairle can be justifiably proud of its record in this regard.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of the preparation of a women's arts policy and of gender breakdowns of both grants and expenditure by An Comhairle Ealaíon, I am prepared to enter into discussions with An Chomhairle to see how best the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women can be implemented for the benefit of women artists.  In this connection, An Comhairle will be asked to prepare a three-year co-ordinated plan and I see this mechanism as being a useful forum to explore and respond to the commission's recommendations over time.</P>
      <P>The make-up of sub-committees of An Comhairle from the point of view of gender is determined by the gender balance of An Chomhairle itself.  There are currently only three women out of a total of 17 members on An Comhairle but I can assure the Deputies that I will have regard to the requirements of gender balance when making appointments later this year.</P>

Such a procedure of longer term planning would enable greater co-ordination between capital and current expenditure and also between local and national initiatives and priorities.  I have already met with the members of An Comhairle Ealaíon and I had a useful exchange of views with them on future policy orientations.  I propose to formally request An Comhairle to prepare a co-ordinated three-yearly plan in the near future.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully conscious of the need for strategic and coherent planning in the development of the arts.  Such planning is vital if we are to maximise the benefits accruing from available funding be it sourced from the national lottery or elsewhere.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> makes provision for the following innovative and important planning initiatives:</P>
      <P>The Arts Council will be asked to operate on a co-ordinated three yearly plan for funding of the arts, as part of that planning there will be a requirement for improved co-ordination between capital and current funding of arts projects;</P>
      <P>funding of the arts by local authorities will be on a planned basis;</P>
      <P>local authorities will be required to produce a cultural development plan to guide planned priorities for arts funding;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the regional authorities envisaged in our local government reform plan will <Col N="2026" /> co-ordinate decisions on major items of expenditure e.g. theatres.</P>
    <P>I propose to ensure that these innovative planning initiatives will be implemented in consultation with the relevant Ministers. Moreover, I envisage that, over time, my Department will play an increasingly important co-ordinating and planning role in complementing the activities of the national cultural institutions and relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>Research which has been carried out to date on the level of attendances at hospital accident and emergency departments has resulted in a considerable variation in the reported proportions of inappropriate attenders.

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general <Col N="2031" /> practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines increase according to the person's age.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Due to the higher income guidelines for persons aged over 65, and due to the discretionary powers of the Chief Executive Officers in dealing with individual cases, the percentage of pensioners who hold medical cards is in the region of 82 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have given the matter raised by the Deputy very careful consideration and I would of course be anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  I believe, however, that it is best to rely on the careful consideration of individual cases by the health boards rather than to grant an automatic entitlement to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago, my Department received an application for an extension to this service, which, if allowed, would have resulted in these children being picked up at their homes.  I am advised that the children in question live between 0.1 and 0.9 miles from the current pickup point.  They are, therefore, considered to have a reasonable and adequate standard of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the Primary School Transport Scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live a long distance from school, and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  Because of the cost, a door-to-door service cannot be a feature of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Home pick-ups are not a feature of the Primary School Transport Scheme, because the cost would be prohibitive. The child in question is considered to have a reasonable standard of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The school which the child is currently attending is the nearest to the family home.</P>
