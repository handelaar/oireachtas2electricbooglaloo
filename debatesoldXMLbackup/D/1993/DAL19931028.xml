      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 5.45 p.m.; and (2) the proceedings on No. 6 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 5.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) the opening speeches of the Taoiseach and of the main spokes-persons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; and (iii) a Minister will be called on not later than 5.25 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding 20 minutes.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  During the exchanges in the House last week the Taoiseach, in referring to the motion of no confidence, said the Opposition &ldquo;could have as much time as it liked&rdquo;. Yesterday the Taoiseach proposed that the time be effectively foreshortened by <Col N="274" /> a debate on Northern Ireland, to which we agreed.  I realise a Summit is scheduled for tomorrow but I do not think there is any need to conclude the debate at 5.45 p.m. simply to enable Ministers to be in Brussels tomorrow.  I suggest that the debate should continue until 8 p.m., or 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. this evening, to make up the time lost yesterday at the Government's suggestion.  Obviously we do not want to make it difficult for Ministers to attend the Summit &mdash; even though we will have something to say about their competence in dealing with various matters &mdash; but assurances have already been given by the Taoiseach that adequate time would be available and we do not regard this as sufficient time.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach said that the Whips should meet.  I understand that three of the five Whips wished the debate to be extended to make up for the time lost yesterday.  The Taoiseach said that if the Whips agreed, he would be agreeable also to an extension of the debate.  I am asking the Taoiseach to extend the debate beyond the extra one hour he is prepared to give.</P>

      <P>In the context of the debate we had yesterday, I thought the Taoiseach's jibe and taunt to the Opposition during Question Time about the <Col N="275" /> no confidence motion was especially inappropriate.  If he intends to give us as much time as we want to discuss this motion, an additional one hour this evening to make up for the four and a half hours lost yesterday is not a fair exchange.  At a minimum, the debate should be extended to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am faced with the same problem and dilemma with which I was faced yesterday.  I made it clear yesterday that I did not want to divide the House on the Northern Ireland issue and that the Government felt the developments were so serious and critical that this House should be given an opportunity to express its views on it.  I did not want to force that debate on anybody yesterday &mdash; it could just as easily have been taken today.  I suggested that a two to two and a half hour debate would be sufficient to enable Members to express their views on this issue.  Yesterday I was faced with the dilemma that while some of the Opposition parties were agreeable to that proposal others wanted more time.  There was another item on yesterday's agenda, the European Parliament <Col N="276" /> Elections Bill.  We took that Bill off the agenda in order to allow plenty of time for the debate on Northern Ireland. There was nothing to prevent an extension of the sitting until 10.30 p.m. yesterday to discuss the no confidence motion, but in deference to the wishes of the Opposition I did not propose that. I said last week and I would give the Opposition all the time it wanted to discuss a no confidence motion.  That opportunity was available yesterday but unfortunately it is not available tomorrow due to the Summit.</P>

      <P>I would be quite happy to have a two day debate on this motion. I have extended the debate by an hour, the maximum time which can be given. Surely Deputy Bruton knows that the timescale he has proposed is totally unrealistic given that the Government has to prepare for the Summit.  I know what will be said to me next week if I do not do my job properly.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>Ireland has secured the best and biggest deal of EC Funds we ever got.  Ireland has secured more money per head of population than any other member state. The people of Ireland know well that we now have the single best opportunity we have ever had.  Does this amount to getting it wrong?  Is this a lamentable and shameful performance by the Government? Is a minimum of £7,200 million and the opportunity to draw down up to £7.84 billion by 1999 to be written off as a national setback?  Only the night before last, President Delors stated: &ldquo;I am fully confident that Ireland will be able to fulfil its plan&rdquo;.  He also referred to the quality of the projects and the past performance of the country and conveyed his confidence that Ireland will be able to get additional assistance over and above the indicative allocation decided last week by the Commission over the next six years. If achieving such a magnificent deal for Ireland is the only serious criticism of me and my Government colleagues by the Opposition, then we will gladly wear such criticisms as a badge of honour and distinction.</P>

      <P>I continue to regard the securing of an unprecedented amount of EC funds to back Ireland's £20 billion National Development Plan up to 1999 <Col N="281" /> as an outstanding political achievement, of which I and my colleagues are justly proud.  We will continue to strive for the very maximum amount of EC support, which on past experience we have the capacity to do very successfully.</P>
      <P>Let us look at all the figures, and the facts surrounding these figures, not other people's interpretation of them, the context in which they emerged and the legal basis for them.  The original £6 billion before the Maastricht referendum was not made up, dreamt up or puffed up by me.  It was first mentioned by President Delors as a very feasible Irish target from the new Structural Funds.  It was adopted by me during the referendum campaign and the election campaign.  Should I have gone for anything less?  Had I emerged from Edinburgh declaring a £6 billion result, I would have been a winner, but Ireland would have lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Please listen.  We will not interrupt you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the general supposition, the £8 billion figure referred to after Edinburgh was not based on the automatic retention of a full 13.5 per cent share of the new funds, which would have amounted to significantly more.  It was accepted by everybody, both in Brussels and Edinburgh, that Ireland would have grave difficulty in retaining the 13.5 per cent share of the new funds and I never claimed otherwise.  The £8 billion figure represented what seemed a just and equitable figure, based on new criteria agreed in the Edinburgh conclusions and on conversations with Commission President Jacques Delors and senior EC officials, and represented the distilled wisdom of the Irish delegation.  The conclusions said that full account should be taken, as now, of national prosperity, regional prosperity, population of the regions and the relative severity of structural problems.  At my suggestion the level of unemployment and the needs of rural development were also to be taken <Col N="282" /> into account, so the £8 billion had a clear basis for its make-up.  Again, contrary to general supposition, the Spanish did not get anything specific in writing about allocations of funds beyond general principles.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, we submitted our backup case for the £8 billion figure to the EC Commission, basing it on the criteria laid down in the Edinburgh conclusions and in the framework regulations for the calculation of the allocation.  Allocations per head of population is only one factor in such calculations.  Our case has never been rebutted on an item by item basis to this very day.  Of course, we had in reserve a power of veto underpinning our negotiating position, to protect our national interests and to ensure a fair deal for Ireland.  We pursued at all times a well thought out strategy.  The veto on the framework regulation was removed only on 20 July, when the Tánaiste reached an agreement with President Jacques Delors on a figure that amounted to £7.84 billion.  The veto would not have been removed if the Tánaiste had not been satisfied that a clear agreement had been reached.  With regard to the figure of £8.7 billion mentioned by me on 20 July as a likely draw-down figure, the fact is that it was made up as follows &mdash; £7.84 billion index-linked to 1999 calculated at a very conservatively low inflation figure of 2 per cent per annum for the EC, equals £8.7 billion.  I hope it is clear to this House what the origin and basis for the various figures were.  There was never any question of deceit or trying to mislead anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On any calculation the present figure of up to £7.84 billion is by far the largest sum of EC funds ever negotiated for Ireland.  Between 1973 and 1986 receipts from EC Regional, Social and Agricultural Guidance Funds and one or two other small infrastructure funds amounted to a modest £1.8 billion pounds.  Between 1987 and 1999, a similar period of time, we will have received well over £10 billion.  By any standard of comparison with other disadvantaged countries, we have done extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in Government was able to negotiate fine words in communiqués about convergence.  That was pretty well all they were able to negotiate. Deputy Bruton talks about large theoretical sums he claims we should have been able to obtain which have no political reality, as he well knows.  Perhaps he can tell us what was the largest sum he ever negotiated from the EC.  I have often heard him say that there should be some automatic transfer system in a Federal Europe with a far higher budget.  How successful has he been in negotiating acceptance of this principle among his German Christian Democrat colleagues?  What impression have his arguments made on Chancellor Kohl, for instance, when I know Mr. Kohl thinks the very opposite?  The only noises I hear coming from German Christian Democrats is a proposal to cut small countries out of the European Commission and the Presidency.  Does that demonstrate the extent of Deputy Bruton's influence with his powerful EC allies?  Back in 1988-89 we successfully negotiated for Ireland the first doubling of Structural Funds on foot of the Single <Col N="284" /> European Act.  Exactly the same controversies arose in 1989 as have arisen at this time.  Similar political charges of incompetence, ineptitude and deceit were made by many of the same people. Yet it is recognised universally now that we did outstandingly well, that our development plan was excellent and has made a real impact.</P>

      <P>Our development plan has helped to increase our <i>per capita</i> income as compared to the EC average from 60 per cent of GDP in 1986 to 73 per cent today. We are regarded in Europe as very good performers.  At that time, as Minister for Finance, I oversaw the drawing up of a £9.7 billion plan and led the Irish negotiating team on the allocation of funds. We initially assumed an EC allocation of £3.35 billion towards the plan, but we only obtained a guarantee of close to £2.86 billion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Noonan, from whom we have heard much on this subject during the past few days, made exaggerated assertions then about a shortfall of £700 million and claimed that £1 billion worth of projects would have to be dropped. Those statements in 1989 have a familiar ring to them today.  We heard Deputy Noonan on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; two days ago repeat the same story.  In the end we obtained over £3.4 billion, over £600 million more than we had been guaranteed.  Can anyone seriously claim today that that plan was anything other than a clear success?  That has been confirmed by the EC and by other independent experts.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa at that time claimed that the plan failed at almost every hurdle.  The then Progressive Democrat Leader, Deputy O'Malley, while still in Opposition, spoke about his fears of a waste of funds.  Yet it is quite clear with the benefit of hindsight that the opportunity was not wasted, that the plan did not fail and that Ireland got a very good return.  The parties opposite got it completely wrong the last time.  I am equally certain that they have got it wrong today.</P>
      <P>Another parallel with 1989 is that people told us that our hard bargaining tactics had seriously damaged our relations with the EC Commission.  There were the usual pompous commentaries about mishandled negotiations, misreading the situation in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no goodwill or friendship available from other member states when money is being allocated.  Half the people in this House and some of the commentators outside do not seem to realise that EC negotiations at the best of times are very tough.

      <P>These difficulties must be one of the worst kept political secrets in recent times.  We have had a constant battle over the past 12 months to secure the maximum share of EC funds against continuous noises designed to deter or discourage us from pursuing our just demands, to which we are entitled.  We have refused to allow ourselves to be deflected.  It is entirely appropriate that we put forward a plan that seeks the maximum level of EC funding.  What chance would we have of securing additional funding over and above the guaranteed amount if we did not put forward projects that would be eligible for additional funding?  I cannot understand the Opposition mania for insisting that we set our sights on the minimum available rather than the maximum.</P>

As in the case of the tax amnesty, he had forgotten the Fine Gael policy document published a few years earlier. Incidentally, or perhaps coincidentally, the two contradictory documents were produced by none other than Deputy Yates, calling for a £400 million investment to be spent on the railways under the new plan.</P>

      <P>There has been much talk about fiascos costing the country. Someone in Deputy Bruton's position would be wiser to leave that sort of language alone.  As Minister for Finance he caused the fall of the Government every time he tried to introduce an annual budget.  He proposed to eliminate the current budget deficit in four years but ended up with the highest one on record, he presided over the Dublin Gas debacle <Col N="294" /> which cost the taxpayer £100 million, and his solution to the ICI collapse cost the consumer and the taxpayer another £200 million.

I am thinking of Deputy De Rossa who told us £6 billion would not materialise and accused us of bribing the electorate, of Deputy Cox who, on the eve of Edinburgh, declared we would get only £4.5 billion and of MEP John Cushnahan who on behalf of Fine Gael put our prospects on a number of occasions at between £5 billion and £6 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to summarise for the House once again the positive impact the National Development Plan will have on Ireland.  The availability of resources under EC Structural and Cohesion Funds represents a significant contribution to the Government's long term strategy of creating the conditions for higher sustainable growth in output and employment.  That strategy is consistent with Ireland's commitment to progress towards Economic and Monetary Union under the Maastricht Treaty.  The strategy builds on the course pursued successfully over the period of the first <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, involving fiscal correction, exchange rate stability, incomes moderation based on social consensus and application of available <Col N="296" /> resources to the expansion of key economic sectors.</P>
      <P>The most desirable combination of circumstances would be strong non-inflationary growth in our main external markets with domestic responses orientated towards maintaining competitiveness and achieving the highest sustainable growth in output and employment. This would maximise the long term benefits of the EC Structural and Cohesion Funds.  However, given that we are unlikely to have a trouble-free external environment for the Irish economy, domestic action to enhance the long term gains to the economy from the funds must be accentuated</P>
      <P>The positive effects of the EC Structural and Cohesion Funds on the Irish economy will emerge over two broad phases, the short to medium term, and the medium to long term.  In the first instance, the transfer of resources impacts on demand, as investment is raised by the implementation of programmes under the plan.  These give a valuable boost to output and employment, which is sustainable over the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>The main impact of the funds over the longer term will be to raise and strengthen the competitiveness of the economy by improving conditions of supply.  This will come as the structure of the economy is broadened and strengthened through major infrastructural projects and the upgrading of skills.</P>
      <P>The allocation of substantial resources to extensive training and retraining schemes will address the central problem, the extremely high level of unemployment which is the principal source of exclusion.  The ESF funded programmes will help overcome structural rigidities which inhibit the transition of some sections of the labour force from fulltime education to a first job and from long term unemployment back into the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I believe this debate is totally unwarranted and motivated by frantic Opposition efforts to paint a major achievement as a total disaster, I welcome the opportunity to have this House <Col N="297" /> affirm confidence in the Government.  An immense amount of work has been done. The partnership is working extremely well and achieving results.  We have outperformed most other economies during the current international recession.

      <P>Most of our farmers are enjoying another good year.  Professor Sheehy estimated that the CAP reform package will pump £200 million into Irish agriculture this year and double that amount by 1995.  Average farm income is now at a record high.</P>
      <P>We have introduced a major programme of Dáil reform.  We have made significant progress on the agenda of social and legal reform.  We plan to introduce 32 pieces of legislation this session. A major effort is being made to tackle the country's social problems.</P>

    <P>We have, by universal consent, one of the most comprehensive and ambitious programmes for Government to fulfil, which has given great hope to a great many people.  People want to see that programme carried out in full, and there <Col N="298" /> is every confidence in us that we will carry it out.  It is quite clear that a majority of the electorate support the Government parties.  We both intend to serve out a full term together, and to ensure that the Irish people get the full benefit from the innovative policy programme, of a dynamic Government, dedicated to change and determined to carry through that change, while enjoying the confidence of the people.</P>

      <P>My only comment on the Taoiseach's speech is that he started low and finished still lower.  He did not sound like the sort of person even his most loyal backbencher would want to see representing this country overseas.</P>
      <P>We are having this debate today because all three Opposition parties are united in the view that a Government led by Deputies Reynolds, Spring and Ahern is not good for the country.  We did not come to this view because of the amount of money we are, or are not, getting from Brussels.  By any standard we are getting a large sum.</P>
      <P>The Opposition united to table this motion, because Deputies Reynolds, Spring and Ahern have made this country look foolish.  Their incompetence has turned what should have been a matter of national celebration, into an occasion of international humiliation.  This has happened because neither Deputies Reynolds, Spring nor Ahern has the seriousness that was amply demonstrated in the Taoiseach's speech today the application to detail, or the capacity to analyse problems as other see them, that are necessary for the successful conduct of Irish foreign relations.</P>
      <P>In the speech written for Deputy Spring for the last confidence debate in this House, just a year ago, he said at column 2313 of the Official Report of 5 October 1992:</P>
      <P>For three and a half years this country has needed grown-up, adult politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental charge against Deputy <Col N="299" /> Spring, in his handling of the EC funds issue, is that he has not treated the Irish people as adults who could be told the truth without gloss or optimistic exaggeration.

Now, in his first opportunity to do a real Government job he has made a complete mess of it.</P>
      <P>In proposing a motion of no confidence in this Government I wish to place some facts on the record of this House.  On 12 December, 1992 the Taoiseach, announced at a press conference in Edinburgh that this country was to receive £8 billion Irish pounds of EC Structural Funds over seven years.  That is actually £8.6 billion in present devalued money. He said the money was &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach had his chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He went on a few days later to tell the Dáil that he had &ldquo;an agreement...that Ireland will obtain in excess of £8 billion over seven years&rdquo;. The Taoiseach made this claim despite the fact that he had no such agreement in writing and despite the fact that, had <Col N="300" /> he bothered to read them, he would have seen that the written conclusions of the Edinburgh Summit made it clear that such a secret agreement was impossible. These written conclusions showed that not only had no allocations yet been made but also that when they were made they would be made by the full Commission and on the basis of &ldquo;transparent procedures with objective criteria&rdquo;&mdash; which were specified.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;. These words in the Edinburgh conclusions specifically ruled out the type of unwritten secret agreement the Taoiseach claimed he had with Mr. Delors.  When the Taoiseach said that in Edinburgh he knew that was the case.</P>
      <P>In the months following, the Commission, despite much pressure, refused to confirm the Taoiseach's claim.  Notwithstanding the lack of any confirmation of the Taoiseach's claim, the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties went ahead to agree a programme for Government specifically on the basis of the Taoiseach's supposed £8 billion &mdash; or £8.6 billion in present money &mdash; agreement.  This figure was specifically written into the programme.</P>
      <P>In June, 1993 the EC Regional Commissioner, Bruce Millian, produced proposals indicating that Ireland's share would be only £6.5 billion in post-devaluation Irish pounds &mdash; a cut of £2 billion. In June, 1993, at the Copenhagen Summit the Taoiseach admitted that the £8 billion was now a matter for negotiation. His &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; was beginning to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July the Council of Foreign Ministers met to agree the framework regulation for the Structural Funds.  Ireland threatened to veto this regulation, depriving all proper regions of money, if it did not get the figure the Taoiseach claimed was agreed.  The Tánaiste came out of this meeting, followed a private meeting with Mr. Delors, to say that Ireland would get £7.84 billion.  This was presented by him as a bottom line figure. The Tánaiste said that he was &ldquo;100 per cent certain that that figure will not unravel&rdquo;.  Indeed, he implied Ireland would get even more.  He made that <Col N="301" /> claim, even though he had nothing in writing, even though he knew that the decision was for the whole Commission, not one individual, however exalted, even though he knew the responsible Commissioner was opposed to the proposals, even though he knew the extra funds had to be found from the total budget to cover newly added areas for special aid, like East Germany, Cantabria, the Scottish Highlands, Hainault in Belgium and Valenciennes in France. The Tánaiste claimed that he had a definite figure of £7.84 billion even though the regulations he agreed to at the meeting again specified in writing that the decision would have to be taken later on by the full Commission in a &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; and &ldquo;objective&rdquo; way, with plenty of scope for opposition from other countries.</P>
    <P>Even though he knew all this, the Tánaiste presented an entirely different picture to the Irish people based on an unrecorded discussion, in exactly the same way as the Taoiseach had done after the Edinbourgh Summit.</P>
    <P>On 10 October 1993, the Minister for Finance met Mr. Delors in Brussels.  Mr. Delors has claimed that at that meeting Deputy Ahern requested him to get the Commission to postpone their consideration of the share-out of the Structural Funds until after the debate in this House on the National Development Plan.  Mr. Delors actually did arrange for such a deferral of this business from the meeting of the Commission on 13 October 1993 to that of 21 October.  However Deputy Ahern, on 22 October, tried to tell a reporter that &ldquo;there could have been a misunderstanding&rdquo; between himself and Mr. Delors.</P>
    <P>The next development was that the Government Ministers started to contradict themselves even in the Dáil.  In the Dáil on 20 October the Taoiseach stated categorically that: on the morning of 20 July a specific agreement (another one of these specific agreements) was reached on a figure of £7.84 billion in 1993 prices as Ireland's allocation of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds.  The Taoiseach made no mention of ranges <Col N="302" /> of figures or fourchettes.  He claimed a specific agreement to a specific figure. Yet in the same debate, half an hour later, the Tánaiste referred to what he called indicative figures which would in all likelihood be expressed in ranges or in what the Commission calls <i>fourchettes.</i> The Tánaiste referred to Ireland being &ldquo;on target&rdquo; to achieve a figure.  A &ldquo;target&rdquo; and a &ldquo;specific agreement&rdquo; are two very different things.  Even in the Dáil debate last week, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were contradicting one another.</P>
    <P>The compulsion to contradict themselves even overflowed into this week.  It now transpires that, on Tuesday night in Brussels, the Tánaiste said that he had actually told the Taoiseach more than three weeks ago that the £7.84 billion share for Ireland was uncertain.  Yet, the Tánaiste had allowed the Government to go ahead and publish a plan based on that figure and allowed the Taoiseach to open the debate on the plan by stating that the aid &ldquo;will amount to approximately £8 billion&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste made no attempt to contradict this erroneous statement by the Taoiseach.  He allowed the Dáil to be misled.</P>
    <P>Those are the plain simple facts &mdash; no amount of distraction, waffle, double talk, bluster or indignation of the kind we have heard in this debate can change them.  What reasonable inferences are to be drawn from those facts?</P>
    <P>First, it seems abundantly clear that the Taoiseach at best did not understand or at worst, deliberately mis-stated what had been discussed at Edinburgh in December 1992.  He ignored the written conclusions of the Summit.</P>
    <P>Second, even if one takes that best interpretation from the Taoiseach's point of view, that he misunderstood what was discussed in Edinburgh and genuinely believed there was an agreement to pay £8 billion in Structural Funds to this country, then he was grossly incompetent in not having the terms of such an important agreement reduced to writing before he announced it to all and sundry.</P>
    <P>Third, it is clear that the Tánaiste at <Col N="303" /> best did not understand or, at worst, deliberately mis-stated what had been discussed in Brussels in July 1993.  He, too, ignored the written conclusion of the meeting he had just attended.</P>
    <P>Fourth, if one takes the best interpretation from the Tánaiste's point of view, that he misunderstood what was discussed in Brussels and genuinely believed that there was an agreement to pay £7.84 billion in Structural Funds to this country, then he was grossly incompetent in not having the terms of such an important agreement reduced to writing. This is especially so, when one remembers that all the problems had their starting point in a claimed earlier agreement which had not been put in writing.  One would expect a junior barrister settling his first &ldquo;knock down&rdquo; action out of court in Listowel would ensure that the agreement was in writing.  That common prudence was not applied in this case by the man responsible for Irish foreign relations.</P>

      <P>Fifth, we have not yet heard from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, what it was that he said to Mr. Delors to make him believe that the Minister did not want the final decision on the Structural Funds allocation until after this House had completed its debate on the National Development Plan.  Unless he gives us a clear and convincing account of his discussion with Mr. Delors and explains to us how Mr. Delors took him up incorrectly, the only conclusion one can come to is that he, too, was deliberately seeking to cover up for the incompetence and deception of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, and was thereby implicating himself in their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixth, Ireland's relations with the EC President, who has been accused by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste of not honouring agreements and with the Commission have been strained and, possibly, irretrievably damaged, as long as this <Col N="304" /> Government, with this group of Ministers, continue in office.</P>
    <P>Finally, if it were just a question of incompetence alone the Government might not have faced this confidence motion.  It was the ham-fisted cover up which brought the combined Opposition together to challenge the Government. Quite simply, it comes down to this: at the very time the Government was publishing its plan at an elaborate launch in Dublin Castle, it knew that the financial basis for the plan was unravelling.  This deceit is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>I do not suffer from the delusion that when this House divides on this motion the Government's mighty majority will suddenly evaporate.  We did not propose a motion of no confidence in the Government in the belief that it will be carried. There is, I fear, not enough respect for the people of this country on the Government backbenches for that to happen.  It is, however, important that some voices in this House be raised in protest on behalf of the people of this country. Surely they are entitled to something better than gross incompetence and deception from Ministers.</P>
    <P>Surely, the tireless work of a succession of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, and I include Deputies Andrews, Lenihan and Collins in that description, in developing good professional working relationships with the EC President and the Commission, should not be allowed to be set at nought by the naïve incompetence of Deputies Reynolds, Spring and Ahern.</P>
    <P>These are what should be good days. Mr. Delors and Commissioner Millan have been, and are, our friends.  They have treated this country well both in past and present allocations of Structural Funds.  They deserve our esteem.  They do not deserve either recrimination or false accusation from the three Ministers who have talked themselves into a hole and persist in talking themselves further in every day that passes.</P>
    <P>The same bluster, the same lack of competence and the same lack of trust in people's intelligence characterises the way the Government is handling other business.  It was the same in the way the <Col N="305" /> Government set about drawing up the National Development Plan.  Rather than treat the Irish people as adults, by showing them a full draft plan where all our people could see the hard choices that had to be made, the Government just asked the people, like children, for their wish lists of projects and then made the decisions in secret and sent them off to Brussels before unveiling them in this House.</P>
    <P>Then, having discovered that it is about £1 billion short in funding for that plan, the Government, again decided to act in a way that under-estimated the intelligence of the Irish people.  It pretends it can go on as before, with the same plan and figures even though a big chunk of the money has disappeared.  This is an insult to people's intelligence.  Two and two do not make five.  Against a background of strict Maastricht borrowing limits and the fact that Government spending over the past four years is already increasing twice as fast as national income it is just incredible to pretend that this plan does not need revision and that the missing £1 billion can simply be found by Irish taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The only way that could be done would be by extra taxation.  The Government seems to be suggesting that the Irish people should now pay extra taxes just so that the Government can save its face and go ahead with a plan that the Tánaiste told the Taoiseach three weeks ago was prepared on false pretences in the first place.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, any doubt I had about the necessity for this motion of no confidence was quickly dispelled when I heard the Taoiseach's Martin Luther-like address here this morning.  The Taoiseach reminds me so much of the man that had a dream.  The Taoiseach had a dream that the Coalition was a &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo;; maybe that is why we now call it a partnership. The Taoiseach had a dream that his party would win an overall majority &mdash; that is how he came to power within his party &mdash; and we all know the nightmare that turned out to be.  The Taoiseach also had a dream in Edinburgh that he had £8 billion in a mythical bag and, unfortunately, he is still dreaming here this morning.</P>
      <P>This debate is about judgment, accountability and credibility.  In essence, it is about confidence in this Government. It is not about whether £7.2 billion, £7.8 billion or £8.7 billion is what we deserve or will get from Europe between now and 1999.  All of these figures or any of these figures would represent a successful outcome to the recent negotiations. In the context of the Structural and Cohesion Funds no one ever heard of a <i>fourchette,</i> of a range of monetary aids that might be available to Ireland, and I ask why not.  A decision was taken at the highest political level in this country to conceal what had happened in Edinburgh and what had happened in Brussels.  The House was misled and the people were misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why the Government might not have wished to tell the full truth.  It would have been embarrassing, particularly for the Taoiseach.  The Government would have had to explain how after devaluation the Taoiseach had lost £1,500 million.  In order to avoid the embarrassment for the Taoiseach, members of the Government at the most senior level were prepared to conceal the <Col N="307" /> truth.  They went ahead with the charade of a launch of a national development plan and a showpiece debate in this House without telling us or the people that the financial foundations of that plan were not based on the cast iron commitments the Government had told us about but rather on threadbare aspirations.</P>
    <P>That is the shadow of incompetence and deceit which stalks this Government. The standards of accountability which this House demands of and sets for Government apply in all its dealings, both national and international, and when they are broken it is up to this House, and particularly the people on these benches, to ensure that there is full and effective accountability.</P>
    <P>The fiasco of the Structural Funds did not just arise in the last few weeks.  It goes back to the Edinburgh Summit last December and to the extravagant, misleading and politically self-serving declarations of the Taoiseach.  In the eyes of many people, especially members of his own party, the Taoiseach was on his last outing as head of that party, having suffered a shattering defeat at the hands of the electorate.</P>

      <P>Fighting then for his political survival the Taoiseach sought to cling to Edinburgh as a drowning man to life raft.  At a press conference on 12 December after the Edinburgh Summit the Taoiseach's exaggeration knew no bounds.  It is important to recall the words he used, because words matter, they have a precise meaning; and when those words are used by the Taoiseach they have a precise import and meaning.  One assumes that when the Taoiseach used words he is choosing them carefully.  It is, after all, what we expect from our Head of Government.  To the assembled media corps of journalists who were rather sceptical, given that they knew the view of the other cohesion countries, the Taoiseach said that the Edinburgh <Col N="308" /> Summit was his &ldquo;greatest political achievement&rdquo;.  To the reasoned reservations and questions from the journalists, still very sceptical, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I am absolutely confident.  It's there.  It's in the bag&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Superlative upon superlative was piled on by the Taoiseach. This is where the real deception began.  This is where we have the deepest deception of all.  I want to tell the Taoiseach exactly what he did say because he repeated it here again on 16 December. He said: &ldquo;We have secured over £8,000 million over a seven year period, which represents over £3 million a day for every day of seven years of non-repayable finance&rdquo;. He went on to say: &ldquo;I am absolutely confident.  It's there.  It's in the bag.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach rounded with irritation on a persistent journalist who was not being fooled and who knew what was going on and asked him where it was coming from.  It would be more appropriate if we asked where the Taoiseach was coming from on that occasion and, perhaps more important, where he was going.  The Taoiseach had a date at the Berkeley Court Hotel and within 24 hours he was proferring the mythical £8 billion bag to the Labour Party leader.  He succeeded in seducing <Col N="309" /> the Labour Party leader hook, line and <i>fourchette.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not end there.  I know the Labour Party always find it difficult to resist spending money.  It did not finish at the Berkley Court.  On the following Wednesday, 16 December, the Taoiseach said here in the Dáil: &ldquo;I am happy to inform the House that these contacts [with other heads of Government] together with a firm and carefully calculated strategy and, not least, energetic participation in the Edinburgh meeting itself, have led to what is one of the greatest negotiating successes ever by an Irish Government.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach went on to say: &ldquo;The agreement now reached ensures &mdash; and I say this with complete confidence &mdash; that Ireland will obtain in excess of £8 billion over seven years.  This will comprise up to £1 billion for the new Cohesion Fund and more than £7 billion from the Structural Funds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Note that throughout the Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  By now self-deception had become a grand illusion. It is interesting that the Taoiseach spoke not of possible negotiations, not of a base figure, not of a <i>fourchette,</i> but of an agreement.  There was no false modesty there.  He was raising the bars of his own political credibility to dizzy heights, and we are entitled to use those heights when we judge him today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were warnings from the Commission. Every official who spoke expressed doubts about the Taoiseach's claims.  Even the outgoing Irish Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, quickly made it known that the £8 billion claim of the Taoiseach was overambitious.  All the public and private signals from Brussels cast doubts; but, significantly it was not until the Copenhagen Summit last June that we find the Taoiseach admitting for the first time that there was not an <Col N="310" /> agreement, that it was &ldquo;a matter for negotiation&rdquo; and that he would be lobbying M. Delors at the summit to make sure that Ireland retained a 13.5 per cent share of the Structural Funds.  After the summit on 22 June last the Taoiseach, still blustering, went on to say: &ldquo;I have still not found any argument or feeling or reason to believe that our allocation will be reduced&rdquo;.  By now, of course, the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; had softened to being a &ldquo;matter for negotiation&rdquo;.  Referring to his meeting with President Delors he stated: &ldquo;I told him that the political reality was that no country could be expected to accept a decrease in its allocation&rdquo;.  However, the Taoiseach is today seeking to define the political realities by which we should judge him.</P>
    <P>Within days of the Copenhagen Summit it became clear that all was not well and when the draft regulations from the Edinburgh Summit were published, outlining the proposed allocations of the £65 billion, it was clear that the Irish position was very vulnerable.  The Government spokesperson said &ldquo;We cannot accept the text of the regulations without a clear indication that our allocation will be maintained in line with the understandings of Edinburgh&rdquo;&mdash; not the agreement of Edinburgh but the understandings.</P>
    <P>What did the Government do?  It threatened to veto the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 2 July.  The man who wants to put justice into economics and trust into politics told us he was 100 per cent sure that the figure would not unravel.  After the Copenhagen Summit he again set his sights on the dizzy £8 billion.  The situation got even muckier from then on, with threats of vetoes, blocking the overall funding programme and haranguing officials.  The night of the <i>fourchettes</i> had suddenly arrived, 19 July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste was 100 per cent sure that the figure would not unravel.  Not to be outdone by the <Col N="311" /> Tánaiste, the Taoiseach was back grabbing the headlines at home.  On the lunchtime radio news, &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;, the Taoiseach praised the Tánaiste for his performance and said: &ldquo;This time our base figure is between £7.84 billion and £8 billion, and we will draw down up to £8.7 billion&rdquo;.  Pressed further by the RTE interviewer as to whether the £8.7 billion was guaranteed the Taoiseach boldly stated that there was no doubt whatsoever about what was coming to us.  I note the Taoiseach was not as fond of grabbing the headlines last week and speaking on &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; about what happened.</P>
      <P>In response to the Taoiseach's comments my colleague and predecessor as Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, said that it was a lot of political bluster and that there was no written agreement whatsoever underpinning these unilateral assertions of the Taoiseach.  He said: &ldquo;Aside from the exposure of the Taoiseach's flawed negotiations at Edinburgh last December the confirmation by the Tánaiste that today's agreement is not a written deal is a further cause for concern&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Given the way the much hyped verbal deal at Edinburgh unravelled, what assurance have we now that the Brussels deal will not unravel as well ...&rdquo;.  The only assurance we had was the Tánaiste telling us he was 100 per cent certain.</P>
      <P>It was not only my predecessor who made such a statement.  More importantly, the Regional Affairs Commissioner, Bruce Millan, was still insisting that the money was not there to meet Ireland's demands.  An official commenting on the Irish performance on the night of the long <i>fourchettes</i> said that we adopted a &ldquo;classic smash and grab operation&rdquo;.  He added: &ldquo;We may have burned a lot of bridges on the way, but happily it will be 1999 before the next set of Structural Funds negotiations&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We then had the launch <Col N="312" /> of the National Development Plan on Monday, 11 October last.  We now know that a week earlier, on 4 October, the President of the Commission warned the Tánaiste, who in turn told the Taoiseach, that there were problems in meeting the Irish claims.  The Tánaiste acknowledged that the President of the Commission briefly raised that matter.  He confirmed that again yesterday morning and the Taoiseach this morning acknowledged that he was told this was the case.  If the Government was told a week before it launched the National Development Plan that the money was not there they should not have proceeded with the fiasco and the charade at Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>In a debate in this House on 14 October, nine days after he was informed by the Tánaiste that the money was not there and the plan was in difficulty, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We will receive in all almost £8 billion&rdquo;.  We know that informal requests were made to the President and to Bruce Millan's office to postpone a decision from 13 October to 20 October. The President, Mr. Delors, said of his meeting with the Minister for Finance that the Minister said: &ldquo;say please if you could postpone your decision until the presentation of the Irish plan before the Parliament, I would be very grateful.  I followed his advice and I postponed the decision&rdquo;.  Commissioner Millan's office also stated repeatedly that an informal request had come from the Irish side to postpone that vital meeting.  That is why the meeting did not take place until 20 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next date of significance was last Wednesday, 20 October.  Despite the fact that the matter was unravelling we had a debate in this House in which for the first time we were told by the Taoiseach that: &ldquo;A specific agreement was reached on a figure of £7.84 billion in 1993 prices&rdquo;, on 20 July last.  There was no reference to Edinburgh and the £8 billion in the bag. The Taoiseach also sought in that debate, as he did this morning, to play the patriotic blackmail card.  It is grand to have the partnership when the Government is going well but when it is in difficulty the Opposition is supposed to cover up and <Col N="313" /> play at consensus.  That will not be the attitude of my party and I do not believe it will be the attitude of any other party in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach sought to tell us that the Opposition is undermining the Irish position.  There was no support in Europe and it is amazing and extraordinary that the Government would find succour in this House.  For the first time the fog of political self-delusion and downright deception began to be cleared by the Tánaiste in the same emergency debate.  For the first time the Tánaiste told us about the <i>fourchettes</i>, the range of figures that were available.  This had never been mentioned before, not even by the Taoiseach when he was speaking here about the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>It is very worrying that the Government sought, throughout the debacle of the last few days, to drag in very honourable public servants to back up the Government's false claims, civil servants who could not answer for themselves and could not be questioned in this House.</P>

      <P>What can we make of what has happened?  I know what the Tánaiste would make of it if he was in my position this morning.  I will remind him of what he said on 5 November last, at column 2314 of the Official Report, when referring to the present Taoiseach. He said: &ldquo;This is the Taoiseach who says, over and over again, that the buck stops with him, but who makes every effort he <Col N="314" /> can to ensure that the buck lands in the lap of the civil servants who work for him on behalf of the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is very happy to mention the civil servants, read that part of the Tánaiste's speech last year.  The Tánaiste went on to say in the same debate: &ldquo;This is the Taoiseach who preaches about respect for the institutions of State in this House, but who has lost the ability to conduct himself with dignity in any crisis&rdquo;.  He said at column 2313 of the same debate: &ldquo;This is the Taoiseach who promised open Government, but whose Government fought in the Supreme Court to establish a system of Cabinet secrecy that flies in the face of that promise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Have we had open Government for the past few weeks?  Were questions answered in this House about the debacle?  Where did the Minister for Finance choose to answer questions?  He answered them on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; and on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, not in this House.  In fairness to the Minister he is the only person who recognised that a blunder had been made and at least he appreciates that lessons should be learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Taoiseach? He tells us there are no lessons to be learned.  What is the attitude of the Tánaiste?  He told us yesterday morning he is proud, proud that he did not tell us the truth.  The only things the Tánaiste believes should be changed are the European institutions themselves.  The Minister of State with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the National Development <Col N="315" /> Plan has said there will be no paring back, there will be no changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the greatest indictment of the incompetence of the Government is that it is not prepared to learn any lessons.  The comments of the Regional Affairs Commissioner are worth quoting.  He described the attitude of the Spanish Government as entirely helpful and instructive.  He noted that there had been a great air of realism in some member states, but not in others, in the past few months.  He did not say who the others were, but he did not need to.  He also said that if any lesson must be learned by the Government it must be that: &ldquo;It is always a bit unwise to claim something unless you are absolutely sure that the matter has been formally agreed by the Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will briefly refer to some of the comments made by the Taoiseach this morning. He chastised me for saying we are the laughing stock of Europe.  I stand over that claim.  The people who matter in Europe have no confidence in this Government because of the way it handles matters.</P>

      <P>I want to remind the Taoiseach of what is contained in the Programme for Government under the heading &ldquo;Oireachtas Reform&rdquo;, and I quote:</P>

      <P>I do not believe in any vague promises. I want to give the people here a specific date.  The hospital will start on the morning of the 14th of April, 1993.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Government thought it could still devise some political formula or create some kind of mirage which would cloud what had happened.</P>
      <P>On 5 November the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs told us that he wanted to end &ldquo;the politics of the stroke&rdquo;. If there is anything we have seen lots of during the entire débâcle on the National Development Plan it is the politics of the stroke.  He also said: &ldquo;I am not going to prop up any party or anybody's ego&rdquo;.  I would suggest that standing by the mythical bag in Edinburgh is very much about propping up the ego of the Taoiseach. What has been unmasked during this sorry debacle is a story of incompetence and deception.  The Taoiseach is the most culpable person of all &mdash; he did not just go over the top; he tried to bully, use vetos and get retrospective approval for his famous Edinburgh deal.</P>
      <P>The Government stands indicated even at this early stage in its term of office.  The Government may have a huge majority in this House but the people will decide at the next election who is sovereign.  To stand over my comments in relation to Europe I wish to refer to an article in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> by Cliff Taylor in which he refers to a statement by Colm Larkin, head of the European Commission office in Dublin, on the Government's strategy.  He questioned &ldquo;whether it was a reasonable thing to do to try to nail the Commission down first in Edinburgh, then in July and again now&rdquo;.  He believed this was not a reasonable thing to do.</P>

      <P>I would like the House to bear in mind two epitaphs in the context of my contribution, both of which are taken from formal statements by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  On 10 January last the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said: &ldquo;The face of Irish politics has changed forever&rdquo;.  At the launch of the National Development Plan on 11 October last the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Our aim is no less than the transformation of the country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has blundered into this no confidence motion as a result of <Col N="320" /> the fiasco of the missing EC millions. However, the EC funds debacle is not the first blunder by this grey Cabinet of underachievers.  Seldom in the history of this State has there been such a gap between promise and performance.  The Government's mismanagement of the currency crisis cost the country something in the order of £200 million and threatened jobs, some of which will never be replaced.  A Government committed to tax reform introduced the 1 per cent income levy for most wage earners except the very low paid and then ushered in a tax amnesty for tax cheats, crooks and fiddlers.  Amidst the rhetoric of &ldquo;no privatisation&rdquo; the Government proceeded to sell off the State's remaining stake in Greencore and botched the shares placing.</P>
    <P>The EC funds miscalculation was not the Government's first deception of this House or of the electorate.  The Minister for Social Welfare told us that the infamous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts were being reviewed &mdash; in other words, repealed.  Not satisfied to leave the good news to Woodspeak and unable to resist a catchy line penned for her party's conference, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare told the delegates at the conference that &ldquo;the dirty dozen have gone for a Burton&rdquo;.  She repeated that falsehood during a radio interview the following Sunday and she accused Deputy De Rossa of being a liar, a statement she was obliged to retract when she could not substantiate her claim on the dirty dozen.  The &ldquo;no job losses&rdquo; in Aer Lingus statement suddenly became &ldquo;no compulsory job losses&rdquo; and the determination to preserve a dynamic national carrier is looking more feeble every day.</P>
    <P>This Government, which was supposed to be dedicated to transparency and openness, has ensured that the lid has been kept tightly on the Pandora's box that is Tara Mines.  Meanwhile the ethics in Government legislation, which we were told was the price of Labour participation in office, has become as harmless as the erstwhile left-wingers now tacked on to the Government.  A Government <Col N="321" /> committed to deepening democracy has cancelled the by-elections in Dublin and Mayo.  Above all, the Government is transfixed by the jobs crisis and on Northern Ireland deferential to the point of being immobilised.  It is a Government which has reneged on its pledges so recently made to the electorate, a Government bloated on its own image and majority and complacent in its mediocrity and inaction.  It is now a Government hoisted on its own <i>four-chettes.</i></P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that it is only ten months since the Government declared in its mission statement:</P>
    <P>Our aim is to restore confidence in the democratic process, by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust, and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing that the night of the long <i>fourchettes</i> has done it is to undermine every phrase in that high-minded mission statement.  If the tawdry reality serves to undermine the hubris which surrounds this Government it may have served some purpose.</P>
    <P>According to no less an authority than the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, we should not have been too surprised.  After all, the Government is led by the same Taoiseach about whom Deputy Spring said in this House on 5 November last year:</P>
    <P>This is the Taoiseach who talked about a Government for all the people, but whose policies have been viciously cruel to many thousands of people who live on the margins of our society.  This is the Taoiseach who talks about consensus, but who governs behind closed doors ... this is the Taoiseach who preaches about respect for the institutions of State in this House, but who has lost the ability to conduct himself with dignity in any crisis.  Why should Members be surprised at the fiddling of figures, the tax amnesty for cheats and crooks and the failure to repeal <Col N="322" /> the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts? Is the Tánaiste not in Government, albeit a partnership Government, with the same political party that he suspected on 5 November 1992 had gone so far down the road of blindness to the standards and of blindness to the people they are supposed to represent that it is impossible to see how anyone could support them in the future without seeing them first undergo the most radical transformation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Tánaiste to tell the House precisely when this &ldquo;most radical transformation&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil took place.  In fairness to Fianna Fáil such a charge should not be levelled against it without good cause.  I do not believe that Fianna Fáil is guilty of such a charge.  The only transformation that has taken place in Irish politics since 5 November has been the transformation of the Labour Party.  The spectacle in this House last Thursday of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, baying back at the hounds in defence of his Taoiseach confirms that transformation, although it was as surprising as Minister Quinn's ostentatious handshake was predictable.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is more or less the same as it has always been.  Mr de Valera and Fianna Fáil were born with a <i>fourchette</i> rather than a silver spoon in their mouths. Its ability to duck and weave has served Fianna Fáil, if not the country, well.  For Fianna Fáil, politics is about power and how to use it.  There are no core values, no principles that cannot be tailored to accommodate that imperative.  A share of power is better than no power and &ldquo;sure things might get better&rdquo;.  An awkward social issue that is at the bottom of the agenda today might very well have to be legislated for next week.  They might say: &ldquo;We are totally opposed to it ourselves, of course, but the other crowd are pushing us into it; Who in their right minds would expect us to give up all of this in order to take a stand that few would understand and fewer still remember, especially with headage payments being so high?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When one is talking about billions of <Col N="323" /> ECUs at 1992 prices, how important is £640 million?  What would one do with £640 million?  Five Tallaght hospitals, three Aer Lingus rescues, one full year of the Exchequer borrowing requirement or God knows how many leaflet drops for Séamus Brennan.</P>

      <P>About the same time that Deputy Spring, walking alone on Banna Strand, detected this &ldquo;radical transformation of Fianna Fáil, the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, was in Edinburgh doing what he knows best &mdash; pulling a stroke, in fact pulling the stroke of his political lifetime.  Not a man to be diverted by uneven numbers, he telephoned from Edinburgh and said, &ldquo;the £8 billion is in the bag&rdquo;.  He asked Deputy Spring if he would like to help him spend it and the rest, as they say, is history.</P>
      <P>Left to their own devices the truth need never have come out.  Who will remember detailed figures half way through the National Development Plan?  Unfortunately for the negotiators, the Irish Government was not left to its own devices.  The unelected bureaucrats of the EC Commission do their business with more transparency than the elected partnership Government which is, in its own words, dedicated to &ldquo;greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not even during life under Kinsealy did we experience such a breathtaking stroke.  A Taoiseach, mauled and bruised in the general election campaign, was limping towards the exit door of Irish politics when he discovered the pot of gold at the end of the Brussels rainbow. &ldquo;The £8 billion is in the bag&rdquo; he proclaimed, no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.  It was a dowry the Labour Party could not resist. He would send the Tánaiste to make the <Col N="324" /> pick-up.  Was not Deputy Spring in the Socialist International with Monsieur Delors?  Brother Dick and Frére Jacques would do the sums.  The Tánaiste was very precise; he landed £7.84 billion and as the Irish people rose for work or the dole office on 21 July he told them on RTE radio:</P>
    <P>I have to say I am satisfied with the guarantees and the assurances that we have received.  I am quite satisfied from the assurances given by the President of the Commission that we will realise that figure.  I am 100 per cent certain that that figure will not unravel.</P>
    <P>Brother Dick has found out that Frére Jacques did not conduct himself as one good socialist could reasonably expect from another.  Monsieur Delors denies any such guarantees.  He ducks and weaves and speaks with forked tongue and saves his own political skin &mdash; in short, Frére Jacques is really more like Fianna Fáil.  Meanwhile, the Tánaiste's well-tailored posterior is well and truly out the window of Iveagh House.</P>
    <P>If this House accepts that our Foreign Minister was duped by this Fianna Fáilstyled Frenchman, the question remains; why did Deputy Spring persist in his error?  Why did Deputy Spring, once he learned that the figures were unsound, not come into this House and put the facts as we know them before the Members of this House?  More seriously, why did the Tánaiste participate in the launch of a national development plan that he knew to be fraudulently contructed?  As recently as Wednesday, 20 October, why did the Tánaiste come before this House confirming he had &ldquo;an agreement&rdquo; on behalf of the Irish Government with President Delors and that he had &ldquo;every confidence that that agreement will be honoured in full&rdquo;?  Why was 20 October the first occasion that this House heard about &ldquo;indicative figures&rdquo; and about the Commission's infamous &ldquo;fourchettes&rdquo;? What is the figure which the Tánaiste would now have us believe he is confident will &ldquo;be honoured in full&rdquo;?  On 20 October he told this House: <Col N="325" /> The figure of 9.35 billion ECU in 1992 prices translates into 9.7 billion ECU in 1993 prices, and into £7.84 billion.  That is the figure that I announced at the conclusion of those negotiations.  That figure has never been publicly challenged from that day to this.</P>
    <P>That last sentence is classic Fianna Fáil speak.  The £7.84 billion has &ldquo;never been publicly challenged&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste knew as he delivered that speech that that figure was being very much challenged in the corridors of the Berlaymont.  It was misleading to allow the inference that the figure was not being challenged.  One may as well claim that there never was such a challenge to that figure, á la Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter of acute disappointment for all those thousands of first time Labour Party voters that their Sir Galahad now speaks with the forked tongue of Fianna Fáil.  The high minded rhetoric of the Concert Hall, promising that &ldquo;the face of Irish politics has changed for ever&rdquo; is now but a distant memory.  It is a case of the more things change, the more they stay the same.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was a case of hope springs eternal.  Perhaps Deputy Spring genuinely believed that the Labour Party could socialise Fianna Fáil and transform that lumbering Civil War relic into a modern democratic entity.  Perhaps the Tánaiste contemplated enrolling the entire Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party in the Tom Johnson Foundation and arranging for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to give some classes on social democracy.  Perhaps it was simply that the pragmatic tendency within the Labour Party, led by the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Health, won out.  Whatever the explanation, we are stuck with a Government which commands the largest majority in the history of the State and is comprised of two parties which, by the end of its term, will seem indistinguishable from each other.</P>
    <P>For the man and woman in the street, what distinguishes this Fianna <Col N="326" /> Fáil/Coalition from its predecessor, the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition? Tens of thousands of people voted for something called &ldquo;change&rdquo;.  What have they got for their votes?  Certainly they have not got a job if they were unemployed last January; they have not got tax reform if they are taxpayers; they have not had their social welfare benefits reinstated if they had been disadvantaged by the McCreevy dirty dozen cuts and there are now more of them on the housing list.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus remains on a life-support machine.  The recommendations of the Culliton report have been fudged.  The sale of State assets for short term budgetary considerations continues apace and access to the courts, to health care, to public transport are just as difficult for the poor and disadvantaged.  Indeed, the very fact that this debate is taking place today is an acknowledgement that the promise of greater openness has been set aside.  We are not permitted to explore whether improper considerations informed public policy on mining.</P>
    <P>So the question can properly be asked: what has changed?  There is none of the friction, we are told, in this Government that characterised relations between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Far from being a cause for pride, the absence of tension between two parties who claimed before the election to be so essentially different is evidence only of the smug complacency and the extent to which the Fianna Fáil embrace has smothered the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In his attack in November last on the Taoiseach, the present Tánaiste accused the Government of cheapening and debasing one of the highest callings there is and of dishonouring those who serve the public in political life.  If the Taoiseach's performance merited such an assessment in November last, one might well ask how his performance has changed since then.</P>
    <P>In December, 1992 the Taoiseach went to Edinburgh and claimed to have £8 billion in the bag.  According to the Brussels correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> this was a figure he based on the assumption <Col N="327" /> that Ireland would retain its existing 13.5 per cent share of the Structural Funds. We now know that the figure which the Tánaiste thought he had secured seven months later in July actually constituted an 11.5 per cent share of the Structural Funds.  Undaunted, the Taoiseach was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 July last as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds maintained that, following 20 hours of negotiations by the Tánaiste, Mr. Spring, in Brussels, the base figure of £7.84 billion to £8 billion would translate into a conservative estimate of £8.7 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds for Ireland between 1994 and 1999.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was using his own <i>four-chette</i> here, introducing ranges for the first time of £7.84 billion to £8 billion while, at the same time, talking miraculously about a base figure and adding in the devaluation factor to translate it back into Irish punts.  Blithely, the Cabinet proceeded on 21 July last, to dish out the £8.7 billion, with £3.7 billion from Irish Exchequer funds under the additionality principle.</P>
    <P>After the Taoiseach had been told the deal had unravelled, he came into this House on 20 October and asserted, &ldquo;On the morning of 20 July a specific agreement was reached on a figure of £7.84 billion in 1993 prices.&rdquo;  Monsieur Jacques Delors says there was no such agreement. Not even the Tánaiste asserts that there was such an agreement.  All he said was that he had an understanding that indicative figures, in all likelihood, would be expressed in ranges, or in what the Commission calls <i>fourchettes</i>.  The Taoiseach ploughed on irrespective.  In a way, he had no choice.  More than a week earlier he had launched his Government's National Development Plan, knowing before the launch that the figures were unreal.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are now implicated in promising to transforms the country with money they both knew they did not have.  Who else in this grey Cabinet of under-achievers knew <Col N="328" /> that the the plan was phoney?  Clearly, the Minister for Finance knew, as did the Minister of State, the self-styled Minister for £8 billion, Deputy Ethne Fitzgerald. Did the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State go further, as has been claimed, and seek the co-operation of Monsieur Delors in postponing the night of the long <i>fourchettes</i> so that they could launch the Government's phoney plan before the cat got out of the bag?  Were they dispatched as emissaries by the Taoiseach or as a result of a Government decision?</P>
    <P>When did the remainder of the Cabinet become aware that the Taoiseach's £8.7 billion had become £7.2 billion, while all the time not a word to the Members of this House?  The first this House heard of indicative figures or <i>fourchettes</i> was on 20 October when the Cabinet recognised that the lid could not be kept on any longer.  When I heard Senator Michael O'Kennedy speak in another House about non-paper documents I thought that, if that is the kind of cavalry this Government must send for, they are really in trouble.</P>
    <P>The House has been deceived.  Critical information about the biggest ever investment programme in the history of this State has been concealed from Members' scrutiny.  A National Development Plan has been fraudulently constructed and sold to the public with the abandon of a down-at-heel, second hard car salesman.  Once again, an Irish Government has disgraced itself.  This time the Labour Party is part of the Government but no one shouted stop.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Green Party Deputy and Member for Dublin North I feel obliged initially to voice the feelings of people in my constituency.  Their perception certainly is one of gloom, indeed anger, when one sees the various problems which appear to have been accentuated since the general election.  For example, there springs <Col N="329" /> to mind redundancies in Aer Lingus, cutbacks and closures of industries.  I understand that next week more earth-shattering news will emerge on that front. In addition, the decimation of horticulture seems to have received less than adequate attention and a highly unreliable, 32-year-old railway system endeavours to render life normal. Responsibility for outlandish re-zoning decisions must also fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government, given that many of the worst were proposed and pushed through by Fianna Fáil with help from some Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat councillors.  In addition, the prolonged problems of the lack of treatment of raw sewage, the decline of small harbours and a very low rates support grant &mdash; becoming ever lower in the case of Dublin County Council &mdash; all render local circumstances particularly difficult.  The deplorable record of this Government on issues pertinent to my constituency becomes all the more serious when one looks at the national scenario.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government going with its collective might, its huge majority?  Is it really a case of all brawn and no brains? On the one hand unemployment is claimed, rightly, to be our biggest problem while, at the same time, the Government pursues policies which encourage redundancies and, worst still, exports money, thereby forcing more people to purchase foreign-produced cars and other goods. Most of our energy seems to be devoted to an enlarged roads network.  The lack of adequate support for horticulture in the production of early crops means that imported food often is the only choice available to our consumers.  This highlights the lack of any energy policy.  It also highlights the fact that this Government appears to be more interested in importing foreign energy in the form of coal and oil while using up our finite supplies of gas and peat as quickly as possible than exploring the options of providing much greater employment through a long overdue domestic commercial and industrial energy conservation programme, and research into renewable energy sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> One example is the Bellacorick wind farm in County Mayo which stands out from a public relations point of view as a fine example of indigenous industry.  I should draw Members' attention to the fact that Danish employment has been enhanced by the Bellacorick wind farm to the tune of 85 jobs.  I understand from the Danish company involved that an additional 35 employees were deployed in the erection of that wind farm.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government's job is to support the Danish economy more than ours but that would appear to be the case.  Less than half a maintenance job has been created in Ireland at that wind farm when a problem arises.  Time does not permit me to spell out all the various examples but I suggest we look to short rotation forestry, rape seed, biodiesel, solar, hydro and wave power &mdash; all our potential resources &mdash; as the big employers to bring employment to the most depressed area of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me by State companies outside this country that without State commitment to indigenous energy supplies no company will trust the market here because State policy is required to ensure some guarantee for their investment. Where is State commitment to Irish industry?  Following the Maastricht Treaty, which is coming home to roost now as we squabble about the money, where is State commitment to Irish industry? In my consituency the Army is tendering out orders for badges to a London company.  It took some very vigilant people in Dublin north to point out that the order was not placed with a London company but with a company in Asia. The Army was selling out on an Irish company, causing redundancies, and instead buying its badges from Asia.  That shows a lack of vigilance on the part of the authorities here.</P>
    <P>The tax system, about which little is done, still allows individual landowners to make immense profits from rezoning. Is this the best the Government can do to assist farmers who say they no longer want to farm their land?  They ensure that their profits from rezoning are maximised. <Col N="331" /> Meanwhile the argument is made that we cannot have an energy tax here just yet but I believe we have to.  After all, what is being taxed is mainly imported energy.  Surely a tax would not just save on imports by encouraging more energy efficiency but the false perception would be turned around that an energy tax would ensure we could reduce tax on labour.  That is what we should be aiming for.</P>
    <P>On what basis can the Government say that openness is a factor in its regime? This confidence motion was sparked off by the golden handshake which has since been found not to be gold but to be a base metal that has rusted to a lesser value.  For the life of me I cannot understand why an agreement of this magnitude cannot have some written commitment. No writing means no guarantee.  Any salesman who came back to the office without a written agreement, arguing there was a guarantee, would not be promoted and would probably face the prospect of redundancy.  Why should this Government be subject to different treatment when it is supposedly made up of some socialists?  I thought socialism was about treating people equally.</P>

      <P>The debate today takes place on a rather artificial basis. The Opposition's declarations of no confidence in the Government essentially stem from complete lack of ability on the part of the Opposition to recognise what has actually been achieved in relation to the next round of Structural Funds, rather than on an accurate and clear picture.</P>
      <P>I know that some people in the newspapers have to keep finding angles for stories.  I realise that Opposition Deputies have to make capital wherever they can find it &mdash; especially when it is so obvious that they are incapable of initiating anything of their own.  But I intend to address the issues raised in as matter-of-fact a way as I can, because I honestly believe that we really have more important work to do in this House.</P>

      <Col N="332" /> I do, however, believe that I must begin by dealing with the two central issues that form the basis of the Opposition's attack in relation to Structural Funds, the issues of competence and integrity.  When we exchanged statements on the subject of the allocation of the Structural Funds from 1994 to 1999 on Wednesday last week, I made it clear that the National Plan would be implemented in full.  I stand over that statement.</P>
    <P>I have twice discussed the situation with the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, since I last spoke on the issue in the House.  As recently as Tuesday of this week, the President said on television that he was confident that the proposals in the plan can be fully realised.  That is the real question which we must address.  Can the plan be implemented?  Can the ambitious targets which it sets be fulfilled?  Can we use resources from the European Communities to bring hope to the many thousands who are unemployed and otherwise deprived in this country?  I say that we can.  The Government will ensure that the plan is fully implemented over the period to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Past experience shows that by presenting high quality projects Ireland is able to draw down funding very effectively. This was the case under the programme for 1989 to 1993 and it will be the case again.  The mid-term review promised by Commissioner Millan will help to ensure that the quality of the programmes is recognised and funded accordingly.  We must face the fact that our task now is to ensure that the plan is fully funded by the Community over the rest of this decade. By looking to the future we can, and will, achieve our aims.  I have no time for recriminations.  My energies, and those of the Government, must be concentrated on giving full effect to the plan. The unemployed and the deprived in our society will not settle for less.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have raised the question of how our share of the funds was negotiated over the last ten months. I invested the maximum effort in getting the best deal possible for Ireland, as did <Col N="333" /> the Taoiseach and the other Ministers involved.  The first three months of the year were taken up with the establishment of a Cohesion Fund.  This fund was put in place well in advance of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty which provides for its establishment.  It is now operating and contributing to Ireland's development.  The Commission then made its proposals for the Structural Funds regulations.  The regulations provide for greater flexibility in the operation of the funds.  They also provide higher rates of Community financing for projects in Ireland.  These changes will make the funds easier to operate and more effective than in the past.  They represent a very significant advance on the previous situation &mdash; one which is of considerable importance to Ireland, as a major beneficiary.</P>
    <P>We played a considerable part in May and June in the drafting of the regulations. The funds regulations, adopted on 20 July, do not contain figures for the amounts to be allocated to the member states.  However, all member states made the adoption of the regulations conditional on agreement being reached with the Commission which would give an indication of what a member state could expect to receive from the funds for the rest of this decade.</P>
    <P>Without these indications, it would not be possible for member states to draw up national plans or to be ready to embark on negotiations with the Commission on the Community support framework.  I regarded the settlement of the amounts as my paramount objective.  This involved bilateral contacts with members of the Commission, President Delors and Commissioner Millan.</P>
    <P>On 2 July I blocked agreement on the draft regulations because the amounts being suggested in my bilateral contacts with the Commission were not satisfactory. They fell well short of what we expected in the light of the agreement on the overall level of funding for 1993 to 1999 reached at Edinburgh in December 1992.</P>
    <P>Between that Council and the Council on 19-20 July there were intensive contacts <Col N="334" /> between the Government and the Commission in an effort to find a basis for agreement.  We received assurances that the Commission would address our concerns.  Against this background I lifted our reserve on the draft regulations going to the European Parliament, while maintaining our reserve on their final adoption at the 20 July Council.  The atmosphere at the Council on 20 July was very tense.  All member states &mdash; and not just the Cohesion countries &mdash; were determined to get the best possible deal. No delegation &mdash; not least my delegation &mdash; offered any apologies for this approach.  Formal sessions were relatively brief and most of the time was taken up with bilateral meetings between the member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>I held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Millan, President Delors, who arrived late at the Council, and with Foreign Minister Claes who presided. Although Commissioner Millan left the meeting before its conclusion, that was not, as far as I am aware, because of any disagreement with the Irish delegation. At all of these meetings and during the formal sessions I made it perfectly clear that I had to have an agreement which would accord with our understanding of Edinburgh.  No one &mdash; the Presidency, the Commission or our partners &mdash; could have been in any doubt as to our bottom line.  I was prepared to block the adoption of the frame work regulation and thus the package as a whole.  I was fully entitled to do this as unanimity was a legal requirement for its adoption.  It was against this background that the Irish delegation held its bilateral contacts with President Delors and Commission officials.</P>
    <P>After a night of negotiation these contacts resulted in an agreement, made between President Delors and me in the presence of senior officials from both sides, that Ireland would get £7.84 billion over the period 1993 to 1999.  And lest anyone think that in referring to senior officials I am seeking to hide behind them, I am not.  I am utterly confident in my own recollections of what transpired, and I find it odious in the extreme that <Col N="335" /> some Members of the Opposition should choose to make innuendoes about any of the people who were present on the night.</P>
    <P>From very early in the night it was accepted that we would be capable of achieving the maximum of any agreed range because of the quality of our programmes and on the basis of past experience, given that we exceeded our indicative allocation between 1989 and 1993 by about 25 per cent.  It was for that reason that all the negotiations throughout the night were concerned only with determining what the maximum of the range would be.  In none of the discussions that we had were we concerned about any other point on the range.  I believe then, and I still do, that the figure of £7.84 billion, once arrived at, was the figure that we would ultimately get. Other member states also reached agreements with the Commission on 20 July &mdash; agreements over which, in some cases, there has since been controversy.</P>
    <P>All the agreements reached on the night were verbal, and Ireland expected, as we had a right to, that the Commission decision would accord with the 20 July agreement.  In the period between 20 July and the beginning of this month we were aware that work was proceeding within the Commission on indicative allocations from the Structural Funds.  The first signal which I received of difficulty came during a brief conversation which I had, on his initiative, with President Delors in Luxembourg on 4 October.  All I learned from that conversation was that President Delors, whose responsibility it was to deliver on the 20 July agreement, was having difficulty in achieving the figure of £7.84 billion.  I left the President in no doubt as to my belief that he should deliver.  His expression of concern did not, and could not, justify altering the National Development Plan or our negotiating stance for the Community Support Framework to be agreed with the Commission on the basis of the plan.</P>
    <P>I doubt if Deputies would expect any Irish Government to back away from the agreement which was reached on 20 July <Col N="336" /> or to scale down our expectations in advance of the Commission's discussions on the distribution of the funds.  In the meantime, of course, the Government here was working intensively on the preparation of the plan itself over many weeks.  I have been intensively involved in that process myself.  At all times the Commission would have been aware that the plan ultimately submitted would be based on the commitment to £7.84 billion. At no stage did the Commission ever indicate to us that they would be unable to accept such a plan.  On the contrary, they have praised its qualities very fulsomely.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last, in a statement to the House, I outlined my position.  I have total confidence that the National Development Plan will be honoured.  The fact that when it met on 21 October the Commission did not allocate an indicative figure for Ireland in line with the amount of £7.84 billion is disappointing. However, as President Delors pointed out on Tuesday, there is every prospect that, in the ultimate, we will attain that figure.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that hindsight is much better vision.  I accept too that I could have saved myself some personal difficulty by introducing the word <i>fourchette</i> into our political language earlier.  But I say this to the House, and I say it as one who believes that personal integrity is the quality that those who vote for us are most entitled to expect &mdash; I would not, and did not, knowingly mislead the House or the public.</P>
    <P>I was satisfied on the night, and remain satisfied, that we were negotiating about a single figure, the figure that we would be entitled to expect.  If I believed that we had arrived at a conclusion that would leave us entitled to expect any figure in a range from A to B, I would have said so. But if I had believed that, I would not have agreed to lift our reserve.  This House is entitled to expect the truth and, as far as I am concerned, this House will always get the truth from me.</P>
    <P>I do not see this debate over the amount of Structural Funds in terms of abstract accounting.  The funds offer the <Col N="337" /> Community a clear opportunity to make a real impact on unemployment, poverty and deprivation in this country for the rest of this century.  The Irish Government has to maximise its share of Community development funding.  This was done with the Regional Fund in 1975 and again under the Delors I Plan in 1989. We owe it to those who can benefit and whose lives can be improved to seek the maximum.  Reducing unemployment has to be the Community's priority.  We will be making that point again at the European Council on Friday.</P>
    <P>That European Council has been called to make the final ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  It takes place after a long and difficult period during which it became very clear that the European electorates expected much more from their Governments than an agenda for institutional change.  Their demands for action on immediate practical issues, such as unemployment, have to be heard. There are elements of the Maastricht agenda which respond to the citizens' concerns &mdash; the new chapter on education, for example.  We must devise an agenda for the future based on these practical elements of the Treaty and respond to the expectations of our citizens. We should not become bogged down in a sterile debate on institutional reform of the European Union.  We should certainly not take up the suggestion made by some that the balance between the big member states and the small member states be changed when there is no demonstrable need to do so.</P>
    <P>I want a European Council and a European Union which is judged on its contribution to reviving growth and confidence.  I do not want a European Council which produces acrimony among the member states over the rotation of Presidencies, or the size of a blocking minority, or whether there are too many Commissioners.  Public opinion would have little respect for such an outcome.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say this.  This is a Government which has already wrought fundamental change in many of our laws and institutions.  It is a Government committed to a programme in <Col N="338" /> which one of the central figures will be accountability in public life.  Ahead of us lies major legislative change in the area of ethics, for example, and in the area of electoral reform and freedom of information. By the time those Bills have passed, and by the time our political culture absorbs and responds to them, it will be clear that this Government is one that will leave behind a legacy of accountability. It is time that we stopped running ourselves down.  In the institutions of Europe, the countries which are prepared to fight hard and fair for what they believe in and to secure a fair share of resources to address real problems, are respected, not derided.  It is time we recognised that and stopped knocking ourselves.  We have a job to do now, to ensure that we deserve the full £7.84 billion through the quality of our work, and to spend it wisely.  I say we should get on with it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Like many fellow citizens I had hoped when this Government was founded that it would be a good Government.  It certainly looked as if it would have the numbers to deliver the change it had advocated when it was elected.  There were other reasons for the hopes of voters being raised.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, had been good in Opposition.  He had laid down the principles for open, honest and ethical Government.  I thought he would have delivered in Government.  Another reason for hope was that many of the Fianna Fáil Ministers, even though they had served for a long time in this House, had little opportunity to express themselves in Government. They were only there for nine months in effect and it looked as if they also could make a major contribution.  I thought this Government would be competent, effective, ethical and open and free from the nod and wink style of the previous administration.  I thought it would be a departure from the Haughey legacy and we could look forward with hope to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I was never taken in, however, by the attributes of the present Taoiseach.  We must remember that he was ruthless enough to get rid of Mr. Haughey as well as getting Deputy O'Malley and his party out of Government and cunning enough after the Edinburgh Summit to entangle the Labour Party in his web.  I was never taken in by his &ldquo;softly softly, catches monkey&rdquo; approach or his one page style. I am not taken in by it now either; but I think the Tánaiste, who has now left the House, would be well advised to equip himself with a long spoon for his future dealings with the present Taoiseach.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Whatever about his outward demeanour, the present Taoiseach is a tough ticket, as tough as you are likely to find in Irish politics.  So nobody should be fooled.  I thought the Tánaiste went into Government with his eyes open.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the performance. All the fine principles enunciated during its three years in Opposition to the last Government seem to have been forgotten as soon as the Government was formed. The early weeks of the Government was epitomised by a rampant deluge of patronage and nepotism, led by the Labour Party, against every principle enunciated in Opposition.  The first weeks in Government were dominated by daily announcements in the newspapers of such a relation, friend or supporter being appointed to some level of the Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expected an open Government where according to the Taoiseach, the light would be allowed in.  However, at the beef tribunal the person who made most allegations in the House could not repeat them on the basis that he did not want to reveal his sources.  I made no allegation in that regard in this House, but on the day I gave evidence at the tribunal I cast more light on events than the Tánaiste bearing in mind all his allegations. We are not getting open government, <Col N="340" /> we are back to the old nod and wink type of Administration which was typical of Fianna Fáil and seemed to be at variance with the stated positions of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It is curious that so soon after the formation of the Government Fianna Fáil and Labour Ministers have become almost indistinguishable.  There are variations in tone and mood, of course, but the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is the classic example because people are not sure to which party he belongs.  Deputy Quinn's style of approach to Government is very Fianna Fáil.  Deputies may recall that one of Julius Caesar's opponents said &ldquo;he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus&rdquo; and those words remind me of Deputy Quinn.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Programme for Government gave some reason for hope also.  There are many objectives in that programme which we all welcome and that was evident in the House not dividing on many issues in that programme.  However, in a curious way it is drowned by its own minutiae and while we could all support many of its interesting details it lacks a general thrust to address the key problems of Irish society.</P>
      <P>That is particularly true in the area of economics, but we should not be amazed at that because the Labour Party in Opposition did not develop an independent economic policy.  The traditional Labour Party strategy of pointing to some fashionable East European model disappeared as soon as the Berlin Wall came down.  It did not take any stand on economic policy and it was inevitable that the economic position of the Labour Party would become absorbed into the Fianna Fáil position as soon as the Government was formed.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic policy this Government is indistinguishable from the identity of the previous Government. That is very pecular because the partners on the last occasion, the Progressive Democrats, were supposed to be a right wing party and the partners on this occasion are supposed to be a left wing party and have far greater numbers.  The number increased from four to 33, yet economic policy is running along the same lines with the same objectives and is singularly failing to address the main problems of this country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fine <Col N="342" /> Gael's economic policy is not relevant at present because we are not in Government, but what the Labour Party stands for is extremely relevant because every time it makes a decision it sentences more people on to the live register.  We look forward to events affecting the Deputy's constituency when a decision is taken in respect of Aer Lingus in a few weeks' time.</P>
      <P>This Government has made no attempt to address the main problems facing the country, particularly the large numbers on the live register and the continuing emigration, which is running at 17,000 or 18,000 a year.  That may be some consolation for the Government, but it is not an economic strategy.</P>
      <P>Expectations were raised also in regard to Dáil reform, but any honest Deputy will admit that the approach to the committee system has been devious and dishonest. Rather than opening up the House and making it more relevant the committee system is a deliberate attempt to bury debate, to take contentious issues off the floor of the House and bury them away from the light of day and media attention.  The way the committees are operating at present is a hindrance to parliamentary democracy.  That would be acceptable if it happened by accident, but it is a deliberate policy on behalf of the Government.  For example, the Government referred the Glackin report to a committee which did not have the power to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Because the Government had such a large majority and proposed to deal with the problems of this country, all men and women of goodwill were prepared to give it a chance; but that optimism is gone. I am disappointed in the Government, particularly in the Labour Party, because it is making no significant input apart from the area of social reform, about which there is almost unanimous agreement in this House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy <Col N="343" /> Broughan is starting to talk like a Fianna Fáil man.  The Government is all about piggy-bank money and how it is spent, lashing it into projects and massaging the electorate with £1 million here and £1 million there; but there is no attempt to address the fundamental problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>That débâcle has triggered today's confidence motion, but apart from that narrow issue there are wider reasons why an Opposition would lose confidence in this Government.  I am making out the ground for the Government.  It can expect future attacks on that ground because it is not performing well in a wide range of areas.  The Labour Party's identity has been totally merged with Fianna Fáil and it will face problems as it proceeds.</P>
      <P>The narrow issue we are debating today involves the three main players in Government &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.  It goes to the foundation of the Government because this is the dowry on which the Government was founded.  This is the money which the Taoiseach waved in the air when he returned from Edinburgh and which attracted the Labour Party. The Government was dishonest from the start.</P>
      <P>The then Commissioner, Ray Mac-Sharry, signalled clearly, both on and off the record in December, that the totality of commitments to individual Governments in Edinburgh exceeded the amount of money available and that Ireland would not receive what the Taoiseach claimed it would.  Bruce Millan and his <i>Cabinet</i> stated throughout the spring and summer that the money was not available and that there would be a significant shortfall in Ireland's share. Nevertheless, throughout the spring, summer and autumn a plan was drawn up based on figures which turned out to be fraudulent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste in his wisdom decided to get entangled in the web woven by the Taoiseach on 20 July at the meeting of the Commission.  I do not know whether <Col N="344" /> people in this House have questioned the veracity of the Tánaiste.  In his speech he claims he speaks the truth, and I accept his veracity, but he was outmanoeuvred on 20 July.  The key issue on that day was that Ireland put a veto on the table and everyone was stuck.  They could not get any kind of arrangement until the veto was removed.  Monsieur Jacques Delors got out of his sick bed &mdash; his sciatica was at him and he was not in a great mood for small talk in any language.  He arrived into a bar in the building at 5.30 a.m. and had a chat with the Tánaiste.  They returned to the meeting and everyone clapped.  Of course they did, because the veto was withdrawn.  If anyone thought they clapped at the cleverness of the Irish delegation, they would want to think again.  It was not the fancy footwork they admired.  Effectively they were saying &ldquo;The veto has been withdrawn, Delors has taken out the Irish and we can all go home to bed, thanks be to God&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All the quality British newspapers were fully briefed by the Commission, particularly by people in Commissioner Bruce Millan's office.  They confirmed that Ireland would not get the £7.8 billion and suggested that something had had to be done on the night to keep the Irish happy.  I am not saying that the Tánaiste did not speak the truth, just that he was outmanoeuved.  The Tánaiste should not then have tried to wrap the integrity of senior civil servants around him by indicating that because the Secretary to the Government and the Ambassador to Brussels and the EC were there, he had to be telling the truth.  Civil servants should not be used as a shield or as some kind of armour, especially when they cannot speak for themselves.  For the first three weeks the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has been wheeling out, in defence of the Tánaiste, Mr. Paddy Teenon and Mr. Paddy Mac-Kernan as if they were Cúchulainn and Finn MacCumhaill rolled into one.  That is a new practice.  Fair dues to the Minister for Finance, at least he fought his battles on his own and never put a line of <Col N="345" /> civil servants between him and the public whenever we were debating anything.  It should not happen, because they cannot reply.  It is not reasonable to expect the Tánaiste to get a written agreement at 5.30 a.m. from Mr. Jacques Delors who was suffering from sciatica; but it would be reasonable when they went back into the plenary session for the Tánaiste, who knows that the Commission operate collegially and not individually, to mention the agreement and get it recorded as a decision.  If the Tánaiste thought that was a bit much at 6 a.m., he could have followed another strategy frequently practised in Brussels &mdash; everybody could have gone home and he could have written a polite letter to Monsieur Jacques Delors, including a minute of the discussion in the bar at 5.30 a.m., and that minute would have included the figure of £7.8 billion.  That is normal procedure &mdash; what civil servants do all of the time.  I do not see why there was no attempt either to get a collective decision and have it recorded at the plenary session when they went back in from the meeting on the margins, or why they did not get it the following day.  It seems that the Tánaiste, who is extremely busy, who has a lot of jobs to do in different parts of the world to which he must attend personally, was outmanoeuvered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will come to that now.  The worst part of this does not relate to 20 July, but to the publication of the National Development Plan.  If we are talking about honesty I cannot see how the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, all of whom now say that they knew that there was a doubt about the exact amount of money, could publish a plan based on definitive figures and allow that plan to be debated here without pointing out to the House at a minimum that these fundamental figures were less than certain. That is where the dishonesty comes in. This House was misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we hear from various officials in <Col N="346" /> Brussels that the Minister for Finance made some kind of request not to have the announcement made that we would not get what we thought we would get because he did not want to embarrass the Government and the House, an explanation is required from the Minister for Finance.  Of course, spreading the blame has been occurring now for three weeks and the Tániste two days ago decided to spread it further by saying that he went to the Taoiseach a week before the debate and told him that these figures were now in doubt and that there could be a significant shortfall.</P>
    <P>The shortfall is very significant at £600 million.  It triggers a certain amount of matching funds, which I doubt will be put up independently of drawing down money from Europe.  Therefore, the shortfall in the plan is somewhere in the region of £900 million.  That is an enormous amount of money and it undermines the arithmetic of the plan.  It also shatters confidence.  Those who framed the plan are depending on the private sector to invest £4 billion to make up the £20 billion of the plan.  It is clear that the public will not have any confidence in an administration whose Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance are not sure of the figure and will publish a plan which falls so short, in terms of money, of what is actually in the plan.  There is a serious problem there.</P>
    <P>The relationship with the Commission has been damaged.  The fact that a Government Deputy, Deputy Broughan, has asked whether Jacques Delors can be believed shows that damage has been inflicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said and written in the past week about the shortfall in expectations of EC funding.  Perhaps it is time to focus for a while on what is being achieved in regard to the National Development Plan.  We are guaranteed, as a minimum, an allocation of the order of £2,000 for every person in this country. This is well ahead of the allocations being made to the other so-called cohesion countries, Greece, Portugal and Spain. The comparable figures for those member states would be approximately £1,600 for Greece, £1,550 for Portugal and £1,300 for the Objective 1 regions in Spain.  We are being given an unrivalled opportunity to improve the capacity of the economy for the longer term and to provide jobs that are so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the heat of the argument about precise figures let us not lose sight of what has been achieved and the obligation that is on all of us to ensure that the funds under discussion here are used to the best possible advantage.  In doing this we will be building on the successes that have been achieved through the use of the Structural Funds in the past.  The present Community Support Framework has been independently assessed by the Economic and Social Research Institute as making a significant and lasting difference to living standards in Ireland. The short-term demand side effects of the EC aid will raise GDP by 2.5 per cent <Col N="348" /> and GNP by 3.5 per cent in 1993.  The long-term supply side effects of the EC aid element will build up over a period and will raise the level of GDP by 0.8 per cent and GNP by 1.1 per cent by the year 2000.  This is estimated as representing a real rate of return of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent on the investment of the EC resources.  This is an extremely high rate of return.  The EC aid element is estimated to give a demand-side effect of 30,000 jobs in 1993 and to lead to a long-term supply side benefit which would raise average employment by 10,000. These results compare very favourably with the position in other Objective I regions of the European Community.</P>
    <P>This debate is about how close we can get to an EC aid figure of £8 billion. A year ago, just before the Edinburgh Council, there were many critics who ridiculed our ambition and forecast that Ireland's share would be very far short of £6 billion over a five year period which was our target at the time.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of the National Development Plan is employment.  I would remind the House again of the figures.  We have a target of up to 200,000 jobs gross.  After making provision for job losses this will translate into net nonagricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 in the period up to 1999.</P>
    <P>The central objective of the National Development Plan is to ensure the best long-term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long-term jobs.  It is further designed to reintegrate the long-term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming so into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the Government's strategy to achieve the national and European Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion. The basic elements of that strategy are first, investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, in tourism and services, in agriculture and natural resources; second, investment in the country's productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy; third, investment <Col N="349" /> in the development of the skills of our people through education and training in order to increase productivity and growth capacity; and fourth, a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative.</P>
    <P>This strategy will be given effect by a wide range of carefully selected development measures.  These include the extension and development of existing programmes of investment in areas such as transport, industry, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, water and sanitary services, education and training, all of which are of importance to the economy. The plan also includes a number of areas of new and increased emphasis including a new local development programme targeted at areas of high long-term unemployment, greater support for the development of indigenous industry, a major programme of investment in the food industry, new initiatives in the tourism sector, including developments in culture and heritage, tourism angling and marketing, substantial progress on the implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, upgrading of the national rail network, increased investment in regional and county roads and strategic investments in the energy and communications sectors.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the plan will be the integrated development of areas of high long-term unemployment economic marginalisation and social exclusion through a new local development programme. This will be targeted at areas where these problems are most acute.</P>
    <P>This new programme will mobilise the energies of local communities, with support from public agencies, to rebuild their economic potential, create new local job opportunities, develop local enterprise and produce a substantial improvement in the community life and the physical environment of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>As the Plan was explained in detail in the debate a fortnight ago I do not propose to go back over the same ground. The plan will be implemented in full and there is no intention or no necessity to revise it.  Let us remember that it provides for a total spending programme of £20 <Col N="350" /> billion.  The guaranteed contribution from the European Community is lower than we had a right to expect but the amount in contention is only a relatively small proportion of the total expenditure and we should keep this in perspective.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind also what happened on the last occasion when I was a member of the negotiating team.  Even though it was agreed that we would receive £2.85 billion we eventually received £3.4 billion.  At that stage the outside figure was probably £3.6 billion. The most important point, however, is that the EC guarantee is only a minimum figure.  In a public statement last week the President of the Commission acknowledged that the opportunity is there for us to achieve an increase in this allocation.  He also indicated that he considers the plan to be &ldquo;excellent and full of promise for Ireland's economic and social development&rdquo;.  Earlier this week the President confirmed that it is possible for Ireland to achieve more than the minimum figure on the basis of the past performance and good programmes in the plan.</P>
    <P>What the European Commission approved last week was not just a precise figure for Ireland but rather an indicative allocation.  In layman's terms this means effectively a range.  We are assured of the minimum, provided of course that we submit good quality projects that meet the criteria laid down for disbursement of Structural Funds.  We are used to this; we have done so, successfully, on a number of occasions.  However, the possibility of improving on this is open to us and this has been acknowledged by spokespersons for the Commission.  This reality has been largely overlooked in recent debate.  In his public statement the President of the Commission said he hoped that Ireland's allocation would be increased in the light of the results achieved on implementation of our programmes. Halfway through the period of the plan there will be a review by the Commission of the operation of Structural Funds programmes in the various member states.  The Commission will make adjustments, where appropriate, <Col N="351" /> and it will have the authority to make transfers.  This is of major significance to us.  I was responsible for five years for the distribution of the money received under the European Social Fund and was aware of the many advantages that would have been gained by this country if the Commission had authority during the period 1989-93 to make transfers.  It now has that authority.  This fact has been overlooked even though it represents a major change.  The Commissioner for Regional Affairs has also acknowledged that the opportunity is there for us to improve on the minimum.</P>
    <P>In short, the bottom line is the quality of the programmes that comprise our plan and our ability to negotiate with the Commission.  Our record is very good. Over the period 1989 to 1993 the high quality of the Irish programmes resulted in an outturn which exceeded the initial indicative allocation.  The original Community Support Framework allocation in 1989 was £2.85 billion and with Community initiatives the total EC aid would have been forecast at just over £3 billion. In fact we received £3.4 billion in current prices.  I am confident that we can repeat this performance and, indeed, better it. I am confident that the proposals in our plan can be fully realised and that they can provide the basis on which Ireland can achieve the maximum of the range settled by the Commission.</P>
    <P>We are now finalising the operational programmes which are the implementing mechanisms of the plan.  The Minister of State and I are taking action in this regard.  These will be submitted to the European Commission shortly.  There are outlines of the programmes in the plan.  The present Community Support Framework has 12 operational programmes plus a number of programmes approved before 1989 and Community-wide measures in the agricultural area which were not programmed.  We are proposing to streamline things in the next round and are proposing ten operational programmes.  The details of the programme structure are a matter to be discussed with the Commission services and <Col N="352" /> both sides will be striving to ensure that the most efficient and practical structure is put in place.  Negotiations will get under way with the Commission in the immediate future towards settling the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The CSF will be, in effect, the agreement between the Commission and the Irish authorities on the various expenditure profiles in relation to the different sectors of activity.  It will be the guideline to determine the precise amounts of funds that will flow to Ireland under each heading.  I cannot put a definite time limit on the conclusion of these negotiations; the general expectation is that they will be concluded at the beginning of the new year.  There will be no delays on transfers of funds and Deputies can be assured that we will be in a position to draw down our full entitlement for 1994.</P>
    <P>In regard to the indicative allocation for the operational programmes the point has been made that there is no substance to the plan which will be examined this week by the Commission.  In regard to the Community Support Framework we will put forward our plans and try to convince the Commission that these will be of value for those areas which have been excluded, agriculture and the environment. If we can do this successfully we can reach the figures.  That is how we managed to receive an extra £600 million on the last occasion.  That is how we will do it this time.  Under the various headings we have a far better case than any other member state and particularly the Cohesion states.  It is a pity that that has been conveniently forgotten.  I recall the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, saying in this House at the end of 1989 that at the end of the programme we will have achieved about £3.5 million.  He is not here to say it now, but that is what was achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate any undue difficulties in the negotiations with the Commission. For the greater part these will be conducted at official level.  I cannot say to what extent ministerial involvement will be required but both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, will <Col N="353" /> be on hand and fully involved when we are required.</P>
    <P>The plan is more than a vehicle for EC funding.  It is a development package that covers the whole economy and it includes a substantial investment from the private sector.  Its success is not dependent on EC funding alone.  The impression may have been created, in recent days in particular, that the plan is about EC funds and no more.  There is, as I said earlier, a total expenditure of £20 billion.  Perhaps the most important influence of all in determining the success of the plan will be the overall management of the economy.</P>
    <P>In this context I want to emphasise in particular our ability to maintain a strong competitive position.  I said earlier on publication of the plan that, for every 1 per cent gain in competitiveness that we can sustain, we stand to gain an extra 4,000 jobs.  This statistic alone underlines how critical it is that we be competitive and that pay policies and other policies give this priority.  By comparison with our European partners our economic performance is very good.  We will have a growth rate of approximately 2¾ per cent this year, well ahead of the European average.  Our inflation continues to be among the lowest in the Community.  Our budget outturn will be on target.  These are all strong plus factors which improve the climate for creating jobs.  Interest rates continue to be on a downward trend and the general expectation througout Europe is that rates will drop significantly further.  This is good news.</P>
    <P>Overall we have a very good foundation on which to maximise the opportunities that are presented to us in the National Development Plan.  We have an opportunity to transform the economy and it would surely be more productive to work on this opportunity than spending our time in acrimony about the precise levels of EC assistance.  The Irish public are concerned about results.  They want to know what expectations can be in relation to jobs and general living standards. They are not preoccupied about the finer points of negotiation with the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> This brings me to the sequence of events in relation to my contact with the President of the European Commission. I want to set the record straight on this. The National Development Plan was formally submitted by me and the Minister of State at my Department to the European Commission on Friday, 8 October. We made the presentation to the Commissioner for Regional Policy who has overall responsibility for the disbursement of Structural Funds.  On that occason the Commissioner told us that he was having difficulty with the Irish proposal on the share-out of Structural Funds and that he could not envisage a total of £7.84 billion being guaranteed. This was not news to us.  The Commissioner has been saying consistenly that there was a problem.  I left him in no doubt, however, that we expected that the understanding that had been reached on 20 July would be honoured in full and that we would receive £7.84 billion as agreed.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I attended the informal ECOFIN meeting outside Brussels.  On the margin of this meeting on Saturday, 9 October, I was approached by the President of the Commission in relation to the share-out of Structural Funds.  He indicated to me that figures would be brought to the Commission for decision shortly.  He added that there were problems in relation to the share-out between the four cohesion countries and that this called into question the allocation expected by Ireland.  He did not discuss specific figures with me.</P>
    <P>The President was aware that our plan had been submitted the previous day and that it was due to be launched publicly at home on the following Monday, 11 October.  He mentioned that the next meeting of the Commission would be in the following week and that the figures must be finalised either then or soon thereafter.  I am at a loss to know why the impression was given that I suggested to the President that the decision be delayed.  There was absolutely no reason for this; there was no advantage to be gained.  From my point of view the question of a postponement being sought by <Col N="355" /> me did not arise.  Once the plan was published on Monday all the figures would be in the public domain and this would obviously precede any meeting of the Commission.  It would have been far more convenient if the Commission had reached a decison between 20 July and October.  Yet there was no indication from the Commission, apart from the comments from the Commission for Regional Policy, during this extended period.</P>
    <P>In our brief conversation I did make one point to the President.  I told him that our plan had been prepared on the basis of a Community contribution of £7.84 billion for the period 1993-99, as agreed on 20 July.  This agreement was made in good faith.  It allowed Ireland to lift its objection to adoption of the regulations on Structural Funds and the Irish Government expected that the agreement would be honoured.  Before I leave this issue let me put it on record that I have always had and I continue to have excellent relations with the President and the Commissioner for Regional Policy and their staffs.</P>
    <P>This Government has been criticised for its so-called begging bowl approach to our negotiations with the Community. This is inaccurate and unfounded.  The fact of the matter is that the process of economic integration, though it undoubtedly brings very substantial potential gains for the whole area in question, also carries substantial risks for Ireland and for the other peripheral regions of the Community.  With greater integration there is inevitably greater drift towards the centre unless definite steps are taken to counteract this.</P>
    <P>We have seen that this very year in regard to VAT at the point of entry and tax harmonisation.  All the difficulties we must deal with in the current financial year are part of European integration. We have taken that medicine on board and we are rightly entitled to argue for Structural Cohesion Funds to balance our position.  It is our job to negotiate.  I have constantly attended European meetings over six or seven years and on issues of <Col N="356" /> money and concessions everybody fights tooth and nail.  We would be strongly criticised if we did not do that.</P>
    <P>The very existence of the Community funds is a practical recognition of the fact that in the absence of countervailing policies, the very processes of integration tend to worsen regional economic disparities. This arises because the central regions of the Community enjoy many advantages over the peripheral regions. Economic resources tend to cluster around the core, enabling the central regions to benefit more from economies of scale in production, lower distribution costs and easier access to ancillary services of all kinds.  This is an automatic, self-repeating process which is reinforced as barriers to trade and to the mobility of capital are removed as part of the move towards full economic integration.</P>
    <P>The reality of this process is a fact of economic life.  When members of this Government and officials from the various Departments of State discuss Community funding with Community officials and with representatives of other member states, they are most emphatically not doing so on the basis of a &ldquo;begging bowl&rdquo; approach.  They do so from a position of entitlement to share in the fruits of economic integration.  The net contributing countries, for their part, recognise that such transfers are warranted by the impact of economic integration on the outlying regions.  They also act out of self-interest, knowing that the tendency for resources to drift to the core leads to many problems for the core, such as overcrowded and polluted cities and roads.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that when the 12 member states and the representatives of the Community institutions sit down to discuss these questions, all concerned are acting from enlightened self-interest. That is what we are there for.  We are not there simply to consider the overall Community in the year 2050 or to sit on our hands and wonder how our people back home, our taxpayers and our unemployed people, take it.  We act in self-interest and argue our case on that basis. There is no question of funds being distributed <Col N="357" /> to countries which have been &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo; and there is no question of anyone holding out a begging bowl.  All concerned are participating in a process which at the end of the day brings benefit to each and every participant. It is all part of the move towards a more closely integrated Europe, which the Irish people voted for last year and stongly support, and to the shared ideals which underlie our joint efforts.  Certainly, there is some hard dealing and some tough talking.  That, too, is part of the process and everybody concerned has learned how to live with it.  Let us recall that over the years Ireland has fared very well indeed in the process, as can be demonstrated from the funding which we receive <i>per capita.</i></P>
    <P>I now turn to the National Development Plan itself.  I hope that after today we can put behind us the recriminations about the details of discussion with the Commission and concentrate our energies on the real issues.  This plan provides an opportunity to narrow the gap in economic terms between us and the more developed countries of the Community. It provides us with the opportunity to improve employment prospects.  We do not have to wait for years to see results; we can make a definite impact in 1994. Again, I want to underline the importance of other policies.  I cannot over-emphasise the significance of wage restraint and the trade off between wage increases and employment.  The Government for its part is committed to continued discipline in the management of the public finances.</P>
    <P>There is one element outside our control and this is the international environment. With some exceptions, the general pattern has been slow growth, recession and rising unemployment. Europe has been particularly bad in this respect.  There are signs of decided improvement.  The European Community has finally woken up to the need for growth; it has recognised the problem of unemployment as a priority.  The growth initiative was discussed at the Council meeting in December.  Beginnings have been made at Edinburgh and <Col N="358" /> Copenhagen towards looking for a solution and the forthcoming White Paper on growth and employment will, I hope, have some positive results.  It is encouraging to see German interest rates moving downwards; this has triggered a general reduction across Europe.  There are distinct signs of economic improvement in the UK under practically all headings.  Overall the outlook is better than it has been for some time, though I must sound a word of caution about excessive expectations.  The outside world will not provide the answer to our problems.  The real test is our ability to manage our affairs domestically and to work in harmony in tackling unemployment. The National Development Plan has a big contribution to make; it deserves and it needs universal support. This Government will implement it in the years ahead and will receive its due rewards for so doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> This discussion and the Taoiseach's speech, which would not do justice to a story in <i>Our Boys</i>, has failed to make any effort to answer the problems that have arisen due to the fiasco of the so-called £8 billion. The Taoiseach attacked people who had nothing to do with the negotiations. That was a bluff to ensure he did not have to answer any of the accusations made.  We are not belittling the fact that £7.2 billion is a lot of money, but that is not the reason for this debate.  The reason for this confidence debate relates to the way the matter has been handled by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who proceeded with a plan when they clearly knew the money was not available.  They decided they would bluff their way until Europe got so frustrated that it blew the cover off all their discussions.  The Taoiseach's <Col N="359" /> statement that the £8 billion was in the bag and the Tánaiste's statement that he was 100 per cent certain ring very hollow when we hear them trying to blame people, giving no explanation to the public or the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the last negotiations.  The <i>Sunday Press</i> of last Sunday states:</P>
      <P>Mr. Reynolds got much of the political credit when Ireland secured £2.8 billion from the Structural Funds for the 1989-92 era and still boasts that he led the Irish negotiations.  History will show that the three key players in those negotiations were former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, former head of the Department of the Taoiseach, Padraig Ó hUiginn, and former Agriculture Commissioner, Ray MacSharry.</P>
      <P>To his eternal credit the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, obviously would not let the present Taoiseach loose in Europe at that time to negotiate the funds.  It looks as if he was very wise because having been let loose in Edinburgh he came back with a cock and bull story that nobody can accept.</P>
      <P>When talking about things coming out of bags we think of people such as Paul Daniels who entertains us and always produces the goods when on television. Our bag did not contain the £8 billion it was supposed to contain &mdash; the figure is much less.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance claim that the quality of this submission will ensure further money.  Will that logic apply also to county council submissions?  Will county councils, because of the quality of their submissions to a certain Department, receive extra money?  We all know that county councils are receiving no money and the whole structure is drying up.  The Taoiseach should be consistent.  I hope county councils submissions will be recognised for their quality and that they will receive extra money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister for Finance, having made three or four statements, has still not categorically denied that he made any suggestion to President <Col N="360" /> Delors about postponing the submission. On one occasion he said he has not that much influence in Europe, on another occasion he said it could have been a misunderstanding and today he says it does not make sense to him.  The Minister for Finance should state openly that he never, under any circumstances, asked for postponement of the submission.  The sooner he does so the sooner his credibility will be restored.  Nobody believes the double talk we hear from him at present.</P>
    <P>When a man of the standing of President Delors', a man with great diplomatic skills, is so frustrated as to speak on television about lies and liars when referring to members of a Government, something has gone extremely wrong at EC level.  He was so frustrated at the way he was treated by our ambassadors abroad that he could not keep his cool any longer.  It is regrettable that we do so much damage to ourselves.  We treat the Dáil with inpunity.  Ministers speak on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; and hold press conferences, but we do not hear a word in this House.  Perhaps we should put some three-in-one-oil on Standing Order 30 because it is rusting away from lack of use.  Nothing ever seems to be important enough to warrant a discussion in this Parliament, but matters are discussed on the radio and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The people who believed that the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, would fulfil the promise of new standards in high places are gravely disappointed.  It has been proved that double talk, despite all the rhetoric and pretence before the last election.</P>

      <P>Tabling a motion of no confidence in the Government is a serious issue.  It should act as a warning to Government that it is breaking the rules of parliamentary democracy.  There are serious issues at stake here and I hope all sides will refrain from using the occasion simply to indulge in personal abuse or to settle old and pointless scores. There is something much more serious at stake.  I have no confidence in this Government because its cynical attitude <Col N="361" /> to democracy and to the Dáil is eroding faith in the democratic process.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance came in here this morning and said, when referring to the allocation; &ldquo;This was not news to us&rdquo;.  If this was not news to him, why was there an emergency flight to Brussels, why was the National Development Plan launched in Dublin Castle on the basis of an other figure and why did seven Ministers come into this House and talk as if the figure had been agreed?  So far as I am concerned, that is double talk.</P>
      <P>It is not the majority of the Government which poses the greatest threat to the health of this democracy; rather it is the state of mind and approach of the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties in this Coalition Government which represents the greatest threat to our political democracy. I say this because in order to flourish democracy needs transparency and accountability, but this has not been the case under the leadership of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, we have seen much of what was evident in Thatcherite Britain &mdash; a gradual tightening of the noose on Government transparency.  We have seen evidence of this again in recent events, and the public know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason I have no confidence in the Government is that when we speak of transparency and democratic politics we are not merely speaking about institutions; we are speaking of language. That is the central feature of democratic politics.  Even though they are very cynical about politicians, the public should expect us to speak openly and use words which are clear.  The words we use should not contain hidden meanings and we should not speak with forked tongues. Unfortunately, many politicians no longer speak openly.  Words no longer means what they seem to mean, language means the opposite, £8 billion means £7.8 billion, £7.8 billion means £7.2 billion and £7.2 billion means something else. We have seen evidence of this yet again in the Taoiseach's speech this morning. <Col N="362" /> More examples include the National Development Plan which was launched before it was debated in this House.  The plan was never openly presented to the public in the way it should have been so that there would be an open discussion, as happened in the case of Northern Ireland where voluntary groups were involved in the development plan at all stages prior to its being sent to Brussels. By-elections have not been held, unemployment figures can be 290,000 or 300,000, there is no proper record of the number of women unemployed &mdash; whatever figure one wishes to choose is correct.  The freezing of grants limits educational opportunities.  There are delays and avoidance in regard to abortion information and divorce.  Voting for change has meant, in effect, the creation of a political system where truth and lies are no longer valid concepts and politicians are instead economical with the truth.  We urgently need an ethics Bill. This type of Government is dangerous because it breeds cynicism and turns people against democracy.</P>
    <P>During the forties and fifties people voted with their feet against Governments &mdash; they emigrated.  People are moving away from politics today because they are cynical and have a lack of belief in politicians.  These people are emigrating from the ballot box, so to speak. Why should we be surprised that people are losing faith in politics and politicians? This lack of faith is dangerous and this Government, through its actions in recent weeks, bears a heavy responsibility for further eroding people's belief in politics.</P>
    <P>The second most important feature of political life is accountability.  In democratic societies parliament represents the centre of accountability where governments justify their actions and seek approval.  This Government is unique among all Irish Governments in its total lack of respect for the Dáil.  As a new Deputy, I have felt this lack of respect in recent months, and I was very interested to hear more experienced colleagues of mine who have been Members of this House for many years say that this has <Col N="363" /> indeed been the case during this session of the Dáil.  Leaders such as Cosgrave, de Valera, Costelloe, Lemass and FitzGerald all respected the Dáil and held themselves accountable to it.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste represent a shining exception to this list of leaders: puffed with pride, they look at their majority and ask, &ldquo;Why should we explain, justify or be accountable to the Dáil?&rdquo;.  It is not correct to adopt this approach to the Dáil or to claim they will always win the vote.</P>
    <P>There has to be national Government on the question of EC Structural Funds. I should like to know why the Opposition did not get the briefing on Northern Ireland which it asked for.  Whose sensitivities did the Government rely on? The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have cost this country much more than £600 million.  We should make no mistake about it, many local communities will suffer and watch their projects die.  Even more serious, the pride and ego of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have cost us generations of goodwill which has been built up by more able diplomatic practitioners.  This Government no longer believes it is accountable to the Dáil and I can have no confidence in a Government and a Foreign Minister who behave in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion of no confidence in the Government, which I wholeheartedly support.  While it is inevitable that the initial contributions to this debate will concentrate on the issue which gave rise to the tabling of this motion, it should be remembered that this Government has shown its incompetence across a whole range of issues. Indeed, it could also be charged with being indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the issue which gave rise to this motion, the Taoiseach used a very clever ploy on his return from the Edinburgh Summit when he said that £8 billion was the equivalent of £3 million per day over the period of the plan.  This no confidence motion was tabled because <Col N="364" /> it is now clear that we have lost £600 million of that money.  To use the Taoiseach's ploy in reverse, if my mathematics are reasonably correct, that is equivalent to losing in excess of £250,000 a day for every day of the duration of the plan.  I wish to endorse a point made by my colleague, Deputy Browne, in regard to Standing Order 30 which provides for a suspension of Dáil proceedings to discuss a matter of pressing national importance. If the loss of £600 million or £250,000 every day over a six-year period does not constitute a matter of pressing national importance, then it is high time this House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges re-examined this Standing Order so that this House is not brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The triumvirate involved in this débâcle, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, are being paid top dollar by Irish taxpayers and they cannot feign indignation when odium is heaped upon them for the incompetent way in which they dealt with this matter. When one is paid top dollar, one deserves to be judged by the highest of standards. The yardstick against which their handling of this issue has to be measured is ability, ethics, accountability and transparency. All of them have failed in those terms.  The negotiation of a deal of such magnitude and importance without having it in the bag, as we were assured, was nothing short of disgraceful and incompetent.  Their attempts to evade their responsibilities and to avoid being accountable and transparent in their transactions by seeking to have the Com-mission's deliberations on the final allocation postponed until such time as they could milk the issue for what it was worth politically and launch the National Development Plan were scandalous in terms of their disregard and contempt for parliamentary democracy.  The attempts made to perpetrate that indecency on this House was an insult to the electorate at large.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have failed in terms of ability, ethics, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>When the Government was formed <Col N="365" /> many commentators reflected on the fact that it had the largest majority of any Government in the history of the State and comparisons were inevitably made with other Government majorities of immense proportions.  I refer specifically to the Government led by Jack Lynch from 1977 to 1981.  A Government majority of this size places a tremendous responsibility on us in Opposition to ensure that it is kept on its toes, that it is made accountable for its every action and that the transparency which was promised with the arrival of the Labour Party in Government would be lived up to. Unfortunately, in one fell swoop the Minister for Finance has blown out of the water all claims of transparency and ethics in Government by the manner in which he treats this Assembly in terms of being accountable to the Members of this House and, through us, accountable to the public at large.</P>
    <P>Seeking to have the deliberations of the Commission postponed was an insult to the Members of this House and to the public at large.  It raises also the question as to where the National Development Plan now stands because that is the blueprint which was milked for all it was worth for two or three days until this blew up in the Government's face.  It is on the contents of the National Development Plan that we hope to draw down £7.2 billion.  That is a huge amount of money and we must be grateful for it, but the principle that is involved in this confidence motion is the Government's incompetence in its handling of that matter and its unwillingness to be accountable and transparent in all of its transactions regarding these funds.</P>
    <P>What are the specific proposals contained in it that will now have to be dropped?  In regard to the £250,000 for every day of the six years of the duration of the National Development Plan, what projects will not now proceed because of that?  They are the essential questions that have failed to be answered by any Government Minister.  We are led to believe that because of reviews in the progress of drawing down these funds we <Col N="366" /> will eventually receive the £8 billion.  If that is correct, then the Taoiseach's £8 billion which he said he had secured on his return from Edinburgh could perhaps have become £8.6 billion or £9 billion over the period.  This attempt at whitewashing is an insult to the intelligence of the electorate and to the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Government has also damaged our relations with members of the Commission.  It is interesting to note at this time the Commission is considering an application by the Government for an injection of equity into Aer Lingus and we need all the friends that we can get at Commission level.  Accusing the President of the Commission and Bruce Millan, the Commissioner for Regional Affairs, of at worst being liars or at least failing to honour obligations does not serve our national interest well.</P>
    <P>There are a whole range of other issues in regard to which this Government has been incompetent.  The issue of community television, the issue of members of this Government at local authority level opposing service charges while, in Government, endorsing decisions taken by the Department of the Environment in regard to service charges shows a two-faced approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, this Government is smug; it is insulated and isolated from the real concerns of ordinary people.  Its <Col N="367" /> unprecedented majority has led it to become complacent in this Chamber and indifferent in its responsibility to be accountable, which is an essential and integral part of a parliamentary democracy. This grasping of power at all costs, the Mercs and perks and the Waldorf Astoria are now far more important, along with the other trappings of power, than what can be achieved when we reach a position of power.  For that reason I cannot have any confidence in this Government.</P>

      <P>The most salient figure, however, was omitted because if we are dealing with reality let us confront it, warts and all.  The most important point that was not mentioned is that the 12 countries in the European Community comprise more than 340 million people. The population of our country is 3.5 million and one would not want to be an Einstein to divide one into the other. However, on doing the division one will discover that we represent 1 per cent of the population of the 12 countries in the EC.  As Deputy Browne knows, tails do not wag dogs and in this case we are a small player in a large field and in such a situation there must be give and take. That is the only way the European Community <Col N="368" /> can operate effectively.  We cannot have Europe on our own terms; we would like this but in reality it is not feasible.  It is important to emphasise that this was our last big pay day from Europe.</P>

      <P>Never again will we have this opportunity because many changes are about to take place in Europe which will weaken our present position and our bargaining power.  In terms of our size we have received more than any other country in the EC.  That is the reality and those are the figures that must be emphasised.</P>
      <P>There was much fury here this morning on the part of Members which signified nothing; tired old performers going through rituals and performing verbal tricks and rhetoric in the House, but that is not good enough.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but of little substance. As a people we have a need to survive and that is important.  That is why the two parties must work together in Government.  It is more important for us to get on with the business of government, do the job for which we were appointed and carry out the priorities of the national plan rather than engage in histrionics and hypocrisy in this House.  I do not need to be lectured on the role of the Labour Party in our society or in this Government, I am quite capable of discharging that job.  Nor am I impressed with the demonology put forward today by the Opposition speakers which casts President Delors and Bruce Millan as villains of the piece.  I do not believe that. I have no penchant for either of the two people concerned but in terms of being a European, Jacques Delors has a far more <Col N="369" /> impressive record than anybody here.  He is a man of vitality, vision and energy and at a time when Europe is beginning to fragment and nationalism is on the rise in many countries, we owe much to him. He has been the most dynamic performer on the European stage with a vision and an idea of Europe in line with its founding fathers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need any advice from Deputy Creed.  Mr. Bruce Millan has also been a good European although on this occasion he did not see eye to eye with us.  However, I will not have him maligned here by people who are not fit to carry his shoes.  He has come to Ireland on many occasions, he has immersed himself in the European concept and he well understands Ireland's problems.  I will not have him cast as a villain either.  What happened during the long night of 20 July is simple; President Delors committed far more than the 100 per cent to the various countries and when he came to add up the figures it came to more than 100 per cent and we lost out.  However, there is no reason why we cannot get that amount.  It we work our national plan effectively there is no reason why the Tánaiste cannot be vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not waste time today engaging in a useless idle debate, it will achieve nothing.  It is important to ascertain exactly what it is we can do with the money being made available to us in carrying out the proposals of the National Development Plan.  I contend that the Tánaiste is a very able negotiator whose <Col N="370" /> endeavours will be vindicated in time.  I have no confidence whatsoever in Members of the Opposition, many of whom I know very well.  I contend they would not do a better job than our present negotiators.  As far as I am concerned the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</P>
    <P>I am not going to stand idly by in this House today and listen to a lot of claptrap and nonsense on the part of Members who would be better employed fulfilling the task they were sent here to do, that is, endeavouring to solve the problems of our society and of the people they represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The synopsis of the National Development Plan states quite bluntly that the plan is about jobs and over the next seven years will result in widespread investment, development, training and education and, most importantly, job creation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on a scale never before witnessed in this country.  It is in all of our interests, no matter to which political party we belong, that we give the plan our 100 per cent support.</P>
      <P>As I listened to various Members' contributions I found myself wondering why the same amount of passion and conviction was not extended to discussion of unemployment and its effects on the poorest and those most marginalised in our society.  People would appear to adopt a blinkered attiude when it comes to economic realities both within and without this House.  I contend this plan is badly needed to give the country a huge economic push.  On that basis all of us would like to see this Government receive the highest possible allocation of funds from Europe but, like everything else in life, we must accept what we can achieve in any given circumstances at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that we shall still be able to achieve our original targets.  Based on <Col N="371" /> our past performance in obtaining funds from the EC and the inherent quality of the proposals contained in the National Development Plan, it is my belief we will receive the maximum amount of funding from this round of EC Structural and Cohesion Funds.  It is much more important that we spend this money wisely in the interests of our people than in merely shedding crocodile tears in the House today.  This money must not be squandered or thrown away foolishly on useless schemes which I do not think will be the case since the plan outlines clearly how it will be expended.</P>
    <P>As I speak here today in my constituency of Cork East hundreds of jobs are at risk of being lost in Youghal Carpet Yarns and at Irish Steel.  I am in close touch with the position obtaining in Irish Steel.  It is vital that as many as possible of such jobs be retained not alone in my constituency but throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan is an impressive document, but unless its proposals lead to the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new ones its objectives will not have been achieved. Nonetheless, I am confident that the implementation of its proposals will have a major effect on the country as a whole. I contend it is irresponsible and disingenuous of the Opposition to attempt to talk the plan down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make brief contribution to this debate.  I must admit that I have no difficulty whatsoever in pinning my colours to the mast by giving my support to the Government in its endevours to obtain the maximum EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for Ireland in the course of the negotiations that will take place over the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the 300,000 people unemployed, in many ways this debate is a non-event.  Having discussed the matter with constituents in recent days I tend to share that view.  My constituents have expressed the view that, whether the amount involved be £7.2 billion or £7.8 <Col N="372" /> billion, it represents a sizeable figure for this country and provides us with an opportunity of providing the requisite infrastructures of job creation in many regions of the country which would not be achievable without such infrastructures.</P>
    <P>I know that in the case of the town of Balbriggan in my constituency &mdash; and the same case could be made for many other towns nationwide &mdash; the lack of construction of a by-pass means that there will not be additional jobs created in such areas.  We must examine carefully the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  If the provisions of this plan afford us such an opportunity, then it should be grasped so that collectively we can ascertain what needs to be done <i>vis-àvis</i> employment generally.  It is appalling that as we debate this issue there are people sitting in offices and boardrooms nationwide whose main endeavour is to pare back jobs.  That is the very real problem confronting us.  We must ask ourselves how we confront that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ask ourselves how we create real jobs.  The proposals of the National Development Plan provide such opportunity in that there is talk of 100,000 net job increases.  We shall work together to bring that about, but it will not be achieved by division within this Chamber while the Government seeks support for its implementation.  For example, within the Dublin area there is provision in the plan for a light rail system so that people who may want to use public transport will be provided with new locomotives and carriages ensuring that they reach work in time.  The proposals of this plan hold out enormous opportunities for us, which is what we should be examining.  We must remember that the unemployed look to us to come up with concrete proposals and suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House has to do with confidence in this Government. I contend opinion polls have shown there is confidence in this Government right <Col N="373" /> across a range of matters including health care, education, housing and social welfare, which problems have been dealt with.

We heard this morning of how well Ireland has done.  The fact that we have received so much more than our three major competitors is testimony to the overall negotiation.  Unfortunately we have listened to cries of disappointment from the Opposition benches, a disappointment which will be reiterated as the weeks and months and years of this Government go by.  Mr. Jacques Delors said he was sure we would get the vast bulk of the £7.84 billion, in other words the extra £600 million.

      <P>He was also a candidate for the prize last year.  One of Roddy Doyle's great qualities, which comes through his books, is his ability to highlight the pain and waste of unemployment on the north side of Dublin and throughout the city.  As Opposition Members will be aware, one of the central characters in his great book is a man called Jimmy Rabbitte senior &mdash; no relation of our distinguished colleague who sits slightly to the left of me here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Jimmy Rabbitte gets up in the morning and finds it very hard to fill his day.  Having spent 20 to 25 years working hard he suddenly became unemployed.  His wife is involved in a local education project and one of his children is getting ready to go to college. <Col N="376" /> A task in life, which every man and woman needs, is missing from Jimmy's life.  As people will know, Jimmy and one of his mates get a van and start a little business.  The book illustrates this point very forcefully.  I am hopeful that by the year 1999 the National Plan will have provided a role in life for the Jimmy Rabbittes of our city and country.</P>
      <P>The part of the plan which I find most valuable, and for which the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, can take enormous credit, is the whole area of local development, particularly in cities such as Cork, Dublin, Galway and the other important urban centres.  We have attempted to integrate organisations such as credit unions, unemployed action groups, local enterprise and community groups and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and give them Government recognition and professional help.  The work done by our local organisations has boosted morale.  Government support, which I am sure will be forthcoming under the plan, will make a fundamental difference to the unemployed in Dublin's north side and other urban areas.  I express my full confidence in the Government and I am glad we are moving ahead with this enormous plan.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Broughan, in his enthusiasm, missed the joke that is now doing the rounds in Kilbarrack that the National Development Plan has been renamed &ldquo;the National Development Plan Ha Ha Ha&rdquo; and will be submitted for the Booker prize next year as a work of comedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the major players in this farce.  I am sorry Dame Eithne Fitzgerald has left the House.  I should like to deal with her first <Col N="377" /> because she said she was responsible for the National Plan.  We now know she was told on 8 October by the EC Commission that the assumptions of EC transfers underlying the plan were &ldquo;unachievable&rdquo; and unrealistic and would not be met. Here we have a Minister of State who portrays herself as the Barbara Castle of the British Labour Party and who has now been transformed into the Barbara Cartland of the Irish Labour Party, indulging in works of light economic fiction, such as the National Plan.  Let us hope we will have fewer lectures from her in future in relation to ethics and political correctness.  Her attempts to dump the matter on the EC Commission will not serve Ireland's vital national interests.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to adopt the EC proposal of a 20 per cent reserve of the total funds has now been proved to be wrong.  This would have allowed the targeting of resources in the light of experience and would have allowed the flexibility necessary to deal with the shrinking of the funds.</P>
    <P>The next person I should like to deal with is the first of our three unwise monkeys who saw no evil, spoke no evil and told no evil.  The ducking and diving of our Minister for Finance in recent days has been lamentable.  It is clear that while Commissioner Bruce Millan shares the same profession of accountancy as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, he is not prepared to indulge in the type of creative accountancy practices in which the Minister is engaged.  The Minister has been floundering in recent days.  At best he has been utterly confused and at worst serious questions have been raised about his personal integrity.  What is without doubt is that he failed to reveal at the launch of the plan in Dublin Castle that he had been repeatedly told by EC Commission sources, three days earlier, that the financial assumptions underlying the plan were not obtainable.  The deceit and duplicity of Government Ministers has made the National Development Plan into a national hoax.  The Government had a clear obligation at the launch of the plan to say these figures were provisional <Col N="378" /> and were draft in nature but they entered no such <i>caveat.</i></P>
    <P>In his contribution today the Minister for Finance has been at a loss &mdash; to use his own words &mdash; to explain how the EC Commission deferred their decision on the share out of the Structural Funds from 13 to 21 October.  This business was deferred at the request of the Irish Government.  Can the Minister explain how Mr. Delors, Mr. Millan, Mr. Christopher Boyd and Mr. Jouyet of the Commission could have collectively developed this request for a deferral as a figment of their imagination?  The Minister has one unique talent: his ability to invent alibis.  During the currency crisis he shifted the blame wherever he could, first to the Bundesbank and then to the speculators.  During the Greencore shares débâcle it was Davy Stockbrokers or Warburg Merchant Bank.  This time it was the EC Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs who let our poor Bertie down.</P>
    <P>Next we come to the Tánaiste, who promised openness and honesty in Government.  He misled the Irish people into believing tbe words he spoke before the closing of the last Dáil and instead the type of Government he has delivered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 14, 15, 27, 36 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations by 15 December next and to the achievement of a global and balanced agreement.  The Government has serious concerns regarding the terms of the so-called Blair House Agreement and in relation to certain elements of the textiles proposals and would wish to see these concerns taken account of in the final GATT Agreement so as to minimise the negative effects of any such agreement on these sectors.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office the Government, at ministerial and at official level, has undertaken the widest possible range of bilateral contacts with other countries to promote Ireland's interests in the context of the negotiations and to make them fully aware of our particular concerns. These contacts have been with member states of the European Community and with other contracting parties to the GATT.</P>
      <P>I, as the Minister with overall responsibility for Ireland's input into the negotiations at EC level, have participated in EC ministerial discussions on the GATT negotiations and have undertaken bilateral contact with Community colleagues and others to highlight Ireland's particular concerns.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy exporting over 70 per cent of its production, Ireland would benefit considerably from a stable world trade environment.  The conclusion of a global and balanced Uruguay Round agreement would serve to create such an environment and would give a much needed boost to the world economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the negotiations fail the most likely <Col N="381" /> scenario would be an increase in protectionism, in unfair trading practices and a proliferation of trade disputes.  This would result in a further decline in the world economy with a very adverse effect on world trade which would undermine Ireland's export growth potential with the inevitable negative impact on employment.</P>
    <P>As the GATT negotiations are ongoing, it is not possible at this juncture to say what the attitude of the Government will be to any final agreement.  It will, of course, depend on the overall globability and balance of any such agreement.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that I shall continue to put forward our specific concerns in all possible fora and make every effort to ensure that the overall balance of any final agreement will be to Ireland's benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not answer the question I asked.  I asked if his Department carried out an in-depth analysis of the potential loss of jobs in industry, particularly in the agriculture and textile industries, following the successful completion of the GATT negotiations.  Is the Minister aware that this year we have already lost 2,000 jobs in the textile and clothing industry, an industry which employs up to 19,000 people and earns approximately £670 million?  Has the Department looked seriously at and quantified the effects of the GATT proposals on this industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered there are over 100 contracting parties to the GATT.  It should also be emphasised that whereas in the recent past the emphasis was on agriculture, it is only fair to say that over 70 per cent of the GATT agreement relates to nonagricultural items.  As Minister I have asked an outside expert group to conduct a consultancy study on the likely impact of a GATT agreement based on what we know over the past couple of months. This agreement has not yet been published but in the near future we will be <Col N="382" /> bringing it before the House and it will be published.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that in any agreement not all sectors will have equal benefits.  There will be pluses and minuses, but without any shadow of doubt the successful conclusion of a GATT agreement will be in our overall interest.  We are an exporting country and are totally reliant on exports.  Any liberalisation of world trade must <i>per se</i> be to Ireland's benefit.  However, the agreement must be balanced.  We have expressed in all fora &mdash; in the EC and to Commissioner Brittan, the Commissioner with responsibility for negotiating on behalf of the Commission &mdash; our various concerns not alone in agriculture but in all other areas.</P>
      <P>At this stage I cannot say if the GATT agreement will be concluded by the middle of December but every member state would like to see the GATT agreement concluded.  It must be balanced and that has been the Irish position all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Sir Leon Brittan indicated in a statement published in one of the national newspapers that he expected there would be an agreement by 15 December and that the agricultural arrangements would be accepted?  In view of the poor penetration of Irish agri-food products of the main EC markets will he suggest measures to the exporters of Irish agri-products to boost our efforts in order to compete with the increasing competition that will arise from opening up EC markets to others, especially to New Zealand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a point.  Vice-President Leon Brittan is the Commissioner charged by the member states to negotiate on behalf of the Commission. His remit is given to him by member states.  He is there as our negotiator and he brings the views of the twelve member states to the GATT negotiations. He is not a free agent in his own right.  He is there on behalf of the member states, so his remit is that given to him by the member states.  He attends <Col N="383" /> meetings at least once a month in Brussels or Luxembourg and he reports back on the up-to-date situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matter the Deputy raises, the establishment of markets for agri-food products, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, will bring forward a Bill shortly setting up An Bord Bia, which will deal with the food processing industry.  It is intended that, together with An Bord Tráchtála, which is under my remit, and the proposed Bord Bia, the growth in Irish agri-food produce, which has been colossal over the past number of years, will continue to grow in future.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the level of funding allocated for marketing in the National Development Plan 1994-1999 is sufficient to increase foreign tourism revenue by 50 per cent by 1999 resulting in 35,000 jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Government's targets of achieving a 50 per cent increase in foreign tourism revenue and the creation of 35,000 jobs can be achieved by the implementation of the integrated package of investment measures for the tourism sector outlined in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The plan provides for a large increase in investment in product and marketing over the 1994-99 period.  The level of EC investment will rise by nearly £200 million, from about £171 million in the current operational programme for tourism to £369 million in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1988 and 1992 the Irish tourism industry earned on average almost £100 million per annum extra in overseas revenue and it also generated an annual average of about 5,000 additional jobs. By the end of 1999 we are seeking to earn a further £1,000 million in overseas <Col N="384" /> tourism revenue and to generate an additional 35,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore that the targets, while ambitious, are achievable having regard both to the historical performance of the industry since 1988 and the large increase in planned investment in the sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his targets are not over-ambitious? In view of the fact that world tourism is expected to increase by just 4 per cent in the period in question and because only £55 million was committed to marketing from EC Structural Funds compared with £17 million during the period of the previous plan &mdash; despite the fact that Bord Fáilte sought more than £100 million &mdash; is it not a major challenge for the Irish tourist industry to increase trade by approximately 8 per cent to 10 per cent? Is the Minister aware that at present we secure only 4 per cent of the British market?  We are losing our share of the American market and we have only 1 per cent of the German market.  Surely that amount of funding is not adequate to take on our competitors who are spending much more money in the marketplace than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a number of questions.  In reply to his first question, it will be a challenge for the Irish tourist industry to increase trade to the figures we proposed in the Programme for Government and set out in the national plan; that target will not be achieved easily.  The Deputy asked a question in regard to penetrative growth in the major markets and I accept that there is a great deal of potential to be tapped.  World tourism is expected to account for 10 per cent of total world trade by the end of this decade and we want our slice of the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC funding is sufficient and represents a doubling of what is proposed in the existing plan.  Our intention is to lever a great deal of money from the private sector.  I am not, <i>per se</i>, a great believer in throwing State money at a problem, I believe in giving a small amount as an <Col N="385" /> incentive and allowing the tourism industry to develop by itself.  As I stated to those in the tourism sector on a number of occasions in the past few months, when this tranche of funds and gravy train from Europe passes I want our tourism industry to be able to stand on its own feet because this gravy train will not pass by our shores again.  Sufficient flexibility to allow the tourism industry and those involved in the business to raise their own money with the assistance of a small amount of EC funding will be provided for in the operational programmes.  The Deputy raised a question about the US, the UK and other markets.  The purpose of this programme is to secure our fair share of the tourist potential in those markets.</P>

      <P>No study has been attempted or commissioned by my Department on the feasibility of establishing an all-Ireland tourist body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of cross-Border tourism co-operation has been undertaken over several years now by the relevant tourism authorities, namely Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  The main area of co-operation between the boards has been the joint marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination in a number of overseas markets with the assistance of the International Fund for Ireland.  Other initiatives have been the development on an all-Ireland basis of Gulliver, the computerised information and reservations system, the adoption of a common classification system for hotel accommodation and the joint marketing of the new Shannon-Erne waterway.  The boards have also co-operated in the administration of programmes for tourism development under the aegis of the International Fund for <Col N="386" /> Ireland and the EC-funded INTERREG programme.</P>
    <P>Progress in cross-Border tourism development is a matter which is kept under review by Ministers under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Conference and in the course of other bilateral meetings. Generally, it is the shared view that co-operation in areas of mutual benefit to the tourism industries, North and South, is the best way forward.</P>

Will he agree that if we are serious about developing North-South institutions as part of a solution to the Northern Ireland problem we must examine areas of best practical co-operation and that a single tourist body for the entire island of Ireland would be a sensible arrangement?  Will he agree that his Department should carry out a feasibility study on the implications of an all-Ireland tourist board?</P>

      <P>In relation to cross-Border co-operation in respect of tourism, under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Conference I met my counterpart, Mr. Atkins, last March.  We put forward a number of proposals about matters to which I referred in my reply.  Since then, both Mr. Atkins and I jointly launched the north-west passage in Armagh last May.  We put forward proposals regarding the joint marketing of the Erne waterway and officials on both sides believe that is the way forward.</P>

    <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell's proposal in regard to an all-Ireland tourist board, but at this juncture it might not be advantageous to make proposals in that regard.  Hopefully that is something which can be developed at a later stage but, as the Deputy is aware, difficult political problems exist on both sides of the divide at present.  Hopefully, in the long term, we will be able to proceed down that road as I have an open mind in that regard.  At present, there are no proposals from either side because officials on both sides believe that is not <Col N="387" /> the way to proceed at present.  However, during the past year we have co-operated in various fora abroad and participated in world tourist organisations on a joint platform sponsored by the International Fund for Ireland.  We will see how matters develop before making proposals for a single tourist authority for the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Council which had its first meeting under my chairmanship on 30 September 1993 will have two primary functions; to act as a national forum for consultation between the tourism industry, State tourism agencies and Government Departments on a tripartite basis, and to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister for Tourism and provide guidance in determining tourism policy to be implemented by the State agencies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the council, as established, can fully carry out its consultative and advisory roles and I have no plans to introduce legislation to put it on a statutory basis.  Final decisions on tourism policy are my responsibility as Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
      <P>The chairman and director general of Bord Fáilte are both members of the Tourism Council and they have assured me of their strong support for the work of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister <Col N="388" /> on setting up this body and for ensuring that all potential voices against such policy have been amalgamated.  I am sure that will have a silencing effect on many of them.  Is it possible to give this body a more practical and active role rather than the consultative one the Minister has given to it?  Will the council have any say in the formation of the tourist operational programme which is being drawn up at present?  Will it monitor the way Structural Funds are spent in the future and the types of projects to be funded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be far from me to try to silence any group of people. To suggest that by amalgamating them in the tourism council would silence some of them is wide of the mark.  The council is a new forum, but it will not have a role in the monitoring of the tourism operational programmes.  We must wait and see how it develops before making any proposals regarding expanding its role in the future.  I believe in the elected representatives and the Government of the day making decisions in respect of policy.  For too long it has been the practice in various Departments, that when a problem arises, especially if it has political implications, the trend is to hive it off to a new body to make a decision so that it can be blamed for the mistakes. There is a new Department of Tourism and Trade and the Minister for Tourism and Trade will direct tourism policy and will have it carried out by the tourism agencies.  I intend that the tourism council should develop and have an input into the areas mentioned.  We will consider in the course of time how to involve it in the operation of tourism policy.  That is the best way to proceed.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the extent of the likely exposure of the Irish taxpayer as a result of the recent decision regarding export credit insurance cover for Iran; if he will give the total value of the contracts in respect of which cover was sought; the exporting companies; the conditions, if any, which have been attached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The up-to-date position in regard to the provision of export credit insurance for exports to Iran, following the Government's recent review of the matter, is as follows.</P>
      <P>Firstly, no policies have yet been issued on foot of the Government's decision. A number of applications for cover are being considered in my Department, but in only one case has an actual offer of cover &mdash; which has not yet been taken up &mdash; been issued so far.  In these circumstances, it is simply not possible to indicate the extent of likely exposure on the market.  As the Deputy will be aware, such an estimate will be possible only when actual policies have been issued.</P>
      <P>The total value of the contracts in respect of which cover has been sought significantly exceeds the limit for the market set by the Government and, accordingly, the maximum cover that may be provided is dramatically less than the level of cover sought.  It is not the practice to disclose country limits, but I can assure the Deputy that it has been set at a realistic level.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice to disclose the names of companies availing of the export credit insurance scheme.  This is confidential information related to the commercial operation of the companies concerned and its disclosure would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Conditions to be attached to any policies issued, are being carefully considered by my Department at present, having regard to all the circumstances.  I will not be in a position to give final details until this process has been completed. I can, however, confirm that the terms will be more onerous than these which pertained when beef was last exported to Iran.  This is a reflection of the changed situation of the market, and will ensure that exporters will carry a fair and reasonable proportion of the risk.</P>

As I replied to the Deputy in an Adjournment Debate two weeks ago, the Government considered the matter of export credit insurance to Iran.  We came forward with proposals and the companies who indicated an interest in that market have been notified of terms and conditions.  As of now, no company has taken up the offer of export credit insurance to Iran but presumably some companies will and others have indicated that they will not.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 20, 37, 41 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to achieve the most extensive possible registration of all tourist accommodation to support the maintenance of quality standards in this sector.  My Department is conducting a detailed examination of the various options involved with a view to identifying how best to achieve this objective.  Consultations are taking place with interested parties on aspects of the issues involved, such as the role of planning authorities in the light of a relevant Bord Pleanála decision earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of this exercise I am not in a position to say how exactly the matter will finally be dealt with.  I can assure all interested parties, however, that all aspects of this complex question will be taken into account and I will make an appropriate announcement in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that it is stated in the Programme for Government under the heading &ldquo;Accommodation&rdquo; that all tourist accommodation will require to be licensed or registered in accordance with objective standards?  It would appear that the Minister is a long way from achieving that objective.  As the Minister is probably aware, last year the Northern Ireland authorities introduced regulations under which all bed and breakfast establishments, guesthouses and so on, must be licensed.  Perhaps these could be used as a model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are as many opinions on this matter as Deputies in this House.  As the Deputy said, a commitment was given in the Programme for Government that all tourist accommodation <Col N="395" /> will require to be licensed or registered in accordance with objective standards.  We have made inquiries and undertaken some research in this regard. I have also asked the officials of my Department to carry out a review along with officials from other Departments. This is a complex matter.  Under the Tourist Traffic Acts Bord Fáilte is empowered to register hotels, guesthouses, holiday and youth hostels, holiday cottages, holiday apartments, holiday camps and caravan and camping parks.  It is also empowered to list or approve town and country homes and bed and breakfast establishments.  If we were to enforce a licensing regime in respect of bed and breakfast establishments, additional legislation would be required.  There would be pros and cons in doing this.  I have met various organisations which would argue, as Deputy Connor said, that all establishments should be licensed.  They are of the view that those who are not licensed do not have to pay registration fees or meet the minimum standards laid down, are probably not paying tax or are members of any organisations.  On the other hand, there are arguments against compulsory registration.  For instance, would this make any difference in terms of quality? Would it lead to a serious reduction in our accommodation bank and would Bord Fáilte be able to police a larger bank?  As I have said before, I do not intend to have an army of enforcers to hound Mr. and Mrs. Smith or Mr. and Mrs. Murphy or those who may take in a guest for a week or two in peak season.  We have enough legislation as it is on the Statute Book and armies of policemen, civil servants and public agents dealing with it.  I intend to bring forward proposals shortly but, as I have said, for better or worse, it is not my intention to hound out of existence people living in County Kildare or County Roscommon.  Far too many establishments are unregistered but despite what the experts, including the State agencies, want it is not my intention to introduce a strict scheme.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of complaints relate to unregistered and unlicensed premises.  Does the Minister's Department have any information &mdash; I take it that some, but perhaps not too scientific, surveys have been carried out &mdash; on the number of approved or unapproved establishments?  I am aware that two years ago in the Cork-Kerry region a survey was carried out which showed that the ratio of unapproved as against approved establishments was two to one.  Would the Minister agree that this is unsatisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in that regard and I have some figures which may be of interest to him. Approximately 3,600 Irish homes are listed by Bord Fáilte.  These include town houses, country homes and farmhouses which are referred to as bed and breakfast operations.  No precise figures are available for the number of unapproved establishments but it is estimated that between 4,000 and 7,000 are engaged in this activity.  It is my intention to reduce these figures to manageable proportions. The present position is unsatisfactory. The Deputy is correct when he says that it would be better if everybody providing accommodation was registered but, as I said, it is my intention to reduce the ratio significantly during my term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister concur that one of the reasons many establishments are unregistered is that the vast majority have been unable to obtain any assistance from State agencies and that under the operational programme for tourism and the business expansion scheme the accommodation provided was at the upper end of the market? Would the Minister consider the possibility of providing some assistance under the next operational programme for <Col N="397" /> tourism to those providing low cost family accommodation for which there is a significant market at present?  No grant assistance is available from any State agency for the smaller hotels and guesthouses which offer that kind of accommodation. If such assistance was available, we would encourage more people to provide registered and licensed accommodation.</P>

Would he further agree that instead of imposing these costs on the community any such scheme should be self-financing and the best way to achieve this is by using a carrot instead of a stick and giving approved licence holders a leg up in commercial terms over unapproved establishments rather than by introducing a compulsory system?  Would the Minister agree, in view of the answers he has given today, that whoever included that in the Programme for Government did not think the implications through very carefully?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy; that is the way I intend to proceed. My Department, together with the Department of Finance, has carried out a study and I intend to bring forward proposals shortly.  As the Deputy said, I intend to use a carrot before producing the big stick.  If we were to introduce a scheme whereby each unapproved guest-house or bed and breakfast establishment would have to register, the cost would far outweigh the benefits to be gained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the legislation establishing An Bord Bia, when it is published by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, will reflect fully the Government's commitment to ensuring that there is no fragmentation of the State's efforts in support of food industry exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own overriding objective, and that of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will be to produce a flexible State agency structure which will best <Col N="399" /> assist the food industry to maximise its contribution to the economy in terms of wealth creation, exports and jobs but which will also secure the best value for money for the State's investment in support and promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he does not believe a word of what he has just read out.  Surely the Minister agrees that it is plain daft to further fragment the overseas drive in the manner proposed by the setting up of An Bord Bia.  How can a Government that says it has implemented the Culliton report fly in the face of a very specific recommendation of the report in this area.  If I were permitted to do so, a Cheann Comhairle, I would quote it, but presumably the Minister knows it.  It flies right in the face of Culliton's recommendations and our overall exports drive will suffer from the inevitable fragmentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill setting up An Bord Bia is being drafted in consultation with my Department to ensure that there will not be the fragmentation the Deputy fears.  This board is being set up under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to focus on the food industry but not cut across the promotions of An Bord Tráchtála and my Department and our emphasis on increasing foreign areas.  I hope when the Bill is published the Deputy will see the logic of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects to the Culliton recommendations.  It will be remembered that Culliton did not recommend the setting up of a separate Department of Tourism and Trade.  However, the Government is entitled to make its own decisions in this regard and An Bord Tráchtála remains in the remit of my Department, the setting up of which was not recommended by Culliton, as the Deputy has pointed out on many occasions in this House.  We will await the publication of the Bill setting up An Bord Bia.  The agencies will not cut across one another and there will be co-operation <Col N="400" /> between An Bord Bia and An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that Culliton recommended one strong cohesive agency for market development overseas? Is it not the case that the Minister's own party supported that position?  Now, apparently, every Government Department must have its own quango, its own agency.  What advice, if any, has the Minister sought from An Bord Tráchtála? What is the attitude of the board that is charged by the State with marketing our indigenous industry as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As many Deputies have pointed out, we have departed from some of the ideas of Culliton.  Culliton recommended the setting up of a monster agency incorporating An Bord Tráchtála. The Government decided not to proceed along that road.  It was decided to leave An Bord Tráchtála with the Minister for Tourism and Trade and, as I said earlier, Culliton did not recommend the setting up of that Department.  In drafting legislation to set up An Bord Bia cognisance will be taken of the concerns expressed and the ideas put forward by my Department and An Bord Tráchtála.  It is the intention not to have fragmentation of effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain where the line of demarcation between An Bord Tráchtála and An Bord Bia will lie?  For example, would alcoholic drink exports fall under one agency and milk exports under the other? How can the Minister possibly justify two organisations marketing consumer goods internationally while wearing different hats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the difficulties that might arise and that is why we are being careful to ensure that we do not have that kind of fragmentation.  I agree it would be foolish to have fragmentation of effort.  There will be co-operation between An Bord Bia and An Bord Tráchtála to avoid that problem.  I do not want to take over the role of the <Col N="401" /> Minister for Agriculture, but he would say that there are compelling arguments for having a separate board responsible for the food industry.  That was recommended by an expert group set up some time ago which recommended the establishment of An Bord Bia to deal exclusively with the food industry.  However, we will await the legislation and I hope the Deputy will be pleasantly surprised to find that there will be no fragmentation, which, like the Deputies over there, I do not want either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to an expert group.  Does the Minister, as Minister for Trade, not acknowledge the validity of the case made by one member of that group, Senator Feargal Quinn, when he argued that what we were doing was setting up an agency for farmers rather than an agency for food production, sales and exports?  Is it not what we are doing?  Are we not conceding to the farmer's lobby and the Department of Agriculture when it is the Minister's job, as Minister for Trade, to co-ordinate our export drive abroad without this fragmentation and competition, which in the view of most experts will only damage our national effort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the minority report put forward by Senator Feargal Quinn in the export group to which the Deputy refers.  The Government decided that An Bord Bia should be set up and that legislation will be brought forward shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that because of impending increased competition for market space and our low penetration in the market at present, it is vitally important to the national interest that we have a focused marketing drive there irrespective of who is selling products abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The reason for setting up the Department of Tourism and Trade was to give a new focus to our promotions abroad and realise their maximum potential. <Col N="402" /> CBF have a presence abroad regarding food and An Bord Tráchtála carry out some activities as well.  It is hoped that the new Bord Bia will be able to liaise with An Bord Tráchtála to focus in on the markets.  It is not intended to adopt a fragmented approach.</P>
      <P>In response to points put forward by Deputies on the other side of the House in regard to the Culliton report, one has to say that if the logic of the ideas put forward by various speakers were to be followed to its conclusion one would end up with one big Government Department and it would be impossible to carry on business in such circumstances.  It is not the intention that there will be duplication or fragmentation of effort which would not be in anybody's interest.  There will be co-operation between An Bord Tráchtála and the new Bord Bia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue.  Does the Minister not accept that far from creating one big department &mdash; we are talking about a relatively small country &mdash; most expert opinion suggests that we need one strong cohesive agency for market development overseas?  What the Minister is apparently supporting in a luke warm way runs in the face of that. What advice did the Minister get from An Bord Tráchtála and does he agree with that advice?  Is it not the case that he lost the battle in Cabinet, that he was dwarfed by the Department of Agriculture and as a result the overall national effort will suffer?  It is a silly concession for us to make at this stage considering the desperate unemployment problem that confronts the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the expert group examining this matter supported the setting up of An Bord Bia. A significant contribution was made by Senator Feargal Quinn who took a different view of the matter.  The Government took into consideration all the points raised and it was decided to set up An Bord Bia.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The National Development Plan 1994-1999</i>, confirms that the Government will continue to assist leisure-related tourism investment.  No specific decisions have yet been taken, however, on the extent to which such investment will be eligible for assistance, but it will remain policy that only those premises which are active in contributing to securing increases in foreign visitors will be assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that smaller hotels, hotels with fewer than 35 rooms, which were debarred from funding under the last programme, cannot expand unless they are grant-aided?  Will the Minister ensure that hotels of all sizes are included for funding under the next programme? Would the Minister not agree that the family run hotel must be protected?  The families who run these hotels are under increased pressure to survive and it is vitally important that, irrespective of their size, they receive funding under this scheme in order to expand and to attract foreign tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply, no specific decisions have been made yet regarding the eligibility criteria for the next operational programme.  Given the best will in the world it would not be possible to allow every hotel to qualify for EC assistance to provide leisure facilities. If that was done the money would be spent over-night and the economic benefit would not be commensurate with the level of spending.  Under the last operational programme only hotels with a minimum of 35 bedrooms were eligible <Col N="404" /> for assistance for leisure facilities.  Under that programme 40 projects nationwide benefited from an investment of more than £61 million, including £6.6 million from EC funds.  The new operational programme will be published in the next month or so.  I have had meetings with the various interested parties in the industry who recommended levels of aid and the criteria that should apply under that programme.  To provide assistance for leisure facilities to every hotel would not be economically justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the hotels with the type of facilities listed in the question, such as swimming pools, tennis courts and various indoor amenities are by and large hotels which charge premium prices?  There is a danger in concentrating resources in that area in that we would perpetuate an image of a country in which the tourism season is restricted to the fine weather period and for the rest of the year we cater only for those who can afford premium prices. Under the new operational programme for tourism will the Minister consider making available grant-aid to hotels which do not have the capacity to finance swimming pools and other indoor recreational amenities but who otherwise can offer budget accommodation for family type holidays?  Many international tourists who may wish to holiday here and escape from the sun could avail of these facilities.  Under the new operational programme investment should be concentrated on those hotels and guesthouses which offer that type of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question put down by Deputy Deenihan relates to EC aid for leisure facilities whereas the matter referred to by Deputy Creed relates to a later question and I will deal with the matter when we come to that question.  I am considering some flexibility under the new operational programme to meet the points raised by the Deputy.  Those points were brought home to me very forcibly when I visited Deputy Creed's constituency some months ago.  One of the most progressive towns in Ireland situated <Col N="405" /> in the Deputy's constituency does not have one hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to consider some means of assistance for hotels such as those which the Deputy has in mind. As regards the question raised by Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Creed as to where tourists are going, people are trading downwards.  That is the case not only in the Irish tourism market but also internationally. From a macro-economic viewpoint, more jobs are created in big operations than in smaller operations.  It is the customer who is driving the market because the customer is trading downwards. Despite the best hopes of agencies such as Bord Fáilte that we attract high spending tourists who stay in big hotels, that is not happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are dealing with the operational programme for tourism will the Minister indicate whether he is considering grant-aid for the provision of extra self-catering units of which there is a great shortage in many parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of accommodation is being considered but we must take cognisance of the total amount of money available under the national plan.  I am considering the introduction of some scheme to meet the problems referred to by the Deputy.  A later question refers to this matter and I will deal with it in greater detail when we come to that question.  Since the State discontinued grant assisting accommodation the amount of bedroom accommodation has increased dramatically.  This is an interesting economic feature which will perhaps gladden the heart of people such as Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think we got good value from the £6.6 million that was invested in leisure facilities under the last operational programme? Is he aware that in many cases the ventures that were grant-aided for leisure <Col N="406" /> type facilities involved multinationals who already had the resources to extend their premises?  There is a feeling of frustration among family-run hotels in that they receive no assistance whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the feeling of frustration among the owners of small family run hotels to which the Deputy has referred.  However, all the studies carried out by economists in this regard which are available to my Department point out that the way to create more jobs in the tourism industry is to attract more high spending tourists to Ireland.  That has been the traditional way of looking at such matters.  As I said, customers are now trading downwards, so to speak, and perhaps it is time we looked at some of the points made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I made the interesting point that the number of bedrooms available in the Irish market has increased enormously since we ceased giving grant aid.  I am looking at this matter in the context of the operational programme.  It is difficult to formulate a scheme for which the demand will not be so great that we neutralise all the available EC funds in one go and not create the proposed number of jobs.  It should be remembered that the programme sets a target for the creation of 35,000 jobs over the period of the programme.  I have to try to allocate the funds in such a way that the proposed number of jobs is created.  I am aware of the points made by the Deputy about small family run hotels.  This point has been made to me at various meetings throughout the country by people involved in the tourist industry. However, I have to balance one demand against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the policy he has put forward here today regarding funding for hotels merely serves to exaggerate the difference between larger and smaller hotels and makes smaller hotels less competitive, resulting in a loss of business and possible closure?  The last programme stated that only hotels with more <Col N="407" /> than 45 rooms would be grant aided.  This was later changed to cover hotels with more than 35 rooms.  Can the Minister say if he will be flexible and provide this grant aid to hotels with more than 20 rooms.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to raise a very important question which I should have asked already.  Will the overall budget available for the Minister's Department be affected by the decrease in the level of funding announced last week?  This is very important from the point of view of marketing and the implementation of the operation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's last question is no, the level of funding for my Department will not be affected.  The Deputy asked if I was prepared to consider a relaxation of the 35 bedroom rule.  I have not yet drawn up the operational programme and, while I am willing to be flexible on this issue, I cannot say at this stage to what extent I will be prepared to change the rule.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a loss of business by small family run hotels.  My job as Minister for Tourism and Trade is to bring foreign income into the country and create lasting jobs.  It would appear that bigger operations create more long-term sustainable jobs.  I have to keep that objective in mind while at the same time encouraging more people to get involved in business and ensuring that small family run operations remain viable.  This is where the difficulty arises in terms of dividing in a reasonable fashion the funding available to me.  As Minister with responsibility for tourism, my main objective is to create 35,000 jobs over the lifetime of the programme and that will be the main criterion for any measure introduced by me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13, 24 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should explain that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, has primary responsibility for addressing the problem of crime, including tourist-related crime.  As Minister with responsibility for tourism I am, of course, very concerned about the level of criminal activity directed at tourists, particularly in the Dublin area.  However, it must be emphasised that this problem is not unique to Ireland as the situation in other European and US cities frequented by tourists is often much greater.</P>

    <P>Overall the number of crimes involving tourists is small in the context of the 1.4 million overseas visitors to Dublin, but they nonetheless attract the attention of the media at home and internationally. In contrast, however, to the considerable <Col N="409" /> attention which has been devoted to the problem in the Irish media, I understand that international media coverage has been more restrained.  Any adverse publicity of this kind, however, is unfortunate, and particularly at a time when Dublin is enjoying great success as a short-break holiday destination in the British and mainland European markets.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am pleased to inform the House that a much greater level of favourable publicity by far is being given to the tourist attractions of Dublin and Ireland generally in the international media.  This year Bord Fáilte, in co-operation with the carriers and the tourism industry, has welcomed over 900 press, radio and television journalists to Ireland from North America, mainland Europe, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. This is a record number of journalists invited to report on the attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination and yields very positive media coverage.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible introduction of a scheme similar to the Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service, the Minister for Justice is at present considering the establishment of such a service here, but its extent and precise role will have to be carefully worked out between the various Government Departments and agencies involved.  On the basis that the scheme in Amsterdam is said to be very successful in providing practical and psychological assistance to the victims of tourist related crime, I am favourably disposed to the concept of a similar service here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that Dublin is not the only major city which has been afflicted by the crime wave.  Does the Minister agree that Ireland's image has taken a battering in recent years?  Does he not consider that a scheme similar to the one in operation in Amsterdam could go a long way to removing the jaundiced view of Ireland many tourists are left with as a result of the absence of any aftercare system for the victims of crime in this city?  Is the Minister aware that the scheme operated by the Amsterdam authorities is relatively inexpensive?  Would his Department <Col N="410" /> support the implementation of a similar scheme here in any discussions with the Department of Justice?</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's last question is yes.  Earlier this year the Irish Association of Victim Support approached the Minister for Justice, the Garda Commissioner and other bodies with a view to setting up here a service similar to the one operated in Amsterdam.  Both my Department and Bord Fáilte are very supportive of such a proposal.  In order to show her interest in the matter the Minister for Justice has agreed to address a seminar being held next Wednesday, 3 November, by the Irish Association of Victim Support which will be attended by a representative of the Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service.  Consideration is being given in the Department of Justice to setting up here a service similar to the one operated in Amsterdam.  The Deputy can take it that both the Minister for Justice and I are very supportive of such a service.  As I said in my initial reply, various matters will have to be taken into consideration.  The Minister for Justice will be in a position to give her views on such a service to the House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that the level of crime against tourists in Dublin is not the worst in Europe.  Nevertheless, any attack on tourists is not helpful in terms of achieving the targets I have set myself in the tourism area.  Ideally, we would not like to see any attacks on tourists. Earlier this year I convened a meeting of the various tourist bodies in Dublin to discuss ways of assisting tourists who have been attacked.  It must be remembered that thugs and criminals will not merely stop attacking tourists &mdash; they will attack anyone they think has money.  We must assist people by way of preventing them from wandering into areas of the city where crime is more endemic than in other areas.  We have brought forward ideas in that regard.  We have produced take care and information leaflets and there will be better signposting next year in order to help ensure that people go <Col N="411" /> only to areas of the city which are regarded as safe for tourists.  The Garda and the Department of Justice have cooperated in this regard and, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am very conscious of the need to sell Ireland as a place to visit and enjoy without being mugged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister accept that it is little consolation to a tourist to know that he will require only three stitches following an attack in Dublin as opposed to requiring perhaps six stitches in Amsterdam or elsewhere and that such publicity will reflect badly on us?  We are dealing with a situation where the residents of Dublin can be waylaid by people jumping out of cars and snatching their handbags.  I would ask the Minister to take a stronger line than saying that we are better off than certain other countries.  Would the Minister accept also that tourism around the country is being adversely affected because of the publicity that has been given to Dublin and that perhaps an advertising campaign highlighting the peace and tranquility of rural Ireland might help to attract the tourists who are afraid to come here because of the problems in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, it is particularly tranquil in Carlow and Kildare and we would certainly encourage tourists to visit those two counties.  However, the problem is not simply confined to Dublin, but the Garda and the Department of Justice have done everything within their power during the summer months to alleviate the distress caused to tourists.  I am primarily interested in crime as it relates to tourists because it projects a bad image of Ireland.  We have taken some measures and will take further measures for next year to address the problem, but it is not confined to tourists.  Recently, a rat was thrown into the car of a friend of mine who was travelling to Dublin with the roof window open.  Naturally she got out of the car quickly and then her handbag <Col N="412" /> was stolen.  That is the type of crime that is taking place in our city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a major threat to tourists in particular because they are less capable of taking care of themselves in a foreign urban environment?  They are not as streetwise and are less capable of responding to crime than some people who live in the city.</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister agree that what is needed now is for the Garda to take the problem of interfering with tourists' cars more seriously?  Would they take a leaf from what happens in England, that is, that cars are put in places where they are likely to be stolen, they are staked out with a view to apprehending those who interfere with them, thus making an example of these people when they are brought before the courts. That is the only way this crime will be stopped.  The Garda might put some creativity into staking out particular tourist cars or mobile homes with a view to achieving a similar result.  When there was an increase in the unauthorised taking of cars five years ago, the penalties were increased and the activity curtailed dramatically.  I suggest that if the Garda put more of an effort into apprehending these culprits and made an example of them, people would think twice about interfering with a tourist's car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter which I can take up with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, but the primary responsibility for this would rest with the Garda Commissioner.  My Department and Bord Fáilte have undertaken measures to assist tourists in 1993.  Hopefully, we will have better signposting in Dublin city as well as various other measures which <Col N="413" /> should alleviate the problem somewhat. This type of crime gives the country a bad name.  However, we are fortunate that the international media coverage of crime in Dublin as it affects tourists was not as prominent as the media coverage here.  I am not blaming the media here for highlighting this problem, but we are fortunate that it was not carried in the international papers and that it was not a constraining factor in the 1993 season at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what the Minister said about confining tourists to certain areas, if one brings that to its logical conclusion we will not allow them to leave Jurys Hotel other than for perhaps a trip around Croke Park.  Can I put it to the Minister that the thugs who are involved in this type of crime are well known to the Garda?  Do the Garda have the necessary manpower to apprehend these people?  I understand that this crime has become very specialised in Dublin and I hope the Garda have the necessary resources made available to them to put an end to this activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now straying into the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  The whole problem of crime, both in the capital city and the country at large, is very serious.  Since coming into office the Minister for Justice has brought forward various proposals to try to alleviate this problem.  Apart from unemployment, I believe crime is the most talked about topic of conversion in most people's homes and I am very much aware that it is an increasing problem.  However, the Minister for Justice and the Garda are doing their best in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has at least recognised that there is a problem.  I raised this question a few months ago and I was more or less accused of scaremongering.  Would the Minister agree that it is rather alarming that approximately 2,300 of these crimes are committed in Dublin with 600 being committed in the rest of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> Therefore, the problem would appear to be confined to Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  Also, some Garda sources have indicated that there is an organised group in existence who pursue tourists because, as Deputy McDowell has said, they are soft targets.  We should be doing more to warn people on entering the country because this information does not appear to be getting to them.  For example, when a survey was carried out in O'Connell Street last year no information was available in the tourist office there warning tourists of any impending dangers in the city.  Because this would appear to be a Dublin problem and because Dublin is so important to the rest of the country, we should be doing more in Dublin to address the problem. Finally, whereas conviction rates are generally high, detention rates are low because there are no prison places available for these criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out earlier in my reply that 1.4 million visitors come to Dublin and, therefore, statistically most tourist directed attacks occur in Dublin. We have taken measures in the past year to make tourists more aware of the problem of crime.  We have take care messages in Bord Fáilte's main promotional brochures, we have a take care leaflet in four languages published by Dublin Tourism which is circulated widely to tourist offices, hotels and bed and breakfast premises.  We have take care leaflets published by the Garda and distributed by patrols and community relations officers.  We have take care messages in on-board and in-flight magazines in Irish Ferries and Aer Lingus.  Tour guides and coach companies warn their passengers about the dangers of crime.  Various other measures have been put into effect and we hope to expand on those this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the whole problem of crime as it relates to Dublin and other parts of the country is a very serious matter.  All I and my Department can do is make tourists more aware of the problem. Hopefully we will not receive anything like the adverse publicity devoted to <Col N="415" /> other capitals worldwide.  I am sure Members will be aware, from looking at international news, of attacks and killings that have taken place in other cities worldwide, in main tourist destinations, such as Miami in Florida.  Thankfully Ireland has not reached that stage, but that is not to say that any crime committed against tourists should not be deplored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a large number of offenders involved in such attacks on tourists are juveniles?  Would he not join in a call on parents to play their part in adopting a responsible role in the control of their offspring, knowing where they are and what they are doing at all times?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, would the Minister agree that it is very frustrating for the Garda authorities, having taken action in such cases, often resulting in convictions, to find such offenders back on the streets within a matter of days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two matters which can be dealt with in the first place by the Minister for Justice.  Parental responsibility for children's activities is a vexed question.  Some Members of this House would advocate the promulgation of such measures but it does not fall within my remit as Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Certainly I can appreciate the view expressed by many people nationwide, often articulated in this House in favour of the introduction of some proposal in that regard.  It is something the Government can consider at a later stage. The frustration of the Garda authorities is another matter the Minister for Justice has been considering.  She will bring forward proposals in the near future in regard to detention places and centres, hopefully within the context of the 1994 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has agreed already that this past summer probably was one of the worst on record in so far as attacks on tourists in Dublin were concerned.  Would he agree that we <Col N="416" /> are on a deteriorating spiral, particularly bearing in mind the frequency and viciousness of attacks on tourists?  Will he ascertain whether more could be done to alert tourists to the dangers at the various points of entry?  Sufficient has not been done in that regard to date.  Perhaps the Minister could direct more tourists to Donegal, a relatively safe place for them to holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that one could not go to a safer place and, as for politicians up there, one will never meet a more decent group of people.  They do not stab one another in the back.  They are more civilised than most other politicians nationwide, so tourists will be all right.  They are noted for being nice in politics in Donegal and, when it comes to welcoming tourists, they are even better than in politics.  I read out earlier the additional steps we had taken this year with regard to warning messages for tourists entering the country.  I can assure Members that we shall be increasing that endeavour in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I briefly welcome the Minister's counselling and aid initiatives for victims of crime against tourists and welcome the apparently increased co-ordination and co-operation between his Department and the Department of Justice. Would he agree that it is important to keep this debate in perspective, that the vast majority of tourists can have a safe holiday and avail of a quality product and that we could run the risk of talking ourselves out of business by over-emphasising the issue?  Nonetheless a serious problem does obtain and there would appear to be recognition of that fact by the Departments of Justice and Tourism and Trade.  We shall carefully monitor the Ministers' performances in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I dealt at some length with the matter of not overstating the problem.  I am glad Deputy Creed has taken up that point.  In comparison with other cities worldwide the <Col N="417" /> level of tourist-related crime in Dublin is low.  We were lucky that international media attention did not focus on the problem in Dublin, presumably for the good reason that, in comparison with other capital cities worldwide, it is very small here.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I had been dealing with the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald and the Minister for Finance, who could not explain away the contraditions between what he and Monsieur Jacques Delors had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Tánaiste has dropped the ball again.  Unlike the Spanish, <Col N="467" /> who were able to obtain a written agreement at all stages, specifying something of the order 40 billion ECUs, he got a mere handshake and was left hoisted on his own <i>fourchette</i> as a result of his exaggerated claims.  His recollection of events is amazing.  Early last week when Mr. Delors said that he had expressed to him a doubt about these funds on 4 October, he said he had some vague recollection of having had some fleeting conversation.  Yet this week, when the pressure was on in &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, he was able to say that he recalled this conversation so well and it was of such significance that he relayed its contents to the Taoiseach.  He failed to tell the people that the share-out of these funds was the sole decision of the 17-person Commission and nobody else.  He ignored the international media reports of 21 July last which has said that the most Ireland could expect was £7.3 billion.</P>
    <P>We turn to the Taoiseach who is becoming a walking, monosyllabic sound-bite.  The one consistent feature throughout every crisis is that he keeps grinning.  He must take ultimate responsibility for this humilating fiasco.  He has shown himself to be smug, complacent, careless and arrogant.  He has brazenly kept shifting the goal posts since Edinburgh. He has led a Government that has consistently and deliberately disguised the doubts raised over the existence of this EC money.  His bungling has turned the National Development Plan into a badly made can of dog food.  If one knew what went into it one would not even give it to one's favourite poodles on the Government backbenches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Members should not indulge in personalities. It is quite acceptable and in order to be critical politically but not of personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was particularly subtle.  He landed from a helicopter to open a school in Galway and <Col N="468" /> was asked if it was wrong for Government members to say that things were in the bag when they should not. What did he respond?  He said that the Tánaiste acted in good faith, when it was quite clear that it was he who had made the assertion at all stages that the money was in the bag. This sorry saga epitomises his style of Government.  The Taoiseach has created a rift we can ill afford between Dublin and Brussels on issues such as Aer Lingus and the GATT deal.  The assurances we heard today that Jacques Delors would draw down this money are worthless. Commissioner Millan made it absolutely clear last week when asked whether we would draw down the £7.8 billion he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He said, &ldquo;It would be wrong to have a misunderstanding on this point&rdquo;. The economic loss to Ireland is £640 million. For every pound in that plan the private sector was to put up 47p so that the loss is now £940 million which is more than the 1 per cent income levy and on the Government's own target it is a loss of 10,000 jobs.  When the 1993 figures are added to the present plan they amount to £16.4 billion and not £20 billion as claimed.</P>

This was our last opportunity but Spain took the lot.  They received 40 billion ECUs, leaving us high and dry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> In conclusion, this plan has become a national hoax.  It is a humiliating fiasco and the Taoiseach should stop hiding behind senior civil servants.  Above all else, the Government should not come back to this House, having lost £940 million, and ask the taxpayer to pick up the tab.  It would be much better if they were to tell the truth and dump some of the projects they can no longer afford rather than persist with this policy of high expenditure and high taxation which is crippling jobs and stifling enterprise.</P>

      <P>This motion gives me an opportunity to analyse the performance of the Government since its formation earlier in the year.  The one striking observation &mdash; I think it will not be lost on anybody in Ireland &mdash; which I share with many thousands of people relates to the arrogance displayed by this Government.  It is amazing that a Government in office such a short time should have developed this bad trait. Normally one associates arrogance with consistent responsibility for ruling the country; in other words, a party or parties in power for a considerable period.  This Government is entirely different.  Its birth was different &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; its upbringing is different and if it gets the chance to mature it is likely to be regarded as the most arrogant, self-centred, ego-based Government we have ever had.

However, the magic formula was hammered out and a Government was formed.

      <P>As a result, the people are paying heavily for that arrogance. Due to its poor foundation the <Col N="471" /> structure of this Government is shaky. The Taoiseach drew the first blood.  He needed a boost after the general election and so he convinced the people and the Fianna Fáil cumainn that he had performed miracles at the Edinburgh Summit.  He announced boldly that Ireland's Structural Funds were £8 billion over a six year period and said he was absolutely sure of that.  Nobody was more convinced of that than Deputy Spring and his cohorts.  When he became Tánaiste he appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to oversee the spending of the £8 billion.  The Labour Party were really in business as they had access to the loot.  They made wild election promises to Aer Lingus and believed the Structural Funds would pay for some of those promises.  The Minister of State did herself justice in regard to the task of consultation.  She became known as &ldquo;Minister moneybags&rdquo; and everywhere money was distributed she was there.  I sincerely hope there will be more money on the way, as the Government suggest, because she has spent considerable sums during the past six months.</P>
      <P>However, all is not well.  It is unlikely that the Tánaiste will ever forget the night of 20 July 1993.  He went to Brussels to bring home the bacon.  He was sure the deal for £7.84 billion was agreed.  I want to put it on the record of the House this afternoon that regardless of the methods used to decide on a deal in the small hours of the morning it is surprising that out of a group comprising the President of the EC Commission, a Minister, a Commissioner, a departmental secretary and an ambassador that nobody asked the next morning what was agreed.  If you bought a dog licence you would be issued with a receipt.  In a deal involving £7.8 billion someone must have taken a memo of what happened that night and if not it was gross incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plot thickened when the Government allowed a two-day debate here on the national plan.  That was the greatest insult ever inflicted on the people, the <Col N="472" /> Members of this House and more particularly on the thousands of committees throughout the country who spent weeks and months trying to ensure that their particular project was accorded priority, on the basis that we would obtain almost £8 billion.  The Government did not have the courage to say they were not sure of it.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on that occasion and they conned me into believing that the money was available.  The Tánaiste, sitting in the Minister's place last week, was uneasy; he was like a clucking hen.  He genuinely believed the bad news was coming his way and decided to spread it around.  For some peculiar reason he decided to meet Jacques Delors earlier this week to mend the fences.  He wanted to ensure that the Taoiseach was in the same gravy pan when he said: &ldquo;But I told the Taoiseach&rdquo;. The Tánaiste showed great incompetence.</P>
    <P>Over the years Government Ministers of all persuasions have put up a fine case for Ireland around the table in Brussels. Because of his shameful and devious behaviour the Tánaiste has dented the high esteem in which Irish people have been held and I believe this has done untold damage where it counts most to the future of the country.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford.</P>

      <P>I will not go over the ground that was covered by my colleagues. I have no confidence that this Government will deliver on the many promises of Structural Funds for Cavan-Monaghan made during the election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on Northern Ireland, Members spoke about the need to co-operate with Northern Ireland.  But what do we see?  A promise was made that Structural Funds would be spent on the routes to Northern Ireland. <Col N="473" /> However, in the National Development Plan the money will be spent on a road that comes out through Longford, up to Sligo and then back to Blacklion, linking up with Letterkenny.  This will force the people of Letterkenny to travel down to Sligo and Longford.  Obviously, the Taoiseach wants a good road to Longford. He succeeded in getting all of Counties Longford and Roscommon reclassified as severely handicapped areas while much of the area in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan which I represent has not been classified as a disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>On page 108 of the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i>, there is a promise that money will be spent on the M2 from Dublin to Donegal, but what it says is that the money will be spent on the road from Broomfield to Castleblayney. However, that project has already gone to tender and the moneys have already been committed to it.  This has nothing to do with the National Development Plan as this is already guaranteed.  There are no other proposals for my constituency in the plan, no water scheme for Monaghan town, no sewage scheme for Carrickmacross, no word of the extra money needed to extend the reclassification of areas as severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>How could anyone have confidence in the Taoiseach who looks after his own area by ensuring that moneys are provided for the roads and the railway?  If one goes South, it is noticeable that all other roads lead to Tralee.  I believe that this plan is totally biased, never mind that we do not know whether the allocation is £7.84 billion or £7.2 billion.</P>
    <P>The Government not only made a fiasco of the National Development Plan but also of the currency crisis.  Indeed a great many things that are happening now, such as low interest rates and the price of cattle, is not as a result of this Government but in spite of it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I condemn in the strongest possible manner the appalling cynicism displayed by the Opposition parties.  It is quite clear from the glee on their faces that they have taken delight in the fact that Ireland has not received the guaranteed amount of money it aspired to.  Since the debate on the Maastricht Treaty various Deputies have stated what we were likely to get from Brussels.  Deputy De Rossa claimed we would get £6 billion.  Before the Edinburgh Summit Deputy Cox said we would get £4.5 billion and the MEP Mr. John Cushnahan said it would be between £5 billion and £6 billion.  Premature comments were made on what we would get.</P>
      <P>I think the Opposition parties should accept the bona fides of the Government, of the Civil Service and the Ambassador and those who were present at the negotiations. The Dáil should present a unified front to Brussels and to the Commission stating what it feels we deserve.  In his opening address this morning the Taoiseach spelt out our excellent track record in drawing up and formulating a national plan of this kind. The return on the previous plan was very significant.  Indeed we received £600 million more than we were guaranteed in the last <i>tranche</i> of EC funds.  We received £3.4 billion instead of £2.8 billion and we spent £3.4 billion during the course of the last national plan.  I have no reason to doubt that the same process will recur during the lifetime of this plan.  Six years is a long time.  The quality of the plan submitted has been acknowledged by President Delors.  We must put the maximum number of projects forward to obtain the maximum drawdown of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Opposition's approach, and so is the country at large. The people looking at this charade are deeply disappointed.  The quality of the debate is poor, as are the metaphors and the language used.  I think the issue has <Col N="475" /> been dealt with childishly.  We need to get the best deal for the country at large and I have no doubt about what motivates the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. They have a genuine motivation to achieve the best results for Ireland and, indeed, we have achieved an excellent result compared with the performance of other countries in Europe.  The Greeks opposed the package and they were very annoyed that Ireland received such an excellent deal.  We are receiving more <i>per capita</i> than any of the other poorer countries.  That is a reflection of the quality of the Civil Service &mdash; I want to put that on record &mdash; and the ability of its personnel to prepare a plan that can obtain the maximum degree of funding. That is the reality.  Most objective commentators have acknowledged that Ireland has done extremely well and indeed much better than other disadvantaged countries in the Community.</P>
    <P>Members have referred to the bad relationship with the Commission.  We had battles before on our fishing and on our agricultural policy.  People are not going to start crying because of disagreements. That is the hard reality of political life and the hard reality of bargaining. I think such remarks are rather childish.  The Taoiseach said it was indicative of our inferiority complex that we were always being careful to be good boys.  It is regrettable that we have not conducted a qualitative analysis of the contents of the plan from many of the Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>I am particularly impressed by the very strong emphasis in the plan on human resources.  Over £3 billion is allocated to education, training and the vocational sector.  There is a percentage increase to this sector which underlines the stong commitment to young people in particular in this country.  It affords them an opportunity to be educated and to get the right training for employment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to look seriously at a new tier of third level education, which is developing very rapidly <Col N="476" /> with the development of post leaving cert courses, vocational preparation and training programmes and VTOS schemes.  Up to 10,000 people are participating in these schemes which are outside the conventional university and regional technical college structure.  I think a very radical revolution has been taking place.  This sector of third level education requires national recognition as well as national funding in structures, institutions and facilities.  The participants in these programmes should be provided with some financial assistance and I appeal to the Government to look at that sector.  A great many young people who are qualifying want to gain greater vocational experience and training. Many of these programmes are market driven and relate directly to employment.  For that reason they very much deserve assistance from the Structural Funds.  I want to stress this point because it is indicative of the Government's commitment to people.  This is a people driven plan.  It is about people, and employment and represents an endeavour to come to terms with the significant problems facing us.  The demographic position is such that during the next ten to 15 years we will have a high entry rate into the labour market.  We have a large number of people on social welfare benefit, depending on a limited and contracting productive sector.  The plan endeavours to deal with those structural difficulties in our economy and that is reflected in the large amount of money which has been allocated to human resources.  It indicates also that investment in people and human resources is as important, if not more so, than investment in infrastructure.  That is a welcome development in this plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at this vote of no confidence in the Government based on the National Plan. The Opposition is inclined to be cynical and tawdry in its approach to the £7.2 billion.  We thought the House would fall down around us last week with the attitude <Col N="477" /> of the Opposition and of course the star performer was Deputy De Rossa.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Martin, for allowing me to share his time.</P>
      <P>The antics of the Opposition leave much to be desired.  The public recognise the benefits and advantages of the National Development Plan.  At the end of the plan we will have achieved £20 billion, made up of £8 billion plus what will be provided by the State and the private sector.  The European Community recognises that this is one of the best documents ever presented to the community from an Irish Government.  It is well structured and presents its targets. We are proud of our success in Europe, where we are recognised as a country on which the Community can depend for producing programmes and achieving targets.</P>
      <P>Before referring to those on the benches opposite, I want to recall some home truths.  The National Development Plan is the most significant capital development programme in the history of this state.  It is committed to generating 200,000 jobs during the period of the plan.  It is imaginative, practical and broad in both scope and vision.  There is more vision in the plan than was generated by those on the benches opposite for many years.  Their carping here today and last week carried with it the unmistakable whiff of sour grapes.  I have no doubt they are jealous and envious of this plan.  They would rather see this job generating plan sabotaged than have the decency or ethical fibre to lend support to it in the national interest &mdash; and members of that party talk a great deal about the national interest.  The concept of the national interest is alien to them. Self-interest is their collective motto and guiding light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is about much more than the national plan; it is about having confidence in the Government.  I have absolute confidence in the Government.  When it was originally formed I was somewhat sceptical but that is no longer the case. This is a forward looking and effective <Col N="478" /> Government with a deep commitment to the wellbeing of the people of this island.</P>

      <P>If there is no confidence in this Government one can only make the presupposition that there is an alternative Government on the benches opposite.  There is no harm in looking at the components of such a would-be Government.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael are but a shadow of their former selves, with no visible policies or direction.  Last week we saw the publication of the Fine Gael rescue package and they were fortunate it was published in the same week they raised a storm in this House.  That package, which was published in the form of a commission report, confirmed what we already know &mdash; that the party is in a shambles and incapable of running itself not to mention being fit to govern.  Fine Gael has a long way to go before it is capable of governing. The electorate are well aware of that fact and so too is Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Democratic Left is a small group of TDs in search of an identity who are only too willing to exploit any political situation or cause in their never-ending search for a headline.  I have a salutary message for the Democratic Left, who presume to care a great deal about the underprivileged in our society.  This Government will do more for the less well off in one term in office than Democratic Left will accomplish in its political lifetime.  That is an unavoidable fact.  The Progressive Democrats, who <Col N="479" /> confuse pompous self-righteousness with real ethics, may have changed its leader but its colours remain the same &mdash; self-satisfied, technocratic and, above all, uncaring.  Those three parties came together last week to create a storm in this House in an alliance which we have never seen or heard in the history of this House.  It is remarkable that this motley crew, with all their glaring differences, have managed to come together at all.  Opportunism makes for strange bedfellows.</P>
    <P>The real confidence motion here today is in respect of our sorry Opposition, who have cause for shame because of their cynicism and opportunism.  This Government under the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, will continue to govern in an effective and caring manner.  That is the Fianna Fáil way.  It is our tradition and one we will continue to hold.</P>
    <P>We have had a buoyant agricultural sector under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh.  This has been one of the best years in Irish farming ever.  Cattle prices, headage payments and the milk sector, among others, have been doing well. There were some hiccups in the pig industry and because of weather conditions the harvest has not been as flourishing as we would like.  Nevertheless, in the agricultural sector the people of rural Ireland are delighted and attribute the success of agricultural development on this island to the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>

      <P>As this is a no confidence debate I would like to refer to the latest IBEC <i>Newsletter</i> published on 19 October. That association has no vested political interest, but it has a deep interest in the future development of this country. In regard to the National Development Plan and its confidence in this country for the next six years, that association states:</P>
      <P>The combined leverage of EC, public and private investment should make a significant contribution to economic growth and, in turn, employment.... There are positive and innovative features in the Plan.  These include: support for indigenous industry through sectoral initiatives; assistance for public transport, including mainline rail; and a strong commitment to a business development programme covering North/South.</P>
      <P>That article concludes:</P>
      <P>... the plan has potential over time to unlock considerable investment potential which should benefit the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That initiative to unlock the potential of people can only take place by having confidence in ourselves and in how this country will develop during the next five or six years.  The contributions from the Opposition during the past four or five <Col N="481" /> hours would depress most people listening to the debate.  In fact, people have confidence in this Government and in its ability to use wisely the funds we will receive between now and 1999.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from the west I am particularly pleased that the Government has ensured that the question of regionalisation is to the forefront of this plan. The west, as one of eight subregions, has the smallest population.  The area of land in Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway is vast but peripheral and there is migration from the region.  Under the ten programme groups, the west is tops with regard to agriculture in the estimated sub-regional breakdown of expenditure between now and 1999.  We are tops in agriculture, first in forestry, second in fisheries, third in tourism, second in environmental services and fourth in industry.  Accordingly, we get more than our fair share despite the fact that in the lead up to the publication of the National Plan there was much speculation because local councillors felt that the emphasis would not be on regionalisation but on flagship projects located along the east coast, particularly in Dublin.  However, the work done by Ministers, backed up by the permanent Civil Service, has resulted in a worthwhile, carefully thought out plan which will benefit the entire country over the lifetime of the plan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates referred to the National Plan as the &ldquo;national hoax&rdquo;.  The Deputy should reconsider those injudicious words.  Is he indicating that he will not look to the National Plan to promote some of the projects which will be pertinent to his constituency and that perhaps he will leave it to the Minister of State from Wexford to promote those projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Deputy John Bruton referred to the analogy of the newly qualified solicitor who would at least know that he should get something in writing and he berated negotiators in relation to the National Plan on that point.  Some people know better; they know that the EC works on an element of <Col N="482" /> trust.  Deputy Bruton and his colleagues should know that a newly qualified solicitor would not in effect bargain down his position but would haggle from a high point and hope to reach it.  That is basic negotiation whether one is in a cattle market or the High Court.  That is the way the negotiation was carried on by this Government and it should be commended on that, not be berated because some of the money slipped away.  As other Deputies have said we have achieved more per head of population than any other EC country.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have a cheek in calling into question confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party, when they do not seem to have confidence in themselves, if we are to believe newspaper reports in recent times and their policy document.  I was part of an all-party delegation which went to Brussels and by chance I was in Brussels; on the day the National Plan issued.  I challenge any of the Opposition Deputies who were part of that delegation to tell the people the attitude of Mr. Bruce Millan's <i>chef de cabinet</i> when we met on the afternoon following the launching of the plan.  I did not detect any unhappiness with the plan, in fact I gathered that they thought that it was a great plan. I challenge Opposition Deputies to say otherwise and I commend the plan to the House.</P>

      <P>The tone and contents of the Taoiseach's speech this morning reminded me of the tone of one of the first political meetings I ever attended with Deputy O'Malley in the Gaelic League Hall in Thomas Street in Limerick. Deputy O'Malley had arrived from Dublin to talk about the objectives of the campaign for the 1977 election and the was full of policy ideas.  Someone at the back of the hall stood up and said &ldquo;Dessie, don't mind all that policy from Dublin, just give us the balls and we'll <Col N="483" /> fire 'em&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach's address today had the same knockabout style about it. In his contribution the Taoiseach did not give any substantial information on the gaps in evidence, the gaps in time and the explanations which the House seeks in this debate today.  We have not yet had the answers to what went wrong, why we were misled in the course of debates last week in terms of what we expected to get.  The Government knew we would not get that amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney today said that the result for Ireland is a very good result and the issue of confidence is not about the result but about the manner in which it was presented and the amount of self delusion which went into certain figures which were worked on incessantly in political terms, to try to deliver some substance to match the delusion.  There was plain incompetence when this House was told of guaranteed amounts of money on the basis of understandings at the highest level and we discovered then on the eve of the fateful Commission meeting last week that we are talking about ranges of money, <i>fourchettes</i>.  Our international reputation will not affect those in Brussels, who will get on with their lives. We are only making fools of ourselves in this process and that is what we are discussing today.  The assurance of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance that Commission President Jacques Delors had made it quite clear he would look after us in the future was a somewhat hollow and amusing assurance. A week after the horse has bolted Mr. Jacques Delors will close the stable door.  Mr. Jacques Delors, who is to look after us in the future, could not do it when it mattered.  The same Mr. Jacques Delors on whose assurances for the future we are relying will not be in the Commission for the mid-term review.  He will leave the Commission at the end of 1994.  We are to accept the assurance of a man who will not be there, without having learned from the assurance we got from him last week as President of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including the <Col N="484" /> Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, said that the £2.86 billion or 3.672 billion ECUs which we were promised in 1989 for the 1989-1993 Community support framework worked so well that we got £3.4 billion.  I accept that figure and one can easily establish where the figure came from.  In 1989 the European Community set out a Community support framework for a five year structural spending programme between Brussels and Dublin.  I am sorry if the figures bore the Minister at this hour of the evening.</P>

      <P>Over five years the EC set out precisely in terms of ECUs what we could expect year by year.  That key agreed in October 1989 is the key that delivered most of the £3.4 billion spoken of in this House today.  Every year, to turn the 1989 prices into whatever mattered in the year in question, they used an inflation rate.  As a result, we will receive more than expected.  In addition, the ECUs had to be converted into Irish pounds.  Our allocation of £2.86 billion did not increase because we got a bigger slice of the cake or because someone else got less &mdash; we received what we were promised &mdash; rather, it increased when the rate of inflation across the European Community and exchange rate adjustments were taken into account.  Eventually, it increased to a figure of £3.2 billion. Under a different set of European initiatives, known as the Community Initiatives, we received a further £200 million, giving us an overall total of £3.4 billion. The figure agreed in October 1989 increased automatically, not because of political acumen, native charm or wit on the part of those who stalked the corridors of power in Brussels on behalf of this nation but rather because it was adjusted to take inflation and exchange <Col N="485" /> rate fluctuations into account.  The bottom line is that we only received what was in the bag in October 1989.  Conversely, we did not receive anything that was not in the bag at that time.</P>
      <P>The question we now have to ask ourselves is what numbers are currently being used.  The figure we are due to receive in 1993 was agreed in October 1989.  We did not receive one penny more at Edinburgh; we only received what was already in the bag since October 1989. One thing did happen at Edinburgh, that is, a Cohesion Fund was introduced and because of this we will receive more.  The first slice is to be paid this year.</P>
      <P>The question now is what is in the bag for the period 1994 to 1999.  Whatever it is will increase because of inflation and exchange rate fluctuations over a period of time.  Last week, when we were faced with a dilemma in Brussels &mdash; the Tánaiste was depicted in a cartoon stuck in the horns of a <i>fourchette</i>&mdash; the question was what the Commission would decide to put in the bag for the period 1994-99. The Commission decided to allocate Ireland, at constant 1994 prices &mdash; I am sorry for using technical terms but people, including the Taoiseach, have been playing with numbers &mdash; a sum of 5.62 billion ECU under the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the Guidance element of the Agricultural Fund.  When converted this amounts to £4.5 billion. That is the sum now in the bag from the Commission's meeting last week and the documentation has been published by the Commission.  In addition to this, we expect to receive two further slices under the Community Initiatives and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the National Development Plan the Government estimated that during the period of the plan 1994-99 we would receive £516 million under the Community Initiatives at 1993 prices.  At this stage, this appears to be a shade optimistic but we looked for the upper figure. The lower figure amounts to approximately 8 per cent of the figure agreed to last week, £363 million.  In regard to the Cohesion Fund there are two layers.  We <Col N="486" /> will receive between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the total funds available.</P>
    <P>The figures we will receive can now be predicted and are not surrounded by mystique, sophistry, obscurity or confusion. They can be measured and we will ultimately come up with the figures that we will receive.  I have prepared a detailed paper which I intend to lodge in the Oireachtas Library to clarify the matter which has been shrouded in fog for so long.  I do not mind if someone says that the figures are wrong because to err is human but at least it is transparent. If the figures are wrong, I want to know by how much.</P>
    <P>When we compare like with like, at 1993 prices, the bottom line is that the gap in the figures between what we will receive during the period 1994-99 and the figure included in the National Development Plan submitted to Brussels ranges between £897 million and £1,429 million in respect of EC funding alone.  Those are the figures which gave rise to this debate on the motion of no confidence. We cannot get away from the fact that there is a hole in the bucket.  Every pound made available by the European Community under the plan was to be matched with £1.50 from public and private sector sources in Ireland.  On this basis, there will be a shortfall of between £2.35 million and £3.5 million.  As I said, I intend to lodge that document in the Oireachtas Library and ask the Minister for Finance who gave us some numbers today to take it away and rubbish it, if he can.  I am not saying that there are no mistakes.  It is probably riddled with them, given that I had to do the sums in a hurry, but I am lodging it on the basis that there should be transparency.</P>
    <P>Several times the Taoiseach and others on the Government side quoted figures that I have used.  I also intend to lodge in the Oireachtas Library a lecture which I delivered on 7 February 1992, the day the Maastricht Treaty was signed, at the Henry Kennedy Memorial Lecture organised by the ICOS, the Irish Cooperative Organisation Society.  During that lecture I tried to predict what would happen and why.  I am proud to stand <Col N="487" /> over every detail and to say that the outturn is closer to the figure I predicted than to the figures predicted by my critics.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the debate during the past few weeks has been characterised on the Government side by obscurity, confusion and by attempts to bluff and confound the people by pulling figures from the air.  There is a need for transparency. We should deal with the true figures.  The Government failed to do this until it was faced with reality last week in Brussels.  That is the reason the Opposition will vote no confidence in the Government in terms of its ability to manage our affairs and its judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Until this week I always thought it was a disadvantage to be a newcomer in this House but now I am not so sure.  I will go further and say that it can be an advantage in the sense that one has not lost contact with the real world and the rules that apply in business. Let us suppose for one moment that Ireland was a plc, that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were executive directors of that plc, supported by a structure of programme managers which was not understaffed and that these executive directors entered negotiations of paramount importance to the company in terms of its long term future.  Do they ensure that a contract is written and agreed?  No, they do not.  Do they ensure that a civil servant is briefed to document what they believe has been agreed?  No, they do not.  Do they respond within hours, confirming the oral contract and placing their understanding on the record?  No, they do not.  When, as they see it, the other party to this oral agreement reneges and says in effect that they will not pay up, do they straightforwardly inform their shareholders of this fact?  No, they do not.  If any group of company directors behaved in this way they would be fired. Legal action could possibly be taken against them.  The business pages would record not just the irresponsibility and incompetence shown but the startling nature of it, because here we have it &mdash;&ldquo;GUBU, the Sequel&rdquo;, GUBU with <Col N="488" /> French subtitles and GUBU with a new star, the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>If it were not so tragic it would be funny, but it is not funny.  It is not funny to realise that all of the evidence needed to establish the truth was available for weeks.  All of the nay sayers were saying nay in no uncertain terms.  Bruce Millan was not hiding his dissenting certainties under any bushel.  Almost every civil servant at every level in Brussels was indicating that the figure being claimed in Ireland was rubbish.  The Press corps from Ireland out there were saying it. The international Press were saying it. What was the Tánaiste hearing?  Precious little, it now appears.  It is not because the information was not available to him. He was hearing precious little because he was choosing to hear precious little. Remember the three wise monkeys, seeing no evil, hearing no evil, speaking no evil.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs chose to adopt the &ldquo;hands over ears&rdquo; stance.  The evidence suggests that he not only heard the contradiction of his claims but communicated that contradiction to his Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We should stand back and examine the person and role of the man at the centre of this.  The Tánaiste is the second person in Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Minister Andrews knows all too well, is responsible for the maintenance of good overseas relationships. If that were not the most publicly prestigious role in Government I do not believe Deputy Spring would have chosen it, but choose it he did and in so choosing he took on the responsibilities and the ethics appending to his choice. According to his own words, the leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, knows days in advance of the announcement of the national plan that the sums on which the national plan is based no longer add up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yet he does not state this publicly.  Nor does he halt the launch of the now grievously flawed national <Col N="489" /> plan.  Instead he sits on the platform at the launch knowing that what is being presented to the Irish people is simply not true.  There is a word for that &mdash;&ldquo;shameful&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the weekend I was on a radio programme with Minister Eithne Fitzgerald and she did her considerable best to defend the indefensible sequence of events.  At one point she spoke of Deputy Spring as a man of integrity.  At the time I was inclined to nod, because I have always thought of the Tánaiste in those terms.  But since then I have been shaking my head a good deal about that particular point, because integrity is not something one gets at the beginning of one's career that stays put throughout; it is not inborn, not a genetic inheritance but something to be defended and reaffirmed in a million decisions, small and large, made every day.  It is always in the present tense.  It is no use claiming one had it yesterday or the day before.  All that matters is whether we can see it today.  Above all, integrity is found in actions, not claims made by someone else on one's behalf, and not in personal assertions.  If we are looking for integrity in the actions of the Tánaiste we will not find it in this instance.  I do not like saying this because I would infinitely prefer to deal with policy issues rather than personal performance.</P>

      <P>In this instance personal performance has made nonsense of policy.

There has been a folk culture established through the generations of Fianna Fáil as the &ldquo;fancy footwork&rdquo; people, the &ldquo;three card trick&rdquo; party of Irish politics.

I would be the last person to argue with him in the context of his knowledge in this regard.  I have no doubt but that the Minister for Finance will be at the head of a queue of people at the Library door waiting to look at his document or documents, but I would not suggest for one moment that the Minister for Finance would rubbish his document. Without in any way patronising the Deputy, I think his contribution was excellent, but it was ruined by the interjection of the political charges made, more particularly against the Taoiseach. No doubt Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Health, will deal with the charges made by Deputy Keogh against his colleague and my colleague in Government, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that we are full of confusion, bluff and obscurantism flies in the face of the facts. Deputy Carey is one of the longer serving Members in the House.  He will remember that in December last, as Minister for <Col N="491" /> Foreign Affairs, I was at the Edinburgh European Council.  It is unfortunate indeed that this debate has been interspersed with hysteria and not a little amnesia.  The roots of the current allocation of European Community Structural and Cohesion Funds to this country are to be found in that Edinburgh European Council of last December.  I know, because, as I said, I was there.  Indeed, I was privileged to be there as Minister for Foreign Affairs on a team ably led by the Taoiseach and including my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In the recent evolution of the European Community the Edinburgh Summit was crucial and Deputy Cox recognised that.  Edinburgh was the meeting of the European Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers that finally put real flesh and blood, as it were, on the bones provided in the so-called Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Edinburgh Council was twofold: to adopt the Community budget for the years 1993-99 and to agree the overall outline of Structural and Cohesion Funds for the same period.  The basic objective of the Edinburgh Summit was to breathe life into the formal decisions and legal aspirations of the Maastricht Treaty, which was then on the way to its ultimate adoption by the Community's member states.  Let us not forget the immense economic and political benefits Maastricht involved for the Community as a whole, but more particularly for Ireland, as one of the poorer, peripheral member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty involved: a timetable for movement to the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union; linked to that, a much stronger and more explicit Treaty commitment to the cohesion of poorer, peripheral member states with the more prosperous regions; new Treaty-backed Community initiatives in, for example, health and education; and an enhanced and better coordinated role for the Community in the area of foreign policy, while at the same time leaving us with full rights of determination <Col N="492" /> of our traditional policy of military neutrality.  These were the noble aspirations of the Maastricht Treaty and as Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time I was proud to recommend them to the people.  I was even more proud when, after Denmark's hesitation, Ireland led the way for Europe with a resounding two-to-one majority in favour of the new Treaty.  That was on 18 June last year, an historic day.</P>
    <P>However, it was necessary in the national interest to ensure that, in particular, the financial measures necessary to implement Maastricht were put in place quickly by the Community.  After all, we had committed ourselves in the referendum campaign to a doubling of Structural and Cohesion Funds, to a figure then of £6 billion, and we had to deliver on that commitment to the people.  That is crucial to this debate.  I know the debate ranges over wider issues than that, but it was brought on by the need for the Opposition to bring themselves to light in some way and to criticise the Government in the context of a confidence motion.  I see nothing wrong with that.  If it gives the Opposition heart, so much the better for democracy and so much for the need for continuing tensions in this House, tensions which have been missing since the last general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue to serve as well as we are serving at present. That is why the primary task facing the Taoiseach, myself and the Minister for Finance at the Edinburgh European Council last December was to ensure that the Community leaders agreed the decisions needed to give real, financial muscle to the Maastricht Treaty.  That task was accomplished through teamwork and to good effect.</P>
      <P>I recall that Prime Minister Gonzalez of Spain worked effectively at the summit to ensure that the overall allocation earmarked for the four so-called cohesion countries, including Ireland, was maximised. But the Taoiseach was effective too in achieving assurances that we would get an allocation in line with what we had been able to obtain in Structural Funds over the previous five years.  We achieved that outcome on the basis of a recognition of the quality and effectiveness of our previous National Plan and our track record in maximising our take-up of Community funds generally.</P>
      <P>That was the fundamental understanding agreed at Edinburgh and subsequent events have not altered those basic principles.  The Government's task from that point onwards was to ensure that the overall resources and the shares of resources agreed at Edinburgh were put into effect for the next seven years, and that, quite simply, is what we have done.</P>
      <P>It was on the basis of that understanding and those principles that the Taoiseach on returning from Edinburgh was able to assure the people that a massive increase in EC Structural and Cohesion Funds had been achieved for Ireland.  Up to that point the largest figure predicted by even the most pessimistic opponents in this House had been £6 billion.  Today we know we are guaranteed a minimum of £7.3 billion in EC funding, a far cry indeed from the gloomy predictions being bandied about as we headed for Edinburgh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be amazed at the end of seven or eight years that the amount will be in excess of £8 billion.  I am making no political promises in that regard but I am making a prediction that, I think, will be realised.  More importantly, on the basis of our past experience we know that we can expect the ultimate figure to be considerably higher.  We know that the EC allocations under the National Plan for the period 1989 to 1993 exceeded target by more than one-fifth. On this occasion if our additional improvement is only half that of the 1989-93 period &mdash; and surely that is a conservative assumption &mdash; we will have no difficulty in reaching the target figure of £8 billion by 1999, as we agreed in outline at Edinburgh.  That is the foundation the Taoiseach and his team laid at Edinburgh. It is for that reason that the Government is confident about the National Development Plan, confident that it can and will deliver on its detailed programmes.  The National Plan is a comprehensive, integrated attempt to focus more than £20 billion in investment over the next six years, with the aim of delivering 200,000 new jobs.</P>
      <P>The marine sector is ready to play its part in delivering its share of the investment and jobs envisaged in the plan. Most of these jobs will be based on the development of indigenous resources. They will be secure and well-paid, many of them will be in locally-based and cooperative ventures and they will bring new hope and vigour to the most peripheral regions of our country.  As a Fianna Fáil Minister in this Government, I am pleased to be giving tangible effect to the kind of economic philosophy traditionally espoused by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise and fully support the right of every Member of this House to scrutinise and criticise.  That has been well done in this debate.  But there comes a time, too, to move on, to recognise what <Col N="495" /> has been achieved and to build on it. Now is that time.  Now is the time for the House to re-affirm its confidence in a Taoiseach and the Government that has delivered and will deliver on its commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence and for the Marine, suggested that I might deal with the personalised abuse of the Tánaiste by Deputy Keogh, but unfortunately neither the Deputy nor any Member of her party is in the House and therefore I will not waste my valuable time in saying anything other than that the record of service and personal integrity of the Tánaiste will be remembered long after the personages opposite are long forgotten.</P>
      <P>I find it ironic that a Government which has been hailed as the most effective in recent years should face a motion of confdence so early in its term of office.  My area of responsibility to this Government is health and I welcome this opportunity to put on the record of this House the progress made in the past nine months on the delivery of a major programme of developments in the health services. When both parties in Government sat down to write the Programme for a Partnership Government and to frame the 1993 budget this priority on health was first and foremost in our minds.  The emphasis on health in the programme and the performance of this Government in the past nine months in the health areas has reflected this high priority.</P>
      <P>This afternoon I will present to the House the evidence that both the public and this House can have confidence in this Government's stewardship of the health services.  Confidence means that this Government is meeting its commitments to the health service as laid out in the programme; confidence means that this Government can be relied upon to act decisively in times of crisis; and confidence means that this Government is actively developing and improving our health sevices and planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Perhaps the greatest indicator of the single minded approach of this Government to the implementation of the programme is in the all-out attack we have mounted on hospital waiting lists.  Long waiting times for surgical procedures is perhaps the area of greatest inequity within our health system.  It is a source of great satisfaction to me that, as Minister for Health, I have been able to make major inroads into this problem.</P>
    <P>The partnership programme committed this Government to a major action programme on hospital waiting lists.  To this end £20 million was provided in the 1993 Budget.  In May I was able to announce a programme of 17,254 extra surgical procedures to be carried out this year.  In the vast majority of specialities the targets I have set are greater than the number of people on waiting lists for more than a year.  In the area of children's ENT and ophthalmology all children waiting in excess of six months will be dealt with.  In addition, as a result of a major investment in cardiac surgery in Dublin and Cork, there will be a 46 per cent increase in annual throughput of cardiac cases nationally.  My Department is in the process of completing a midterm review of the waiting list initiative and I am happy to say that most agencies, with one or two exceptions, are meeting their targets and I am now confident that well in excess of 17,000 extra procedures will have been completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In other areas the Government has shown that we are not afraid to tackle issues which are sensitive or potentially controversial.  In following through on the commitment to develop services for people wih HIV-AIDS and to be more frank and open in the message about prevention, I was aware that what was proposed would meet with resistance from some quarters.  The Government's responsibility in this difficult area is to those who suffer from this dreaded disease and to those who are at risk of exposure to it.  It was for this reason that I did not hesitate to bring forward the frank and upfront HIV-AIDS prevention programme which was launched in May <Col N="497" /> of this year.  It was also for this reason that I finally brought to an end the debate on the availability of condoms through the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>I have made no secret as Minister for Health of my desire to strengthen and develop the caring aspects of our health services.  An area of particular interest to me in this respect is the services provided for those with a mental handicap.  The programme commits the Government to an ongoing programme of improvement in services for those with a mental handicap. An additional £8.5 million was made available this year for this purpose, bringing total expenditure to £217 million. This is by far the largest single allocation ever made to services in this area and is a hallmark of the Government's determination to give a very high priority to the development of these important services. I am satisfied that this injection of £8.5 million will provide a real improvement in the services and I intend to build on this in the coming year.</P>
    <P>My commitment to a health service with a strong tradition of caring is also underlined by the provision this year of sufficient funds to implement the Nursing Homes Act.  The Act came into effect on 1 September this year.  In addition to new standards of care and accommodation in private nursing homes, a new system of subvention payments has been introduced from that date.</P>
    <P>In the past week yet another programme commitment was fulfilled.  I was very happy last Wednesday to approve and witness the signing of the main contract for the construction of the Tallaght Hospital.  In my first week in office I gave the green light for the commencement of the tendering process.  Since then the Tallaght Hospital Board and my Department have worked extremely hard to ensure that construction would commence before the end of this month.  It will commence tomorrow.  Perhaps the most gratifying aspect of the process to get the Tallaght Hospital up and running has been the agreement reached between the three component hospitals, the Adelaide, Meath and National Children <Col N="498" /> Hospitals on future management structures for the hospital and the maintenance of the important ethos of the Adelaide.  Tallaght will be the largest hospital project ever undertaken by the State and it is my ambition that the new hospital will be operational within four years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most shocking incident in the health services since I became Minister has been the tragic Kilkenny incest case which focused the nation's attention on services for children in the area of prevention and detection of abuse.  In response to the public outcry following the case I set up an inquiry headed by Catherine McGuinness SC. Within six weeks the McGuinness report has been accepted by the Government and a commitment given to provide £35 million over the next three years to implement fully the Child Care Act.  This year the Government made available £5 million to begin immediate implementation of the Act.  I would remind the House that this is the largest ever investment of resources in the child care area in a single year.  It demonstrates in the most tangible way possible the commitment of this Government to the development of a range of services and supports to children at risk and their families.</P>
    <P>All sides of this House have demanded action on the issue of the expanding public service pay bill.  Action requires us to be fair, and also to be firm and resolute.  The Government is committed to pay restraint and it has made it clear that any solution to, for example, the ambulance drivers' dispute must be in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  There is a responsibility on behalf of the Opposition parties in this House, if they are going to argue for pay restraint, to support the Government in this respect.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Improving our health service is not just about increasing available manpower; it is about demanding and achieving quality at every level and ensuring that every pound is spent to maximum effect.  To this end I have expanded my Department's capacity to support value for <Col N="499" /> money initiatives at agency level.  I have encouraged the development of comprehensive case-mix criteria to be used in the yearly allocations to health boards and hospital authorities.  I have sought and achieved savings in the contentious area of drug prices.  In August my Department concluded a new three year agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which achieved an effective 6 per cent reduction in drug prices and a price freeze for the duration of the agreement.  It has been estimated that the cumulative effect of these concessions will yield annualised savings of £15 million to the Exchequer.  In addition to these savings on the purchase price of drugs, I am optimistic that the agreement worked out last December with the Irish Medical Organisation on general practitioner prescribing will yield additional savings.</P>
    <P>The major task for my Department for the remainder of this year is the completion of the national health strategy. The strategy, which I hope to bring to Government at the end of the year, will review the state of health of the nation and set out clear policies, plans for their implementation and specific targets.  It will set the agenda for my Department for the next four years and tackle such issues as reform of health board structures, the further development of primary care and health promotion.  A key element of the strategy will be the introduction of an annual health status report setting out the key health indicators and a review of progress made in reaching targets.  I am prepared to state honestly where we are in terms of our nation's health and what we have to do to change things for the better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, what I have set out for the House this evening has been the beginnings, the early steps, of a virtual sea change in our health services and the way they are run.  This is a Government committed to change.  One of the yardsticks with which to measure that commitment is the progress made so far in implementing the programme for a partnership Government.  I feel privileged to <Col N="500" /> have been associated in the past nine months with one of the most productive periods ever in the history of the Department of Health.  By the yardstick of the programme, or indeed any yardstick, change is taking place and will continue.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition have argued, and I presume will continue to argue, that this Government does not deserve the confidence of this House.  In ignoring the achievements of this Government, not just in the health area but in every area of public life, I wonder what this debate is all about.  With poor opinion poll ratings and damning reports on everything from leadership to party finances, is this debate really anything more than a last ditch bid by the Opposition to gain the credibility and the confidence of the electorate?</P>

      <P>I will try to be as brief as possible.  The real question under discussion in this debate is not whether we sought and got a promise for a certain amount of money from the European Commission but rather why information which was available to the Taoiseach and at least two Ministers was not brought to the attention of this House during the debate on the National Development Plan a little over a week ago.  The reason the Opposition parties tabled a motion of no confidence is that it is normal in similar circumstances in other democracies to call for the resignation of the people concerned.  It is well known &mdash; this has been confirmed since &mdash; that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and at least one, if not two, Ministers had information which they withheld from the House during the debate on the National Development Plan, a plan which they knew in their hearts could not be delivered upon in full.  They further complicated that charade today when they said they hoped and expected to get the <Col N="501" /> full amount and had every confidence that we would get it.  That is the most extraordinary double speak I have ever heard &mdash; I suppose one could call it &ldquo;partnership speak&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Commissioner Millan has been a tough negotiator, with whom we have had some differences over the years, but for whom we also have respect. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs did negotiate with him on 19 July, albeit unsuccessfully, until President Delors took over from him on that night.  Unfortunately, Commissioner Millan's position was coloured by his original strongly held view that Ireland should only get about £5.5 billion.</P>
      <P>That is a little bit like blaming everyone else around the table except oneself.  The only people charged with this responsibility were the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.  It was their job to negotiate.  I hope they can carry out any future discussions in a more dignified fashion.  The impression created abroad of Irish politicians chasing around Europe with a shawl and a begging bowl looking for alms is beginning to wear thin in the European circuit.  If we are to improve our image abroad, we will have to change our attitude in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated on television that he fully endorsed the Tánaiste's handling of the affair.  I have no doubt he did because he was equally culpable.  It was extraordinary that everyone seemed to be looking for a victim to blame.  The only people to blame are those who went forward, allegedly secured a deal, returned home, announced a deal and withheld information in the final analysis which was crucial to a debate which took place in this House two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>In any other democracy people who acted in this manner would be asked to resign and that is why the Opposition parties have tabled a motion of no confidence. We do not have confidence in the Government's ability to negotiate or to continue in Government.</P>

      <P>I do not have any regard for the ability of this Government to get us out of the troubles that are daily getting deeper.  The problem is not the amount of money that we have received from Brussels.  We have made great gains since our entry into the EC.  However, we cannot obtain the truth from the Government in regard to the full amount we will receive.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, referred to £7.3 billion but in fact the amount is £7.2 billion, which is a substantial amount of money.  The National Plan was based on a figure of £7.84 billion, despite the fact that the Government knew that the money would not be forthcoming.  That was a false premise.  The people were misled.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who had responsibility for this plan, stated in the Seanad in reply to the debate on the National Plan that &ldquo;half a billion was neither here nor there&rdquo;.</P>

It was the thinking around the Cabinet table that £500 million is neither here nor there.  If £1 billion &mdash; and that is what the final amount would be &mdash; is not significant to the Government, to the ordinary people of this country it amounts to a shortfall of £1,000 million.  That is outrageous. That is the type of book-keeping that has this country in its present mess and which has ordinary people believing there are millions of pounds available if one has the right contacts.  That came to light with the various scandals that broke in recent years and months.  If half a billion pounds is neither here nor there, why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate is about confidence in the Government.  I have every confidence that this Government is working well, is achieving real change in Irish society and will continue over the next four years to implement in full the Programme for Government which it has set out as its objective.</P>
      <P>Already this Government has brought about great change, in nine short months in office.  Issues of social reform have convulsed this House and this country for the past twenty years.  This Government did not just talk &mdash; it delivered.</P>
      <P>It implemented reform of the contraception laws to bring this country into the twentieth century and face honestly the challenge posed by AIDS; it reformed the laws on homosexuality to give basic rights to this minority of our citizens and it took prompt action to tackle child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Government must be judged on how it delivers for those who are most disadvantaged.  Our contribution in Government has been one of action.  As outlined by the Minister for Health £8.5 million has been provided for extra services for those with a mental handicap; a successful £20 million initiative has been implemented to tackle hospital waiting lists; there has been a fourfold increase in the local authority housing programme <Col N="506" /> to tackle the underlying problems of homelessness; a charter of tenants' rights has been introduced, with a legal right to a rent book and basic minimum housing standards; there has been a restoration of social welfare rights to the elderly and disabled; children's allowances have been increased to £20 a month and additional resources in education, targeted at disadvantaged communities, have been provided.</P>
    <P>This commitment to tackling disadvantage and addressing the underlying causes of poverty and unemployment is a central theme of the National Plan and the Government intend to implement that plan in full.  I am confident that with the quality of our plan and our programmes, a quality that has already been publicly acknowledged in Brussels by both Bruce Millan and Jacques Delors, Ireland will ultimately draw down in full on that plan.  As late as Tuesday President Delors has again reiterated that based on the quality of our plan it will be possible to draw down in full on the undertakings given on 19 and 20 July last.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of this House my confidence in the integrity of the Tánaiste and the senior public servants who witnessed the deal made with the Commission President on the night of 19 and 20 July.  I have every hope and confidence that it will be delivered on at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The indicative allocation notified by Brussels is, as acknowledged in public statements from Brussels, a baseline figure, not a final quota.  The EC document quotes a range of figures, from 8.1 billion ECU to 9.3 billion ECU &mdash; with the top figure equivalent to £7.84 billion in 1994 prices.  I am still confident that based on the quality of our plan and our programmes, Ireland will at the end of the day achieve the top of that range.</P>
    <P>In all the debate both in this House and in the Senate, there has been no serious or fundamental challenge to the actual strategy or detailed contents of the plan.  That strategy is based on a commitment to jobs.  It is aimed at securing the best long term return to this country from the investment programme, <Col N="507" /> to best enhance Ireland's economic potential for output and jobs when the last ECU has been spent.</P>
    <P>This plan marks a radical departure in its approach to economic development. It contains new thinking, new ideas, and it draws on the lessons learned from experience.  New elements in this plan are its focus on tackling disadvantage and poverty, its emphasis on gender balance, its practical concern for the environment and its strong regional dimension.</P>
    <P>One of my central concerns was that this plan would be one that would reach into the heart of every community, in particular to those areas most blighted by chronic unemployment and poverty.  The local development programme is an imaginative new initiative which aims to rebuild the economic potential of Ireland's worst unemployment black spots.  Over £900 million is being committed to specific targeted action on unemployment and to resourcing local communities to realise their job potential.</P>
    <P>This Government has also embarked on a programme of radical reform aimed at broadening our democracy.  In the matter of Oireachtas reform the committee system has delivered on a record number of Bills being processed through this House since the Government took office.  The Ethics in Public Office Bill to be introduced this session will ensure transparency and accountability in public life, give assurances to the public that in this House, in Government, in the public service and the public sector, it is the business of the public which is being transacted, not the private business of those concerned.</P>
    <P>The new committee system is increasing the accountability of the public service to the House.  I have prepared a preliminary draft of a freedom of information Bill which will ensure greater accountability and openness in our system of Government.  I am engaged in a detailed study of how similar provisions operate elsewhere so that our legislation can have the benefit of best practice.  I hope to engage in maximum consultation <Col N="508" /> before putting final proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, the new structures set up by Government are working well and are delivering on change.  They are ensuring that partnership in Government works for this country, respecting the identities and aspirations on both sides, while delivering on a common agreed programme.</P>
    <P>I ask this House to vote confidence in the continuance of this Government and in that Government programme.</P>

There may have been other trips to North Korea, but I do not think £100,000 was sought there.

Our critics have not had the graciousness to acknowledge that Ireland is guaranteed, even at that minimum, an allocation of EC aid of the order of £2,000 for every man, woman and child in this country to the end of the century. I might point out that that is well ahead of the allocations being made to other cohesion countries &mdash; for example, £1,600 <i>per capita</i> in the case of Greece; £1,550 <i>per capita</i> in the case of Portugal; £1,300 <i>per capita</i> for the Objective One regions in Spain.  Therefore, we are being given an unrivalled opportunity to improve the capacity of our economy in the longer term and to provide jobs that are so badly needed.</P>

      <P>This National Development Plan is very much about jobs. Anyone who has a basic understanding of the needs of this economy as we enter into the next century knows that we need these funds to increase living standards and increase the numbers at work.  When one looks at the policy-driven party called the Progressive Democrats who say &ldquo;Put the money in the bank&rdquo;, it gives one an idea of the level of policy input one can expect from that new crusading leadership.  For a while they were so self-confident within that party they even forgot about God, but then all of a sudden, he resigned a few weeks ago.</P>

      <P>Over the past few years our economic performance has exceeded that of our EC partners, but our needs are greater than theirs.  In particular, unemployment remains higher as a proportion of our labour force than in any other EC country with the exception of Spain.  Our national rate of labour force increase is well above the EC average. Although there has been some catching up in recent years, income per head in Ireland remains well below the EC average. Reducing unemployment and narrowing this gap in living standards are two of our foremost economic challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make this point, because I know Deputy Carey is in here for one reason <Col N="512" /> and one reason only?  His leader made an outrageous suggestion that the performance of this Government had in some way diminished the prospects for the State aid being proposed for Aer Lingus or that our position had been damaged in some way in that regard.  I want to make it very clear to the House, given the seriousness of the situation facing us, that that suggestion is in no way accurate.  Indeed, it is an outrageous slur on the professionalism and independence of the transport and competition divisions within the Commission. Even in recent days my Department's contact with the Commission has shown increasing positive progress which belies the inferences being made today.  Agreement by the EC to our proposed equity injection into Aer Lingus is a completely separate matter and is in no way related to the issue of national development funds.  I want to make that point quite clearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter this evening and I also thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond.  This is an unusual case involving a native of my county who worked for many years in Great Britain but returned home last year because he was out of work due to an occupational injury.  He contacted the Irish Embassy in London to obtain the relevant regulations governing the reimportation of his goods and property into the country and at all stages endeavoured, as is proved by documentary evidence, to comply with the regulations. However, a technical breach of the regulations occurred and the first this man knew of it was when he was stopped on the road and had his car seized when returning from a fishing trip.  This man suffers from a disability as a result of his occupational injury and depends almost totally on a motor vehicle for transport. As he lives in a rural area the ownership of a car is crucial.</P>
      <P>The man acted in good faith at all times.  He contacted the Irish Embassy and tried to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>Perhaps he tried too hard, because it was the documentary evidence which he had so diligently kept and submitted to Customs and Excise officials which, in a technical sense, tripped him up.  I accept that rules and regulations must be applied, but they must be applied in a humane manner and one which affords understanding to individual cases of hardship and difficulty.  Therefore, given this man's disability, his dependence on his car and the fact that he would have been prepared, had he been approached in a less heavy handed manner, to meet with the relevant officials to resolve the matter, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the situation is resolved amicably and the car returned to him at the earliest opportunity so that he may go about his business peacefully and quietly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gallagher for giving me an opportunity to say a few words generally about this scheme and I assure him that I will personally examine the case he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly outline the rationale behind the still relatively new vehicle registration system which has been in force for only ten months.  Excise duty on motor vehicles was replaced from 1 January 1993 by a first registration charge aimed to maintain revenue from motor <Col N="519" /> vehicle taxation at an equivalent revenue neutral level.  The new vehicle registration tax is based on the open market selling price and is designed to ensure the same amount of tax is charged on all vehicles of a similar value in Ireland, irrespective of whether they are imported or originally purchased within the State and whether new or used.  The non-discriminatory nature of the registration tax is a requirement of the EC Single Market and indeed the neutrality of the system as between different vehicles of the same value makes it inherently fairer than the system it replaced.  Needless to say the scheme will experience teething problems.</P>
    <P>Since 15 September 1993 Revenue have intensified their crackdown on unregistered vehicles.  Road checks were carried out throughout the country and vehicles on which VRT had not been paid have been seized.  A number of Deputies have raised that matter with me.  Revenue have concentrated in particular on Irish residents who should not be driving foreign registered vehicles.  There are severe monetary penalties and possible jail sentences for persons convicted of VRT offences.  National newspaper advertisements have drawn peoples' attention to the law in this regard.  In 1992 the Revenue Commissioners seized 1,529 vehicles.  Between 1 January 1993 and 14 October 1993, the latest data available, 1,309 vehicles were seized. Under Revenue's special nationwide enforcement exercise, which took place between 15 and 28 September 1993, 278 vehicles were seized.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by Deputy Gallagher, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in May 1993 the person concerned visited the vehicle registration office at Tullamore and sought to register a car without payment of vehicle registration tax under the reliefs available to persons transferring their residence to the State.  During the interview he indicated that he had been resident in the State for approximately two years.  The car had been obtained for him by his son-in-law who is resident in <Col N="520" /> the UK and imported into the State in December 1992.  He was advised that he would not qualify for transfer of residence facilities as he did not meet the condition that the person transferring his residence to the State must have had possession and use of the car outside the State for at least six months before the date of transfer of residence.  This condition is set out in the Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993.</P>
    <P>He was advised of the amount of vehicle registration tax payable on the car.  He was also advised of the legal requirement to declare the car within one working day of its arrival in the State.  At this stage, I understand, he terminated the interview and left the office.  A few days later he again visited the vehicle registration office.  When he refused to register the car and pay the VRT due he was warned that he was committing an offence and the car was liable to seizure. The car in question was encountered being driven by the person concerned by officers of the Customs and Excise on 11 October 1993.  As they had reasonable suspicion that the VRT on the vehicle had not been paid they detained it for further investigation using powers under section 142 (3) of the Finance Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Subsequent investigations indicated that the person concerned applied for and was granted transfer of residence facilities in respect of his household goods in January 1992.  These facilities were granted on foot of a declaration signed by the person concerned in which he stated that he had surrendered the tenancy of a local authority house in the UK in January 1992 and in return had obtained financial assistance from the London Borough of Hackney Housing Authority to purchase a house in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>The officers were satisfied that the person concerned was a resident of the State and had failed to pay VRT due by him on the car in question.  This is an offence under section 139 (3) (d) of the Finance Act, 1992.  The penalty on summary conviction for this offence is £1,000 and the car is liable to forfeiture.  In this <Col N="521" /> case the car was offered to the person concerned for a compromise sum of £400 in lieu of prosecution.  This offer has not yet been availed of and the car remains in the custody of Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>On 15 October 1993, while investigations were continuing, the person concerned visited the vehicle registration office at Tullamore and submitted an application for relief from payment of VRT on the basis that he had transferred his residence to the State on 10 December 1992.  This is at present under consideration. However, he will be required to provide evidence to substantiate his claim.</P>
    <P>The nature of the disability of the person concerned is not known, but I will communicate with the Deputy in that regard.  The person involved has not applied to the Revenue Commissioners under the terms of the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, as yet, but I will make available to the Deputy details of that scheme and the procedures that must be followed by the person involved.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the officers involved dealt with the matter fairly and correctly at all times.  Nevertheless, I will take account of what Deputy Gallagher has told me.  I appreciate his concern in putting forward the case and I will ensure that the matter is investigated fully.</P>

      <P>If media reports are correct, major redundancies in Amdahl will be announced shortly.  A figure in excess of 230 has been mentioned.  In 1992 there were 680 employees in the company.  The reported redundancies, together with <Col N="522" /> those announced in May, will reduce the workforce to approximately 150.  In 18 months some 530 jobs will have been lost, reducing the workforce by 80 per cent.  This will have a devastating effect on the lives of the workers and their families and it will be a disaster for the economic life of Swords, which is already reeling from the prospect of 1,000 job losses in Aer Lingus.  The knock on effect of these redundancies and the crisis in the horticultural industry in Fingal will devastate the area.</P>
      <P>In May this year Amdahl, who manufacture mainframe computers, laid off 150 workers.  At that time we were informed that all parts of the electronic industry were being kept under constant review and that assessments as to future potential and risk are regularly made by the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the IDA.  What steps has the IDA taken to monitor the operation of the Swords plant?  Was any action considered necessary by the IDA and was any assistance sought by the company? Were any proposals recommended to the Minister to offset this calamity?  There is rumour that the factory will close completely. I urge the Minister to ensure that this does not happen particularly if, as forecast, there is to be an uplift in the world economy in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would prefer not to discuss redundancies, I ask the Minister to ensure that redundancies are kept to a minimum and that every effort is made to encourage the company to broaden its operations, perhaps into the softwear area.  North County Dublin has a workforce highly trained in electronic procedures and it has an infrastructure which is the envy of other areas.  We have an international airport on our doorstep, a motorway and close proximity to ports. Given the intolerable level of the projected redundancies in the area, which may reach 2,000 by the end of this year, I call on the Minister to extend the remit of the recently established Aer Lingus task force to cover the entire Fingal area and the new Fingal County Council and ensure that they have the necessary resources to encourage alternative industries <Col N="523" /> to come to the area and restore as many of the jobs as possible as a matter of priority.  Action is required now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>North County Dublin is going through a very dark period in its economic life with Aer Lingus facing over 1,000 redundancies and Amdahl, if media reports are correct, showing 500 redundancies in the last 12 months.  The horticultural industry is in difficulties, the town of Balbriggan has not been given a factory for some considerable time and unemployment is at an all time high.  The Swords area of North County Dublin is facing a very difficult period and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the IDA does everything in its power to assist Amdahl in restructuring from its mainframe business into other areas.  We cannot afford this level of unemployment in an area which is already an unemployment black spot.  The remit of the task force should be extended to cover Swords and the whole of north County Dublin.  I do not have much confidence in some of the task forces but it is the only avenue open at this stage.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure that the IDA and the other State agencies do everything in their power to tackle this major crisis for north County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the future of both the Amdahl Corporation and Amdahl Ireland in Swords, County Dublin.  On 16 March 1993 I had a meeting with the chairman of the Amdahl Corporation in California.  Unfortunately, the corporation's results so far this year have been very disappointing.  Amdahl's first quarter results showed a net loss of $240 million.  In the second quarter they had an operating loss of $23.7 million.  The results for the third quarter are expected very shortly.  However, the company has been warning that it expects to report a considerably larger operating loss for the third quarter over the second quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has cited slow mainframe computer sales and intense competitive <Col N="524" /> pressure on pricing as the principal reasons for its losses.  Industry analysts have said that mainframe computer prices have declined by about 40 per cent in the 12 months ending July 1993.  Both Deputies Burke and Ryan have been in frequent touch with me on this matter and on a number of occasions have conveyed their concerns to me.</P>
    <P>Any developments in the Amdahl Corporation would have an immediate effect on Amdahl Ireland.  I remind the House that the plant in Swords, County Dublin, is Amdahl's only manufacturing location outside the US.  Amdahl Ireland was established in 1977 and it supplies Europe, the Far East and the Pacific Basin.  While employment peaked at 680 as recently as 1992, it has now dropped to 385.  The main contribution to this was the redundancies in May of this year. Deputies will recall that Amdahl was already discussed in an Adjournment debate in the House on 5 May this year and it is particularly disappointing that it is necessary to discuss Amdahl again less than six months later.  The unfortunate truth is that what is happening at Amdahl is a consequence of the interaction between declining mainframe sales and plummeting prices.</P>
    <P>Senior management at Amdahl Ireland were in the United States last week for discussions about the future of the Amdahl Corporation as a whole and Amdahl Ireland in particular.  It now appears inevitable that there will be further job losses in Swords.  I understand that there have been negotiations between management and staff at Swords and that the company will be making an official announcement tomorrow.  The corporation is seeking a total of 1,600 redundancies and 250 of these will be made at Swords.  There is overall restructuring within Amdahl as the corporation seeks to bring its operating expenses and production costs in line with demand for its products.</P>
    <P>While the mainframe computer business has been in serious decline worldwide, the personal computer market, in contrast, is booming.  I was pleased to be able to announce last month that Gateway <Col N="525" /> 2000 Inc., one of the world's leaders in direct marketing of personal computers, is setting up a telemarketing, customer support and production operation in the Clonshaugh Industrial Estate in North Dublin.  This fully integrated operation will create 400 new jobs within three years.  Approximately 220 of these will be involved in sales, technical support and customer service.  The company plans to be in full production prior to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Gateway 2000 Inc. will invest £13 million in purchasing and modifying an existing 150,000 sq. ft. building in Clonshaugh and installing manufacturing plant and equipment, computerised order processing systems, telemarketing and general office equipment.</P>
    <P>With the downturn in the mainframe business, telemarketing has been identified as an important growth sector particularly suitable for Ireland in general and Dublin in particular.  The decision by Gateway to set up its European headquarters in Dublin is a milestone in this regard.  Gateway represents the new breed of computer manufacturer in that it is highly responsive to market demand and close to its customers.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the electronics industry is currently maturing and consolidating after an explosive growth phase.  This is particularly demonstrated on the hardware side of the industry where Amdahl as a mainframe manufacturer is succumbing to price pressures and decreasing margins.  Due to rapid technological advances the electronics industry is characterised by high and increasing capital intensity matched by shortening product life cycles.  The industry is also characterised by sudden shifts in direction which must be identified and acted upon as quickly as possible.  To this end &mdash; in response to one of the questions raised by Deputy Ryan &mdash; all segments of the electronics industry are kept under constant review by my Department and future assessments as to potential and risk are made regularly by the Industrial Development Authority and officials in my Department in conjunction with outside analysts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> As an illustration of how we in Ireland have sought to respond to this rapidly developing industry, it is worth noting that, as the market has moved towards personal computers and their associated networking equipment, these companies have been targeted by the Industrial Development Authority and many leading representatives of these companies are now located in Ireland where they are performing above expectation both by way of job creation and overall performance.</P>
    <P>Two questions were raised by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Burke.  I will consider favourably the suggestion made that I should extend the remit of the task force to include north County Dublin or the Fingal Corporation area as it is now known.  I will encourage the incoming chairperson of that new authority to liaise directly with the Industrial Development Authority to ensure that suitable land is made available at the right location.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke expressed doubts &mdash; this is understandable &mdash; as to whether the task force will be effective.  I hope to be in a position by the end of this year to announce that the performance of the special task force set up in Galway when a similar problem arose in the other mainframe computer manufacturer, Digital, has been very satisfactory in terms of job replacement in that area directed by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, we will continue to work directly with Amdahl.  As I indicated, I met the President of the International Corporation on 16 March.  Our door will always be open to ensure that it transforms itself and takes account of the changes that have taken place in the marketplace.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Local Authority Tenant Purchase Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  Many elderly people and people of modest means, some of whom have been local authority tenants for over 40 years, have expressed grave concern at the fact that they will not be in a <Col N="527" /> position to purchase their homes under the new tenant purchase scheme.  They were allowed to do so under all previous schemes.</P>
      <P>Many of these people could have purchased their homes under the millennium scheme in Dublin in 1988, but they decided not to do so.  They have had to wait until now for another opportunity but find that they have been excluded for the first time.  The local authorities are turning them down in large numbers.  As I said, elderly people and people of modest means were not prevented under the provisions of any previous scheme from purchasing their own home.  In the past if a local authority was of the view that a person would not be in a position to meet the repayments, which were modest, and if a son or daughter said that they would help their parents to purchase the house, the local authority allowed the deal to go ahead.  However, that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>This is a tragedy.  Many tenants have paid for their homes many times over. Some have been tenants for between 40 and 50 years.  Indeed, some entered the houses in Crumlin, which are now almost 50 years old as brides and now find they cannot purchase their homes which represent their only potential asset to be passed on to their families.  This is an indication that there is one law for most of us and another for the rest.  Most people aspire to own their own home and for most of us it is the biggest single asset that we will pass on to our families.  The current terms of the local authority sales scheme must be amended because large numbers of old people are excluded.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I am fed up getting replies from HEOs who are expected to operate the system, but the politicians are aware of the effect this new scheme has had.  I have no doubt that no one sat down to ensure that those who have been tenants for 40-50 years will not have the right to purchase, but as a result of these regulations many tenants will not be able to pass on their homes to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be argued that there is a need <Col N="528" /> for housing stock.  If there is a need for housing stock we should build houses and not rob the widow who cannot afford to purchase her home.  These people should not be denied their right to purchase.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question for written reply, but it offered no hope.  It was stated that any tenant who does not obtain a loan from a commercial lender may apply to the local authority and that it is a matter for the local authority in each case to decide if the applicant has the means to meet the loan repayments, but that is not what the local authorities are saying. They are saying that they are not allowed to do this under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I will take to Dublin Corporation the reply that I received to the question I tabled for written reply yesterday and the reply I receive to this debate, because I want this matter to be brought to an end as it is grossly unjust and unfair.  I hope that is what the Minister will do tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government a new tenant purchase scheme was introduced on 6 July.  The principal terms of the scheme are as follows: tenants of local authority houses and flats who have held a tenancy for at least one year may apply to purchase the dwellings in which they live.  The purchase price of the dwelling is its market value in its present state of repair as determined by the local authority, excluding improvements carried out by the tenant.  A discount of 3 per cent will be deducted from the market value of the house for each year of tenancy subject to a minimum discount of £3,000 and a maximum of 30 per cent. The purchase price will be payable at the point of sale.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension when he states that elderly persons and others who would have qualified under previous schemes do not qualify under this one.  I wish to make it clear that there is no blanket exclusion of the elderly or indeed of any other category of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with the 1986 and 1988 <Col N="529" /> schemes, the scheme excludes dwellings which were specifically provided for and are occupied presently by elderly persons. It would be imprudent to sell dwellings which have been specially constructed or adapted for the elderly at additional cost and for which there is a continuing and growing demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were to be sold, the integrated housing development for the elderly with which we are all familiar would eventually be broken up into general purpose housing.  Indeed, the local authority of which the Deputy is a member has made a strong case for preventing persons other than elderly persons from buying the houses and I have refused that request from Dublin Corporation.  I have made it quite clear to them that the only category excluded from purchase are elderly persons' houses occupied by elderly persons.  To sell such houses would be counter to the efforts of local authorities to cater for the housing needs of elderly persons or those elderly whose only source of suitable and affordable accommodation is the dwellings in question.  The scheme is, of course, open to the elderly who occupy normal local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous schemes, the administration of the 1993 tenant purchase scheme in their area is the responsibility of local authorities.  Apart from the very limited exceptions, the scheme is designed to enable as many tenants as possible to apply to purchase their dwellings. The finance which will accrue from payment of the purchase price at point of sale will facilitate the construction of further local authority dwellings to meet the needs of persons on the waiting list. However, as in the case of previous purchase schemes, only those who can afford the repayments will be in a position to purchase.  There is nothing new in that. Where necessary, mortgage loans may be obtained from either the local authority or a commercial mortgage lender.  Any tenant who is not in a position to obtain <Col N="530" /> a loan from a commercial lender may apply to the local authority, and it is a matter for the authority in each case to decide if the applicant is capable of meeting the loan repayments.  I have no role in making that decision.</P>
    <P>I would hope that all eligible tenants who wish to purchase and who are in a financial position to do so would be facilitated by speedy processing of their applications, whether for houses or flats, by the local authorities involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Seán Power.  First I want to thank him for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment of the House and to point out that this is an issue which has been before successive Ministers for Education since 1989 when approval was given by the then Minister for an extension to Hewetson School in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>The situation has become progressively worse and the school authorities have been anxiously attempting, in the past two years, to achieve a successful and satisfactory conclusion.  I am glad the Minister is here tonight to reply to the debate and I hope she will give a positive response.</P>
      <P>The community in question is small.  It is not a strident or aggressive community and depends entirely on the goodwill of the Minister to respond in terms of the provision for the Estimates in the current year.  It is imperative that the Minister recognise the need to make provision for that extension in the current year, thereby providing for future generations in the school.  If that is not done the confidence of the people in public representatives' ability to deliver will be badly shaken.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some good news.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for giving me some of his time here.  I agree with the Deputy's statements about the school.  I live close to the school and <Col N="531" /> am familar with it.  Having visited the school and knowing the people who are teaching in it and those who are sending their children to it, I know that pupils and teachers are trying to operate under very difficult conditions which would not be tolerated in many other areas.</P>
      <P>The people have presented their case in a very mannerly way and have not been very vocal.  They have been led up the garden path by successive Ministers. Promises were made and they thought that the extension would have been built a long time ago.  We are not talking about a large amount of money to put this situation right.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funds in this year's Estimates to allow this extension to go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's intentions in relation to the proposed extension to Hewetson national school, Sallins, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the anxiety of the school authorities in relation to the delay in providing an extension at the school.  The school has 84 pupils and three teachers, accommodated in three classrooms in a very old building which also includes a private residence.  The school and residence are in the one building.  I accept fully that the situation is not satisfactory and that the provision of an extension and associated improvements is fully warranted and is now an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the school authorities are concerned at the long delay in dealing <Col N="532" /> with the case.  However, many of the earlier delays were caused by prolonged and protracted negotiations and the reluctance of the school authorities to have the school vested.  The vesting problem was somewhat resolved in 1989 and architectural planning could then commence.</P>
    <P>The project involves an extension of one classroom, the conversion of an existing small classroom to a library/medical/staffroom and extensive works to the existing school and grounds.</P>
    <P>Planning has now reached an advanced stage and full drawings will be completed by end December 1993, after which tenders can be invited.  It was not possible to include the project in the 1993 primary schools' capital programme because of other demands which were deemed to be of a higher priority and therefore had to take precedence.  The project will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.  It is my intention to progress the extension and refurbishment of Hewetson national school as early as possible, bearing in mind the financial resources available for the building of national schools and other demands on the budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 28, 29 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, the growth of exports by indigenous companies has been consistently ahead of overall export growth. Over the past three years, they have increased by almost 23 per cent to IR£3.7 billion in 1992, compared to overall <Col N="418" /> export growth of 14 per cent in the same period.</P>
    <P>Our indigenous companies are now major export players and their contribution to the Irish economy is extremely valuable: indigenous exports are more than twice as job intensive as other exports and indigenous companies purchase more of their inputs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This excellent performance has been facilitated by the expansion and intensification of An Bord Tráchtála's programmes and services under the Programme for Industrial Development, 1989-1993.  With the assistance of Structural Funds, Government expenditure on measures to improve the marketing performance of indigenous industry has more than doubled.  One specific grant scheme, which I have launched, is EUROPLACE, which aims to increase substantially the number of salespeople that Irish firms have, on the ground, in their main markets.</P>
    <P>However, the continuing weak demand in these markets, and the tentative nature of the recovery in market conditions in the UK and US in the first half of this year, have led to a slowdown in the rate of indigenous export growth. To address this situation, I announced, on 31 August, a new export drive by ABT which involves action on two fronts &mdash; on the demand side through stimulating more sales leads and increasing promotional activity and on the supply side by providing additional direct grants to firms.  These changes are aimed at encouraging indigenous industry to maintain its market effort, particularly in Continental European markets, and to step up its presence in the UK and US, where export sales are expected to pick up after the slow start earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>While there has been a noticeable improvement in our ability to compete effectively in international markets, we must continue to close the gap that still exists between many Irish fairms and their foreign competitors in areas such as marketing skills, information and organisation. Deputies can be assured that the Government's commitment to providing significant resources to our indigenous <Col N="419" /> exporting sector will be maintained under the Market Development Programme for 1994-1999 which will include a variety of measures aimed at further improving the marketing capability of Irish firms and translating that into increased market share, through group-based activity and providing grants to companies to enter new markets and consolidate existing markets.</P>

      <P>Aviation policy is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, whose Department has recently opened talks with the US authorities on amending the Ireland/US air agreements.</P>
      <P>I made an input in relation to the needs of Irish tourism in advance of the talks and I am satisfied that resulting changes will prove beneficial to Irish tourism generally and the continued development of the Shannon region.</P>
      <P>Access is vital to Irish tourism and one of the more striking features in recent years has been the growth in access services from our main markets of Britain and Mainland Europe which helped to facilitate growth of 38 per cent and 124 per cent respectively since 1987.  This has not been matched on the transatlantic routes where the number of carriers and services reduced over the same period. Tourist numbers from North America have remained more or less static while our share of North American tourism to Europe has fallen from 6 per cent in 1987 to an estimated 5 per cent in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem has been compounded by a reduction in the proportion of pure holidaymakers from 52 per cent of total North American traffic in 1987 to 45 per cent in 1992.  The proportion of &ldquo;backtracking&rdquo; traffic is also increasing.  Direct transatlantic air passengers have fallen from 54 per cent to 47 per cent of total US arrivals since 1989.  The average length of stay for those arriving by indirect routes is 8 days compared to 14 for those who travel direct to Shannon or Dublin with <Col N="422" /> a corresponding reduction on visitor spend.</P>
    <P>If the North American tourist markets is to be fully developed carrier capacity must expand.  Changes in the Ireland/US air agreements can provide a stimulus to carriers to develop new direct services to Ireland.  A useful indicator of the potential impact on tourism is the experience in relation to transatlantic access to Scotland since 1990.  Five carriers now operate regular scheduled flights from North American to Scotland.  Total direct transatlantic passenger movements in and out of Scotland have grown by 41 per cent since 1990 while similar figures for Ireland show a change of less than 2 per cent over the same period.</P>

    <P>In a tourism context, I and my Department have met with, and received submissions from, a wide range of tourism interests, including trade representative associations such as the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC), which represents the principal participants in the Irish tourism industry.  I have of course also had the benefit of the recommendations of the Tourism Task Force in relation to <Col N="423" /> Structural Funding which, in the course of its deliberations, received submissions from 130 bodies and individuals.  Account is being taken of these submissions in preparing proposals for the next operational programme for tourism, 1994-1999.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that I have recently established the National Tourism Council, which will provide the industry with direct access to me and my officials on a regular basis in relation to all aspects of tourism policy, including advising on their priorities for the next tourism operational programme.  My commitment to maintaining and improving relationships with the industry's private sector representatives is evidenced by my decision to include on the new National Tourism Council thirteen representatives of the Irish tourist industry from outside the public sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i>, indicates that the Government plans to secure a significant improvement in the seasonality profile of Irish tourism.  The Government's target is that by 1999, two-thirds of visitors to Ireland will holiday here outside the peak July to September period, compared to 60 per cent at present.</P>
      <P>The next round of EC Structural Funds will focus investment in areas which will contribute to meeting the Government's seasonality objectives.  Product investment proposals such as tourism angling measures and the development of the National Conference Centre are planned as these can yield year-round tourism business which will assist in improving the industry's present seasonality profile.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan also provides for substantially increased investment in marketing Irish tourism.  It is planned in this context that special provision will be made for the marketing of Ireland as a tourism destination in the off-peak periods.  Support will, <i>inter alia</i>, be directed at the marketing of tourism products, such as angling, golf, conferences, etc., which are weather-independent tourism products and can therefore contribute to increasing the number of off-season visitors.</P>

      <P>The subsequent Industrial Development Act, 1993, defined the role of Forfás in relation to An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; ABT &mdash; as follows: &ldquo;to advise on the development and co-ordination of policy for Forbairt, IDA, ABT and such other bodies as the Minister may designate&rdquo;.  As heretofore, I, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, continue to be responsible for, and give policy direction to, ABT.</P>
      <P>In relation to food exports, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has announced the establishment of An Bord Bia, which will be responsible for that sector.  It is envisaged that An Bord Bia will have the same links to Forfás and ABT.</P>
      <P>To further ensure that there is absolutely no wasteful duplication in the State's export promotion efforts, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is drafting the legislation, to establish An Bord Bia, in consultation with me.  Our common objective will be to produce a State agency structure which will best assist the food industry to maximise its contribution to the economy in terms of wealth creation, exports and jobs but which will do so on the basis of securing the best value for money for the State's investment in support and promotion.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report, a tabular statement giving details, based on estimates from the Central Statistics Office, of Ireland's trade with east European countries in the past four years.</P>
      <P>Ireland's trade with east European countries has traditionally been low, accounting for only about 1 per cent of Ireland's total trade, and consisting mainly of fuel imports from Poland and Russia, and exports of food to the USSR &mdash; mainly as a result of the European Community's Humanitarian Aid Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> In the light of recent developments, however, the East European markets now offer significant new trading opportunities in the medium to long term.  A number of niche opportunities for tradable goods have been identified &mdash; primarily in the food, electronics and pharmaceuticals sectors &mdash; with the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary currently offering the best potential for export growth.  An Bord Tráchtála estimates that exports will be up in 1993 to each of these three countries, where the economic situation is already stabilising and significant private sectors are emerging.</P>
    <P>There is immediate potential, in particular, for export growth in the services sector to Eastern Europe, where countries are still in the process of transforming their economies from a command to a free-market model, and require considerable amounts of technical assistance to complete this process. As a result, the operation of World Bank, EBRD, and the EC's PHARE and TACIS programmes are providing good and growing opportunities for the Irish services sector.</P>

      <P>During my Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill I indicated that the Government proposed that pension funds should work towards a target investment of £100 million in venture and development capital projects over and above their existing level of investments in unquoted companies, to be phased in over a five year period.  As the Deputy will be aware from my replies to earlier questions on this matter, the Irish Association of Pension Funds, following discussions with myself and my officials, endorsed the principle of this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, as a result of these discussions, it was agreed that a detailed study should be carried out under the auspices of the Irish Association of Pension Funds and supported by other interested parties including my Department to assess, among other <Col N="432" /> things, the opportunities for investment in this area and its suitability having regard to the prudential requirements of pension fund trustees.  This study is expected to be completed shortly.  The target figure of an additional investment in venture and development capital projects of £100 million will be subject to the outcome of this study and to sufficient commercially viable projects being brought forward.  There is, therefore, no basis for the view that this initiative constitutes double taxation or that it will prevent pension fund trustees from carrying out their legal responsibility to invest contributions to ensure pension levels for the future.</P>

      <P>The provisions in the Taxes Act dealing with interest on overpayments of tax are designed to cater for situations where a taxpayer might overpay tax due to the fact that the law requires him to make payments of tax before the correct liability can be determined.  The provisions are not designed to cater for any particular category of taxpayer or to make general provision for the payment of interest.  The specific provisions permitting the payment of interest are:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;section 30 of the Finance Act, 1976 provides for the payment of interest where an overpayment arises on the determination of an appeal against an assessment.  The procedures for tax appeals require taxpayers to pay the tax in dispute prior to the appeal hearing.  If the tax is subsequently <Col N="433" /> found not to be due the law permits the payment of interest.</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 12 (7) Finance Act, 1988 provides for the payment of interest on the overpayment of preliminary tax by the self-employed.  The tax law requires the payment of preliminary tax before the end of the tax year and before the taxpayer's income is known.</P>
    <P>The question of paying tax in advance of determination of the liability does not generally arise in the PAYE system.  The system is designed to ensure that the correct amount of tax is deducted throughout the year.  The vast majority of refunds arise from the claiming of additional allowances by employees after the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the question of delays in the hearing of civil cases in the High Court and the Circuit Court in other statements I have made here and elsewhere over the past few months and the <Col N="440" /> House will be aware that others who have special knowledge of the subject have commented also.</P>
      <P>I believe that there is misunderstanding generally about these delays and that it would perhaps be useful if I were to say a few words in order to clarify matters.</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong to assume that an extended interval between the service of notice of trial and the actual hearing of a civil action is inevitably a matter of inconvenience to the parties involved or to their legal representatives.  For tactical and other reasons, in fact, the parties or their representatives may find it preferable to have a hearing postponed, though this may not of course be acknowledged openly by those favouring postponement. I make this point, not to give the impression that all delays can be explained by reference to factors of this kind &mdash; there is no question that many cases are delayed because of pressure on the Courts &mdash; but in order to emphasise that it is not reasonable simply to lump all cases together, calculate the average time between the date of service of notice of trial and date of hearing and conclude that the resulting figure provides some sort of measure of the level of inconvenience suffered by litigants due to pressure on the Courts.  When I use the term &ldquo;delay&rdquo; for the purpose of replying to the Deputy's question, it is important that the foregoing consideration be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I am informed that, apart from personal injuries cases, there are no significant delays in the hearing of High Court cases.  There is a delay of twenty four months in the hearing of personal injury actions in the High Court in Dublin and an average delay throughout the remainder of the country of approximately thirty months.  I also understand however, that in the High Court approximately 90 per cent of all personal injury cases are in fact settled out of Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Circuit Court in Dublin the delay in the hearing of civil cases is approximately twelve months.  The delay throughout the country varies from one Circuit Court venue to another with the <Col N="441" /> delay in Cork being in excess of three years while other venues such as Castlebar and Monaghan have no delay at all. On average the delay in the hearing of civil cases in the provincial Circuit Court is approximately nine months.</P>

    <P>Tackling unemployment is the number one priority of this Government.  The policy response to the current unemployment situation is as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i>.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a list of inter-linked measures designed to, encourage and support enterprise, develop the skills of our labour force and encourage local initiative through regional structures for enterprise. Detailed proposals on job creation strategies in all sectors of the economy are set out in the National Development Plan.  In addition to the achievement of specific job creation targets, the plan contains, as one of its key elements, a significant local dimension to enterprise and employment creation.</P>
    <P>The needs of those who find themselves unemployed long term are specifically catered for in a number of measures including the area-based initiative, which is co-ordinated by the <Col N="443" /> Department of An Taoiseach, and the social employment scheme/community employment development programme which provides training and work experience for the long term unemployed.  The SES/CEDP programme will provide opportunities for an average of 17,000 participants throughout the year with the end year participation figure reaching 20,500.  I am hopeful that this level of participation will continue in 1994 increasing to 30,000 by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Priority places on FÁS training courses are given to the long term unemployed and early school leavers.</P>
    <P>While the existing arrangements do, therefore, recognise the particular needs of the long term unemployed these arrangements are under continuous review and they can be adapted in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>The phased introduction by the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, of the muzzling of greyhounds in enclosed coursing commenced at the start of the coursing season in September last on a trial basis.  In the initial stage of the trials the greyhounds participating in the semi-finals and finals of all stakes were muzzled.</P>

    <P>The dimensions and construction of muzzles are primarily matters for the ICC, the body which is conducting the trials.  I understand however that at the <Col N="449" /> commencement of the season leather muzzles were used and that at this juncture plastic muzzles are being evaluated.</P>
    <P>Progress will be reviewed with a view to extending the use of muzzles to more courses until all courses are run on the basis of muzzled greyhounds.</P>

      <P>In organising school transport services, Bus Eireann plan routes in such a way as to secure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table, while, at the same time, ensuring that vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of trips to schools and, consequently, some pupils may have some waiting time.  Such an arrangement applies in this case.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> The bus in question makes two trips in the mornings, as follows:</P>
    <P>First trip &mdash; 56 post-primary pupils from Kilkelly area.  First pick-up at 7.50 a.m.  Arrives at Kiltimagh PPC at 8.15 a.m.</P>
    <P>Second trip &mdash; 20 post-primary from Kinnaffe and 55 primary pupils from Treenkeel areas.  The first pick-up of the primary school children is at 8.27 a.m.  They arrive at Kiltimagh NS at 9.02 a.m.</P>
    <P>There are three trips in the afternoon, with the first of three carrying the primary school pupils only, because of their earlier finishing time.</P>

      <P>The children from the Lisselton area are eligible for transport to post-primary centres within their respective Catchment Areas.  However, some parents chose to send their children to school in Listowel which is not their catchment area.  Consequently, the most they can be offered by my Department is concessionary transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended.  Catchment boundary transport may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated. The other proviso is that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of using a larger or extra bus, or by re-routing an existing service.  Children from the Lisselton area have been availing of transport under these conditions.  However, at the start of the current school-year, it emerged that it would not be possible to accommodate all the applicants for Catchment Boundary tickets as the bus providing the <Col N="460" /> service is operating at full capacity at present.  I have been advised by the Transport Liaison Officer that Bus Éireann will carry pupils who present themselves as ordinary fare-paying public passengers on scheduled services.</P>

      <P>The total commitments to expenditure in the National Development Plan for the human resources sector for the period 1994-1999 are £3,108 million.  Of this, commitments to expenditure totalling £1,545 million are included for projects <Col N="465" /> in the education sector with a provisional allocation of EC aid of £966.994 million.  The final level of EC aid will, of course, be determined in discussions with the Commission of the European Communities leading to the adoption of the community support framework.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision is made in the plan for special education measures, including at the primary level, to combat early school leaving and under achievement leading to exclusion.  The measures will be targetted at selected areas under the local development programme so that an integrated response to the needs of children at risk can be provided from early childhood right through to adulthood. The expenditure levels referred to above relate to expenditure included in the National Development Plan only, and the initiatives listed will be complemented by measures supported from ongoing exchequer funding outside the plan.</P>
