      <P>I beg leave to announce, for the information of the Dáil, (1) that, having informed the President that Dáil Éireann had approved on nomination of Deputies to be members of the Government, the President on 12 January 1993 appointed them accordingly; (2) that, on the same date I nominated Deputy Dick Spring to be Tánaiste; (3) that, on the same date I assigned the Departments of State to the members of the Government as follows:</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 10.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 11 shall be decided without debate; (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 10: (i) the opening speech of the Minister and of the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes; (iii) the Minister or Minister of State may be called upon a second time and shall be called upon not later than 8 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding 30 minutes; (iv) the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair not later than 8.30 p.m. and (3) there shall be no Private Members' Business this week.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions.  First, when is it proposed to publish the Book of Estimates which are very late compared to previous years?  Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why a question to him on representations he may have made to European Heads of State regarding the currency crisis has been passed to the Minister for Finance when the question was specifically addressed to him?  Is this an example of the openness he has promised in this new Government? When can we expect the Taoiseach to tell us what steps he took to ensure that the Irish currency was not devalued and remained within the ERM?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad the Taoiseach has confirmed that the Book of Estimates will be published on 17 February but what about the estimates of receipts and expenditure?  Will they be debated some time before the budget. Will they be held back for a while?  Is the Taoiseach still making them up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to put that book back even if we wanted to, so the book of expenditure and receipts will, as always, be published the weekend before the budget.</P>

A Cheann Comhairle, I unintentionally tested your patience in the past by raising a specific matter here which is now expressly included in the Programme for Government.

Will he indicate specifically if legislation to provide additional equity to Aer Lingus, which has been promised by a number of Government spokespersons, will be included on that list.</P>

I would remind Deputies Gilmore and Rabbitte that aspects of the Programme for Government requiring legislation will be dealt with in due course, even if that means providing shelter for Deputy Rabbitte in whatever way he wants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that Deputy Mary Flaherty be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  To the best of my knowledge, a woman Member has never been an occupant of either the Office of Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle. When so many women have been returned by the will of the Irish people to this Dáil it is appropriate that at least one of the senior presiding offices in his House should be occupied by a woman. I wish to state clearly that I do not put forward Deputy Mary Flaherty's name, primarily on grounds of gender.  It is important to point out that she has very considerable parliamentary experience, having been a Member since 1981 and has longer than average service in this House.  During that period she has been a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare and a Front Bench spokesperson for her party on subjects as diverse as social welfare, energy, communications and family affairs.  She is also a parliamentarian who has won the respect of Members on all sides by her conciliatory approach in her dealings with all Members and she would be an excellent occupant of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  As is the tradition in the Seanad, this office should be held by a Deputy from the Opposition benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to indicate that the Progressive Democrats are supporting Deputy Flaherty for this position and we do so for a number of reasons. First, given the unprecedented size of the Government majority, it is particularly important that the Opposition should hold this key position.  It was a long tradition in this House &mdash; until 1973 &mdash; that this position was held by the Opposition and in 1981 the then Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O'Connell, gave his casting vote for the Opposition nominee.  That tradition should be restored because the fundamental health of our democracy can only be protected in the context of such a huge Government majorities and those generous towards minorities and those that differ politically from us.  The test of the Government's attitude to democracy and its intent to preserve the health of our democracy will be seen in its treatment of the Opposition and minorities in this House.</P>
      <P>Second, Deputy Flaherty represents a younger generation of politicians, despite the fact that she has 11 years experience in this House.  This is an old institution and there are many Members who were elected.  For that reason also, it is important that a new generation be represented in one of the office positions of the House.  We have now 20 women elected to this House and it took 75 years to get to this position.  In all, we have only ever elected 55 women to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>We know how difficult it is to elect women to Dáil Éireann.  Members of the Labour Party know how difficult it is because it was only in the 15th election that Labour elected their first woman Deputy.  Prior to the last election when five women were returned for the Labour Party it had only ever elected two Deputies.  That party knows how difficult it is, and that electing a woman does not happen accidentally.  It is significant &mdash; I do not say this in a partisan way &mdash; that my party which is seven years old has had six women elected in three elections and that does not happen accidentally.  We must set out to encourage women of substance to enter politics.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Minister for Education I will quote the following from the Programme for Government:</P>
      <P>That the Government will introduce a radical programme of affirmative action in appointing women to State boards with the objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct appointments by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not too much to expect that women could hold 40 per cent of the positions of those who preside over this House or are we going to again have 100 per cent men for the next three or four years?  The Programme for Government refers to gender proofing for all policy and legislation. We may have a Minister for Equality and Law Reform and we expect great things from him but the greatest assistance we can give to this Minister when he talks to the Fitzwilliam Club and so on is by our example, to lead the way. We will show that we will elect not just any woman for the sake of electing a woman.  Deputy Flaherty is not just any woman, she is a competent, experienced and popular Deputy.  She is the type of person, who would bring great credit to this House in the way she would preside over its preceedings but she would do much more than that.  The Cheann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle represent this House abroad, leading many important delegations and meeting many foreign dignitaries.  It would send a great signal to those who visit this House if a woman held the position <Col N="705" /> of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We are not looking for the top job yet.</P>
    <P>It would send a very meaningful signal to the politicians in Northern Ireland whom we are always preaching to about being generous and open, if we too showed that minorities in this House, the Opposition in the first instance, and women in the second, were appointed to this position.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about change.  If we continue to elect the people to preside over our business in the same way as we have done in the past we will not send out any great signal to the public, that we are interested in change. Tomorrow afternoon, the Taoiseach will receive the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  I am aware the Taoiseach has receive it publicly tomorrow. The Taoiseach is aware of the Commission's view that the reason women are discriminated against in Ireland is because they do not occupy key decision-making roles in our society. Until they do, even though much legislation may be enacted, it will not make any difference.  The Taoiseach should think again about the person proposed for this position.  I hold no personal grievance against Deputy Jacob.  He is a very fine Deputy and, as far as I know, a warm and friendly person.  I have no doubt he will do a good job, but there is more involved.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the extent of the Government majority, the importance of encouraging women to enter public life, the fact that we have a Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the Government's programme, I hope that the 40 per cent referred to in the programme will become the norm when the Government makes appointments. While it may be too late for the Taoiseach to change his mind in regard to this appointment when he names his 11 nominees to the Seanad, I hope he will follow the proposal in the programme.  I hope that at least four women will be named in the Taoiseach's nominees and not just one or two token appointments which would be an insult to women in general <Col N="706" /> and particularly to the Commission on the Status of Women whose report the Taoiseach will receive tomorrow.  The Progressive Democrats are happy to support Fine Gael's nomination of Deputy Flaherty, whom we consider would make a fine Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Her appointment would be a great example to the many women we want to bring into Irish politics.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I wish to indicate our support for the nomination of Deputy Flaherty for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is not necessary to repeat the excellent case made by Deputy Harney as to the reason this House should elect a woman on this occasion. Deputy Flaherty is a member of Fine Gael and she would carry out her duties in an objective and fair way.  She is a colleague of mine in Dublin North-West and I have always found her to be an extremely able and fair-minded person.  I have no doubt that if she is elected to this position she will carry out the job effectively and do honour to this House.  This appointment should have been discussed by the party leaders, as was the case in regard to the appointment of the Ceann Comhairle.  It would make sense to have a Member from the Opposition benches elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle on this occasion, particularly in view of the size of the Government's majority.  I have no hesitation in supporting the nomination of Deputy Flaherty.</P>

We welcome the support of our colleagues in the Opposition benches, particularly the excellently articulated support of Deputy Harney.  While I have some concerns about the overall concept of gender <Col N="707" /> proofing in seconding Deputy Flaherty's nomination I am supporting a woman of great experience and ability, both inside and outside this House.  Much lip service is paid to the need for change.  Deputy Flaherty is the ideal role model to have as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle will not mind me suggesting that Deputy Flaherty, apart from introducing a gender balance and, perhaps an age balance to the position, will create an urban-rural balance which would be very effective also.  I am sure we can expect the support of all sides on this House given the lip service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the nomination of Deputy Flaherty.  It is particularly appropriate for this Chamber to support Deputy Flaherty the day before the Commission on the Status of Women launches its historic report which includes a few hundred recommendations to improve the status of women in Irish society.  The commission received more than 600 submissions, more than any other commission in the history of the State.  It would be appropriate if this House led by example and supported Deputy Flaherty for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The whole question of women having access to key decision-making positions is a critical one and while 20 women have been elected to this Dáil, it is by no means the critical mass of women we need in decision-making arenas such as the Dáil.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the thought that many of the issues raised here this afternoon were important.  Perhaps the <Col N="712" /> most important issue in a Dáil with such an unprecedented majority is the desirability of having the Opposition represented in one of the two major positions presiding over, conducting and managing the affairs of the House.</P>
      <P>When I became a Member of the Dáil in 1981 the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle traditionally belonged to the Opposition, indeed, it was not only that position but also that of Ceann Comhairle that belonged to the Opposition. That was an important point to raise and it was a very good reason for allowing my name to go forward.  I have 12 year's experience as a Deputy and the role that I had in mind for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have resembled that of school teacher on occasions, but, perhaps, nobody could outdo the outgoing Leas-Cheann Comhairle in that role.  I still find a strange pleasure in the detail of legislation.  I have enjoyed dealing with some very technical Bills and I take pleasure in seeing them pass.  I would have enjoyed the role of presiding over legislation that passed through the House with speed and expedition.</P>
      <P>As a woman, I would have taken particular pleasure in scoring a first for women by taking on the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I thank my party leader, and my party, for proposing me and I appreciate the warm support received from the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left and the Independents. I also thank members of the Government who indicated that they would have supported me had circumstances been different.</P>

      <P>I should like to extend my good wishes to Deputy Jacob in taking up the position.  I commiserate with my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, who I know would have made an excellent Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I also pay tribute to the outgoing Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Tunney, for whom I had a great affection although on occasions we clashed.  Deputy Tunney served this House extremely well as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with a great sense of humour, and preserved the dignity of the House. <Col N="713" /> Even though he is a member of the party opposite I consider that, it was a sad day for this House when he lost his seat.  He served the House well.</P>
      <P>While congratulating Deputy Jacob, I nevertheless feel that the result achieved, and the manner in which the matter was dealt with today, are a sad reflection on the House.  The message that goes out from this House as a result of today's vote is "Male Rule OK".  The result of the vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>&mdash;supports the action of the Government in realigning the value of the Irish pound within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and in remaining within the narrow band of the mechanism;</P>
      <P>&mdash;calls on the Government to continue to press for reform of the EMS at ECOFIN and in other European Community bodies;</P>
      <P>&mdash;supports the underpinning of the exchange rate policy by budgetary and other economic policies in order to provide a competitive trading environment for business, which is an essential basis for increasing employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to put on record in Dáil Éireann the events of recent months and to outline the reasoning underlying Government policy throughout the currency crisis.</P>
      <P>The upheaval in the European Monetary System last September was in retrospect not as sudden and unexpected as may have seemed at the time.  It had been abundantly clear for a considerable time that there were serious tensions in the system that called for urgent attention. The persistent high interest rates in Germany and the underlying weakness of sterling and the lira created a very unstable situation.  The tensions in the money markets were heightened by politcal uncertainty following the rejection in Denmark of the Maastricht Treaty. While a well-managed re-alignment within the system could have forestalled the subsequent chaos, the reality is that it did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hindsight was not available in September, however, and the events of that <Col N="719" /> month came as a huge shock.  As a result, there was no co-ordinated response from Europe.  The markets, and particularly the speculators, had a free run for a time. It was unprecedented that the foreign currency reserves of three of the most powerful industrialised countries in the world, and members of the G7 &mdash; France, Italy and the United Kingdom &mdash; should be seriously depleted in quick succession. The authorities did not have any plan to react to this demonstration of market power.</P>
    <P>Even though the crisis was not of our making, it left us in a vulnerable position. Other currencies were caught in a similar dilemma and there had to be immediate responses.  Our Government decided to hold the parity of the Irish pound and we were in no doubt about this.  It was the proper course of action and there was a strong consensus at home, embracing employers and trade unions, in favour of this policy.  It was also the considered view of our European partners that this was in the best interests of the Irish economy. We had one of the lowest inflation rates in the Community, a consistent balance of payments surplus and a good budget performance.</P>
    <P>We were subjected to an immediate and severe attack by the markets but we demonstrated our capacity to resist and maintain our position.  It was reported at the time that we introduced new exchange controls.  This was not correct. We made more intensive use of existing controls and we acted in strict accord with our EC obligations.  I am convinced that, if we had adopted a weaker currency line, we would have been subjected to a similar attack.</P>
    <P>It is well to recall the mood in Europe at the time in relation to the crisis.  After the initial shock, there was a confident expectation that the worst was definitely over and that the European Monetary System would quickly recover its equilibrium. After all, there were no good monetary reasons why other currencies should be subjected to further attack.  It was expected that the lira would resume its place quickly in the exchange rate <Col N="720" /> mechanism and that sterling would be in a position to return without undue delay. A Summit of Heads of State and Government was arranged for Birmingham to address the issue and there was a general belief that the German authorities would be in a position to reduce interest rates without delay.  Following the initial attack the markets generally accepted that the Irish pound would hold its parity and the Irish market settled down. Unfortunately, higher bank retail rates and mortgage rates were unavoidable and increases of 2 per cent to 4 per cent were implemented.  At the same time interest rates in some of the other member countries of the EMS also had to be increased.</P>
    <P>The Government policy to maintain the parity of the Irish pound was based on a number of considerations.  Since 1987 we had seen the benefit of a policy of stability built on low inflation.  We have made substantial gains in competitiveness particularly against the United Kingdom.  The disciplined approach to economic management has paid excellent dividends in terms of reduced budget deficits.  Exchange rate stability within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism has been a key factor in this and we considered it vitally important to maintain our position, if this were possible.  In any event we are committed to greater European integration. We believe that economic and monetary union can be achieved within a reasonable timetable and we want to be part of this.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there was no good reason for us to change our position and, as I mentioned, there was a strong national consensus in favour of holding the line.  It was necessary to provide some temporary relief for business badly affected by the sudden fall in the value of sterling and the Government introduced the market development scheme with a commitment of £50 million.</P>
    <P>It is well to reflect on the options that were open to us in September.  One commentator put it well when he said that we were caught between a rock and a hard place.  If we had chosen not to hold the <Col N="721" /> line the options were devaluation within the exchange rate mechanism, free-floating of the Irish pound, linking with sterling or linking to the ECU.  Contrary to rumour, our European partners in all probability would have rejected a devaluation, if we sought their agreement, because at that stage it would not have been justified by reference to our economic position.</P>
    <P>A variant of the devaluation option perhaps might have been to move on to the wider band of the exchange rate mechanism for a period.  However, I see no real merit in this.  It would probably be seen as evidence of weakness and would lead to greater volatility for our currency arising from a loss of confidence.  It would bring no particular benefit.  Certainly, it would not provide any protection against higher interest rates.  I believe it would be interpreted by the markets as an effort by us to move closer to sterling.</P>
    <P>Free-floating would effectively mean a fall in the value of the Irish pound because of the market perception of the influence of sterling.  Therefore, free floating and linking with sterling in practice, are likely to amount to much the same thing, in the immediate future. Free-floating would be inadvisable for a number of reasons.  As events have demonstrated, it would have meant great volatility for our currency.  I do not believe that we could have followed the example of the United Kingdom in bringing down interest rates.  On the contrary, there would have been a distinct risk of high interest rates on a long term basis to match the uncertainty about our currency policy.  This approach would also result in strong inflationary tendencies. Inflation in Ireland would be likely to be stronger than in the United Kingdom because the Irish economy is operating at a higher capacity level than the United Kingdom economy, the Irish economy is much more open.  The small size of its market means competition is less intense and increases in import prices are more likely to be passed quickly on to the consumer. Investors would become more wary of our position and the overall effect of free-floating would be that much of the <Col N="722" /> achievement of the previous five years could be undone.</P>
    <P>Linking to the ECU would not have eased our problems to any consequential extent.  The fall in the ECU over the period of the crisis was 2.4 per cent only. The devaluation required to satisfy the markets obviously had to be much greater than this.  Linking to the ECU outside the ERM would have reduced our ability to defend our position because of the absence of the ERM support mechanism. Therefore, our interest rates would have been higher rather than lower had we linked to the ECU.  In short, we would have the problem of very high interest rates to protect us against speculative pressures, while not being in a position to avail of the ERM defence measures.  I would remind the House that some Scandanavian countries followed this policy earlier and they discovered that it offered them no protection when they came under attack from the markets.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Summit was a disappointment and a signal that re-establishment of the EMS as a zone of stability could be a slow process.  However, it did give a mandate to the monetary committee of the European Community and the Central Bank Governors to consider the lessons to be learned from the crisis and to report to the Council.  This activity is still in progress.  As I speak, the monetary committee is considering a report which, I understand, will soon be submitted to Ministers.  I would hope that this will lead to substantial improvements in the working of the EMS.  It is not evident that changes are required if the system is to be a force for stability in Europe and a staging post for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The continuing pressures in the EMS and on other European currencies throughout the autumn led to devaluation of the Portuguese escudo and a second devaluation of the Spanish peseta in November.  I must repeat that there were no pressures from Europe for a change in the parity of the Irish pound. In retrospect, I believe that if our currency had been devalued in the early <Col N="723" /> weeks, it is quite possible that we would have faced the same experience as the Spanish authorities.  I say this because the clear market perception would have been that the Irish authorities were seeking to align their currency with sterling and also because at that stage our European partners would not have been willing to agree to anything approaching a 10 per cent devaluation.</P>
    <P>The Irish pound was not the only currency under strain.  There were also substantial pressures on the French franc and the Danish krone.  I said on a number of occasions that we were ready to consider a realignment within the exchange rate mechanism and it did appear from time to time that such a realignment involving the Irish, French and Danes might take place.  Despite widespread disappointment that the long awaited cut in German interest rates had not materialised, the French and Danes were unwilling to participate in a general realignment.  A further disappointment was the failure of the Edinburgh Summit to address the continuing crisis adequately.</P>
    <P>Our position deteriorated considerably in the new year.  The removal of exchange controls on 31 December was not a significant factor in the context of defending the currency.  Exchange controls had been useful for a short period when pressure emerged in September but, by November, it was necessary to push overnight interest rates up to 100 per cent despite the existence of controls.  Similar interest rate levels were again required on two occasions in January.  The main focus now was on wholesale interest rates which had risen to a point where further increases in retail rates generally and in mortgage rates were imminent.  This was a reflection on intense market pressures and persistent rumour &mdash; sometimes originating from sources that had much to gain &mdash; that the Irish pound would be devalued.</P>
    <P>The new Government launched an immediate and strong offensive to support the parity of the currency.  The initial reaction from the markets was encouraging <Col N="724" /> as they recognised the determination of the Irish authorities to hold the line.  In a short time there was a significant improvement in our external reserves position and, while interest rates remained high, there were prospects that reductions might not be far off.  In order to stave off immediate danger of an increase in retail rates the Government decided to provide exchange rate guarantees for borrowing in foreign currencies by industry, agriculture and the mortgage institutions.</P>
    <P>A further and substantial fall in sterling, however, following a reduction in United Kingdom rates, put immediate pressure on a number of businesses and added to the pressures on Irish interest rates.  The combination of these factors and the weakening of the national consensus created extraordinary difficulties and the Government decided reluctantly that the currency had to be devalued. There was no real prospect of reducing interest rates quickly even with the implemenation of the exchange rate guarantee schemes.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism in recent days of the poor response from our European partners to requests for assistance.  I would like to put this in perspective.  At all times the rules of the exchange rate mechanism on intervention have been applied rigidly in our case but it has become evident in recent months that these rules are no longer adequate.  It is common knowledge that on two occasions last year the German authorities went beyond their obligations in providing assistance for the French franc.  This led to the understandable perception that the dominant partner in the European Monetary System was differentiating between currencies.  It was for this reason that we, and others, protested that it undermined the solidarity of the system.  On the other hand, if special assistance for the franc had not been provided on the occasions in question, it is possible that the system might have collapsed altogether.</P>
    <P>The Government did take strong diplomatic initiatives to generate support for its policy of maintaining the parity of our <Col N="725" /> currency.  Contrary to rumour, there was no question at any time of a special deal for the Irish pound.  This would have made little sense and would hardly be accepted by the markets.  Our efforts were directed towards improvements in the operation of the exchange rate mechanism, with multilateral intervention, to secure greater stability and to demonstrate effectively to the markets that further speculation against the currencies in the mechanism were unwarranted and would not succeed.  I know that we were not alone in seeking change and we were not alone in pointing to the need for reductions in German interest rates quickly.  We also stressed the need for some disciplines on currencies which participate in the EMS but have suspended their obligations within the exchange rate mechanism.  As participants they have commitments to ensure that their economic and monetary policies are not inconsistent with the overall obligations of EMS members and it is vitally important that these commitments be honoured. This is an issue that will be pursued further at European level by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the days immediately prior to the devaluation of the Irish pound there were indications from our European partners that they were willing to consider intervention on a co-operative basis to support our position.  This would have been an extension of the support given to us during the crisis; as we have seen, this support was provided later for the Danish krone.  It represents a change in the operation of the intervention arrangements, which has yet to prove itself, and hopefully it is a sign that improved arrangements will emerge in the future.  In the circumstances it was the view of the Irish authorities that this would have been too little too late and that it would be insufficient to achieve an immediate reduction in Irish inter-bank interest rates.  This view is supported by the fact that some Danish official rates are very high despite the cut in German rates.  Besides, we had no reason to assume then that the reduction in German rates would be implemented within days.  It is regrettable <Col N="726" /> that an offer of multilateral intervention from our European partners should have come so late in the day.  We had proposed this repeatedly at earlier stages but it had not been possible to get universal support.</P>
    <P>Following the devaluation of the Irish pound, it became evident last week that the whole system was under imminent threat once again.  While the Danish krone was in the front line, there were pressures on other currencies and a co-ordinated initiative was needed immediately. When it reduced interest rates it was, according to the Bundesbank, responding to changes in domestic and global economic conditions and to pressure on the EMS.</P>
    <P>The Government decided on a devaluation of 10 per cent because this was the figure required to bring our effective market exchange rate back broadly to its level of the first half of last year and to provide the best prospect of getting early reductions in interest rates.  Our partners agreed to support this figure while reaffirming their viewpoint that an adjustment was not warranted by reference to convergence criteria.  They welcomed the assurance that the Irish pound will continue as one of the core currencies of the exchange rate mechanism in the movement towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The change in the parity of our currency has provided immediate reliefs. The threat of increases in retail interest rates generally and mortgage rates has receded.  Interest rates continue, however, to be high and I must warn against expectations that rates can be brought down further in the immediate future.  I am optimistic, however, that there can be further reductions and that interest rates will be down significantly later this year.  This will obviously depend on external as well as internal factors.  In particular the timing of further reductions in European interest rates generally will be an important factor in determining the timing of reductions in Irish interest rates.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of Irish industry measured on a trade weighted basis has <Col N="727" /> been restored.  The position of exporters and of those competing with goods produced abroad has been improved.  There are also increases in farming incomes. These are the immediate benefits and they may beg the question as to why there was such opposition over a long period to devaluation.  There has been opposition because of the clear attendant risks over the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>I have always accepted that there are some short term gains from devaluation. However, devaluation has imposed significant costs on the State.  It has added about £800 million to the national debt and the additional cost of servicing this debt in the current year will be about £50 million.  The debt of the State-sponsored bodies has increased by about £160 million and the servicing of this will impose an extra charge of about £15 million on these bodies this year.  Of much more significance are the inflationary pressures on the economy.  Experience has shown that devaluation rarely secure a permanent improvement in competitiveness and instead tend to leave enduring interest rate disadvantages.  It has to be a priority of Government to address these problems in the forthcoming budget and with other policy initiatives to ensure that on this occasion we make devaluation work.  Unless costs are contained and, through responsible policies, we manage to contain price increases, our competitiveness could suffer.  We must continue to improve our competitiveness to create additional employment.</P>
    <P>Some critics have suggested that the devaluation would not have been necessary if the Government had introduced measures to reduce domestic costs and so restore the competitive position of the economy.  There is no doubt but that adjustment of domestic costs would have eased pressures on business, but these critics have not spelled out clearly the scale of the adjustments which would have been needed and the implications for incomes and for the public finances.</P>
    <P>An example of what might have been necessary was given by the director <Col N="728" /> general of IBEC when he said that a freeze in wages would not be adequate &mdash; what was needed was an actual reduction in nominal wages.  Reducing other industrial costs on the lines requested by the director general of IBEC would have required significant tax reductions or subsidies.  This would have increased the budget deficit at a time when it is already under strain from the effects of recession and rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>There has been much misinformed comment about the costs of defending the parity of the Irish pound over several months.  There appears to be an impression in some quarters that big expenditures were involved through loss of external reserves.  It is true that the reserves were depleted but reserves are intended for use in an emergency and the standard procedure is to use them to minimise the worst effects of a difficult situation.  As long as we continue to manage the economy in a prudent way, the reserves can recover very quickly. For example, overseas investors sold substantial amounts of Irish gilts.  This repayment of debt to non-residents was refinanced by borrowing from other non-residents denominated in foreign currency. The additional foreign currency debt increased by about 8 per cent in response to devaluation.  On the positive side, the interest rate on this debt is currently well below the interest rate on Irish pound debt.  Besides, my information is that there would have been substantially more disinvestment from Irish gilts, both in the short term and the longer term, if we had not demonstrated a strong commitment to currency stability.  Following the easing of tensions in the markets generally our reserves have already improved very substantially.  I am not in a position to mention any figures, as is the tradition, but I can assure the House that the authorities are satisfied with the situation.</P>
    <P>In any difficult situation where a major decision has to be made there are attendant costs and benefits on both sides and many elements cannot be reduced to arithmetic.  There were figures mentioned <Col N="729" /> about job losses and potential job losses as a consequence of policy on the exchange rate.  These figures were grossly exaggerated and there was a growing tendency in some quarters to attribute every redundancy to the currency crisis. There were obvious costs associated with excessively high interest rates but there can be no assurance that interest rates would be lower if we had devalued in September.  On the contrary, devaluation then would probably have built a long term premium into Irish interest rates because of market doubts about the strength of our commitment to maintaining a stable currency both now and in the future.  This reputation for stability could prove to be a very important factor in the longer term.  On the downside, it is well to bear in mind that the devaluation of the currency can have a damaging impact on employment in the longer term and we must be very careful to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>The currency crisis has generated much debate about speculation.  There has been quite intense speculation against all currencies in the EMS which came under threat.  I would define speculation as short term borrowing of a currency solely for the purpose of making a large profit from a subsequent devaluation.  It is an accepted practice in the marketplace &mdash; involving the corporate sector and banks located overseas &mdash; and we have no choice but to learn to live with it, within whatever rules apply internationally. However, the experience of recent months will open up the debate about market regulation.  The markets have become huge and very sophisticated and, working at international level, the monetary authorities must ask themselves whether existing regulations should be strengthened to counter undue speculation and to put reasonable limits on the powers of the markets.  Exchange controls are now seen as a sign of weakness but, internationally, the classic response of higher interest rates may not be enough in the future to maintain proper balances.  I believe that significent changes are likely but these are probably down the road.  As regards the speculation <Col N="730" /> against the Irish pound.  I can say that it proved costly for many of the speculators who used the mechanism over many months and who hoped we would quickly devalue in September, but this was not to be so.</P>
    <P>The most important consideration now is to plan well for the future.  The Irish pound will remain within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.  This is seen as the best guarantee of future stability.  While there are still residual fears, I believe that the worst of the EMS crisis is over and the system can recover its equilibrium quickly.  The process towards economic and monetary union is continuing.  It is well to bear in mind that stage II is due to commence on 1 January 1994.  I have no reason to believe this deadline will not be met.</P>
    <P>I have heard the case being made for alternative policies, particularly that the Irish pound be free-floated as a means of achieving a dramatic reduction in interest rates in the short term.  I have referred to this already.  Superficially this may seem attractive and getting interest rates down as quickly as we can must be a priority. I must warn, however, that this kind of approach would amount to a high risk and dangerous strategy that could do serious damage to the economy down the road; for a small open economy this is much too dangerous.  As a small currency we cannot free-float; the markets would in all probability attach us to some larger currency and, as I have said already, in our situation, we would be linked to sterling. We must adjust to the new realities in regard to sterling and we will not return to the exchange rate that applied in the first half of 1992.  We will not adjust our exchange rate in response to changes in sterling.  Irish business must recognise this as a fact of life and plan for the future on this basis.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years we have invested heavily in a disciplined approach to economic management and this has paid excellent dividends up to now in terms of low inflation and reduced budget deficits.  The stability of our currency has been a very signficiant factor and we must <Col N="731" /> do our best to ensure that devaluation does not undo in any way the achievements of recent years.  I am disappointed that devaluation was inevitable and reject the viewpoint that an earlier devaluation would have avoided much of the difficulty. On the contrary, I believe we have gained much in credibility in consequence of our determined opposition. It is regrettable that the national consensus against devaluation could not be sustained.  As demonstrated in other countries, this consensus is necessary in order to successfully defend the parity of a currency.  We must now adopt to the stiuation in which we find ourselves. There will the short term advantages but some long term cost.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, there will be a stronger level of economic activity this year compared wit what would have been the case if we had not devalued.  On the budgetary front the effects this year will be only slightly negative.  The extra costs in debt servicing will be balanced by positive gains in other areas.  In the longer term our foreign debt has increased and we will probably suffer a premium on our interest rates in the medium term.  We need to reduce this premium.  Even in the short term inflation this year will be higher than if we had not devalued.  There has been a downward trend and this has been reversed but only to a limited extent.</P>
    <P>The new situation presents us with a challenge.  We have been given a competitive advantage in certain markets and we must seek to get the benefits in terms of jobs from this.  In countries which we have devalued against, for example, Germany, France, the Benelux countries and the US, we have now a major competitive advantage in terms of our exports prices. In other areas where we compete with UK or Italian products we reduced the degree of adjustment required for firms in those markets.  This should help support our current market share.  Indeed, given low wage inflation in recent years here we should be expanding markets.  In other areas, for example, tourism, the devaluation increases the attractiveness <Col N="732" /> of Ireland for visitors from both the US and Europe.  It will also help boost the growth of holidays domestically for Irish people.</P>
    <P>We must as a nation now work together to take advantage offered by the devaluation. All sectors must work together, as we have done in the past, to turn devaluation into concrete achievement in employment.  We must not seek to compensate ourselves in personal income terms for anything lost by devaluation. Rather it must be through increased productiviely that we earn back any losses.</P>
    <P>As a strategic consideration we have worked to lessen dependence on the UK market.  We must continue this process. Otherwise, we may be over-affected, at a future date, by sterling volatility.  We need to break in the markets' minds this perceived link.  Our economic performance over recent years has been far better in terms of pay rises and inflation than the UK.  This must be reflected in our exchange rate.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt in Deputies' minds about our exchange rate policy. The main aim of the Irish exchange rate policy is the preservation of the Irish pound at existing bilateral rates within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.  Until last September, the system had provided a stable regime for our currency and we now hope that, following the recent crisis, the system will return to its former stability.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the widespread support throughout a difficult period for the policy adopted by the Government.  This support came from many quarters, and not least from people who were immediately affected by increased competition in business or by mortgage increases.  It says much for the maturity of the Irish people that there was a general recognition of the merit of resisting the easier short term option in the interests of the longer term benefit of the economy. While we could not sustain this policy in the face of intense pressures, it is encouraging that there is such a strong appreciation <Col N="733" /> here of the merits of a stable currency based on a low inflation policy.</P>

      <P>A hard currency policy and soft option politics do not mix.  Since last September Governments involving Deputies Reynolds and Ahern tried to defend a sudden and unsought increase in the value of the Irish pound on international markets without taking any of the measures at home that were needed to underpin and justify such an increased value.  That increased value collapsed because the fundamentals of the Irish economy were not sound.  A country with 300,000 people out of work &mdash;&mdash; 23 per cent unemployment &mdash; and from which 150,000 emigrated does not have a fundamentally sound economy.  Balance of payments statistics artificially boosted by transfer pricing by multinationals are not the fundamentals of an economy.  The fundamentals of an economy are the people who live in that economy.  An economy where up to 30 per cent of people cannot find work at home is not fundamentally sound.  The international markets could see that.  Currency dealers who read the monthly Irish unemployment statistics could see that the Irish Government had not taken any convincing permanent steps to protect jobs in the exposed sectors of the economy at the increased value of the pound since last September.  They knew that further job losses caused by the new exchange rates were inevitable and politically unsustainable.</P>
      <P>The reason the Government's exchange rate policy collapsed was that its economic and social policy on jobs was unconvincing.  Unfortunately, the Government thought that currency policy was something one could pursue in some sort of theoretical world, divorced from the reality of employment and unemployment, but it was wrong.  Its mistake only underlines the unhealthy dual nature of the Irish economy identified in the Culliton report, the Telesis report and many other independent analyses of the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sectors in the Irish economy; a foreign owned sector attracted <Col N="734" /> here by grants and a 10 per cent profits tax, whose operations are international and whose costs are only slightly affected by the value of the Irish pound.  This sector employes 95,000 people only. Frequently, its goods are priced in foreign currency and sold in captive markets controlled or developed by its foreign owners.  In other words, they are unaffected by currency policy.  Much more important there is a native manufacturing sector which employs far more people than does the foreign owned sector.</P>
    <P>Its profits may not be as great but it is far more sensitive to the value on a day-to-day and month-to-month basis of the Irish currency. It is because of the activities of this Irish owned native sector that we are still in a position to export one-third of our products to Britain.  The labour intensive, native Irish owned firms produce most of these exports.  These firms, not the multinationals, were vulnerable to job losses as a result of the new exchange rate policy pursued by the Government since September.  The currency policy of any country should be based on enlightened self-interest.  The German currency policy is based on German self-interest and the French currency policy on French self-interest. Similarly, Irish policy should be based on Irish self-interest.  Ireland's position is not similar to that in Germany.  Germany's problem is how to cope with the restructuring of East Germany, internal migration and immigration.  Excess demand is caused in Germany by Government spending which leads in turn to high interest rates.  Ireland's problems are almost exactly the reverse as demand for labour here is too low.  We do not have enough jobs for our existing population, let alone having a problem of immigration.  There are 300,000 people unemployed and 150,000 recently emigrated. Germany's problem is immigration; our problem is emigration and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our currency policy must reflect reality in that context.  We need an economic policy that reduces the marginal cost of creating and preserving a job.  The Germans <Col N="735" /> need an economic policy that maximises the rate of return on the massive savings of the German people.  There may be occasions when the economic interests of Ireland and Germany will converge, but this will not always be the case.  Until such time as there is a single European economic policy the Irish Government remains responsible for Irish economic and currency policy.  Irish currency policy cannot be put on autopilot to operate on a computer programme designed for the needs of the German economy by the German Bundesbank.</P>
    <P>Basically over the last five months there was no Irish economic policy. There were three Governments in rapid succession, but each effectively abdicated responsibility.  There was more interest in Fianna Fáil in manoeuvring first to bring down a Government, then in-fighting and losing an election and finally in forming a Government in alliance with the Labour Party than in managing the Irish economy for the benefit of those who do not have jobs or who are likely to lose them.  In a real sense those who lost their jobs in the last five months were the victims of politics mismanaged primarily by the Fianna Fáil Party.  This brought about an unnecessary election, taking attention from economic policy for months on end.  People are losing jobs and paying excessive interest rates, which it may take many years to reduce, due to lack of political direction.  Those problems have arisen as a direct consequence of politics.</P>
    <P>Let nobody say that politics does not matter.  Politics does matter.  The reason for high interest rates and record redundancies in recent months is political mismanagment by the Fianna Fáil Party who brought their own Government down, wasted time in an election and in forming a new Government, time which should have been used to manage the Irish currency and the economy in the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Nothing has changed since the new Coalition came into being.  The experience of the last five months shows that <Col N="736" /> Irish policy-making at the highest level is gravely deficient.  Not only are Fianna Fáil and Labour politicians unable to understand Ireland's true interests, it seems some of the senior officials of State are unable to do so either.  There is no evidence of questioning of the exchange rate policy even by those most directly responsible for the preservation of jobs in the export sector &mdash; we compete with Britain, Italy, Spain and other countries against whom our currency has unwarrantedly appreciated since September.</P>
    <P>Senior figures in the trade union movement pursued a policy that completely ignored the needs of their many members in the exposed sectors of the economy. We can agree to set up for a to discuss the problem of unemployment and we can produce papers and studies to beat the band, but the real test of people's concern about unemployment is whether they are prepared to take courageous decisions to protect jobs and help create them &mdash;&mdash; by courageous decisions I mean decisions that hurt somebody.  I was prepared to say that the Irish pound should be realigned downwards and I said so publicly because I believe that jobs come first in Ireland.  Those who criticised me for doing so and placed pride before jobs were grossly mistaken in terms of the national interest.  There has been a conspiracy of censorship over the last number of months to prevent rational discussion of exchange rate policy.  This conspiracy is based on the false view that the value a country freely decides to place on its currency at any time is something akin to the national territory which must be defended at all costs and that anybody who questions it is guilty of treason.  It is no such thing.  The value a country places on its currency is no more than a pragmatic, political decision taken from day to day on the basis of what should be an understanding of the national interest. The problem is that there have been three Governments in the last five months, none of whom has had any real understanding of the national interest in terms of jobs.  In those circumstances it is reasonable for those in Opposition to advocate different policies from those <Col N="737" /> being pursued by the Government of the day as was done on this occasion by my party.</P>
    <P>During the general election in the televised debate I had with the Taoiseach I made it abundantly clear that if it came to a choice between maintaining the newly appreciated value of the Irish pound on the one hand or preserving jobs on the other, Fine Gael would choose to preserve jobs first.  Like others who did not press this point at the time we in Fine Gael presumed the Government had some rational plan to preserve jobs at this newly appreciated exchange rate.  As time went by it became increasingly obvious that the Government did not have a plan to preserve jobs at the new rate.  The measures it produced only added to the vulnerability of the exchange rate policy.  It proposed temporary &mdash;&mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash; measures to preserve jobs in various firms and to keep interest rates down for mortgage holders.  By producing measures that were avowedly temporary the Government merely advertised that its own currency policy was temporary.  This showed the depth of the Government's misunderstanding of what was happening and was an open invitation to sell the IR£ short.</P>
    <P>By the end of the year it was beginning to dawn on the Minister for Finance that the economy was running up a cul-de-sac. When briefing the press at the end of year budget returns the Minister for Finance said that devaluation was an option that would have to be considered by the incoming Government.  There were no attacks on him for lack of patriotism by either Deputy Spring or the trade union movement.  But he was promptly silenced and disowned by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Government had inferred that it would be willing to see the currency devalued in the context of a general realignment.  In other words, it was willing to have the Irish currency devalued but wanted other people to take political responsibility for initiating it, rather than the Irish Government itself.  This concept of support for a general realignment <Col N="738" /> policy was nothing more than an open invitation to speculators.  It was a signal that one was willing to see the currency devalued, but did not know when one would do it.  One was prepared for others to make the first move.  Nothing could be more clear an advertisement of policy weakness than advocacy of a general realignment, combined with reluctance to take unilateral action.  Obviously, if a Government decides that the currency value is wrong, it should act quickly rather than wait for others to make the first move.  That ability to make a decision to manage one's own affairs, in one's own interest, and in a prompt fashion, is the esential mark of good government. This Government plainly does not have that capacity.  It wanted to wait for others.</P>
    <P>If the Government really wanted to maintain the new value of the currency that came about in an unsought fashion last September, it should have immediately introduced a permanent reduction in the cost of job creation and maintenance in Ireland.  By making a permanent cut in job costs the Government would be emphasising that its new exchange rate policy was also permanent. Instead, what the Government did was simply introduce temporary measures which emphasised that the exchange rate policy, in turn, was merely temporary. The appropriate way of introducing permanent undepinning for the new exchange rate was the one advocated by Fine Gael last September.  Fine Gael told the Government that it should introduce a permanent 6 per cent cut in employers' PRSI &mdash;&mdash; a permanent 6 per cent cut in the cost of creating and maintaining a job in Ireland would have shown that the Government was serious about preserving jobs at the new exchange rate. Yet that suggestion was dismissed with contempt.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Government did nothing. It sat and waited, and hoped that the problem would go away.  I cannot see how the Government could ever have expected the problem to go away.  It was quite plain, once Britain had left the exchange rate mechanism, that it was not <Col N="739" /> going to raise interest rates sufficiently to bring the British pound back up to its previous parity with the Deutsche Mark. It was also quite obvious as the weeks passed that Britain was pursuing a policy of competitive devaluation of the British pound in order to stimulate its economy. Anybody with eyes to see could realise that that was the case, yet it took the Irish Government five months to realise what was happening.  In those five months, thousands of jobs were sacrificed, never to be returned; the indebtedness of many businesses and mortgage holders was needlessly increased by virtue of high interest rates in recent weeks; and the reserves of the Central Bank were run down in a vain and foolish attempt to defend what the Government itself by its actions demonstrated it believed to be indefensible, although it would not match its actions with words. Despite this monumental error, no one has offered to resign.  The Minister has not offered to resign, despite being disowned by the Taoiseach when he tried to change policy, and then seeing the entire policy collapse.  In effect, no one is willing to take responsibility.  That is unaccountable government.  Ministers, their advisers and supporters attempt to blame everyone else.  They have attempted to blame the European Community, the Germans, the British and even the Opposition in the Dáil.  The random nature of their attacks on others is no more than an indication of the desperation and humiliation suffered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The real question that has to be addressed is how this Government actually works when it comes to employment creation and maintenance.  Did the Ministers and Departments responsible for the preservation and creation of jobs have any say at all in exchange rate policy, or have they been just as culpable as the Minister for Finance?  Why did the Taoiseach, having issued a stirring statement against devaluation at the Cairde Fáil dinner, entirely disappear from the public policy-making stage and leave the Minister for Finance alone to take <Col N="740" /> responsibility?  What advice did the Bundesbank offer the Irish Government on this matter?  Did the Bundesbank, through the Central Bank, tell the Government that it would have to take certain unpalatable steps in regard to pay and public expenditure if it was to sustain the currency value.  Was this advice ignored and was that the reason for the collapse?</P>
    <P>This series of events shows that this Government is quintessentially the victim and not the master of events. When we elect a Government we elect it to be the master and not the victim of events, yet we have a Government that has allowed the affairs of this country to be carried like a cork bobbing along on the stream generated by events outside this country.  We have a sovereign Government and have the capacity to manage our own exchange rate policy. Instead, this Government has allowed events outside to dictate the policy of a country which faces massive problems in terms of employment.</P>
    <P>My concern centres not just on the approach of the Government on this matter but on the entire policy-making establishment that has been built up around the concept of social partnership. In the eyes of many of those involved, the unemployed do not really matter. Those who are about to lose their jobs in employment perhaps not as highly paid as that of some of those who are making policy do not really matter, either, in the eyes of the policy-making establishment. It seems that the important thing is to be able to hold one's head high when one goes to meetings in Brussels.  I would like to remind the Government that the unemployed do matter.  Too many people from all categories of employment have lost their jobs in recent months and others are likely, as a result of this failed policy, to lose their jobs in coming months for the problems of the unemployed and the problems of employment not to be at the very core of policy making in this State.  My responsibility and that of my party is to ensure that in all policy issues, including the budget that is soon to be introduced, the problems of <Col N="741" /> employment and unemployment take their place at the top of the national agenda, as most certainly they did not in the past five months' handling of the currency issue by this already discredited Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the currency crisis which culminated in the costly and ignominious devaluation of Saturday, 30 January, erupted last September I was very concerned at the impact that the sterling devaluation of that time would have on our export competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce then, I ensured that my Department carefully monitored the impact of the revaluation of our costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our single most important market, which is still Britain.  I was also aware that, whereas we had reduced our overall export dependence on that market to around one third, that figure masked levels of dependency of up to 60 per cent and more on the British market for certain companies and commodities.  It also masked a very high level of dependency on the Irish domestic market for companies who were in direct competition with British suppliers.</P>
      <P>The significance of this factor was particular in two ways.  The companies concerned were mainly Irish owned, and they were also labour intensive, as opposed to capital intensive, the very kind of companies that we need more of, and which every expert analysis, including Telesis and Culliton, rightly insists must be nurtured and expanded if we are ever to effectively tackle the underlying unemployment crisis in Irish society.</P>
      <P>Companies in sectors like food processing, precision engineering, clothing and textiles and furniture are the kind of export companies concerned, and they quickly began to hurt from last September onwards.  Stated quite simply, the nub of the problem was that the price they were getting for their goods in Britain was slashed by up to 15 per cent, and they faced competition from British firms enjoying a similar 15 per cent advantage in price on other markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was for those reasons that I, as the <Col N="742" /> Minister responsible then, brought forward the Market Development Fund as an emergency measure to safeguard jobs from the impact of the currency crisis.  I had this scheme speedily approved by Cabinet and by the EC Commission in Brussels, and I launched it on 6 October last, within three weeks of sterling's exit from the ERM.  Under that scheme, which was, and is, scheduled to run to the end of March, support grants of up to £50 a week per employee were provided to sustain up to 30,000 jobs in Irish industry.  It was a measure that met with universal approval, and there is little doubt that it has had a very positive impact in staving off the worst effects of the sterling devaluation and the drop in British interest rates.  I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the efficiency of my then departmental staff and An Bord Tráchtála in particular &mdash;&mdash; since that was the agency directly administering the scheme &mdash;&mdash; for the innovation, efficiency and effectiveness brought to the task.</P>
    <P>In the main, it was designed to give us the necessary respite to address the underlying problems of the loss of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain and also to tackle the underlying defects so evident in the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to realise that this measure was generally regarded at the time as a temporary one, a respite to allow us to tackle the underlying problems both at EC level and here.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, I was full aware that if sterling were to remain very weak and if the currency difficulties causing so much difficulty within the European Monetary System were to persist it would be essential that the emerging cost handicaps for Irish industry be tackled more directly.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration, for instance, was given at the time by my Department to the burden of PRSI on industry. Clearly, if our hard currency stance within the exchange rate mechanism were to be maintained, further remedial measures would have to be adopted to redress the 15 per cent cost handicap we were facing in our main export market, <Col N="743" /> which was clearly threatening many thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>It was also quite obvious that it was esential for this country to mount a major diplomatic offensive at EC level, with the Commission in Brussels and in the capitals of our Community partners, to seek to ensure that the underlying defects in the ERM were speedily and effectively tackled.  This needed to be done last November and December &mdash;&mdash; not in the few days before the eventual devaluation of 30 January last.</P>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind that in the September-October period there was virtual unanimity, embracing all industrial sectors and their representative bodies, both employers and unions, and the financial institutions and market analysts alike, that it was preferable to maintain our hard currency status with the ERM.  Nobody at that time seriously advocated devaluation.</P>
    <P>Pursuit of that currency policy, and staking our place within the hard-currency, narrow band of the ERM, had served us well.  In particular, this policy had helped bring interest rates here down to within 0.75 per cent of German levels at one point; had led to a significant increase in overall employment in Ireland in the 1988-91 period, and had led to a fall in the level of Government borrowing.  It marked a period of genuine confidence in the Irish economy.  It had been hard won through shared and difficult sacrifices by all sectors of the Irish people particularly in the last quarter of the 1980s.  Clearly, it was a policy very much worth defending, comprehensively and effectively.</P>
    <P>Tragically, the essential action at EC and domestic level were not undertaken, and the disastrous slide culminating in the economic débacle of the enforced devaluation of 30 January last began early in November.  The collapse of the Government then, caused by the enforced resignation of my party, and the subsequent three week election campaign, meant that no real Government attention was given to the deepening financial crisis here during the month of <Col N="744" /> November.  There was no offensive at EC Commission or EC capitals level, and the then minority Fianna Fáil Government, which had wilfully precipitated the political crisis here, threw the fate of our currency and the jobs of thousands of Irish workers to the wolves while they concentrated solely on retaining power. At that stage, too, the only domestic policy instrument being deployed to defend our currency was actually driving up Irish business costs.  By raising interest rates to penal levels, in a bid to head off currency speculators, the cost of overdrafts and other borrowing for Irish business and industry became unbearable, and job losses began to grow.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, therefore, the longer the battle was going to be waged using only the policy instrument of hiking up interest rates the more it was compounding the problems of Irish industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> its main market, Britain.  Not only that, the high level of interest rates was also clearly seen to be unsustainable by international investors, who thus viewed the Irish pound even more negatively, forcing interest rates ever higher in a vicious circle which was strangling Irish companies.</P>
    <P>However, despite this, all we had was political paralysis and indifference from the then minority Fianna Fáil Government. This was underlined by its failure to seek any relief for our currency at EC level or to take any other step that might have been appropriate in the circumstances on the weekend of 21 November, when the Spanish and Portuguese currencies were both devalued &mdash; that weekend being the time of the second devaluation of the Spanish currency.</P>
    <P>The options we could have actively pursued on that occasion were to devalue with the Spanish and the Portuguese, to seek to encourage the French and the Danes to devalue with us as part of a more general realignment or to do what the Danes succeeded in doing last week, namely, ensure that the Germans cut their interest rates or brought Irish pounds above the ERM floor level or did both.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the general election on 25 November last, the political paralysis <Col N="745" /> here at Government level simply persisted. At that stage it was simply unforgivable. Whatever understandable reluctance a Government facing an election three or four days later might show in the weekend before the election, there was no need for equal diffidence when the election was over.  By the end of November there was no sign of a sterling recovery and no prospect of a general ERM realignment.</P>
    <P>The problems of Irish industrialists were worsening by the day.  And more and more of the country's foreign reserves were being spent to buy Irish pounds in the face of heavy selling from overseas.</P>
    <P>By this stage, the Government was down to a very clear-cut choice.  It had to take immediate and decisive action to tackle the cost imbalances that were crippling industry here.  That too would have helped convince our EC partners that we really meant what we said.  Or we should as a sovereign Government have taken the positive decision to devalue.</P>
    <P>But neither of these courses were taken, nor was any intervention by our Community partners, and notably by the Bundesbank, secured.  And so the agony simply piled on.  Instead of firm actions to tackle the 15 per cent cost handicap of Irish industry exporting to the United Kingdom, or any sign of effective aid at Communiy level, a minority Government now intent on finding a new coalition partner, resorted to jingoistic rhetoric and xenophobia which fooled nobody abroad at least.</P>
    <P>We need clear answers here today about what kind of diplomatic actions were pursued by the Department of Finance, and the then Government, in the aftermath of the election on 25 November at Community level.  Did they not realise then that the only response from the EC Commission and the German Bundesbank would be mere words of encouragement?</P>
    <P>If they did not know this, they should have known it.  Armed with the reality there was a clear onus on the Government to take appropriate action here to stem the cost crisis facing large sectors of <Col N="746" /> Irish industry.  That action should have involved a special meeting of all the social partners, under the auspices of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The agenda for such a meeting should have been to agree the actions essential to drive down Irish costs and prices, and in the process bolster the confidence of the financial markets in our currency.  But tragically that kind of positive political leadership did not materialise.</P>
    <P>At Community level, last December's Edinburgh Summit afforded a further opportunity to seek some communitaire response to our difficulties in so far as the inherent defects of the EMS were concerned. But here our unfortunate and overriding mendicant attitude to Community membership again dominated our considerations.</P>
    <P>With the Danish Government seeking special concessions for its further Maastricht Referendum, and the other member states equally concerned to restore faith in that process, here was a golden opportunity to insist on our currency crisis receiving real attention at Community level.</P>
    <P>But our representatives were more obsessed with Structural Fund bonanzas that would win banner headlines at home and which might induce economic growth in the future rather than protecting existing and hard-won economic welfare in the form of thousands and thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>Faced with the continuing economic haemorrhage which still afflicted this country as 1992 gave way to the New Year, the leisurely pace of government-making indulged in by Labour and Fianna Fáil was simply unconscionable. All we got was more jingoistic rhetoric, with warnings to speculators, foreigners and unnamed financial institutions.  But like the charge of the Light Brigade, it might have looked or sounded magnificent but it was not war.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 5 January and noting that six weeks had elapsed since the election, I pleaded for urgency in dealing with the monetary crisis, and <Col N="747" /> I drew attention to the previous day's statement of the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation that a further 30,000 jobs in Irish firms were then at risk.  Urging an immediate conclusion to the Government-making talks, I pointed to the need for a clear strategy for dealing with the monetary crisis and pointed out that, to be successful, it also required a Community-wide framework.</P>
    <P>But even with the eventual formation of the new Government on 12 January last there was still no action just more rhetoric and renewed declarations of no surrender under any circumstances.  The firm domestic actions that would have relieved the cost handicaps of industry here and would have reassured the financial markets were still funked.  The last Government meeting I attended was at the end of October, and I recall one decision being made there clearly, unanimously and urgently by the Government &mdash; that was the Minister for Communications would take immediate steps to effect a reduction in the cost of overseas telephone calls from this country which, on average, are about 35 per cent higher than similar calls from other countries to here.  It seemed to me and to the Government that was essential because it was one of the most significant and identifiable cost handicaps afflicting Irish industry and especially exporters.  That was in October.  We are now in February and we are still paying 35 per cent more on average than other countries and, of course, substantially 35 per cent more than some.</P>
    <P>The new Government in mid-January simply renewed, mantra-like, its commitment to hold the exchange rate and when the ignominious climbdown was finally forced on them at the end of that month, they had inflicted on our economy, even longer-term damage by a massive loss of credibility.  Moreover, they had now shown that they were either unable or unwilling to take the necessary domestic actions to give credibility and substance to their rhetoric.</P>
    <P>While the fault for the eventual débacle of 30 January certainly lies in <Col N="748" /> part with our ERM partners for their indifference and their non-communitaire attitude, the real fault lies with the two successive Fianna Fáil-led administrations, the minority one and the coalition with Labour, which were charged with the economic management of this country since last November.  We are a sovereign people with a sovereign Government and the buck stops here at home.</P>
    <P>These points are made, not because of any desire to score points or to seek any satisfaction in the ignominious defeat of this Government.  It is not just this Government which has lost; it is we, the Irish people, who have lost and who will have to bear the costs of this devaluation in lost jobs and premium interest rates, perhaps for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I now want to elaborate briefly on some of the harsh economic consequences of devaluation and what they mean for this country.  The fact that, at Community level, the Germans came to the support of the Danish krone, but not the Irish punt has established certain financial and political realities.  The political reality is that our Government simply did not make its case well enough to the German authorities, for the reasons that I have already outlined.  We had to settle for rhetorical aid from them.  And it is worth noting, too, that while the Bundesbank is noted for being independent this is not the case for currency intervention.  That is decided by the German political authorities, although it is administered by the Bundesbank.</P>
    <P>The financial reality of the devaluation has very serious implications for future interest rates here in Ireland, as well as for Government borrowing, and for exchange rate policy and, of course, for the question of our participation in a single currency and Economic and Monetary Union, assuming that it goes ahead as planned in either 1997 or 1999.</P>
    <P>By supporting the Danish krone and the French franc but not the Irsh punt, the other European Central Banks have clearly put our currency outside the first tier, or division one, of the ERM dominated by Germany, France, the Benelux <Col N="749" /> and Denmark.  This means that Irish gilts may well now be valued relative to the division two ERM countries like Spain and Portugal.  And whereas the Spanish ten-year bond yield has averaged 12.35 per cent over the last three months, its Irish equivalent was 10.05 per cent, a 2.3 per cent advantage for us.  But now, if we are confined to the lower ERM division, it could mean an increase of up to 2.3 per cent in the cost of short term money to the Government.  That is a very serious matter when we consider that over £13 billion raised on the Irish money markets by the Irish Government in gilts is outstanding at the moment.</P>
    <P>I heard with interest reports of a speech made early this morning in Paris by Mr. Peter Sutherland and while I have not seen the text of his speech, and I am loathe to comment on it in any detail, I am glad that Mr. Sutherland has raised some of the points he did and has started the form of debate to which I hope his speech may lead.  In the light of what I have just said, his hopes that seven of the 12 member states, including Ireland, would move almost immediately towards currency union and a single hard currency are probably unrealisable, for the simple reason that if it happens we will not be within it, and even if we were, Britain would be outside it.  If sterling were to continue to fall against such a new European Community currency the difficulties we experienced in recent months would be suffered all over again.  We would have no freedom of action being locked into a very hard currency where clearly the other six member states would not wish to pay any attention to further British devaluation.  If these developments take place the problems that we face should be worked on actively by the Government. It is impossible for the Irish Government now not to play a leading part in trying to implement the changes that will have to be made within a matter of weeks.  All member states, whether they were affected or not, realise that the chaos of recent months can never be revisited on the Community without causing serious difficulties for it in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> While the recent slight reduction in German interest rates has eased the immediate pressure within the ERM, tensions could return to the system.  At home, despite devaluation, interest rates are still at an unaffordable level for many businesses and are crippling any chances of significant new investment prospects. The economy is severely depressed and we need a clear statement on the Government's economic strategy in the wake of the enforced devaluation.  Our prevailing interest rates underline the fact that the currency problems are still with us.  One of the most disturbing aspects of the last few days is that, after this enforced devaluation, our pound was up yesterday to 103.2 pence sterling and is at 102.9 pence sterling at the moment.  It is also very ominous that manufacturing inflation in Britain was described yesterday in official figures as having risen in the past 12 months to 7.2 per cent.  In a short time that underlying price rise will percolate the British equivalent of our CPI and cause significant inflation in Britain.  Our inflation outlook for this year must cause concern and disappointment. Whereas prior to devaluation we were looking at the distinct possibiliby of an inflation rate of 1 per cent or less for this year, it now seems unlikely that our inflation rate will be below 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The crisis of the past five months has wrought a terrible attrition on Irish industry. The extent of the damage is still not fully apparent.  Therefore, it is essential for the Government to effectively tackle the problem, however belatedly, in the forthcoming budget.  If it is to relieve the interest rate pressures on our economy it must effectively relieve the overall costs now facing Irish industry and the growing debt problem.  The Government should be aware that increases in taxation to fund increases in expenditure will simple compound the problem by reducing consumption, driving out investment and renewing the economic haermorrhage caused by cross-Border shopping which is likely to be far more extensive from now on with the advent of the single market and the abolition of customs controls. <Col N="751" /> Therefore, prior to the budget and the publication of the Estimates, the Minister for Finance has strict duty to impress on his colleagues that if there were ever a time and need for control of and reduction in expenditure this is it because of the events of recent months and, in particular, those of 30 January.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The currency crisis has raised the most profound questions about the future direction of the European Community. Given the dramatic lack of solidarity shown by other powerful EC states when this country was battling to defend its currency, there is an urgent need to reopen the debate on the Maastricht Treaty process.  The experience of the past six months shows that there is a very big gap between the generous <Col N="752" /> expressions of European solidarity and assurances of common interest given when the Maastricht Treaty was signed and the selfish &ldquo;every man for himself&rdquo; response, of most EC member states to the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left remains committed to the principle of European union but the painful experience of the past six months has shown that the reservations we expressed about the Maastricht Treaty were very well founded.  When pointed out that the agreement was incomplete in some areas and badly flawed in others, we were accused of being negative, destructive, isolationist and anti-European. Unfortunately, there was little real debate in Ireland about the Maastricht Treaty.  The abortion Protocol was a vitally important issue but, unfortunately, it diverted attention from the political and economic implications of the Maastricht Treaty.  There was an unprecedented pro-Maastricht Treaty alliance of the political, business, farming and trade union establishments which resulted in whatever debate there was being very lopsided.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have every right to ask some of those who advocated an unquestioning and uncritical endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty to account for some of their statements.  They have every right to believe that they were not given the full picture by their political leaders and were, in fact, misled.  We all remember how, in a move virtually unprecedented in my memory, Deputies Reynolds, Bruton, Spring and O'Malley posed for the cameras on Leinster Lawn in a show of political unity and assured the people that if they voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; it would be all European blue skies while a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would condemn us to a life under permanently grey skies.  It is interesting to examine what these four champions of the Maastricht Treaty said in their joint statement of 9 June and I quote:</P>
    <P>It would run the risk of causing a flow of investment funds out of the country, an increase in interest rates, still higher unemployment and lower living standards.  It would also relegate <Col N="753" /> us to the margins with a greatly reduced ability to influence the major decisions being made internationally which directly affect our interests one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that statement is not about devaluation but one made by the leaders of the other parties on 9 June on the implications of voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Of course, the party leaders concerned were doing no more than reflecting the establishment consensus that was so intolerant of any alternative view that pointed out deficiencies in the Treaty.  Democratic Left was denounced at the time as European lepers for doing no more than highlighting some of these deficiencies.  It was not until the outcome of the Danish referendum that the other parties condescended to join the real debate.  Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats forecast ruin for the country if we voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The country voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; by a margin of two to one and the ruinous scenario predicted above has come to pass with a vengence.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government parties were so mesmerised by the promise of additional EC grant aid, the much vaunted £6 billion, that they saw nothing else, were interested in nothing else, and abandoned any pretence to critically assess the terms of the Treaty.  Fine Gael and Labour were so anxious to be part of the Euro-consensus that they abdicated their role as Opposition parties and allowed the Treaty and the legislation to go through the Dáil in the minimum of time and with the minimum of examination. The craven unquestioning posture at the time of the Maastricht debate betrays a political culture that is accustomed to the begging-bowl mentality and lacks confidence in our own capacity to earn a living as a people.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left was virtually a lone voice in pointing out the deficiencies of the Maastricht Treaty.  As a strongly pro-European party, we demanded that we should not sign such a binding treaty without a full debate and without changes. More important we pointed out the major flaws in the Treaty.  The Fianna <Col N="754" /> Fáil Progressive Democrats Government signed this Treaty without studying it. Their eyes lit up with dollar signs when they saw the &ldquo;promise&rdquo; of £6 billion. They saw nothing else.  Any decent trade union negotiator would have had great qualms about bringing such a deal to his-her members for approval.</P>
    <P>In essence, the flaws were that, while it established a huge single market, it failed, and failed substantially, to address the wider issues of who should regulate this massive market and how this should be done.  We were to get the cruelest demonstration of what this unregulated market for capital would mean sooner than any one dreamt.</P>
    <P>It was a gift to big corporations and to capital, but with only nominal social control.  Democratic Left asked who would gain and who would lose.  Spokes-persons for the other parties told us that we would all gain.  The Government did not debate it prior to signing.  Apparently the Progressive Democrats only discovered that Mr. Haughey had contrived the inclusion of Protocol 17 after signing. They dangled the promised £6 billion in front of the media.  The media loved it. The people were urged to believe in their leader writers and in their political leaders.</P>
    <P>No one would have believed that there could be such a destructive demonstration of what an untrammelled Single Market would mean until we saw the currency crisis.  This Single Market, with free flow of capital, was totally without regulation.  The authorities in 12 nation states, including four of the most powerful economies in the world, Germany, United Kingdom, France and Italy did not even know what was going on. They sat idly by as the sharks made killing after untaxed killing.  Amazingly, EC Summits at Birmingham and again at Edinburgh seemed not to even attempt to tackle the crisis.  I notice the Minister today admitted as much.  He pointed to the fact that the Summits at Edinburgh and Birmingham were failures.  It is a disturbing feature of the way we do our parliamentary business that when the Taoiseach, and Minister, returned from <Col N="755" /> those Summits they were praised in this House for having made an important contribution to the advancement of European integration.  The public press reported that the Taoiseach failed in Birmingham and again at the Edinburgh Summit to persuade other EC leaders to attempt to bring order to the capital markets and it appears that he did not even try.</P>
    <P>Surely if there is any lesson to be learned from these disastrous events it is that central bankers alone cannot create European union.  It must also be clear that unless the elected politicians seize the initiative back from the bankers and speculators, then the prospects for monetary union, let alone full political union, are very remote indeed.  The non-elected, non-accountable Bundesbank has shown itself to be far more powerful in regard to monetary policy than any elected government.  The constitutional and statutory role of the Bundesbank is to preserve the value of the Deutsche Mark; it does not have an EC-wide role.  Yet decisions which the Bundesbank were making were determining whether Irish people would have jobs and whether they could afford to meet their mortgage repayments.  That is not democracy.</P>
    <P>First, however, this House must deal with the question of accountability for the disastrous mismanagement of the ERM crisis as it impacted on Ireland.  It is all too typically Irish to set up a committee or a so-called war cabinet to handle the crisis.  Sometimes one is tempted to the view that the only reason we set up a committee in so many areas of Irish life is in order that nobody can be held accountable.</P>
    <P>This was a disaster whether one was for devaluation or against it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has rhymed off the reasons on many occasions as to why devaluation would be disastrous: a 10 per cent devaluation would add £150 million to debt service costs.  I notice that since we devalued the figure has gone down to £80 million which is a great deal of money no matter which way one looks at it.  The same devaluation <Col N="756" /> would lead to a 4 per cent deterioration in the debt-GNP ratio; interest rates would not necessarily come down.  Inflationary pressures would triumph and speculators who tasted blood may come back for more.  That is a fair account of the Minister's arguments at the time.</P>
    <P>Those in favour of devaluation are at a complete loss to explain why so much pain was needlessly inflicted on mortgage holders and sections of business.  Why were jobs lost, hundreds of millions of our reserves frittered away and mortgage holders uselessly penalised when it is now apparent that the concerted European action that might have staved off devaluation was never in prospect anyway?  Why did the war cabinet persist if they knew that international troops were not going to fight?  Who was advising the Minister to keep his finger in the dyke?  What advice was the Minister given?  Was the Minister available to be advised during the critical weeks between the general election and the election of a new Government?  Was the currency crisis forced to play second fiddle to the partisan imperative of the Minister securing his party in Government for another term?  How could the Government misread the unequivocal signals from the Bundesbank?  Was the Minister, Deputy Ahern, more concerned to interpret the signs from Herr Quinn than from Herr Slesinger?  In short, did the Government take its eye off the ball for reasons of political expediency and have the Irish people paid a heavy price for this dereliction of duty?</P>
    <P>These questions deserve answers.  Not only has our economy been debilitated and many of our citizens hurt but the credibility of the new Government has been damaged.  What precisely was the role of the Central Bank in all of this debacle?  What ought its role be and did it execute that role?  What, in the context of a crisis of this magnitude, is the relationship of the Central Bank to the Department of Finance?  Does not the primary, statutory and constitutional role rest with the Central Bank in such a crisis?</P>
    <P>The traditional silence of the Central <Col N="757" /> Bank is no longer good enough.  The responsibility rests with the Governor, Mr. Maurice Doyle.  He must publicly explain how he discharged his responsibilities in this affair.  Unless he can show that his advice was spurned by the Minister or unless he can demonstrate that the extraordinary tardiness and inconsistencies are not of his making, then he must tender his resignation.  However, if Mr. Doyle's account of the conduct of the Central Bank during the crisis is in conflict with public perception, then the Minister for Finance is honour bound to offer his own resignation.  Public uncontradicted comment about the manner in which the Central Bank allegedly does its business requires a public response from the Central Bank.  I was disappointed to receive a letter this morning from the Ceann Comhairle in response to a question I put down to the Minister for Finance on this matter pointing out:</P>
    <P>The Minister has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to this matter and it is one for the Central Bank itself.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are not entitled to ask questions about the conduct of such a matter of important public policy in the House.  Yet we know that a paper written recently by a former employee, an economist of the Central Bank, Mr. Cathal Guiomard, was exceptionally critical of the performance of the Central Bank in recent years.  I have no reason to believe that these are the views of a disenchanted employee but rather the soundly held views of a public spirited professional whose experience in the Central Bank gave him good cause to be so disenchanted. His reported criticisms are profoundly disturbing and require urgent rebuttal if they are not justified.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to an item in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 7 February 1993 where an attempt was made to summarise some of Mr. Guiomard's criticisms.  It states:</P>
    <P>That unlike its counterparts in other EC countries, the Central Bank's focus <Col N="758" /> is not on the country's economic development or on the approaching economic and monetary union, but on &ldquo;internal administrative issues&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That Ireland's representatives on the influential Committee of Governors in Basle rarely contribute and virtually never do so on issues that don't concern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That &ldquo;in general, staff are only recruited at the school-leaving stage.&rdquo; As a result, the level of qualifications is low . . . .</P>
    <P>That almost £3bn of foreign reserves are invested with the advice of just one economist, acting part-time.</P>
    <P>Hardly any resources are devoted to analysing what its policies should be and the bank &ldquo;seals itself off from the outside world, due to its paranoia about media comment . . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That &ldquo;a strong air of inactivity prevails throughout much of the bank much of the time.  We work fairly short hours fairly half-heartedly.  A low level of performance is demanded by management and so a low level is offered . . .  in fact, the bank is a very efficient machine for turning bright young active people into slow inactive ones . . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That the bank &ldquo;is a one-language&rdquo; institution and is largely unable to understand material from other EC countries.  That the bank's information technology is &ldquo;lamentable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That &ldquo;we do not do any fundamental research on European Monetary Union, we have not seriously tried to apply existing analysis to the Irish case and we do not even monitor the work that others are doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On and on it continues.  That litany is profoundly disturbing if it is true and, if it is not true, the Minister should reply in this debate and the Governor of the Central Bank should make his position clear publicly.</P>
    <P>What of the role of the Department of Finance?  Is it not time for this House, <Col N="759" /> against a background of the limited available literature, to properly debate the role of the modern Department of Finance in our economy?  Were the Department of Finance &mdash; assuming a subservient role by the Central Bank, a functional one by the NTMA and a passive or absent role by an otherwise preoccupied Minister &mdash; really calling the shots in this entire affair?  If they were, is that the way this House wants it to be? I have every conviction that all public officials, and not just those in the Department of Finance, acted from the highest motives.  However, one must be forgiven for inquiring whether these same officials manage to find time to talk to anyone outside in the real economy.  Whether or not the Minister was otherwise preoccupied, it is puzzling, to say the least, why the Department of Finance persisted for so long in defending the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I believe that the quality of public policy and not just the reputations of these institutions requires that those responsible for guiding these institutions have a suitable public forum to justify their actions.  I am quite sure they acted properly at all times but whether they acted wisely is a legitimate matter of public interest.  Either the Committee of Public Accounts or the proposed new Finance Committee &mdash; if it can be established sufficiently quickly &mdash; should provide such a forum immediately where these questions can be examined and where the people concerned can defend their actions.</P>
    <P>It could, of course, be the case that there is an exclusively political explanation for a series of actions and omissions that otherwise seem incomprehensible.  Certainly the behaviour of our political leaders almost defies understanding.  After the disastrous Birmingham Summit we were told that the Taoiseach was in &ldquo;a remarkably relaxed mood&rdquo; throughout and that he ambled through the summit &ldquo;with detached ease&rdquo;.  If the Taoiseach was in a &ldquo;relaxed mood&rdquo; during the Birmingham Summit, he was either out of touch with reality or he is a remarkably good actor and I do <Col N="760" /> not believe that actors make good heads of government.  Indeed, one has formed the view from public comment that the Taoiseach was out of touch for much of the crisis including the ignominious climbdown.  The history books will show that it was the misfortune of the Irish people that the currency crisis coincided with an unnecessary general election and its aftermath.  The history books will also show that it was the Taoiseach who unnecessarily provoked that general election.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, persisted in the aftermath of the election with the pre-election make-believe that we could resist devaluation because &ldquo;the fundamentals of our economy are sound&rdquo;.  Who are we kidding? More than 300,000 people &mdash; in reality almost 350,000 if one takes account of pre-retirement and small-holders not included on the register &mdash; are unemployed and we continue to repeat that &ldquo;the fundamentals of the economy are sound&rdquo;.  How can any economy be regarded as sound when more than 20 per cent of the workforce is idle; when two-thirds of our exports derive from companies who are tenants in our economy and when almost 90 per cent of our indigenous industry is trading into the UK?  Persuading EC counterparts to sing our song as distinct from mounting a planned, political and diplomatic offensive to persuade them to come to our aid was a futile exercise.  It did not fool the speculators and it did not cause the Bundesbank to do anything more than the minimum required by ERM rules.  But the Minister persisted with the same song and after Christmas acquired a partner in the Labour Party who were more than willing to make it a duet.</P>
    <P>Of all the incomprehensible actions of the Government surely the most bizarre was the hardline statement from the first new Cabinet meeting which added gratuitously that the Irish Government would not be seeking a negotiated realignment.  I find it difficult to dispute Paul Tansey's summary of the consequences:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Domestic business have been debilitated for over four months by an over-valued exchange rate and penal interest rates.  Their efforts to recover the ground and money lost will be hampered by continuing high interest rates. The authorities bet the bank against a devaluation of the Irish pound and lost. Now, we must all pay for their mistake with expensive money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As early as the economic debate of 8 October, Deputy De Rossa, suggested that a renegotiated realignment was the best of difficult options.  An unnecessary general election ended what might have been a period of productive questioning of the dominant view.  On December 1 in a lengthy speech I again raised the question of a political offensive for a negotiated realignment and complained of the adverse impact of the consensus and suppression of debate that was intolerant of any view other than the official one; a view that was beginning to be presented in increasingly nationalistic colours by sections of the media.</P>
    <P>At the first opportunity in the House, I again questioned the consensus on 15 December, when I commented:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is likely that the pound sterling will weaken further in January thus creating very serious additional problems for us.  I am not saying that in order to be controversial but about 10 days ago I pointed to the fact that there seems to be an orchestrated agreement that, irrespective of what happens, we all stand by the existing policy.</P>
    <P>Late and all as it is, it is not too late to start a real debate about Maastricht and European Union.  The ratification process is not complete as both Britain and Denmark have to complete their procedures. There are some people who believe that the Irish people may well have to be asked to vote on the matter again, given the significant changes made to accommodate Danish objections after the Irish referendum was held.</P>
    <P>Even if the ratification process is completed without further problem &mdash; and that is by no means certain &mdash; there is <Col N="762" /> still a need for a full debate on the future direction of the European Community and especially on the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.  But it is important that it should be a real debate with due consideration given to both the positive and negative aspects of the Treaty and not the one-side affair which we had last summer.</P>
    <P>There must be a far greater degree of accountability by the Government to the Oireachtas and to the people.  Never again must we allow the situation to happen, as it did with Maastricht, where the Government entered into negotiations on the future of Europe in circumstances of virtual secrecy with the Dáil and the people then being presented with the outcome of the negotiations as a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>My party has pressed repeatedly for a strong Oireachtas committee to deal with European affairs.  When the previous Fianna Fáil/Progessive Democrat administration proposed the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs, they wanted to exclude significant areas of EC business from the committee's remit.  The new Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs, but unfortunately makes no reference to its role in European affairs.</P>
    <P>The currency crisis of the past six months has been a painful and expensive lesson but it may not be an entirely wasted experience if it forces politicians in all member states to stand back and reassess the Maastricht Treaty.  If they are now forced to accept that the political structures for the process of integration must be based on the sharing of democracy and sovereignty, on genuine equality of citizenship and on balanced economic and social development in all regions of the community, then it may turn out to have been of some value.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss of jobs, the most severe impact of the currency crisis on the lives of ordinary people has been felt through the huge jump in mortgage rates. Even if the further threatened 3 per cent increase has, for the moment, been avoided &mdash; I hope, permanently, but I <Col N="763" /> doubt it &mdash; householders are now paying mortgage rates far higher than at this time last year.  Many families are being beggared by crippling mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will use the opportunity presented when replying to the debate to reassure householders that the Government intend to honour the commitment given during the election campaign &mdash; that if interest rates had not dropped before introducing the budget full mortgage relief would be restored and be backdated to 6 October.</P>
    <P>While the commitment was given by the Minister at the height of the election campaign, I am concerned that nothing has been heard of it since.  Ominously for householders, there was no mention of it in the Joint Programme for Government and there have been rumours in political and financial circles that the Government was looking for ways to try and extract itself from the promise.  Any attempt to renege on the promise would be a cruel betrayal of householders who are the core of our taxpayers.</P>
    <P>People on modest incomes, who have no choice but to buy their own homes because of the direction of national housing policy, have faced mortgage increases on a virtually unprecedented scale.  The farming organisations, employers and conservative economists who have called for a wage freeze and even wage cuts seem to have forgotten that, in many cases, the full benefits of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increase over the past two years have been wiped out by the mortgage spiral. A worker on the average industrial wage would have benefited by about £16.70 per week from the combined 7 per cent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increase over the past two years, but if that same worker has a mortgage of £40,000, he or she has had to face a mortgage increase of about £21 per week.</P>
    <P>People are simply terrified of further mortgage increases and, at the very least, the Minister should use the debate today to give them that assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo i dtaobh na dí-luachála, ceist atá anphráinneach do lucht talamhaíochta agus do lucht tionscail atá bunaithe ar an dtalamhaíocht.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important motion. Since the currency crisis erupted last September, the Government has had to make many difficult decisions, based on its best estimate of the economic and financial circumstances which prevailed. The reasons certain decisions were taken have already been clearly spelled out by the Minister, Deputy Ahern.  The Government's decision to sustain the value of the pound was the right one, given the consistent economic and monetary policy which had been followed in recent years.  The circumstances had changed nearly two weeks ago, when the decision to devalue was taken.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain to the House why I believe that the Government's policy in recent months was correct.  In doing this, I will set out how the currency crisis has affected the agricultural and food sector and what devaluation will mean to the sector.</P>
      <P>Farmers and their representatives have traditionally been among the foremost advocates of responsible fiscal and economic policies.  They know from bitter experience that loose macroeconomic policies will lead to high interest and inflation rates and will erode farm incomes.  Thus it was not surprising that farmers were very much in favour of the moves towards greater monetary stability within Europe with the eventual aim of achieving a single currency.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers have clearly benefited from the low level of inflation in recent years.  This has been an important factor in sustaining income.  For example, in 1992, when aggregate farm income increased by 18.5 per cent the fact that the price of inputs rose by less than 1 per cent made an important contribution to that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus it was not surprising that in the <Col N="765" /> wake of sterling leaving the ERM last September, farmers and their organisations were part of a wide national consensus which agreed that Ireland should retain the value of the pound within the ERM.  There was nothing surprising about such a consensus &mdash; it was also shared by other countries within Europe. Ireland had a low level of inflation, public finances which met the Maastricht convergence criteria and a very solid balance of payments surplus.  To have done other than remain within the ERM at that time would have been a precipitate reaction. It would also have been inconsistent with the policies which had been followed since the end of the seventies when we took the strategic decision to join the European Monetary System and increasingly align our economic destiny with Europe and, in so doing, reduce our dependence on the UK.</P>
    <P>While there was no objective reason why Ireland should have followed the UK out of the ERM last September, the fact that sterling devalued by such a large amount in such a short time obviously caused problems.  Sterling falling from 92p to 108/109p to the pound in the space of two weeks was bound to have a significant impact.  In the agricultural and food sector, the impact of the sterling devaluation was greater than for manufacturing industry as a whole.  This was so for two essential reasons.  Firstly, the agricultural and food sector is more dependent on the British market and is more exposed to competition from British produce on domestic and third country markets than is manufacturing industry in general.  Secondly, the agri-food sector is much more dependent on indigenous inputs than almost all of the rest of manufacturing industry.  This meant that while the industrial sector could gain, in certain cases substantially, from cheaper imported inputs from the UK, the gain to the agri-food sector was very limited.</P>
    <P>These quite fundamental factors were, of course, of particular concern. However, there was on the other hand, the fact that the operation of the EC's system of monetary compensatory <Col N="766" /> amounts shielded certain products from the effect of the devaluation of sterling.</P>
    <P>The products to which full MCAs applied were cattle and beef, dairy products, cereals and sugar.  MCAs applied to a more limited extent to pigmeat, poultrymeat and certain processed products.</P>
    <P>There were also, of course, a number of products which MCAs did not apply to, such as sheepmeat, fruit and vegetables and a number of high value added processed foods.  Many of these products were granted aid under the Market Development Fund, which the Government agreed to in October.  The fund aimed to assist businesses which were under pressure as a result of the devaluation of sterling.  Of the £50 million which was committed under the Market Development Fund, the food industry will have benefited to the tune of about £12 million by the end of March.</P>
    <P>These were the facts in so far as they related to the agri-food sector in October-November of last year. Although the sterling devaluation meant that a number of food companies were hurting, the various reasons which I have given confirm me in my view that maintaining the value of the pound in the ERM was the right policy during the latter months of 1992.</P>
    <P>To repeat, these reasons included: the long term commitment to and interest on the part of farmers in monetary stability; the operation of the MCA system; the existence of the Market Development Fund.  In the last part of 1992 and into January 1993, the effects of the currency crisis became more damaging for the agri-food sector.  The parts of the sector which were exposed to the full impact of the devaluation, and which had no protective cover from the MCA system, were clearly facing increased competitive difficulties. This was feeding back into weaker prices for farmers.</P>
    <P>There was a particular concern about those parts of the food industry which were producing value added products.  A number of these firms have grown substantially in recent years.  The growth of Waterford Co-op is a prime example. <Col N="767" /> They have large numbers of people employed.  They were doing precisely what everyone agrees should be at the heart of a policy towards developing the food industry &mdash; engaging in product development and expanding into consumer markets.  Yet it was these companies, not protected by MCAs and using a very high proportion of indigenous inputs, which were being put under severe pressure by the devaluation of sterling.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other important factors which, as the weeks and months went by, began to change the judgment as to where the balance of advantage lay in relation to the value of the currency.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the high interest rates were causing severe problems.  The 3 per cent increase in September 1992 meant that the increased annual interest bill for the agri-food sector would be £60 million. Total borrowings of the sector are of the order of £2 billion.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it has been an objective of the EC that MCAs would be abolished on 1 January 1993 in tandem with the introduction of the Single Market.  In fact, the rates of MCAs were substantially reduced from mid-November onwards.  The December Council of Agricultural Ministers confirmed the decision to abolish MCAs from 1 January, although some changes were secured in the Commission's proposal along the lines advocated by the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there were changes in intervention arrangements for beef from 1 January 1993.  There was a risk that these changes could have put downward pressure on beef prices.  I am glad to report that this has not, in fact, happened due to the scale of the intervention tenders which have so far been obtained in 1993. But, that being said, if such tenders were not to be as effective in maintaining prices in the future, then the fact that MCAs were abolished could lead to severe competitive pressures on the UK market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> These various factors which I have been speaking of are all central to the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;traded sector&rdquo;, which are the subject of the motion before the House.  From my point of view, as Minister responsible for one of the most exposed industries within the traded sector, it was crucial that our exchange rate policy should be consistent with the objective of maintaining and, indeed, expanding income and employment within the agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment to the Department, a matter which gives me confidence in the future in relation to one of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is that an export group sitting in the Department are drawing up a blueprint for the food industry. Their report and recommendations should be with us in the not too distant future.  There is still a great deal of potential for job creation in the food sector. Obviously, the niche markets can be exploited but quality, price and transport to markets is an important factor.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other part of my portfolio, the horticulture sector, which has had its problems in recent times, the success story has been the development of the mushroom industry.  This industry was affected by the devaluation of sterling. I believe that not alone will this industry regain its true market share but there is scope for expanding its market share, particularly in the UK.  I was glad to see that in my own constituency last Monday there were discussions in relation to a planning application for a worth while production unit.  The model set by the mushroom industry in terms of horticulture is one that should and will be followed by other sectors in terms of attacking those niche markets which are there to be exploited.  However, it will require real professionalism and quality goods to exploit them to the full.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the first portion of Deputy De Rossa's question to the Taoiseach, if the Taoiseach believes that the Supreme Court decision in relation to this matter is clear, what is the position in relation to the deposition in the national archives of Cabinet papers?  Is there any time limit in relation to Government papers and Cabinet papers going to that body and have the Taoiseach or the Government received any advice in relation to that?  Second, is it the case that, unlike other parliaments such as the one in Westminster, Ministers can no longer explain to this House, even in the context of a resignation, what happened at a Cabinet meeting which brought about such resignation?  Does the Taoiseach really believe the various judgments in the Supreme Court are clearly understood by the Government?

      <P>That is more a statement than a question.  If the Deputy wants to put down questions on specific aspects of it he is free to do so.  The majority of the Supreme Court clearly identified Government confidentiality as an intrinsic feature of our system of Government.  Anybody who has been around the Cabinet table will agree with that on the basis of practicality.  Forget about law for the moment.  If the views expressed by any Minister sitting at the Cabinet table were for open discussion afterwards I do not believe it would be practicable to carry on Government as we know it.  That is the reality and I am sure all Deputies privately concur with that arrangement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.  Consultation, solidarity and partnership <Col N="775" /> between all interests in our society is essential in a very small and open economy such as ours.  We have given particular prominence and emphasis to this in our Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The very striking economic and social achievements since 1987 owe much to the partnership arrangements developed with the social partners under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Central Review Committee will continue as the monitoring and review forum for the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum will strengthen and extend the partnership principle through the formation of consensus on major issues of economic and social policy.  A particular focus in the work of the forum will be the development of new initiatives to tackle unemployment.</P>
      <P>The forum will have wider representation than that of the CRC which is confined, on the social partners side, to social partners who are a party to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> For example, it will include representatives of women's organisations, groups representing the unemployed, the disadvantaged and people with a disability.  Members of the Oireachtas will also be represented through merging the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment with the forum.</P>

In the Programme for Government we have clear sets of initiatives that we will take over the term to tackle unemployment.  We also recognise that Ireland is going through the worst effects of world recession that the world has seen since the thirties.  Consequently, we have the economy well poised to take advantage of the upturn when it happens.  We are going to seek maximum consultation and consensus throughout society about the manner in which this is to be tackled.</P>

The NESC will continue to meet, as it always has done, in private while the forum will have open plenary <Col N="777" /> sessions from time to time.  The involvement of Oireachtas Members as well as the social partners will be a particular feature of the forum.  The NESC will continue to advise the Government on the principles of economic and social development and will provide a strategic and long term focus, whereas the forum will focus more on issues of immediate policy concern.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together, When the last round of talks ended on 10 November 1992, the participants issued an agreed statement in which the Irish and British Governments expressed the view that further political dialogue was both necessary and desirable while the four Northern Ireland parties agreed with this view and undertook to enter into informal consultations to seek a way foward.  At my meeting with the British Prime Minister in Dublin on 7 December 1992, we reaffirmed our commitment to work towards the resumption of the dialogue.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> makes clear this Government's determination to work for an early resumption of political dialogue with the aim that all of the relationships involved will be comprehensively addressed in a spirit of openness and innovation; that the Government are ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes.  On 12 January, I reaffirmed in this House the Government's deep commitment to the establishment of peace in Northern Ireland through the negotiation of a balanced settlement.  I repeat that commitment here today against the sombre background of the numerous further deplorable and heart-breaking incidents of loss of life, on both sides of the beleaguered community in Northern Ireland, we have unfortunately seen over the period since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs had an informal meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 22 January to review the prospects for a resumption of the talks.  The position was again reviewed at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference on 3 February.  These meetings <Col N="779" /> reiterated the determination of both Governments to promote a comprehensive political settlement which would address the three central relationships. The conference meeting confirmed the readiness of both Governments to demonstrate openness, flexibility and imagination in their efforts to promote such a settlement in consultation with the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and agreed that every effort should be made to create conditions under which further talks could take place at an early date.</P>
    <P>Therefore there can be no doubt regarding the Government's resolve to work earnestly to achieve the earliest possible resumption of the talks process. We do so in the firm belief that a lasting settlement is profoundly desired by the vast majority of people from both traditions on this island.  The realisation of this desire can stem only from a comprehensive and engaging dialogue.  It is for this reason that the Tánaiste has indicated his desire for early meetings with the Northern Ireland parties.  I very much hope that this will happen.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in relation to constitutional reform, with particular reference to Articles 2 and 3, is outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This makes clear the Government's willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.  It also states:</P>
    <P>Since the final outcome of such negotiations will need to be acceptable to the people North and South, we will seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package, which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues, and creates structures which will bridge divisions and promote reconciliation between the unionist and nationalist traditions and ensure enhanced co-operation between both parts of Ireland;</P>
    <P>Regarding the scope of the discussions <Col N="780" /> in the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement sets out the matters with which it would deal, political, security, legal and the promotion of cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>Within this ambit, the range of matters and issues dealt with has been extended at several stages, most notably following the review of the working of the conference published in May 1989.  The conference meeting on 3 February considered a joint paper on economic and social topics which might be discussed at future conferences, including business co-operation and tourism, enterprise and employment, science and technology and inland fisheries, to name but a few.  The follow-up will be covered in a report the secretariat was asked to prepare.  The Government will aim at the fullest possible extension of the work of the conference, within the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the most constructive move his Government could make to get formal talks restarted would be to make a clear statement that it would definitely be willing not just to discuss the matter but actually to recommend a change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as part of an overall settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made very clear the Government's willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and, let me emphasise the following words, &ldquo;to inititate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement that is balanced in regard to the differing positions of the two main traditions in Ireland on the constitutional issues involved.&rdquo; The Programme for a Partnership Government gives a commitment that such a settlement would be put to the people in a referendum.  I believe this is a forward looking and open position.  It is fully consistent with the agreed understanding that nothing will be finally agreed in any strand until everything is agreed in the talks as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In stating that all constitutional issues are up for discussion, is the Taoiseach referring only to the Constitution of this State or is he also talking about the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom?  Does the Taoiseach regard the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as part of that constitutional issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have at all times made it clear that it is open to every party to the talks to raise any issue that they wish to raise.  That includes constitutional issues both from the Irish constitutional position or the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  The principle of nothing is agreed until everything is agreed still holds.  The talks process recognises the requirements for a lasting settlement through its focus on seeking to balance the many elements within not alone the relationships between the communities in the North of Ireland and the relationships between the North of Ireland and the Republic, but the relationships between here and Great Britain.  If a durable settlement were to emanate from those talks, which I know everybody in this House aspires to, and if that settlement were to lead to lasting peace and stability on the island, there has to be a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions in Ireland on a constitutional basis.</P>

      <P>Order.  I now call Deputy Austin Deasy, whose Question No. 10 refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit confused.  Am I to take it that the Taoiseach considers that a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 is desirable?  If that is what is implicit in the Taoiseach's answer, it is contrary to his speech in Nenagh some weeks ago in which he ruled out any referendum on Articles 2 and 3.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Deasy is trying, as some of his colleagues did before, to quote part of what I said at a function in Nenagh.  The position is unchanged.  We realise that a lasting solution to the problems of this island must recognise both traditions.  We have continuously said that both constitutional positions would have to be taken into account in any settlement that was going to last and bring peace to this island.  We are all trying to pursue the objective of peace at this time.  I have said continuously, and repeated in a speech at Bodenstown in the latter quarter of last year and many times in the House, that we are open to try to find an accommodation that would bring lasting peace. I have no plans to hold a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 in advance of any settlement that may be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that it is absolutely necessary in order, to avoid confusion, that he make a clear and explicit statement on this issue to this House?  At one stage he said Articles 2 and 3 are not for sale.  Now he is being given the opportunity to state specifically that he will recommend changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as part of an overall settlement.  Could the Taoiseach clearly say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that?</P>

      <P>If these talks are resumed, as all of us hope they are, what form does the Taoiseach envisage they will take?  Will they be in largely the same form as they were before or will he suggest that they be in a different form and, if so, what?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit early to say what form they may take.  The Tánaiste has extended invitations to political leaders in the North of Ireland.  He has had some responses so far.  All of us in this House would be hopeful that those informal talks would get underway to try to find the best way to resume the talks. They do not necessarily have to follow the previous format.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Taoiseach going to maintain special responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs and Anglo-Irish affairs as his two predecessors, Mr. Haughey and Dr. FitzGerald did, or on this occasion will Anglo-Irish affairs and Northern Ireland affairs be the responsibility of the Tánaiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware from the previous administration which I led that Northern Ireland affairs <Col N="784" /> were the responsibility of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews.

We have already established a committee of the Cabinet involving the Minister for Justice, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself to deal with the affairs of Northern Ireland.</P>

May I have a straight answer to that? Secondly, may I remind the Taoiseach that it is almost 25 years ago since the start of the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland.  It is 21 years since the British took over direct responsibility in Northern Ireland.  Yet there are still serious abuses of civil rights within that jurisdiction.</P>

We will expand it in whatever way it is possible <Col N="786" /> to do so within its parameters.  In relation to constitutional matters, I have said time and again that all constitutional matters are on the table for discussion and can be raised by any party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, more than anybody else in this House, would agree that a balance must be restored between recognition of existing constitutional realities and acknowledgment of the value of a future that we believe would be best for all people of this island.  He recognises exactly what an equitable solution will mean at the end of the day. That is what we seek.  Restoring peace to this island is the first priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing we are all united about in this House is that we want peace on this island.  The difference arises as to how we achieve it. The Taoiseach indicated that he is anxious to create the conditions in which these talks may get under way.  In that spirit, and the declared spirit of generosity, would he identify the Articles of the Irish Constitution he feels could be changed at the end of the process of discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his failure to give unambiguous answers to questions today is a lost opportunity and that if he were willing to speak in plain language about his intentions in regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution he would undoubtedly get a response which would lead to much earlier recommencement of these talks <Col N="787" /> than would otherwise be the case?  Does the Taoiseach not realise, leaving all party considerations aside, that he has an opportunity that he should not cast aside simply because he cannot quite make up his mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>In my statement in the House on 12 January I stated that the Office of Tánaiste was being established to reflect the new partnership we have embarked on in Government and that it was to have a separate Vote and a Minister of State in charge of it.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have now appointed Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, as the Minister of State in charge of this office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role and functions of the office will encompass: briefing and advising the Tánaiste generally on all Government policy matters; representing the Government on the new National Economic and Social Forum and thereby ensuring direct liaison through the Tánaiste between the forum and the Government; joint responsibility, together with the Minister of State and Chief Whip attached to my Department, for the implementation of the provisions under the heading &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo; which are contained in our <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>; representing the Tánaiste on a committee of programme managers to monitor the implementation of the programme for Government; representing the Tánaiste on the Central Review Committee under <Col N="789" /> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and any successor to this committee under any further such programme; and representing the Tánaiste on the Inter-Department committee for the Co-ordination of EC Affairs; this committee will continue to be chaired by the Minister of State for European Affairs attached to my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
    <P>Staff are currently being recruited for the Office and budgetary provision will be made in a separate Vote for this Office for these staff costs and for other relevant costs and expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a constitutional statutory basis for the establishment of an Office of the Tánaiste and, if not, are either constitutional or statutory changes contemplated?  Which Minister will be accountable to this House for expenditure by the Office of the Tánaiste during the Estimates debate and who will be answerable to this House at Question Time for the activities of the Office of the Tánaiste both in terms of expenditure and the other aspects of its activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste will, pursuant to his constitutional status answer questions in the House on my behalf whenever I am unable to do so.  That is clearly laid down in the Constitution.  As Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, he will answer parliamentary questions relating to his responsibilities as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Tánaiste has been assigned responsibility for the National Economic and Social Forum and will answer parliamentary questions in respect of the forum.  Generally, the Tánaiste will give an account to the Dáil in connection with the Estimates of the Office of the Tánaiste and in relation to all matters covered by the activities of that Office.  He can be questioned in such a debate on such matters, which will cover a wide range of activities.</P>

For example, if a question directly relates to the responsibilities of the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, will the Tánaiste answer that question in his capacity as Tánaiste or will he do so in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs during foreign affairs questions or, alternatively, will it go to the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <P>I welcome the efforts to expand the role of the position of Tánaiste but I have concerns about how questions to the Tánaiste might be dealt with on matters which would not relate, for instance, to foreign affairs or Northern Ireland.  It seems that it would not be possible to have a question accepted on the forum, for instance, if it were addressed to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that?  May I raise again, perhaps out of the depths of my ignorance, the allocation of a Minister of State to the Office of the Tánaiste and ask to which Minister is the Minister of State responsible?  As I understand it, Ministers of State are responsible to Government Minister.</P>

      <P>Did I correctly hear the Taoiseach's original reply when I believe he said that the proposed Office of Tánaiste would be headed by a Minister of State who would be responsible for it? If I correctly heard him say that, does it not seem extraordinary that the Office of Tánaiste, if it is proposed to create it as a separate office, should be headed by anybody other than the Tánaiste himself? If he is in a position to answer questions, as suggested by the Taoiseach, in his right as Tánaiste rather than as Minister for Foreign Affairs, is it envisaged that the Ministers and Secretaries Act will be amended to allow this and, if so, when? Has any provision been made in the long rota of Ministers for such a Question Time?  I have not seen the Office of Tánaiste included in that even though the list goes up to April.</P>

First of all, will the Taoiseach introduce legislation to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act to provide for the Office of Tánaiste?

If the Taoiseach confirms that, would he agree that in legal and constitutional terms there is no such a thing as the Office of the Tánaiste?  In that context, there is no such thing as junior Minister appointed to a non-existent office.  In the circumstances, the unfortunate Deputy Fitzgerald is not a properly appointed Minister of State.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.  The Government has made an order delegating my powers and duties in relation to the Central Statistics Office to Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is also Government Chief Whip.  In addition, as I mentioned in the House on 12 January last, Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister of State at the office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, are jointly responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government <Col N="798" /> contained in the section &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 24, inclusive, together. Details of the transfer of broadcasting policy functions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht are contained in the Broadcasting (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1993, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 January last.</P>
      <P>The statutory ministerial functions relating to Radio Telefís Éireann and the Independent Radio and Television Commission laid down in the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979, the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and other broadcasting legislation have been transferred to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, except those functions relating to the assignment of broadcasting frequencies and the licensing of broadcasting transmitters and other apparatus for wireless telegraphy incidental to the purposes of broadcasting. These latter functions remain the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main responsibility for the Child Care Act, 1991, and for the implementation of proposals in this area contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government rests with the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.  Responsibility in relation to services for homeless children <Col N="804" /> under the legislation has been delegated to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea. The necessary delegation of functions order was made by the Government on 3 February last and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the following day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has been assigned responsibility for the formulation and development of future policy in relation to inland waterways, national parks and wildlife, national monuments and historic properties.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works shall continue to exercise their day-to-day functions in those areas in accordance with policy decisions by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, setting out his priority areas and proposed implementation targets.  To assist that Minister in exercising his policy functions the Commissioners shall report to him annually in relation to developments and their attainment of targets in these areas and shall furnish such information as the Minister may require from time to time for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The contract for the visitor centre for the Burren National Park was placed by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1992.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the Commissioners are responsible to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to introduce legislation in 1993 to bring Irish law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Ministers will have responsibility for introducing legislation in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will introduce legislation to reform our laws on homosexuality to give effect to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Norris case.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government, in the chapter dealing with social justice and a compassionate society, includes a commitment that legislation will be introduced in 1993 on foot of the Green Paper on Mental <Col N="805" /> Health, to reform the mental health services and update the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  This legislation will bring our mental treatment law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Minister for Health will introduce this legislation.  Other Ministers will also examine the Convention in order to establish what, if any, legislative changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, will be responsible for preparing legislative proposals to regulate the position arising from the Supreme Court decision in the X case and will submit these for the Government's consideration in due course.  The areas to be covered are very complex, and the Programme for a Partnership Government made it clear that the legislation would recognise the sensitivity of the issue throughout the community.  In view of the complexity of the issues involved, I do not propose to set a specific timescale for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The delineation between the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Jutice is set out in the Justice (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1993, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 4 February last.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Order, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will be responsible for the functions previously exercised by the Minister for Justice in relation to civil law reform, civil legal aid and the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will continue to be responsible for criminal law reform and legislation arising in areas of administrative responsibility of her Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 48, 69, 73, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Since asuming office, I have been engaged in a detailed review of the prospects for a resumption of political talks on the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity for a thorough discussion of this matter at an informal meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Dublin on 22 January and at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference which took place in London on 3 February.</P>
      <P>I have made clear to the Secretary of State the Government's determination to work for the earliest possible resumption of political dialogue.  I can confirm that this objective is fully shared by the British Government.  We wish to see progress towards a comprehensive political settlement which will address all the main relationships and which will bring lasting peace, stability and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the last round of talks concluded, the participants recorded their <Col N="810" /> view that further dialogue was desirable and necessary and they agreed to join in informal consultation with a view to finding a way forward.  I have signalled the readiness of the Government to enter consultations immediately with a view to achieving a basis for further talks.  I have made clear on a number of occasions my desire to sit down face to face with Unionist leaders to hear their concerns at first hand and to discuss the way forward. I very much hope that this invitation will be taken up, and will be making appropriate contacts to examine how this can best be achieved.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> sets out in some detail the objectives which the Government will seek to attain in a renewed process of dialogue.  We are committed to pursuing them in a spirit of openness and honesty, showing a willingness to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.  We are working towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland, based on the principle that both must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection.  We are committed to seeking any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues and which will bridge divisions and promote reconciliation between them.</P>
    <P>The talks process so far has made us all aware of the strong views of the Unionist parties on Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution and I accept these are among the issues that will have to be addressed and resolved in renewed talks. The talks also confirmed, however, that there are two conflicting views on Articles 2 and 3 as between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  The search for accommodation must take account of this dimension also.  We cannot hope to reach a solution by addressing the concerns of one side only.</P>
    <P>Constitutional issues cannot be dealt with as abstractions divorced from the <Col N="811" /> realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.  It is precisely because of the need to consider the practical and the political context, and to reconcile the positions of both communities in Northern Ireland that further dialogue and negotiations are necessary.  As the Programme for a Partnership Government made clear, we are ready to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement, but it is reasonable to expect that any changes would flow from such dialogue and negotiations rather than be made a precondition for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste clarify for the House, first who is responsible for the development of policy on Northern Ireland and, second arising from the confusion generated by an earlier reply from the Taoiseach, whether he is prepared to accept that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are a major problem for one of the communities in Northern Ireland and that, as part of an overall settlement not coupled with other issues, he would be prepared to recommend changes in Articles 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Government I have day-to-day responsibility for matters pertaining to foreign affairs and for matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  As has been announced, a sub-committee of the Cabinet has been formed, involving the Taoiseach, myself and the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice has particular responsibility in relation to security matters, which the Deputy will be aware of.  Obviously, Northern Ireland policy is a constantly evolving process.  In relation to Articles 2 and 3, in relation to a range of issues, the Deputy will be aware of the statements I have made &mdash; the press statement I made in London last week and the press conference I attended after the meeting of the inter-governmental conference.  I have said very clearly that Articles 2 and 3 are a source of difficulty to the Unionist community. I have also said, and made it very clear, that I want them to come and talk to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I think that no politician in this island can take upon himself to refuse to come to any discussions which might be helpful to the future of this island.  What is happening in Northern Ireland on a daily basis is far too serious to allow it to continue. In that respect I believe that at the earliest possible opportunity all politicians on this island must sit around the table to resolve the difficult issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, welcomed what he described as a new sense of realism on the part of the Irish Government in its approach to the Northern Ireland issue?  If he is so aware, would he agree that this new sense of realism must contrast with the previous policy?  Would the Minister put his finger on what it is that is different about his approach from that followed by the Minister of the outgoing Government prior to his appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I can inform the Deputy I have had two meetings with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The first was an informal meeting in Dublin to look at the agenda and the prospects for getting dialogue resumed.  The second was a formal meeting in London in relation to the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  It was outlined at the conclusion of that meeting that the Intergovernmental Conference will meet on a regular basis.  The Deputy will appreciate that I was not privy to the talks on the last occasion.  In fact, there is a possibility that the Deputy has more information about them than I have because his party leader and his colleague, Deputy Molloy, were involved in those talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it very clear, since taking responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs and responsibility in relation to Northern Ireland, that I will leave no stone unturned in my approach to Northern Ireland because I feel that Northern Ireland and the deaths and murders there are a shame on this island. It is the responsibility of all politicians in <Col N="813" /> this House and politicians in the North, and the British Government share our responsibility, to bring about dialogue and get politicians back working around the table.  I am going to pursue that and, in relation to remarks made by the Secretary of State at our first meeting, we both resolved to have a determination to apply all our energies to bringing about some progress and dialogue to tackle these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully the Minister for Foreign Affair's good intentions in relation to this matter.  It appears that Articles 2 and 3 will have to be changed if there is to be progress. Whether it is at the beginning or at the end of the process, it is inevitable that they will have to be changed.  Given the declared intention of the Minister and the Taoiseach that they want to create the conditions for these talks to get underway, would it not make sense for the Minister to take the opportunity, which the Taoiseach refused to take today, and state explicitly that Articles 2 and 3 will certainly be considered for change in the expectation that this will overcome the current difficulties and get these talks underway to see if we can make progress to bring to an end as soon as possible the appalling carnage that is taking place in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought to make it very clear that we are prepared to discuss all constitutional issues and to initiate and incorporate change in the context of an overall settlement.  I believe that is a clear commitment to meaningful negotiations with the Unionists, including their concerns in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  I do not think it is helpful that preconditions are put down by any party or potential party to the negotiations.  At this stage the responsibility should be on all politicians to get around the table and discuss the matters which are causing the problems on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister for Foreign Affairs' commitment to work as hard as he can towards achieving a solution in Northern Ireland and I wish him well in that task.  Does he not accept that his reluctance and that of the Taoiseach to be specific in relation to Articles 2 and 3, as opposed to the general commitment about review of the Constitution which might or might not include Articles 2 and 3, is now a barrier to the resumption of talks?  It would be helpful if he overcame this reluctance and stated here in this House that Articles 2 and 3 will be modified in the context of an overall solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spokespersons for Foreign Affairs and for Northern Ireland in the other parties, have a very important role to play in relation to the dialogue that may ensue. We have to deal with the realities on the ground, both in Northern Ireland and in the South.  Change in relation to the Constitution may well have to be part of the way we deal with the underlying reality of two strongly conflicting views about the status of Northern Ireland.  In that respect, it is not helpful to assume that there is a magic wand in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  That is not going to solve the problem.  I want to approach the difficulties and problems with all the cards on the table.  I have repeated on many occasions, and will continue to do so, that constitutional change may be necessary.  I want to discuss with my fellow politicians on this island their approach to those difficulties and with other politicians as well.  That is absolutely vital and essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the last set of talks, the Minister is aware there was a difference of opinion between the parties on whether there would be constitutional change or merely that there could be constitutional change.  I note that the Minister in his reply used the phrase &ldquo;there might well be&rdquo;.  Will <Col N="815" /> he indicate that if a settlement, which was acceptable to the people North and South, came into existence there would be a willingness on the part of the Government in the Republic to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From my understanding of the debate that took place during the last talks in relation to &ldquo;could&rdquo; and &ldquo;would&rdquo;, it was unhelpful.  It was cross-purpose and of no help to anybody involved.  I have outlined that there is a commitment by the Government to look at the constitutional change that is necessary. There is a responsibility on all politicians on this island to look at what is necessary because there will have to be changes on all sides.  That is my approach and I will pursue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that it is unhelpful for any side to lay down preconditions.  That approach is a mistake because there are inbuilt preconditions on every side in relation to these talks.  The continuation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a precondition of the Irish Government.  I do not think we should go down that road.  We should take the statements of the various people who have problems in Northern Ireland at face value.  It is not helpful to try to knock the argument in relation to Articles 2 and 3 by pretending that it is being offered as some kind of magic wand; it is not.  Even if an agreement were reached tomorrow it would still not be a solution.  It will take time for agreements to work their way through and for attitudes to change.  Could I ask the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If they were changed there would be a sigh of relief in the South as much as in the North.</P>

It is very obvious that there are politicians on this island, political parties and their supporters who have serious difficulties with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  I believe it is in everybody's interest that they come and discuss those difficulties. We will look then at what is necessary to resolve those difficulties.  I will not be found wanting in resolving those difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 67 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1991 the nine member states of the Western European Union issued an invitation to the other members of the European Union &mdash; that is Denmark, Greece and Ireland &mdash; to accede to the Western European Union or to become observers.  The background to this invitation has been set out in previous replies and the implications were described in the White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty published last year. Following discussions and negotiations with the Western European Union, Ireland became an observer at a meeting of the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Rome on 20 November 1992.  At the same meeting, Denmark became an observer and Greece became a full member of the Western European Union.  I have arranged for a copy of the Declaration on Western European Union Observers adopted at the Rome meeting to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>As an observer to the Western European Union, we will be able to attend meetings of the Western European Union Council at ministerial and official level, to attend meetings of Western European Union working groups and to speak at any of these meetings if we so wish.  I can assure the House that any contributions we make to Western European Union meetings will reflect the values and principles which have traditionally guided our international security policy, that is to say the priority of using peaceful means to settle disputes, the importance of political mechanisms for crisis management and conflict prevention, and the need for disarmament and non-proliferation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The decision to take up observer status at the Western European Union was prompted by the new relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Government decided that Ireland should become an observer to the Western European Union so that we might be fully informed on developments in Western European Union that might have a bearing on discussions within the European Union. Because our interest in observer status derives from the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union established in the Maastricht Treaty, we do not intend fully to exercise our rights as an observer until the Maastricht Treaty is ratified.</P>
    <P>Ireland attended two meetings of the Western European Union in 1992: one in July at which the Western European Union enlargement negotiations were formally opened; the second in November at which negotiations were concluded.</P>
    <P>Observer status in the Western European Union has no implications for our traditional policy as a country outside military alliances.  As an observer, we are not required to become a member of the Western European Union, to take up any obligations or defence commitments under the Treaty establishing the Western European Union or to subscribe to policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states clearly that Ireland will not be a member of the Western European Union and also that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged, unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the decision to attend the Western European Union as an observer, unlike some of the Minister's colleagues in his own party.  Having said that, now that we have taken that decision and are attending and will be offering our views &mdash; which is sensible as I am not in favour of an empty chair in any circumstances &mdash; does the Minister accept that spells the end of whatever <Col N="819" /> remains or our alleged policy of neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  It is very clear that the traditional policy of Irish neutrality is intact and, we made clear in the context of the Maastricht debate, it is a matter which will have to be put before the people if changes are to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no forum at present in existence with international criminal jurisdiction.  The International Court of Justice in The Hague does not have competence in criminal matters. The jurisdiction of the European Commission of Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is confined to findings of breaches by states parties to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Its competence does not extend to the trial of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of an international war crims tribunal is under consideration in the context of the present conflict in Yugoslavia where UN and European Community missions have reported on massive violations of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war.  Ireland supports the establishment of such a tribunal and the work that is currently under way on the matter in the UN, the CSCE and the European Community.  At the UN, the special Commission set up under Security Council Resolution 780 is examining and analysing information concerning breaches of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions.  The CSCE is drafting a statute for a war crimes tribunal with specific reference to the situation in the <Col N="820" /> former Yugoslavia.  The French Government are preparing proposals for the establishment of a war crimes tribunal which are expected to be made available shortly to the Twelve.</P>
    <P>The area is a complex one and any international criminal jurisdiction must meet the highest standards of legal protection. I hope that the work underway can lead to the early establishment of a tribunal to bring the perpetrators of these appalling crimes in the former Yugoslavia to justice.</P>

It should not be the case that expediency should dictate that these issues should be swept under the carpet.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the matter raised by Deputy McDowell.  It is a matter I raised with my European colleagues and is one which I intend pursuing. What the world has seen in relation to the war crimes that have been committed are totally unacceptable.  If we were to pursue a course of action where expediency would prevail I believe that the world would stand ashamed.  That will not be allowed to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch I had been dealing with the various factors which were central to the trade of the economy as the difficulties arising from the devaluation of sterling were having more effect on us. As Minister of State responsible for one of the most exposed of those industries, I believed that that sector was becoming more at risk.  By mid-January it was increasingly clear that the economic cost of maintaining the value of the pound was becoming very high.  These costs would be reflected in likely lower prices affecting farm incomes in the year ahead and in reduced employment in the food industry.  These considerations about the real economy allied to the risk of increased interest rates, which would have affected businesses and householders alike, helped to tip the scales towards the decision to devalue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that we got to the point of being obliged to devalue.  The case for European monetary stability and, eventually, a single currency remains very strong.  Having a single currency <Col N="1109" /> would be the natural complement of the completion of the EC Single Market.  The Single Market will bring benefits to Europe and to Ireland.  The increase in Structural Funds to about £8 billion over the next five to six years has to be seen as an integral part of the overall project. I accept that the plans to move towards a single currency as part of that project have clearly taken a set-back in recent months.</P>
    <P>We will now have to assess in a very clear way what were the problems associated with the ERM which meant that Ireland was obliged to devalue.  That debate about the future working of the European Monetary System and how Ireland can best achieve its economic objectives within that system needs to be a full and open one.  I look forward to participating in that debate in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like now to move on to assess what the impact of the devaluation of the pound on agriculture and food will be, now that the decision has been taken. The first and most obvious impact is that prices for agricultural produce should increase now the Green £ has been devalued by about 9 per cent, thus increasing support prices in Irish pounds by that percentage.</P>
    <P>It is important to explain to the House why the green £ was not devalued to the full extent of the devaluation agreed within the ERM.  As it is vital that the longer term development of the food industry is not inhibited, it is important to ensure that the new support prices do not unduly tilt the balance in favour of intervention as against sales to the market.  For this reason a small proportion of the percentage devaluation is being held in order to improve our competitive position in the market.  The position in this regard will be reviewed by the early summer.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that some of the direct benefits from the devaluation are already coming through.  Factory prices for beef have risen by 5-6p per lb and prices for hoggets have risen by up to 6p per lb.  There will also be an upward adjustment of the various premia which <Col N="1110" /> are paid to farmers, although in the case of cattle the 1993 premia have not been changed.  The Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, intends to press the EC Commission for some flexibility on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is clear that some increases in costs will arise as a result of the devaluation. However, the net effect of increased prices and costs will be substantially positive in terms of farm income.  It would not be unreasonable to expect that aggregate farm income in 1993 will increase by at least 5 per cent, thus building on the very positive outturn in 1992, when income grew by 18.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The devaluation should also have a positive effect on improving the competitiveness of our food products and on sustaining employment in the industry. This increased competitiveness should provide the platform for further development of the industry and for employment growth based on developing new markets and products.</P>
    <P>In summary, I acknowledge that the past five months have been very difficult for the agri-food industry.  The Government took the correct decision in the latter part of 1992 to hold the value of the pound.  For a variety of reasons, the costs of that option became unsustainable in early 1993 and the correct decision at that point was to devalue the pound.  This decision to devalue presents us with an opportunity for competitiveness which we must grasp in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like, first, to congratulate you on your election and to welcome you to the Chair.  In the year 351 BC, if we go back a long way, Demosthenes, in his first Philippic, took consolation at a further set-back in Athenian policy at the hands of Philip of Macedon in the following words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, then we should not be downhearted at the present situation however regrettable it seems.  The worst feature of it in the past is the best hope for the future.  What feature?  The fact that it is plain dereliction of duty <Col N="1111" /> which has brought us to this position. If it followed a period of exemplary action there would be no hope for improvement.</P>
    <P>That the quotation is apt because, as was the case 2,000 years ago in Athens, the only consolation we can hope for, after the recent ignominious and dismal collapse of Government policy, is that we can learn from the dereliction of duty and the lack of exemplary action so that we can never be so humiliated again.</P>
    <P>The gross dereliction of duty to which I referred has principally been by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, who throughout the period, in four different colours of Government, held the positions which they hold today.  First, I intend briefly to catalogue the relevant events since the currency crisis commenced in September, then I will give an inventory of the losses suffered by the country.  However, I will dedicate the major portion of my remarks to what I believe are the main policy considerations which must now be addressed to ensure that a débâcle like this never happens again.  I believe there are three such policy considerations.  First, there is the exchange rate policy itself.  Second, there is the failure to recognise that we did not have the support of the German authorities in the course of the crisis. Third, there is the lack of accountability of the agencies and persons involved to the Houses of the Oireachtas and in particular the lack of accountability by the Central Bank to anybody, it seems for its activities.</P>
    <P>I would like to go briefly through the sequence of events which is familiar to many people.  In September, following an intense period of instability in international currency markets, sterling, the lire, the peseta and the escudo devalued. Without any policy decision being made by the Irish authorities, the punt increased in value and on a trade weighted basis this revaluation settled at about 5 per cent.  There was nothing in the fundamentals of the Irish economy to justify this increase and over the succeeding <Col N="1112" /> five months the Government did nothing to justify the new value of the punt.  They could have cut the cost base to industry to restore competitiveness. They did not.  They decided to defend the punt by Central Bank intervention in the markets and by raising interest rates. Wholesale rates soared and retail rates, including mortgage rates, went up by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government of the time was totally preoccupied by the tensions between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Deputy O'Malley had already given evidence at the Beef Tribunal and the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was rehearsing his rebuttal of Deputy O'Malley's charges.  The participants in Government were so immersed in the internal powerplay that the vital interests of the country were neglected and no measures were taken which would permanently restore competitiveness and enable industry, particularly those sectors of it trading into the United Kingdom, to survive.  This was the only strategy which would have worked.  I consistently stated so since September and, in its absence, a devaluation was inevitable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's evidence at the Beef Tribunal blew the Government apart in early November and since then, I believe, Fianna Fáil's main concern was to avoid the political blame for a devaluation while at the same time being unwilling to risk unpopular action to defend the punt. This continued through the election campaign, after the election, when they operated as a caretaker Government, and during their negotiations with the Labour Party.  Fianna Fáil were not prepared to act until they could share the blame with a new partner in Government.  Consequently, right through the period from November until last week, policy was dictated by party political considerations rather than by considerations of the Government's duty and the national interest.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the election campaign some of the Baltic countries, led by Sweden, devalued and the punt came under pressure.  As sterling weakened in <Col N="1113" /> December and January, the punt came under pressure on a number of occasions and the Minister for Finance announced to a press conference that we could not stagger along indefinitely.  The punt again came under pressure.  During all this period the only instruments of defence were direct intervention by the Central Bank and higher interest rates.  The Government took no action at any time which would have indicated, both internationally and domestically, that it was prepared to take hard policy decisions to defend the punt.  It would not fight and it could not run, so nothing was done. When the final collapse came, it was inevitable.  It was as inevitable as it was humiliating, and the principal culprits were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, who held those offices right through the five months in question.</P>
    <P>I would like now to look briefly at the costs, which have been enormous.  The Central Bank has used up all the nation's external reserves.  It has used the swops arranged with the commercial banks, it has incurred significant liabilities to those central banks, who, under the terms of the ERM, came to the defence of the punt.  The total effect on the Central Bank's balance sheet cannot be less than £300 million and could be considerably more by the time the reserves have been fully replaced.</P>
    <P>The Treasury Management Agency has incurred very significant losses as a result of substituting D-mark borrowing for Irish pound borrowing.  The national debt has gone up by £800 million, according to the Minister's figure.  Interest rates are still at the higher level in Europe and at one of the highest levels since the foundation of this State, and these levels include the mortgage rates.  They have soared as the economy has plunged into recession, businessess have closed down and thousands of jobs have been lost without hope of recovery.  And all for what?  To protect the reputation of Fianna Fáil and in particular to ensure the continuance in office of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the implications for exchange rate policy.  I believe the <Col N="1114" /> Government now has an absolute obligation to clarify Irish exchange rate policy.  I do not think the Minister did so today in his speech which opened this debate.  Claims such as have been made by the Government that Ireland is still on course to participate with the Benelux countries, Denmark, France and Germany in some kind of exclusive hard currency club and that the devaluation of the punt is merely a slight temporary setback in our steady progress towards a single European currency are quite clearly untrue.  The fact that the Bundesbank was prepared to cut interest rates to protect the Danish krone within one week of failing to take action to protect the punt clearly illustrates that Germany does not see us as appropriate members of this hard currency club.  The fact that the central banks of other EMS countries only intervened to protect the punt strictly in accordance with their ERM obligations, while they went well beyond their obligations to protect the krone, indicates that other hard currency countries also regards us as ineligible for membership.</P>
    <P>We are now being pulled in two directions. Our exchange rate policy pulls us towards Germany, our export trade pulls us towards the United Kingdom, and as long as sterling floats outside the ERM this tension will continue.  Some commentators have advocated that we establish a link with sterling; others argue that we should move from the narrow to the wider ERM band; others again suggest that we should allow the punt to float.  I believe that to pursue any of these strategies would be extraordinarily difficult and would be no more than a shot in the dark, the outcome of which would be quite uncertain.  The best course of action probably is to stay within the narrow band, but to approach our policy with a willingness to demand, and insist on, frequent realignments within the ERM if domestic or international circumstances warrant such realignments.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we protect our national interest.  The only strategy that will succeed in maintaining growth in the economy and in putting people back to work <Col N="1115" /> is one which enables Ireland to produce more goods and services and sell them competitively.  Because our home market is so small, it is a prerequisite of this strategy to export competively.  Unless our exporters can trade into the United Kingdom on competitive terms, with relatively stable exchange rates, businesses will close down and thousands of jobs will be put at risk.</P>
    <P>We should remember that statistics frequently hide the true picture.  We have been told, right through the five months in question, that 30 per cent of our exports go to the United Kingdom &mdash; and this is true &mdash; but 65 per cent of the exports from indigenous Irish industry go into the UK.  That is the sector which is most at risk &mdash; two thirds of their product is dependent on sales in the UK market.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of jobs lost through the dereliction of duty by this Government.  It is, however, clear that if a devaluation had not taken place the country was possibly facing at least 30,000 redundancies in the export sector of the economy over the next 12 months or so.  Policy failures always give one an opportunity to reflect on the future course which policy should follow.</P>
    <P>I believe now is the appropriate time to question whether the present exchange rate value of the Irish pound is consistent with the level of unemployment of over 300,000.  If the main strategy for job creation is to produce more goods and services and sell these goods and services abroad, then it surely follows that an undervalued pound rather than an over-valued pound would be much more appropriate to our employment needs. There is an increasing view among economists, and especially among younger economists, that the main reason our unemployment levels are double the European average is that our currency is overvalued and has been overvalued for most of the decade.</P>
    <P>There is no absolute measure of the value of a currency.  The Government claims that the value of the Irish pound is consistent with the fundamentals of the <Col N="1116" /> Irish economy.  It is absolutely ridiculous to speak of the fundamentals of the Irish economy and ignore the fact that 23 per cent of our people who are looking for work cannot get a job.  I am well aware of the many benefits which a hard currency bestows.  I believe, however, that in the current crisis of policy, where the incoming Government have no idea how to respond to the unemployment catastrophe, this House has an obligation to examine all elements of policy, and there should be no sacred cows.  If the price of prosperity for some is conditional on the poverty of others, then policy should change.  If the exposed trade sector of the economy must wither to benefit the sheltered sector, such policy is only viable in the immediate short-term and will collapse in the medium-term, to the grief of both the exposed and the sheltered sectors.  If employment is a Government priority, as it stated this week, then the Government had better examine its exchange rate policy, because that which it has pursued, if continued, will cost rather than create jobs.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the question of accountability.  In the course of the preliminary discussions on the formation of Government, the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton and I, in common with other party leaders and Finance spokesmen, were briefed on the budgetary situation by officials in the Department of Finance.  In the course of this briefing the currency issue was briefly discussed.  I have no doubt that those highly respected, reputable officials were intellectually convinced that the course of action which they were following was in the national interest.  I presume that officials of the National Debt Management Agency and officials of the Central Bank were equally convinced.  I do not know if they remain convinced of the rightness of the course that we were pursuing through December and January; but it is clear that in computing the losses incurred as a consequence of devaluation, the loss of reputation of those involved at official level must also be taken into account.  I do not know whether the Department of Finance, the <Col N="1117" /> Central Bank and the NDMA succeeded in imposing their views on the Government, or whether they were simply carrying out political instructions.  We presume the latter is the case and that the Minister for Finance will accept responsibility on behalf of everybody.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, however, is independent in the exercise of its functions. The losses incurred by the strategy it pursued would be enormous by any standards and I believe that there should be some level of direct accountability by the Central Bank to the Oireachtas.  It is necessary, so that we avoid mistakes in the future, to establish what actually happened; and I believe that an appropriate committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be empowered to hear the views of the Governor of the Central Bank.  The Governor of the Bank of England reports through a committee of the House of Commons to the members of the House.  The head of the Federal Reserve in the United States is accountable to a committee of Congress.  I understand there is a reporting mechanism between the Bundesbank and the Bundestag. If the Taoiseach is seriously interested in letting in the light, perhaps he might start with letting some light into the activities of the Central Bank and make some committee of this House responsible for the accountability of the bank for what they do.  I do not believe that the Minister should be the fount of all wisdom and should be expected, whether he is to blame or not, to carry the responsibility for everybody who advised him on this occasion.</P>
    <P>A number of public statements have been made recently by former employees of the Central Bank which are very critical of the bank.  This is a matter of great concern, especially when charges have been made that appropriate economic advice has been ignored when policy has been formulated by the bank.  I believe the Minister for Finance and the new Government have an obligation to consider the accountability of the Central Bank to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I would strongly recommend that they would set an appropriate structure <Col N="1118" /> in place.  This is a very opportune time to consider this as the Government are in the course of setting up a series of committees of the House.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking features of this whole affair is the lack of input by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Ireland's exchange rate policy, though primarily a matter for the Department of Finance, cannot be pursued with effect without a Department of Foreign Affairs which is in tune with the mood and aware of the views of decision makers and opinion makers in other EMS countries, especially in Germany.  This is particularly so when one of the main weapons in the defence of the punt was supposed to be a diplomatic <i>démarche</i> to convince our EMS partners that our currency was appropriately valued and that they should come to its defence.  I believe that the apparent absence of a Foreign Affairs view &mdash; if there was such a view it was not taken into account &mdash; is profoundly disturbing.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording some of the facts. The &ldquo;war cabinet&rdquo;, which made the day-to-day decisions on the defence of the punt, consisted of the Minister for Finance, the secretary of the Department of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank and the chief executive of the NTMA.  In circumstances where diplomacy was conceived as one of the main weapons of defence, it was surprising that the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs was not a member of this group.  I had personal experience of the Department of Foreign Affairs during the negotiations which led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement and again when, as Minister for Justice, I attended the early conferences with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  I learned very quickly to appreciate the effectiveness of the Department and in particular their capacity to establish and report the views of a wide range of significant people both in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  I have no doubt that they had the capacity to do the same in respect of Germany and our principle EMS partners.  I wish to ask why they failed to do so and, if <Col N="1119" /> they actually carried out the diplomatic work, why the information provided was not taken into account by the Government.</P>
    <P>Public opinion in Germany has changed significantly since reunification. German views on a single currency and their views on obligations to weaker European countries such as Ireland, and indeed on Germany's role in the new Europe which is now emerging, have changed quite dramatically.  The Fine Gael Party through its relationships with the German Christian Democrats is in a position to know the views of German decision-makers better than other parties in this House, and we are fortunate in that respect.  Our party frequently sends delegations to Germany.  I was a member of one such delegation last October to the former GDR and frankly it was a most profoundly depressing experience.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in former East Germany is about 65 per cent.  This is disguised in the official statistics by early retirement schemes and training schemes.  But of a workforce of nine million approximately before the wall came down, there is now a workforce of slightly under three million.  Those are the facts. The industrial base of whole towns has been closed down as former State companies can no longer compete in the free market.  I was in one town on the German-Polish border where 12,000 industrial jobs in three industries had been lost and virtually nobody except a handful of public servants was at work.  The confidence of ordinary people has been severely dented.  Their morale is low.  They are suspicious of foreigners, afraid of inflation and resentful of grandiose EC schemes for which, they believe, the German taxpayer will have to pick up the bill.  In the former West Germany, Germans at all levels of society are deeply worried as they fear that the price of unity may be a long period of recession.  With so many problems at home they are not really receptive to begging bowl approaches by other member states such as Ireland.  They are becoming increasingly hostile to the idea of a single currency <Col N="1120" /> and they regard the Deutsche Mark as their principal badge of sovereignty, their ultimate symbol of unity, the basis of their wealth.  They certainly do not want it contaminated by weaker currencies. This mood in Germany was quite apparent to my colleagues and me last October.  I would be very surprised if it were not fully recorded in the diplomatic despatches from our embassy in Bonn to Iveagh House.  I would be equally surprised if our diplomats in Germany had not clearly indicated that the Germans were in no mood to do any more that was strictly required by their obligations under the ERM to defend the pound.</P>
    <P>There is a strong belief that the German authorities advised the Irish authorities in November that a negotiated realignment within the ERM was more appropriate than continuing to defend the punt and that this advice was rejected.  Whatever the truth of this, it became blindingly obvious in the week after develuation that the Germans believed that the Irish pound was over-valued, when they did for the Danes what they would not do for the Irish.  It was quite clear that the German authorities were not committed to the defence of the punt.  Why was this not communicated by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Finance in good time and, if it was, why was the advice ignored?</P>
    <P>One of the principle legacies of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, to public administration has been the diminution of the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Haughey was suspicious of Iveagh House, particularly with regard to Anglo-Irish relations and Northern Irish policy.  He suspected them of revisionism and he suspected them also of too close a relationship with his rival of the day, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  He reduced the role of Foreign Affairs by transferring much of the real decision making of the Department to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Its power has been further reduced by the dominance of the Department of Finance over all other Government Departments, especially since Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987.  I believe that the insignificant <Col N="1121" /> role played by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the defence of the currency was the principal reason the strategy was continued well beyond the point when it had lost credibility.  If we are to learn anything from this sorry mess it is the absolute necessity to restore the Department of Foreign Affairs to its rightful role in the formation and execution of any policy involving relationships with other states.</P>
    <P>Another lesson which we can learn from this entire tragic affair is that Government Departments operating entirely within rigid departmental boundaries, as if they lived in distinct universes, is an inadequate response to complex political and economic affairs.  The fact is that the financial and diplomatic businesses of Government are interwoven threads in the fabric of our national interest.  All Departments and agencies of State should be mobilised to serve the national interest and they should be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the decisions they make.</P>
    <P>I will leave the Taoiseach with a mystery. In the course of his reply he may deal with it.  How is it that the Belgians, where all the fundamentals of the economy seemed to be wrong, came under no pressure at any time in the course of the currency crisis?  What magic formula did they use to defend the Belgian franc which was different from the strategies taken by everybody else whose economic fundamentals seemed far stronger?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>Comhgáirdeachas leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, agus go n-éirí an mbóthar leat.</P>
      <P>The first thing I must tell Deputy Noonan is that the Belgians put up their interest rates today.</P>
      <P>The course of conduct the Government adopted during the currency crisis since last September has been a sensible and honourable one, taking account of both our long and short term interests.  Our eventual decision to realign was right in the circumstances and was widely welcomed. It creates positive opportunities, provided we can minimise the disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> I have always accepted that there are advantages and disadvantages to devaluation, depending where you are coming from.  The chief opportunity is presented to our exporters for diversification towards our continental main European trading partners, to reduce what is still a very unhealthy dependence on the British market.  In fact, when you take out agricultural produce, we are down to approximately 15 per cent exports to the British market.  Thirty-five per cent of our exports in the first 11 months of 1992 went to the other six counties still in the ERM narrow band &mdash; Benelux, Denmark, France and Germany &mdash; a higher proportion of our trade than went to the United Kingdom.  A 10 per cent devaluation will create a big opportunity for our exporters in these markets.  In the meantime, we will have recovered competitiveness for our United Kingdom exporters.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes which rose by 18.5 per cent in 1992, will get a further significant boost of about £150 million in 1993 alone with the recent green £ devaluation. Hard-pressed mortgage holders were spared an immediate further increase in home loans.  With regard to inflation, we are back to the situation prior to last September.  Inflation should stay around the 3 per cent mark or slightly lower.</P>
    <P>There are two principal disadvantages. The downward trend in the debt/GNP ratio will be interrupted this year, as the realignment will mean an increase of the order of £800 million in the national debt. But this should be largely offset by an equivalent increase in Structural and Cohesion Funding from 1994 to the year 2000.  The budgetary impact will be slightly negative.  We must show our determination to maintain economic discipline. Siren voices that would now have us ignore the Maastricht criteria will be ignored.</P>
    <P>The other negative aspect is that inevitably foreign investors will seek, in the short term at least, a higher interest rate premium on the Irish pound.  Unfortunately, there is still much uncertainty around.  We will have to work hard to rebuild confidence. <Col N="1123" /> The management of the currency is an important instrument of economic policy.  Its value is vital to both jobs and living standards.  But the currency is not the flag, and we should resist the temptation to treat it as such.  My background has taught me to have a pragmatic view of the currency.  My view since last September was that as long as there was a reasonable prospect of a return to stability in the short term, we would be right to hold out for the sake of the long term gains.  If not, we would have to review the position.  That view was broadly supported in the political and commercial world.  To have put up no fight at all would have displayed a lack of seriousness and commitment on our part of the system and would have cost us dearly in the long term.  It was incumbent on us, for our own sake and in solidarity with our European partners, to take every reasonable step to sustain our position. However, it should be remembered that qualified and nuanced statements made in other policy areas have to be avoided on the currency issue because of the sensitivity of the subject itself and the way that markets overreact.</P>
    <P>When it became clear at the end of January that the costs and risks were escalating out of proportion, we had to seek a realignment.  Ireland enjoys large numbers of hindsight decision makers. But the nature of markets is that the future course of a floating currency cannot be accurately predicted.  While a country's economic fundamentals do influence how its currency is regarded, they do not wholly determine it.  Speculation is capable of unsettling the most firmly-based currencies, as we have seen in recent months.</P>
    <P>For nearly six years, from early 1987 till last autumn, we enjoyed the benefits of currency stability within the exchange rate mechanism.  The value of our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Deutsche Mark remained the same.  This stability was the backdrop to a period of remarkable economic progress.  Inflation remained in low single figures.  Our economy gained rapidly in competitiveness, particularly <Col N="1124" /><i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  We had a growing balance of payments surplus.  The interest rate gap with Germany, which had been 9 per cent was reduced to less than 1 per cent.  We generated high economic growth averaging close to 5 per cent leading to 45,000 net new jobs.  Potential instability was removed when Britain joined the ERM in 1990.  Our experience, in short, was overwhelmingly positive.</P>
    <P>There was also a strategic European dimension.  Since 1990 the Community has embarked on the road to Economic and Monetary Union, on the basis now of the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland wishes to be part of that union and voted strongly for it.  Most studies accept that it is strongly in our interests to participate. There is little future in being a peripheral economy, largely dependent on Britain, especialy if it remains outside the single currency.  The structural problems of the British economy were the principal reason we decided to join the EMS in 1979.  Those problems remain.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress towards convergence.  According to the EC's latest annual economic report, our GDP <i>per capita</i> has risen from 60 per cent of the EC's averge in 1986 to over 70 per cent to date.  While our income per head was roughly half Britain's in 1973, today it is about three-quarters.  Participation in Economic and Monetary Union has clear benefits for Ireland.  The increased Structural and Cohesion Funds agreed at Edinburgh, worth about £8 billion in non-repayable grants &mdash; now significantly more &mdash; were to enable countries to converge and to participate in European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>These were powerful reasons to hold our nerve in the initial stages of the currency crisis.  The relevant economic data were good.  There were good reasons for believing that the situation, including the rise in interest rates, might last a few months only.  The British at that time spoke of rejoining the ERM as soon as practicable.  Large numbers of exporters secured their profits by financial cover up to November and December.  We brought in a Market Development Fund to help the exporters worst affected. <Col N="1125" /> Farmers were protected by MCAs to the end of the year.  The lending institutions softened the impact of increased interest rates on mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>Last September there was a broad consensus that we should try to ride out the storm.  This stance was supported by nearly all political parties, by the social partners and in the media.  The <i>Irish Press</i> said on 18 and 19 September: &ldquo;We must be in there with the best&rdquo; and that &ldquo;This State has benefited greatly from EMS membership, that membership is worth defending&rdquo;.  George Lee of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> argued that we should seek a fixed link with the Deutsche Mark.  Paul Tansey in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 20 September said: &ldquo;In fundamental financial terms, the Irish economy is robustly healthy . . . .  It is impossible to argue that the Irish pound is overhauled&rdquo;. <i>The Irish Times</i>, which opposed devaluation to the very end, stated on 29 September: &ldquo;The Government and the Central Bank deserve every support in their efforts to defend the pound&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I stated at that time my opposition to a two-tier approach or a two-speed Europe and my hope that interest rates would return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> on 20 October said: &ldquo;The Taoiseach has to be strong on this issue . . .   The hope is that the present muddle in the markets will be sorted out in a couple of months&rdquo;. Three days later they said devaluation was not an option.  They went on to say: &ldquo;Our future lies with the rest of the world&rdquo;.  But, as time went on, there was a perceptible shift.</P>
    <P>During the course of last autumn we saw Britain and Italy leave the system, and there is now little prospect of an early return.  We saw Spain forced to devalue twice with little relief in interest rates.  If we had devalued last autumn it is more than likely that we would have had to do so again, at least once if not more.</P>
    <P>The weaknesses in the system and the need to do something about them were constantly raised by me at the Birmingham and Edinburgh European Councils and in bilateral meetings that I had with Prime Minister Gonzales last <Col N="1126" /> October in Spain, with Chancellor Kohl in November &mdash; during the election campaign &mdash; and Prime Minister Major in December and also through normal diplomatic channels.  I also wrote to Chancellor Kohl last month updating him on the position.  The Minister for Finance attended all ECOFIN meetings during the election campaign and was succesful in obtaining valuable statements of support for our position.  These were useful in helping to fend off speculative pressures and caused speculators to lose out on a number of occasions.  We were in constant touch with President Delors and Ireland's EC Commissioner.  There was no sparing of diplomatic effort.</P>
    <P>Until the last week of January there was some prospect that sterling might settle down at a level just above parity. An expected fall in German interest rates would also have had a helpful effect.  In those circumstances interest rates in the course of 1993 could gradually have begun to fall.  We were ready to implement further measures to ease the combined pressure of high interest rates and a high exchange rate, such as guaranteed low interest European loans for industry, farmers and mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>However, on 26 January the British authorities, having earlier decided to change policy, lowered interest rates by 1 per cent, with strong indications of further substantial interest rate cuts to come.  Our currency rose rapidly to 110p against sterling.  There was a prospect that this would now be a floor rather than a ceiling.  The markets, believing that this would place great strains on the Irish economy, speculated heavily on a devaluation. Continued defence of the currency without strong multilateral support, which was not forthcoming, would have required a further substantial rise in interest rates.  At that stage we decided in favour of the protection of jobs and mortgage holders by seeking realignment.</P>
    <P>The currency instability has had a dampening effect on economic activity and investment confidence.  Damage to employment was kept to a minimum.  Our exporters, to their credit, were determined <Col N="1127" /> to hold on to their markets.  While we had a gain in competitiveness of some 17 per cent <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British market in recent years, some of this margin had been used up by firms to increase their market share.  Our indigenous industries are a vital source of employment.  It would not have been right to have left them vulnerable.</P>
    <P>What were the factors that made us opt for realignment in the end?  In addition to the change of policy in the UK and the Bundesbank's continuous refusal to lower interest rates, speculation played a very significant role.  There are some in this country who are inclined to doubt the existence of speculators and who argue how does one distinguish them from prudent forward traders and those who are looking after other people's money.  The President of the Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger, is in no doubt about the existence of speculators. Last Thursday he said at a press conference that he could find no one who could give him good explanations of such dramatic attacks on European currencies, where the fundamentals were sound, such as the Irish pound, the Danish krone and the Belgian and the French francs, and he added &ldquo;We hope that this somewhat unfriendly game of dominoes, whereby speculation picks off one currency after another, is at an end&rdquo;. Speculators believed that if the Irish pound fell, the Danish krone and the French franc would be next.</P>
    <P>Some financial comment from across the water certainly did us no favours in recent weeks.  The British authorities no longer seem concerned about sterling's future compatibility with the ERM, which some might prefer was no longer there.  This creates difficulties for Europe and difficulties for us.</P>
    <P>Attacks against EMS currencies were also fuelled by opposition to European Monetary Union by speculators, who, with the prospect of a single currency, saw very profitable business in currency exchanges being abolished.  In the light of this experience I have already acknowledged that there is a strong case in terms <Col N="1128" /> of economic stability in Europe for accelerating the timetable for a single currency, which at one stoke would remove the present multiple exchange rate activity.  But all our partners would need to be persuaded of this.  The present long lead-in time unfortunately provides too much opportunity to try to derail the project.</P>
    <P>The principal domestic factor was our very high level of unemployment, which, after Spain, is the second highest in the Community.  Currency policy has to take account of the need to protect existing employment when there are 300,000 people out of work.  It is far easier to lose existing jobs than to create new ones.  A further large rise in interest rates would also have caused a slump in consumer spending with a resultant negative impact on jobs.</P>
    <P>While we did receive valuable support from our European partners, there is insufficient solidarity in the system.  In the early stages speculation about an early move to a two tier European Monetary Union which might exclude us was distinctly unhelpful.  We killed that off for the moment at Birmingham.  The interest rate policy of the Bundesbank, which I stress is independent of the German Government, is based on domestic criteria and does not normally take into account the need for stability within the ERM.  But perhaps the concept of an anchor currency is flawed if it is unable to prevent much of the convoy floating off.  I believe that our decision to realign the Irish pound brought home the realisation that the whole system could be in danger of collapse and that this was partly responsible for the half point cut in German interest rates, along with the conclusion of a public service pay agreement in Germany the same evening.  A floating Danish currency could have led to a flood of German business going across the border and cheaper Danish products on the German market.</P>
    <P>Countries in similar positions were not prepared to realign together, which certainly contributed to the domino effect. In that regard I would like to point out that Ireland in the narrow band was not in <Col N="1129" /> a similar position to Spain and Portugal, which operated within the broad band and which had twice to three times our inflation rates.  It is no great secret that in the late autumn we would have participated in a more general realignment if certain other narrow band countries also under pressure had been willing to join in.  But it is absolutely untrue to suggest that we were either asked or advised by the Germans to devalue last October.</P>
    <P>The erosion of the domestic consensus in recent weeks also made the defence of the currency more difficult.  Some of the more vocal commentators simply switched camp and were determined to be proved right.  The opportunity was used to reopen ideological arguments about the value of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The scale of potential short term job losses was vastly exaggerated.  Organisations that habitually preach tough medicine to others are often the first to seek the soft option for themselves.  But I would like to thank those who supported the national interest throughout, in business, the banks, the trade unions and the members of some stockbroking firms, who were constantly on the airwaves with helpful explanations of the situation.</P>
    <P>Our former partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, shared our decisions up till early November, but recently seemed to need to ride both horses.  But, in view of the barrage of criticism that has come from Fine Gael, I would like to remind them of their devaluations and realignments against the Deutsche Mark, which amounted to over 20 per cent between 1983 and 1987.</P>
    <P>The first devaluation was described by the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Dukes, as &ldquo;a technical adjustment&rdquo; designed &ldquo;to secure a correction of the unwarranted appreciation of the exchange rate against sterling&rdquo;.  It took place as the Irish pound approached 90p against the pound sterling.  In 1986, Deputy Bruton refused to take part in a general realignment in April and ended up unilaterally devaluing by 8 per cent four months later in August.  That was followed by a 4 per cent rise in interest <Col N="1130" /> rates in October and a full scale crisis of confidence.  In view of that accord, I am little disposed to pay much attention to claims by Deputy Bruton and Fine Gael that they would have managed the currency crisis better.  They certainly did not the last time and there is no reason to believe that these same Deputies would have done any better this time.  In the last few years Fine Gael claimed to be the most European party.  On this issue it has shown itself to be the least European party.  Since October the Fine Gael Party has tried to undermine the defence of our currency.  Deputy Yates admitted recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Fine Gael had favoured devaluation all along, and indeed that showed through.  Market doubts about the underlying Fine Gael attitude and the strong possibility that Fine Gael might be the largest party in the next Government certainly did nothing to improve sentiment towards the currency during and after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism that the Government was not doing enough to underpin the currency rarely turned into specific suggestions. One implication was that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> should have been repudiated. How industrial relations chaos would have assisted the defence of the currency is not explained.  There was a proposal that the social insurance system should be dismantled in order to subsidise employers by abolishing or halving employers' PRSI, which is already virtually the lowest in Europe.  There was never any explanation as to how this would be paid for and why all companies, including those which were unaffected by the crisis, should get the full benefits too. Finally, the Fine Gael leader's call to devalue on 25 January, when the situation was reasonably under control, was typically badly timed.  I notice that one of this own front bench colleagues is quoted in a newspaper describing that <Col N="1131" /> action as &ldquo;national sabotage&rdquo;.  Certainly, I do not think the Fine Gael Party, with its spineless attitude to the currency, comes out of this with any credit.</P>

      <P>I am quite happy to stand over the actions we have taken since last September which we believed to be in the best interests of the Irish people.  The decision to realign was taken almost at the beginning of the life of the new Government, the time such decisions should be taken if they have to be.</P>
      <P>In regard to the empty calls from some Opposition speakers that devaluation should have taken place in December, are they seriously suggesting that foreign Governments or international financial markets would take any heed of a party in the middle of negotiations with other parties hoping to form a Government? They would be more concerned with what the policy of the incoming Government would be.  The decision was taken within two weeks of being in Government &mdash; the right time and the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in difficult and uncertain economic times.  Our responsibility is to find ways to combine our response to pressing short term needs and situations while maintaining course in line with our long term interests and objectives.  Efforts to create employment will be assisted by balanced comment and analysis.  There is always a real danger of talking down the Irish economy, which so many people seem to enjoy these times.  Of course, what flows from that is damage to investment and damage to consumer confidence. It in no way contributes to attacking the employment situation.  It is incredible that, while outside observers continuously praise our performance through the worst recession throughout the world since the 1930s, in Ireland we seem to enjoy inflicting problems on ourselves by talking ourselves down.  Yet others, as I say, see our performance in <Col N="1132" /> a totally different light.  We do not do any service to this country or to confidence building here by a continuance of that type of defeatism.  What we need is confidence and building for the future.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach deserves a special guest spot on <i>The Paul Daniel's Show</i> for the agility and magic he has shown by walking away from everything he has been saying for the last five or six months.  We got lectures on the fundamentals, on this temporary crisis, that interest rates would abate &mdash; every prediction the Taoiseach made was wrong.  Today in the Dáil he has had to swallow all that rhetoric because it is now seen to be reminiscent of the king with no clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the agricultural sector specifically and some general points in relation to the way this matter has been handled so poorly by the Government.  First, I want to put on the record of this House that it has been alleged to me that in the second week of January there was a major rift between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and the Government.  I am advised that the Central Bank told the Government and the Department of Finance in no uncertain terms that they had been advised by the Bundesbank and other central banks in Europe that they would not be able to continue to support the overvalued Irish currency unless there were policy changes, unless tough decisions were taken in relation to pay restraint and other measures taken that would reduce costs in the economy to give credibility to a hard currency stance. <Col N="1133" /> I have been told that the Department of Finance and the Government flatly rejected the Central Bank's advice and in doing so sent a clear signal to those European central banks that there was no point in supporting the Government against the speculators or in supporting the Irish punt because the policy was no longer credible.  The Minister for Finance must now clarify whether the Central Bank received this advice they gave from the Bundesbank and why the Government did not take decisive action if they wished to retain their hard currency stance.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have tried to divert blame exclusively to European and German authorities to cover up for their own failure in policy measures to support the currency and to give it credibility.  The real question that must be asked in this debate is where does the credibility of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach stand now.  It is totally eroded.  They have failed in their handling of this crisis.  The question must now be asked: why did the Government not devalue after the general election and what is the cost of having failed to devalue then, the cost in terms of additional foreign borrowings?  We got lectures of how certain the Government were about the value of the punt.  We were told that they put more Exchequer and semi-State borrowings into the Deutsche Mark so sure were they that they were not going to devalue.  That bill must now be paid, and what is it?  Every prediction made by the Government has proved false.  Our difficulties were not temporary.  The rise in interest rates worsened instead of abated.  Only last month publicans, small businesses and farmers all got bills from the ICC showing their monthly interest rate at 42 per cent.  Historic new heights have been reached in unemployment.  Business has incurred massive losses, particularly on export contracts and fixed price agreements. Throughout, even when this debacle was at its height, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did not give leadership, because they were not to be found.  The only leadership the Tánaiste had to give amounted to <Col N="1134" /> media briefings of how he got up so early in the morning that the offices of his Department were not open.  He could find time to review a Bob Dylan record, but when he was needed to give clear leadership to the country he was absent.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank supported the Irish punt by selling external reserves and buying Irish punts to the extent of £4.5 billion.  As the speculators made, the Central Bank lost.  If you work out the devaluation at 8.5 per cent, in market terms £4.5 billion, you find that, unlike the speculators, there is a minimum loss to the Central Bank of something of the order of £380 million in replenishing those reserves.  The political fact remains that not only our currency but this Government has been devalued.  Their vain attempt to sustain an overvalued currency collapsed ignominiously.  There must be political accountability.  There has been none to date, not even a confession from the Government that their policy failed.  They could not sustain their policy, because when the inter-bank rate was over 40 per cent and when jobs were being lost at over 9,000 a month, enough was enough.  They had to come out because the bleeding was too heavy.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about agriculture because it suffered more than any other sector in the process of trying to sustain an overvalued punt.  The ultimate devaluation ultimately benefited the agricultural sector more than any other through the green £ devaluation. The effect on farm incomes from September to the period of the devaluation was very harsh.  Agricultural borrowings by farmers alone stand at £1,650 million. If you take the corporate food sector as well it stands at over £2 billion.  High interest rates cost the sector over £50 million in a six month period.  As 30 per cent of our food exports are to the UK, there was a crippling effect on these sales of horticultural products, most notably mushrooms, sheepmeat pigmeat and dairy products.  The phased abolition of MCAs in December and January left a cruel exposure which resulted in a sharp price reduction and an income drop.  For <Col N="1135" /> the first time in memory many lambs brought to the mart before Christmas could not be sold and had to be brought home because no bid was raised on them. Pigmeat and sheepmeat prices were reduced to their lowest level in 13 years. All of this for no gain whatsoever and for a policy which had subsequently to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to listen to the agricultural sector was irresponsible. Agriculture and food is our single largest industry.  It accounts for £3.5 billion of total exports and 40 per cent of net exports.  There are aspects of the green £ devaluation that remain to be dealt with and I call on the Minister to come into this House to clarify them. Firstly, in relation to the male beef premium, the circular cow premium and the spring/winter beef slaughter premium, it seems that the increased rates of payment will only be paid in 1994 and not 1993 resulting in a loss of about £16 million this year to Irsh farmers.  It is imperative that the effect of the green £ devaluation applies to all such direct income aids this year.  The 8.93 per cent green £ devaluation falls somewhat short of the full punt devaluation of 10 per cent.  While I accept the need to retain market prices at a premium over intervention prices, it must be remembered that farmers will have increased input costs due to higher prices for fertilisers and oil because of devaluation. The high cost of interest rates remains a severe cost penalty on Irish agriculture.  The dry stock sectors of livestock, sheep and pigmeat should have access to foreign loans, as was intended, at 8½ per cent in Deutsche Marks or Swiss francs.</P>
    <P>During the crisis, when the Market Development Fund was put in place, the first condition was that you had to be a 10 per cent corporation tax trading company. That excluded the entire agricultural sector.  They got no benefits.  It is estimated that of the £50 million only £5 million or £6 million went to the food industry itself.  It is now time that the Government honoured its commitments to the agricultural sector.  In the forthcoming <Col N="1136" /> budget the Government must deliver on the early farm retirement scheme, the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the increase in the threshold for inheritance tax.  It is quite obvious, in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations, that the Government has filed to ensure the survival of family farms.</P>
    <P>We have seen here a debacle of historic proportions.  There are different people to blame.  We had a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, Fianna Fáil alone, a caretaker Government and now Fianna Fáil and Labour. But the consistent handlers through all of this were the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  They were the steady hand on the tiller that pulled in different directions from the start to the finish. They must now say who is going to pay the extra £85 million a year because of the additional foreign borrowing, who is going to pay for the Central Bank bill of £380 million for replenishing our reserves and who is going to pay in political terms for the jobs that were lost?  The highest notifiable monthly redundancy increase in the history of this State took place during the middle of this crisis.  The real question that must be asked and answered by the Minister for Finance is: who is going to pay the price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to share this slot with my colleague, Deputy Yates. The devaluation of our currency after the five months of crisis was a major defeat for this Government and indeed, the last two Governments, including the caretaker as a Government in that scenario. Not only was it a major defeat at home, it was a question of international humiliation for our country due to the inept handling of the crisis.  The Government failed to put in place domestic policies that could have convinced the international markets that we were serious in our defence of the punt.  It also failed diplomatically to convince our European colleagues to come to our aid and hence we faced devaluation, which, unfortunately, had appeared inevitable for <Col N="1137" /> some time as the defence of the punt was plainly inadequate.  Above all, the situation called for a major initiative to improve our competitiveness, to cut payroll costs particularly to the vulnerable traded sector.  Instead, the Government depended on a two-pronged policy of high interest rates and our national reserves, a policy that was doomed to failure.  We now have the spectacle of our Minister for Finance looking for scapegoats, and not being too fussy where he lands the blame either &mdash; the Bundesbank, Delors, the European Community, Franco-German sweetheart deals, the United Kingdom and even the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael uneqivocably supported the Government in the early weeks of the crisis and we fully accepted the merit of defending the punt.  But, as it became clearer that the Government were more interested in talking about the defence of the punt rather than defending it, hard decisions had to be taken.  But because they did not take the hard decisions to put in place a plan to achieve that defence, I am afraid the writing was on the wall and the futility of the Minister Finance's utterances were transparent to all.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael cannot be criticised for calling for devaluation when we did, but perhaps we could have called for it earlier. Effectively, we have been squeezed in this country by two sets of problems, neither of our own making.  On the one hand, we have the high cost of German reunification and, on the other, the economic difficulties that beset our main trading partner, the UK.  Questions can be asked about the rapid response to the aid of the krone compared to our European colleague's, and particularly the Bundesbank's, defence of our currency.  We might not have had to devalue if the Bundesbank had been in a position to cut its interest rates when the punt came under pressure.  Then the krone would not have been next in line and we would have been spared what has been referred to as the domino effect on the currencies within the ERM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposition of the Bundesbank towards the French franc has been <Col N="1138" /> obvious for some time and historically is easy to understand.  There are, however, serious questions still to be answered by the different response of the Bundesbank, not least in relation to the state of political solidarity in the European Community or political union.  Are some states, as has been asked, more equal than others and is this ultimately acceptable? Surely monetary union and a single currency presupposes at the very least political solidarity and equal treatment of all members in that union?  In practice we now know that it does not.  These conclusions must point up what has been called by commentators the blackest period in Irish foreign policy, apart altogether from the ineptness of the Minister for Finance's handling of our exchange rate policy.</P>
    <P>We could also ask in relation to the Bundesbank whether it has another agenda not immediately obvious to all of us.  Why should we assume that it is in the Bundesbank's interest to see a comfortable and relatively smooth ride towards European Monetary Union, towards the establishment of a single currency? Why should it be in the Bundesbank's interests for it no longer to be controlling the anchor currency in the ERM but effectively to hand over control to a European Central Bank that must predate the arrival of the ECU as the single currency?  We need explanations from the Bundesbank, from the Bundestag. We understand their internal domestic problems and have no right to tell them how they should behave in relation to the problems brought on by German reunification.  But I do think we have a right to an explanation if indeed there is a hidden agenda and if it is, as painfully obvious, not in the Bundesbank's interest to arrive at a European Central Bank before a European single currency has been reached.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that Irish foreign policy came under the microscope as much as our domestic economic policy during the debacle of the last five months. What has been the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs during that period? Why was there no diplomatic offensive <Col N="1139" /> to ensure solidarity among all the Community states when one member was under attack and under pressure?  I do not accept the Taoiseach's protestations that indeed there was a diplomatic offensive and I do not accept Minister Bertie Ahern's protestations this morning on this issue either.</P>
    <P>The crisis, and its tragic consequences for the jobless, for mortgage holders and for our business and industrial and traded sectors generally, is as much an issue of foreign policy as it is a matter of financial mismanagement.  Why has the Department of Foreign Affairs not had a role to play in the defence of our punt?  Deputy David Andrews. when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, showed he was competent at handling the issues of the day in Somalia and in the Bosnian crisis, to mention but two.  His handling of those issues would indicate that he would have been equally competent, if allowed to conduct the necessary diplomatic offensive on this issue.  He could have performed admirably and quite likely he would have been in a position to convince our European colleagues of the need for solidarity and perhaps save us from devaluation, thus preventing the domino effect that is affecting other currencies at the moment.</P>
    <P>I put it to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that internal Fianna Fáil politics prevented the Minister, Deputy David Andrews, from having the role that he should have had in relation to the crisis, which was a matter of foreign policy. That was not to be.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance decided that they would control the direction of the negotiations.  Look at what they have done to the country as a result.  They were more interested in precipitating an unnecessary general election through the macho behaviour of our Taoiseach during his evidence to the Beef Tribunal than they were in resolving the national crisis caused by the speculative attacks on our punt from outside.  That unnecessary general election has yet to be costed and analysed for what it has done to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> During the election the Minister for Finance missed the opportunity, on 21 November last, to realign with other currencies in the ERM.  The Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was displaying, as commentators have said during the week, the gut instinct of a latter day economic republican by acting and being seen to act independently of the British, whatever the cost to the real national interest. During the election anglophobia had to come to the fore and, as has been said, he behaved like a latter day economic republican with one eye on the ballot box at home.</P>
    <P>Following the election, the Minister for Finance was more interested in negotiating for power than keeping his eye on the ball in relation to the pressures on our punt.  I imagine there must have been many other equally qualified members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who would have had more time on their hands to negotiate in relation to power, but no. The man perhaps most critical to the resolution of our economic crisis was used by the main Government party to negotiate and removed himself from the issue that was before him.</P>
    <P>Exchange rate policy is not an end in itself.  Economic rigour must be tempered by the interests of all our people.  Even the Minister for Finance once he had devalued, despite his protestations, justified it on the basis that he &ldquo;could not continue to make the ordinary people suffer&rdquo;.  At least he must be commended for his honesty in admitting that he had made ordinary people suffer for over five months.  He had driven people from their homes by the crippling mortgage rates and, indeed, he had added to the dole queues in thousands.  It will be some time before we know the impact on the dole queues.  Business closed, industries were in serious trouble, all because of unnecessary suffering beyond the time when it was patently obvious that the Government was not prepared to defend the currency as it should have.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the Minister for Finance must take responsibility for those who advised him.  As commentators have said over the weekend, the Eurozealots in <Col N="1141" /> the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency unwittingly did more to damage the European ideal in the past five months than Ireland's most dedicated Eurosceptics have achieved in 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Teacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Teacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the international currency situation.  In my remarks I will concentrate on the areas which are the responsibility of my Government colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, who is currently in the United States where he is leading a major tourism promotion drive.</P>
      <P>The past four and a half months have been a turbulent and difficult period for many of those involved in exporting and in the tourism industry.  In my remarks today I want to concentrate on what we can learn from recent events and focus on some future policies which we should pursue.  The recent currency crisis was not precipitated by the Irish Government. The unprecedented turbulence in the currency markets has threatened much of the progress which we have achieved in recent years.  For several years we have pursued a consistent line in regard to our exchange rate policy.  We have sought to maintain a firm and stable exchange rate within the narrow band of the EMS.  We have lent credibility to this approach by adopting a set of economic policies which are consistent with membership of a strong currency regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach has paid dividends. From 1987, wage and price inflation reduced sharply to facilitate the achievement of significant gains in the competitiveness of the traded sector of our economy.  This improvement in competitiveness coincided with reasonably favourable increases in import demand from our main trading partners as economic growth achieved a modest acceleration. This gave a major boost to exports and sustained a record surplus <Col N="1142" /> on our balance of trade and balance of payments in recent years.</P>
    <P>Free Trade is Ireland's life blood.  The small size of the Irish domestic market means that employment and living standards in this country are highly dependent on our success in international trade.  We already have one of the most open trading economies in Europe. Exports of our goods and services account for over 70 per cent of our GNP and Irish exports are now found in over 120 countries throughout the world.  Our most important trading links are with our European Community partners.  In 1992 over £12 billion of our total exports were to markets within the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to look at our export portfolio before we joined the European Community.  In 1972 the United Kingdom accounted for some 62 per cent of our exports, with other EC countries accounting for 17 per cent of our overseas sales.  Twenty years later we have seen a dramatic shift in that balance.  The UK now accounts for just 32 per cent of our exports, whereas other EC states take 42 per cent.  To put it another way, exports to the UK since we joined the EC have increased by a factor of 12, whereas exports to other member states have increased by a factor of 56.  These stark figures illustrate very convincingly just how reliant we are on markets within the European Community for our prosperity. The completion of the Single European Market means Irish firms can enjoy the fullest possible access to a market of 340 million people; and we can look forward to the members of EFTA and Eastern European countries joining also, to make that market even larger.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this successful diversification of our exports, Ireland incorporated is still more than twice as dependent on the UK market as on any other overseas market.  This reliance, together with the very flat performance of the UK economy in recent years, was at the root of the difficulties which our exporters, particularly small and medium sized firms, faced in recent months.  The very difficult trading environment which <Col N="1143" /> faced many firms required a flexible and constructive response on behalf of all arms of the Government involved in industrial promotion and development. The response of the Government was swift and realistic and was widely supported by industry and the political parties.</P>
    <P>Additional finance has been made available to the various marketing bodies to help firms with additional marketing costs to maintain existing business and to secure new orders.  An Bord Tráchtála, established a special fund of £800,000 which helped 544 companies to visit their target markets in the UK and Europe before the end of 1992.  A further £1 million has been allocated to this scheme for the first three months of this year, and I understand from An Bord Tráchtála that there is a very strong demand from industry for support.  An Bord Tráchtála also initiated a number of support measures to help exporters.  A 1-800 Freephone help line was established to give exporters advice on the new and intensified programmes available to them to assist with difficulties in the marketplace. Forty market specialists from An Bord Tráchtála offices in Europe, the UK and the US were recalled to Ireland to meet companies throughout the country and advise them on specific difficulties and opportunities and, where appropriate, to set up market visit programmes. An Bord Tráchtála accelerated its inward buyer missions programme, bringing overseas buyers to selected companies in the regions to discuss business opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, recognised that in themselves a redirection of programmes by agencies would not be sufficient to meet the threat to employment as a result of a loss of margins, an immediate cash-flow deficiency and uncertainty as to whether contracts for future order should be undertaken at current sterling/Irish pound exchange rates.</P>
    <P>On 29 September last our Government established a working group to look at the nature and content of the problems arising for firms as a result of the decline <Col N="1144" /> in the value of sterling and to make recommendations as soon as possible. The report of the working group was considered one week later by the Government, on 6 October, and an immediate decision was taken to allocate £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which had been seriously affected by the turmoil in exchange rates within the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  By 9 October the team needed to manage the operation of the fund was in place, drawn from a total of seven State agencies and Government Departments.  The market development fund received speedy approval from the European Commission, following a strong campaign involving the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and various senior Ministers.</P>
    <P>Through the operation of the market development fund and through various schemes operated by the State agencies more than 800 companies, employing 53,000 people, will receive assistance to cope with currency pressures.  I understand that a review of the scheme, which is nearly completed has indicated that the fund has been successful in helping companies to maintain employment during a very difficult time.  Many companies have indicated that the support available to them has made the difference between shedding labour or maintaining employment, closing down or staying in business.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, remember that the role of Government and its agencies must be to help firms to help themselves. A key criterion for companies seeking assistance from the market development fund was that they would initiate an action plan which would demonstrate how the firm was going about maintaining and improving its competitiveness and adjusting to the changes in the marketplace. The assistance provided is of a short-term nature and in no way relieves firms of the need to make the necessary adjustments to their operations to ensure long term survival.</P>
    <P>The vulnerability of many of our firms has highlighted yet again some of the structural weaknesses in parts of our <Col N="1145" /> indigenous industry.  It comes as no surprise that those sectors which suffer most from the devaluation of sterling are those where price is possibly the most important determinant of competition.  The clothing and timber industries come immediately to mind in this analysis.  The reality of our geographical location on the periphery of Europe and the small size of our domestic market mean that businesses which compete mainly on price will find it very difficult to achieve the necessary economies of scale to enable them to trade competitively.</P>
    <P>The solution for such sectors and, indeed, for indigenous industry in general must be to seek our market segments where they can compete on the basis of a differentiated product which can give value to the customer in terms of higher quality, better service or some other non-price factor.  An essential ingredient in this process is the building up of marketing skills within companies.  This is the reason that under the industry operational programme, which is funded by the EC Structural Fund, the Government highlighted the need to improve the marketing capability of Irish industry.  All the marketing programmes of An Bord Tráchtála are assisted by the European Regional Development Fund and attract the highest support rate available, i.e. 75 per cent of eligible expenditures.  EC Structural Fund support underpins the ability of the Government to get behind and support the marketing efforts of Irish industry.  Since 1989 Exchequer funding for marketing programmes has increased by over 60 per cent, a level of increase which would simply not be possible without EC Structural Fund support.</P>
    <P>The focus of An Bord Tráchtála's activities in recent years has been firmly on the opportunities that the Single Market will present and it has particularly highlighted Germany as a priority market to which additional resources have been allocated.  The realignment of the Irish pound, while unwelcome and not the Government's preferred policy option, has nonetheless provided many of our exporters with a significant competitiveness injection.  There is now an onus <Col N="1146" /> on firms which are in a position to avail of this benefit to invest in the marketing effort necessary to penetrate these markets. For their part, the Department of Tourism and Trade and An Bord Tráchtála are actively examining ways in which new programmes can be devised and existing programmes adapted to support exporters.</P>
    <P>The UK will always be the most attractive market for small and first time exporters, but we do have a good many quality firms that can make the breakthrough into European markets.  A key factor will be their willingness to put people on the ground in the marketplace. The Programme for a Partnership Government has specifically identified the need to develop measures that will assist firms to place their sales people in export markets.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, has asked An Bord Tráchtála to come forward with proposals which will facilitate companies in making the necessary investment in this area.  The Minister has also indicated his intention to give greater priority to An Bord Tráchtála's promotional efforts in new and expanding markets and this emphasis will be evident when he announces shortly the board's promotional programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>Other priorities in the area of international trade on which the Minister for Tourism and Trade will be concentrating include making the Single Market work. We must be vigilant in ensuring that the open Single Market becomes a reality and that new invisible barriers are not erected against intra-Community trade. We must exploit the Single Market.  The public sector purchasing within the EC, a market worth £400 billion a year, £5 billion of which arises on the Irish market, both North and South is now an open market and Irish companies are looking at a major new business opportunity. We must make sure that Irish companies can quickly and effectively access the opportunities arising.</P>
    <P>We must develop service exports. Throughout the world various multilateral organisations, such as the UN, the World Bank and the EC, are involved <Col N="1147" /> in extensive development and assistance programmes which represent major opportunities for our exporters, in particular our service organisations.  We should be looking at the lessons that can be learnt from our experiences in Central and Eastern Europe, where Irish companies have achieved some notable successes.</P>
    <P>Members, will, no doubt, be aware that the Irish tourism industry has been one of the most successful sectors of the economy in recent years.  Overseas visitor numbers have increased since 1988 by 33 per cent to over three million; foreign tourism revenue has increased by 45 per cent to over £1.2 billion; an extra 23,500 vitally needed new jobs have been created.  The Government's commitment to tourism has been renewed and strengthened in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The aim in the programme is to increase foreign earnings in real terms by 50 per cent and to provide an additional 35,000 jobs over the next five years.  The targets which we have set may be regarded as ambitious but are, we believe, realistic and we are confident that the industry itself will rise to the challenge with us.  The new Department of Tourism and Trade will give tourism an enhanced international dimension and will be the focal point for the development of the sector.</P>
    <P>Tourism, like other industries, does not exist in a vacuum and is of course subject to a number of factors, including the general state of the economies in our main markets, consumer spending levels, comparative inflation rates, etc.  We were most fortunate that the peak of the tourism season in 1992 was almost over before the international money markets became turbulent.  We are also most fortunate that the major source of growth in Irish tourism in recent years has been in mainland Europe outside the sterling area. While the IR£ has strengthened against the pound sterling, it has weakened against other major currencies, such as the French franc, the Deutschemark, the Dutch guilder and, of course the dollar all of which represent important markets <Col N="1148" /> for Irish tourism.  Since 1987 tourist traffic from mainland Europe has increased by more than 116 per cent and revenue has almost trebled to come within 8 per cent of the British figure by the end of 1991. Our most recent tourism statistics for the third quarter of 1992 show that growth from continental Europe was again ahead of the United Kingdom.  Market diversifications undoubtedly helped considerably to reduce the level of exposure of the tourism industry to individual currency fluctuations in any one market.</P>
    <P>The recent realignment of the IR£ taking place at a very early stage in the 1993 tourist season will be of particular benefit to the industry as many Europeans have not yet decided on their summer holiday destinations.  Already Bord Fáilte is alerting overseas travel agents to the benefits of increased spending power for our visitors arising from the realignment and is updating live brochures on central reservations systems used widely in the industry for booking holidays.  The realignment will also play an important part in attracting visitors from Britain, and Bord Fáilte will be making a special effort to ensure that this very important market will be promoted efficiently and effectively in the coming season.</P>
    <P>We are confident that all participants in the industry will do their best to enhance their competitive position arising from realignment and the resultant fall in interest rates.  This effort will be accompanied by the Government's commitment to tourism, which in 1993 alone will manifest itself in a further £88 million investment in tourism around the country, including £47 million in European Community grants; a special £2 million European Community assisted marketing campaign to generate business during the off-peak and shoulder seasons; and a £10 million European Community assisted marketing package by the industry directed at selling a new range of quality Irish products in overseas markets. This combined effort should ensure that our tourism targets for 1993, and indeed for the next five years, are achieved. <Col N="1149" /> Finally, may I say that the establishment of a new ministry for Tourism and Trade now provides us with an opportunity to devise and implement focused policies which will lead to increased foreign earnings.  Its actions and that of its agencies will be part of the Government's broad economic policies to provide a competitive trading environment for business and assist it by availing of the opportunities arising in the international marketplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. Today, for the first time, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, had the opportunity to place on record the Government's view on the currency crisis and the recent forced devaluation.  Given the momentous impact of this policy decision and the manner in which it was forced upon a reluctant Government, one expected that today at least the Government would use this opportunity to spell out with clarity the lessons it has drawn from the recent debacle &mdash; for Irish/European policy, on the one hand, and for Irish domestic economic policy, on the other.  Regrettably, we got neither. There is no strategic sense of purpose indicated by the Minister's speech with regard to our continuing potential for vulnerability within the exchange rate mechanism.  Indeed, the statement produced after a long pause for reflection on the part of all the relevant policy-makers, including the Minister, reeks of passivity.</P>
      <P>As the crisis which began last September unfolded, the Minister draws our attention in his speech today to the assertion that &ldquo;a well-managed realignment within the system could have forestalled the subsequent chaos . . .  the reality is that it did not take place&rdquo;.  The Minister's analysis is replete with subsequent references to the desirability of a general realignment.  In particular, when the consequences of the permanent rather than the transitory nature of the crisis were clearly evident by mid-November last, the Minister again recalls:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on a number of occasions that we were ready to consider a realignment <Col N="1150" /> within the exchange rate mechanism, and it did appear from time to time that such a realignment, involving the Irish, French and Danes, might take place . . .  the French and Danes were unwilling to participate in a general realignment.</P>
    <P>On 22 November last the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo were both devalued by 6 per cent, with particular pressure still then continuing on the Irish pound.  At the crucial meeting of the European Community's Monetary Committee that weekend, it is clear from what he now says today that our Minister and his advisers were anxious that we might participate in any realignment which could be described as &ldquo;general&rdquo;. Following the logic of the dilemma which they then found themselves in on that occasion, the Spanish and the Portuguese took the obvious course of action of realising that their exchange rates were overvalued and were nothing more than a tool of economic policy and not an object of economic policy.</P>
    <P>This is in stark contrast to the public policy position of the Government and its advisers who by implication did not wish to suffer the ignominy of being classified as a division two player in the European monetary league, but chose instead to persist with a form of Micawber-style economics, hoping something would turn up on the European front; but, of course, it did not.  Clearly the French and the Danes did not oblige Ireland by sharing our policy preference for a general realignment in whose slip-stream we could have drifted with no apparent loss of face in terms of our newfound monetary machoism.</P>
    <P>A core truth is revealed in the Minister's speech today.  In persistently, though passively, aspiring to a general realignment, he is clearly admitting that the Government and its advisers implicitly accepted throughout this critical period that fundamentlly the Irish pound was overvalued.  This is the inescapable conclusion of the Minister's remarks; otherwise, why would we talk about realignment? <Col N="1151" /> This stance reeks of a misplaced pride and a hopeless passivity with regard to our currency policy options.  We, through our Government, wanted to run in the fast track of the Exchange Rate Mechanism without being able to match the pace-setters.  At the same time, we had no independent plan of action, should some of those pace-setters, such as France and Denmark, refuse to run at our speed.</P>
    <P>Intriguingly, the Minister states that, &ldquo;contrary to rumour, our European partners would, in all probability, have rejected a devaluation if we sought their agreement last September&rdquo;.  Later, he stated: &ldquo;There were no pressures from Europe for a change in the parity of the Irish pound&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, this begs the question: did we ever choose to make an issue of our parity at any of the Monetary Committee Meetings; and, if not, why not, even if only to test the reaction?  If it was our considered opinion, as reported in the Minister's speech today, that a general realignment was the preferred policy option held throughout that critical period, then surely that implies that the Minister, and his advisers, accepted that the currency was over-valued and that there was an onus on them to explore, with our European partners, a way to tackle the consequences of that problem.</P>
    <P>Like the European Community, through its policy known as multilateral surveillance, we have concentrated in Ireland on framing our policy response on the so-called fundamentals of the Irish economy.  These indicators of nominal economic convergence consist of, for example, our having one of the lowest inflation rates in the Community, a consistent balance of payments surplus and a good budget performance.  In Irish terms these factors are good in comparison with our recent history, and in European terms they are very good compared with many member states, and better than most.  However, in terms of real policy covergence, there is no escaping the fact that Ireland was defending a tough currency policy in the context of the highest measured rate of unemployment in the <Col N="1152" /> European Community.  Inevitably, given our trading links with the UK, and the labour intensive nature of many of the Irish firms and sectors competing with UK equivalents, financial markets were bound to speculate that the strain of these bread and butter realities would ultimately prevail.</P>
    <P>Economic dogma, a Cheann Comhairle, in the end is no substitute for dealing with economic reality.  The only domestic policy response to emanate from the war bunker of the economic trinity, consisting of the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Bank, was to manipulate Irish interest rates as the key means of controlling currency speculation at home or abroad.  In practice what this did in policy terms was simply to add an enormous cost burden to Irish firms and households and still it left us vulnerable to the economic consequences of an overvalued exchange rate.  While it was perfectly legitimate that the Minister and others should concentrate on the question of avoiding excessive increases in the interest rate, however, by relying solely on this policy focus and not examining in any great depth the cost implications of an over-valued currency we left ourselves constantly open to the problems we faced. The fundamental problem, the first cause, was the overvalued currency; and the consequences of that was the forced interest rate manipulation to try to protect it.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister strikes a pose which, in my view, amounts simply to whistling past the graveyard.  He also told us: &ldquo;We will not adjust our exchange rate in response to changes in sterling&rdquo;.  He is making a prediction for the future.  Later on he added: &ldquo;I believe we have gained much in credibility&rdquo; God bless your innocence, Minister, if you expect us to read your lips and believe you on that one. Indeed, disturbing evidence emerged this morning in a line of thinking which may be shared by official circles in Ireland &mdash; and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this &mdash; which was enunciated in Paris by the former <Col N="1153" /> European Community Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  He sought to establish that the Irish dependence on Britain, in terms of the pecentage of our exports destined for that country, is a good deal less in reality, when you take account of agriculture and oil flows, than most people think, taken from the general economic point of view.</P>
    <P>There are serious flaws in this argument. First of all, the markets do not believe it.  The Government did believe it and on 30 January the markets won. The key flaw arises from the fact that Irish manufacturers not only export to the United Kingdom but must also compete against competing UK imports for our home market and compete on third markets against other firms exporting out of the United Kingdom.  All these factors combined, exert an influence considerably greater than that suggested by the former Commissioner in terms of the impact on Irish trade and jobs.  Mr. Sutherland suggested that the cure to the current monetary crisis is for a core of seven countries, including Ireland, to proceed quickly towards a single currency. With the pound sterling floating freely outside the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and presumably outside such an arrangement were it to happen, there is one clear lesson that should have been learnt from recent weeks and from the recent currency trauma.  It is this: that while in this country we should not be a slave to sterling &mdash; and that is clearly not the view of the Minister and his advisers from reading his speech today &mdash; we nonetheless would at our peril ignore the impact of sterling on our affairs.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for Irish policy to become more Catholic than the Pope, or more European than the Europeans. Within days of our devaluation the Danish krone, then the subject of intense market speculation, was the beneficiary of a European response which in terms of its nature and scale was denied to the Irish over a prolonged period of time.  I believe that denial to the Irish of such a response and the granting with an apparent equanimity to the Danes of such a response speaks volumes in terms of how <Col N="1154" /> we are perceived in the currency stakes at a European level.  There is no point in us trying to naively defy that logic.  There is no point in us in Ireland being naive Europeans, even if we still remain committed Europeans.  The key benefit of Mr. Sutherland's intervention today is that at least it has the merit of focusing on what vision we Irish might bring to the wider European debate and the monetary crisis.  I must say I was disappointed not to find any semblance of such vision in terms of Irish European policy in this matter in the Minister's considered response to the House here today.  That is a major weakness in regard to where we stand now.</P>
    <P>Last May, in launching the Progressive Democrats' campaign in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the Maastricht referendum campaign, I made the point that I thought it was high time that, after two decades of membership of the European community, we in this country should have a view of European policy that is more sophisticated than just milking a European cow for grants.  The Minister's statement today sees us, after a very traumatic period of Irish public policy in a European context, falling very well short of that desirable aim.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred today to &ldquo;the weakening of the national consensus&rdquo;, together with the most recent unpheaval in British interest rates, as the justification for the policy <i>volte-face</i> at the end of January.  Deputy Ahern went on to upbraid critics of his Government's failure to reduce domestic costs by saying that these self same critics &ldquo;have not spelt out clearly the scale of the adjustment which would have been needed and the implications for the public finances&rdquo;.  It is the duty of the Government to govern in this regard.  Critics were perfectly correct to assume that a Government committed to a hard currency policy was equally committed to the ways and means of securing its success in market terms. As I have already remarked, on the European level in waiting for others to realign when it might suit us, we had a Micawber approach of hoping that something would turn up and these economics clearly <Col N="1155" /> failed.  What the Minister has implicitly admitted here today amounts on the part of the Government and its advisers to a gross dereliction of duty.  It is a bit like the Emperor in Hans Christian Andersen's tale.  The Minister, by his own admission, stands naked in policy response terms other than interest rate manipulation. Then he has the brazen effrontery to come to this House and to criticise those who simply, in policy terms, observed his nakedness.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Government itself shrank from the prospect of bringing in policies on the scale of adjustment which would be needed.  Yet it still clung vainly to the prospect of holding the line on the currency's value.  The Government's failure to act in terms of cost reductions simply made devaluation inevitable and necessary.  The Government did have choices, but it did not have the choice of doing nothing about domestic costs with an overvalued currency and, at the same time as doing nothing about that and being able to do nothing to influence our European partners effectively in our favour, to presume that nothing would give.  Either jobs would be sacrificied &mdash; and plainly that would be a consequence &mdash; or, alternatively, costs would be cut. The Government chose not to cut the costs.  The Government chose to wait for someone else to act in our interest in Europe &mdash; and it did not work.  That made what happened on 30 January absolutely inevitable.</P>
    <P>Today Deputy Ahern also told us that &ldquo;on the budgetary front the effects this year of devaluation would only be slightly negative&rdquo;.  This contrasts sharply in tone, whatever about content, with the text of a currency policy statement issued by the Minister's own Department on the night of 26 January last, four days before the devaluation, which focused only on the Exchequer costs of pursuing a policy of devaluation.</P>
    <P>This, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, leads me to observe that the debate which should have surrounded a grave and momentous national policy question such as this has been conducted in an extraordinary atmosphere, which was hostile <Col N="1156" /> to ideas, which was economic with the truth, not least in the manner I mentioned just a moment ago, which was vitriolic towards those who chose to deviate from conventional wisdom and, worst of all, which was virtually indifferent to the appalling social and economic costs suffered by so many Irish firms, so many Irish employees and so many Irish households. Verbal fat was issued against those who strayed from the official truth is no way to conduct important national debates and certainly that it is one lesson which we have all got to learn from this particular incident over the past several weeks.</P>
    <P>Another lesson which we must apply, especially on the new Finance and General Affairs Committee proposed for the Dáil, is to ensure that senior policy makers, no less than Government Ministers, while respecting their independence from the political process should nonetheless be held publicly accountable for the policy advice they give.  I am referring here to the necessary, desirable act of bringing these people &mdash; central bankers, senior officials from the Department of Finance, senior officials from the National Treasury Management Agency &mdash; before the relevant Dáil committees, as their counterparts in Europe come before the relevant European parliamentary committees, to answer for their conduct of public affairs and for the nature of the advice they give.  It is not good enough that we have policy managed from economic bunkers when there is so much incoming fire from speculators and when we do not know the basis on which that advice is being given.  Indeed, in that regard, having read some recent newspaper reports commenting on the attitudes of one economist who recently quit the Central Bank, it raises a central question about some of the economic policy formulation process within that institution.  We should have a right to get public accountability, and that should be a lesson that is derived from this crisis.</P>
    <P>On the wider front, in the absence of any early move to a single currency in the European stage or indeed, even if we went the Sutherland route of having <Col N="1157" /> seven currencies including Ireland move quickly towards a single currency, I am extremely disturbed about what the policy consequences would be if we in Ireland find ourselves still subject to the vagaries of a sterling area which is totally removed from the European realities.  As long as that is the case we will have serious and fundamental problems in terms of our vulnerability.  Surely the lesson in economic terms is that there is no point in kidding around in that in the future.  Unfortunate and undesirable as it is, it is a plain fact of the matter.</P>
    <P>A second area where we need more flexibility is at the European level itself. Six years of rigid inflexibility in the exchange rate mechanisms will have to be replaced by a more flexible attitude to currency parities in the future so that we do not get locked in to unnecessarily restrictive options.</P>
    <P>Finally, referring back to the policy bunker I mentioned earlier, I wonder whether it is desirable that all of the agencies of policy making should be locked into the same process rather than having an arm's length independence from each other.  We signed no at Maastricht for a central banking process in policy terms to be wholly removed from political interference or from political contact.  I wonder whether it makes sense in Ireland, as we prepare for full European Monetary Union in the future &mdash; if Europe ever gets there &mdash; to compel ourselves to put all of our eggs in one basket and to find that various institutions are locked into the same policy focus.  I certainly think it is something which needs looking at.</P>
    <P>I not in the Taoiseach's remarks that he describes the Progressive Democrats, having left Government, as needing to ride both horses.  I would remind the Taoiseach that he himself, in the course of his own address to the House, said that from his background &mdash; presumably he referes to his business background &mdash; he felt that as long as the prospect was reasonable for stability he would hold out, but otherwise would review the position. For my own party, I would expect <Col N="1158" /> no less a right in the matter of public policy debate.</P>

      <P>The sorry saga of events that led to the devaluation of the punt on Saturday, 30 January last has been endlessly repeated here and indeed elsewhere. I do not wish to take up the valuable time of the House by dwelling on the details of recent history.  As far as I am concerned a far greater urgency and relevance is not the &ldquo;how&rdquo; but the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of that recent debacle.  We must now accurately identify the root cause of our situation and agree by broad consensus on a programme for its resolution.  If we fail to achieve this we will be giving two hostages to fortune.  First, we will recklessly endanger the progress made in our economic affairs since 1987.  We must remember the unprecedented political and social consensus that brought about our changed socio-economic environment. We must also recall the extreme fragility of such a widespread and valuable national resource, as that consensus is &mdash; a consensus, I might add, which was hard won.  Second, if we fail to stabilise our currency in particular and the European Monetary System in general, we may as well abandon any pretence of economic or industrial planning.  In the wake of devaluation some commentators churlishly crowed that you cannot buck the market.  Certainly, it has been demonstrated that Ireland alone cannot buck the market; but if Europe as a whole slides by default into a posture of <i>laissez faire vis-à-vis</i> the markets, the unbridled capitalism of tomorrow may make the State socialism of yesterday seem like a fond memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europe as a community is undoubtedly <Col N="1159" /> at a crossroads.  Do we opt for a free enterprise culture within the framework of social and economic concern for individual citizens and small countries?  The alternative is an ideological capitalism that will make the worst excesses of That-cherism and Reganomics look benign.  In this recent crisis Europe, by default if not by design, has slipped somewhat down the latter slope.  These are the dangers that will result from inaction, or incorrect action, and they must be avoided.  In 1979, when breaking our 200 year link with sterling, we had the commendable ambition of reducing our dependence on a British economy that was increasingly unable to compete in the European market.  On that occasion our currency policy was saved by the oil crisis.  Sterling, with the North Sea oil behind it, rose rather than fell.  Had sterling fallen, as it would surely otherwise have done, the punt would have been forced to leave the ERM within a year.  However, I am not ungrateful for our luck then, neither am I insensitvie to the welcome changes the ERM membership has wrought in our economy and in our economic attitudes.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record that I strongly support the drive towards a single European currency and the day when the possibility of a repetition of recent events will be firmly behind us. This poses the question of genuine European unity.  How close are we to political union in Europe and how soon will the European Monetary Union become a reality?  When you take a practical look at the individual countries, each with their individual problems, unity is as yet but an aspiration.  The core of our problem is that since 1979 we have underestimated or underallowed for the continual crucial influence of sterling on our economy and our currency.  In 1979 the Government borrowed at low interest rates in order to compensate for the problem of the ERM membership.  That policy, in my opinion, was flawed.  Even to the present day we are paying with interest for the unfounded optimism of those times.</P>
    <P>The use of subsidies now, as then, is unsustainable in the face of global markets. <Col N="1160" /> A situation had been reached where the pain of the real economy was such that it prompted a review of our currency policy sooner rather than later.  I accept that the Government was forced by circumstances outside its control to take a calculated risk in regard to the defending of the currency.  I strongly question the validity of the formula by which historically and now this calculation is arrived at.  An underestimation politically and economically of Britain and sterling is a flawed policy formulation process.  We must note with concern the reduction in British interest rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent.  It is the view of the NatWest Bank that the Major Government has decided that the recession has become unbearable and is bent on stimulating its economy at almost any cost, including a cheap currency policy.  Another 1 per cent interest cut before the March budget should not be unexpected, Where will the effect of this policy leave us?  Within six months we conceivably will be back to the position we were in before devaluation.  So our pain will have been without gain.  It is urgently necessary that we guard against this appalling vista.  The long-term solution lies in diminishing further our dependence on the UK economy.  Since joining the ERM in 1979 we have reduced the percentage of our exports to the UK from one-half to one-third.  We have made progress, but not nearly enough.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the facts as best I can. In this crisis it has never been true to say that there are lies, damn lies and then there are statistics.  Nobody should be in any doubt that this crisis has as much to do with perception as with fact.  One-third of our exports are to Britain.  That is the official statistic.  It is also a dangerous fiction.  If our statistics were based more realistically on the currency in which the transactions were made it would be shown that Ireland's real dependence on the British market was 15 to 20 per cent. If the latter perception had been widespread would the currency crisis have bitten so deep?  I doubt it.  I have quoted from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 <Col N="1161" /> February by a chief economist with NCB Stockbrokers.  The bottom line is that, however unfairly and despite a gallant fight by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, by the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds and the Government, we did lose on the diplomatic front in Brussels and, indeed, on the propaganda front in the markets.  I place the blame for this on the institutional incapacity of the Department of Finance to meet the situation. This is not news to anybody and has long escaped correction, only because of inexcusable political malaise from all sides for some considerable time.  Unless the nut of institutional reform is cracked we will permanently lack the capacity that is imperative to surviving let alone prosper in an ever more complex world. Roll on reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has shown himself to be a brave and stalwart Minister for Finance.  I invite him to be a great Minister.  If he can succeed in broadening the thought base in his Department he will leave a legacy in the years to come which will be truly significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I have no doubt that you will fill the position with distinction and honour and that you will leave a mark in this House.</P>
      <P>As one who favoured devaluation in the fall of last year when the crisis first arose on the advice of business people in my constituency who had been very dependent on the British market, I discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance and my views are well known. The debate here today is necessary but not before time.  This debate should have taken place before Christmas.  I would compare this with the debate which took place here some months ago on the Gulf War which was much less damaging to the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to say that the British market is still very, very important to the Irish people.  It is a market of 56 million people on our doorstep.  Much of our foodstuffs in processed form goes to the British <Col N="1162" /> market.  We are dependent for many thousands of jobs on that.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the threat of Cadbury's to leave this country or close down their business because of their failure to trade as a result of the value of the punt versus the pound sterling.</P>
    <P>We have lost a substantial amount of shelf space in our multiple stores because of the importation of foreign foodstuffs. Much of this space had been hard won by Irish manufacturers over a long number of years.  The problem for many of our Irish food manufacturers now is to win back this shelf space.  I refer mainly to the major multiples.  The Dunnes and the Quinnsworths are the major participants in this country in that type of business.  They have been quick off the mark and it is not right to criticise them as good business people.  It is very important that at all times we be on our guard to protect our homemarket.  We are the same type of people as the British; we speak the same language and for that reason it is a market that we can never ignore.  The fact is that that market is of vital importance to us.</P>
    <P>We have had a devaluation and we still have high interest rates.  Our interest rate at 18 per cent is unreal and inflation is 2 per cent to 3 per cent.  They both make little sense and I wonder when we will see a levelling off or a substantial reduction in interest rates to compete with inflation. Speculators were spoken about and regarded as reds under the bed, but the climate at the time favoured speculation. Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind about that because it was attractive for people in the money business who understood the market to speculate.  If you create a certain climate people who know the business will work against you.  A rate of 34 per cent has been quoted by one large banking group.  For three months it was at about 32 per cent.  I am very much aware of the numbers of business people who have been caught having agreed the three months and who will have high rates of interest to pay for the next number of months.  They will have great difficulty in surviving.</P>
    <P>We have mortgage rates at 18 per cent. <Col N="1163" /> If we had faced the challenge &mdash; I say this against all the odds because many people did not believe it &mdash; and had faced devaluation we would have low interest rates internally and much more favourable trading conditions.  That is the reality. Our citizens would not have lost internally but of course it would have affected our national debt and others.</P>
    <P>We are told then that we are going to borrow to the Maastricht guideline.  It is not very encouraging for the Bundesbank to give us the support necessary because we should be pulling back from our borrowing rather than increasing it.  While that is a guideline the message is that that is as far as you can go.  Any increase in borrowings cannot be afforded by this country because the real problem is that the cost of our goods and services is much too high.  As a country that wants to trade we will always have to be watchful and fearful of increased costs and to be aware if our goods are more expensive than our competitors.  That is the reality as I see it.</P>
    <P>We have a very difficult and uphill battle ahead of us because we are creating a climate in this country where the goods we manufacture and the services we trade abroad will be much too expensive because of high interest rates and other costs.  It has been said quite often in this House on all sides and by all Governments that the cost of our internal services including telephone and postal services is too high.  This makes the life of an Irish manufacturer very difficult on top of the problems that have now arisen. What has emerged is a fiasco.  There has been the poor judgment of the advisers and the people who should know better, mainly the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency. I have not followed the financial scene very closely but it would seem to me as if the National Treasury Management Agency had all its eggs in one basket rather than having a mix of borrowing. While we have a substantial trade in the UK it is right that we should have some mix of borrowing.  We should have borrowing in sterling in view of the problems <Col N="1164" /> that arose.  The reality is that the crisis is not yet over.  The whole concept of the ERM and our alignment to Germany currency need a vision and growth in Europe.  This year will be zero in contrast to a three per cent growth in America. The Danish krone will have to be devalued, as I read <i>The Financial Times.</i> Therefore, with the exception of Germany all other countries will have devalued.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of the £8 billion and many of our citizens believe that the £8 billion is contingent on our stying in the ERM.  That is not the case as I understand it.  We should heed many of our very fine economists as they write in the papers.  There are three that I can mention, Brian Welsh, Brendan Keenan and Seán Barrett.  One of the finest economists is Brendan Keenan who writes in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> He said at one stage that there is no easy way out of the ERM madhouse.</P>

      <P>I start by offering you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, my personal best wishes on the office that you have assumed today and to assure you that as long as you are reasonable you will not find me in conflict with you at all, Sir. That is known as getting your retaliation in first.</P>
      <P>I have been a bit worried by this debate to the extent that there has not really been an awful lot of discussion of where the problem originated from or what the basic problem is that led to all of these events that we are talking about.  There does not seem to be too much questioning as to how much progress has been made in actually resolving that problem.  There are several parts of the problem and the origins of the turbulance that we have seen are to be found in a number of different places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> First of all, and without going into it in any great detail, we should look at what the main components are.  First, there has been an ongoing problem of domestic economic policy in the Italian economy that has caused a lot of difficulty in that economy over quite some time. Second, there has been, again over a substantial period, a problem in economic and fiscal policy in the UK economy. There has been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the principal elements in that policy and that uncertainty has given rise to varying views on sterling and there was until quite recently indeed a degree of uncertainty as to what the view of the UK authorities was on what we might loosely call exchange rate policy.</P>
    <P>Then we had the whole question of German reunification which in fact the Chancellor decided to resolve first of all by telling his compatriots that it could all be done without any new taxation.  He embarked on a programme of paying for the costs of reunification by borrowing thus driving interest rates up on the rest of us.  Then he was obliged to introduce some elements of new taxation though not by any means enough and refused to give the European Community the kind of strong role in dealing with the consequences of reunification that it should have had.  That has created enormous problems for the rest of us, not least being very substantial upward pressure on interest rates.  Finally, another key element has been the French Government's policy of the strong franc.  I think that most observers, analysts and commentators would believe that the strong part of that particular policy has been overstated a little compared to the inherent capacities in the French economy.</P>
    <P>Those are the main components of the problem that gave rise to all of this turbulence and unless we focus on those and look at what the implications are and assess what has been done to solve them we are not actually going to get much that is worth while out of the work that we do.  I say that to put the debate in context.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The Minister for Finance earlier today spoke a little bit ruefully about how wonderful it would have been at the end of last September to have the hindsight that we have today.  I suppose we can all say things like that in the present situations. But Ministers are there and administrations exist in order to exert a bit of foresight, not to complain afterwards that hinsight would make wise men of us all and if we knew then what we knew now would we not have done the devil and all?  They are there to exercise a bit of foresight, to look at the situation that faces them.  All of those components of the problems that I have outlined were clearly known in the middle of September last year when all of this turmoil began.</P>
    <P>The reason I insist that the Minister and, indeed, his advisers should have exercised a bit of foresight was really suggested to me by something that the Minister said.  He said it could be argued and, indeed, not only could it be argued but it is sticking out a mile that a wellmanaged realignment at the right time would have avoided all of this problem. That is the central issue here.  It would undoubtedly have done so and we have Ministers for Finance and we pay people in the Central Bank and in the Department of Finance and in their counterparts in the rest of Europe to have the kind of foresight that can see the necessity for a well-timed realignment of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself pointed out that it was unprecedented last September that the currency reserves of three of the G7 countries should come under pressure at the same time.  Indeed, yes, it was unprecedented. Why, in view of the fact that something unprecedented had happened, were the governments concerned and the EMS countries left floundering in the darkness?  The Minister said that the authorities had no plan to react. There was no plan to react.  If you are faced with an unprecedented situation you may not have a plan to react but you react in the best possible way on the basis of the problem that presents itself to you.</P>
    <P>Until the devaluation we have seen nothing of any real substance done to deal with the problem.  Three key opportunities <Col N="1167" /> were missed to deal with the problem.  The Ministers for Finance solemnly had a meeting in Bath which everybody thought would address this problem.  It did not.  The Heads of State of the European Community member states solemnly went and had a summit in Birmingham and they were expected to look at this problem.  They set up a working group.  In the middle of the problem they set up a working group.  The same Heads of State assembled again in Edinburgh in December and again failed to tackle the problem properly.</P>
    <P>There were solutions available at the time.  The Minister spoke rather mysteriously of what he called the unavailability of a special deal for Ireland and the punt.  It is very significant that he spoke of that because we are led to believe that in September the UK authorities were told that they could have a realignment if they really wished and that in October the Irish authorities were informally told the same thing, but neither of them took that option.  No action was taken until we had a statement from the ECOFIN Council a couple of weeks ago.  By that time it was too late.  It was with a certain degree of ruefulness that I heard the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs at the beginning of last week addressing the General Council of the European Community lecturing to them, if you please, about the deficiencies of monetary policy and the system we have in the EMS and ERM after the events had happened, after three successive Governments have had done nothing at all about the problem and after the Minister had been totally silent on the issue from the middle of last September, right through the negotiations to set up the Government, until he was sent off with a prepared script by a Government that wanted to shift the blame to other people for what they had been obliged to do.  That kind of treatment of the problem is not just insulting to us but it causes me grave worry about how the Government is going to deal with the consequences.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a few brief reflections <Col N="1168" /> on that.  A devaluation means that we reduce the value of our currency in terms of other currencies in order to give us a competitive advantage on our exports.  It means that we must necessarily accept that some imported products are going to be more expensive, both production goods and consumer goods. If we at home try to pay ourselves from our own internal resources more money to offset the extra cost of imported goods then we will rob the devaluation, we will rob the movement of any meaning.  There is a lesson here.  That is putting it as simply as I can.  There is a lesson to be pondered by the ladies and gentlemen in the Club of 22 on the backbenches of the Labour Party who are building up positions on this and by officials of large trade unions in this country who seem to be saying that there is a way from our internal resources that we can get over this when in fact they should know there is not.  The Minister has not given me any confidence at all today, in the few vacuous and vague statements he made about the consequences of devaluation, that the Government has any plan whatever. We are about to get the worst of every world on this issue.</P>

      <P>I join in offering congratulations and best wishes to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in your new post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to concentrate on being as positive and I can in that many of the valid criticisms of the handling of the debacle, the crisis, have been made by other speakers from all sides of the Opposition. I would like to vent my spleen because I did not have the opportunity of doing so the last occasion on which the Dáil met.  One of the key and quite valid points of criticism that has been made is that the Government's eye was off the ball for so long because of the drawn out nature of the forming of a Government.  I look back at the two to three weeks that the current Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, spent dealing with Democratic Left in what was a decoy activity to cover up for his long standing intention to do business <Col N="1169" /> with the Fianna Fáil Party on forming a Government.  In the context of the severity of the crisis that was facing the country that piece of political shenanigans takes on a doubly and trebly unattractive face.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the position of mortgage holders.  Most of my speech will concentrate on their situation.  It is inadequate to give a one day debate to an issue of this importance.  The debate to date has attempted to analyse the course of the crisis, how we got into such difficulties, how it was managed or illmanaged. There has been insufficient analysis of content in relation to the lessons to be learned from this.  That is probably the most important thing. Unlike the Minister, and in common with many people on this side of the House, I believe the complacency or sense of crisis over is not something that any responsible Government could adopt as a policy.  It was very unclear from the Minister's contribution today that any lessons had been learned from the handling of that matter that would advise him more effectively if such a situation were to recur.  I hope the debate will not end here.  I welcome interventions such as that of Peter Sutherland simply because they broaden and develop the debate. The debate should be taking part with all the social partners; it should continue as soon as possible in a newly formed committee of this House.  We have not come to terms with what happened.  We have not learned all the lessons and we certainly are not clear on how to handle such circumstances should they arise again in the future.</P>
    <P>Mortgage holders have been referred to in many speeches today, but generally very glancingly.  I was struck by a vox pop conducted by RTE in the weeks in advance of devaluation when the prospect of a further 3 per cent interest rise was very much looming.  Its significance only came to me as we finally devalued and I realised that the campaign we had all given a certain amount of hope and support to had failed and failed so dramatically.  The RTE interviewer was talking to people on the street, mortgage holders, about the impact of the existing <Col N="1170" /> interest rates and the kind of repayments they were making.  At one point he came across a very happy looking gentleman who said, &ldquo;I have no problem, mine have just come down to 5 per cent&rdquo;.  He was from Britain.  That passed me by at the time.  When I think about it now it raises a lot of questions.  Specifically it led me to do a little sum.  I may be wrong in my figures and in a way I hope I am.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell me if I am wrong or perhaps confirm if I am right.  In thinking about the position of mortgage holders in this country first, we have to be aware of the numbers that are involved.  To get that number I contacted the Central Statistics Office and they informed me that there are 320,000 mortgage holders in receipt of mortgage interest relief.  I can take it that that is a fairly sound figure.  The average mortgage is indicated to be of the order of £40,000.  On that basis and with an interest rate hike of the order of a minimum of 3 per cent, the increased figure being paid by the 320,000 mortgage holders is truly startling.  I make it out to be of the order of £150 million to date.</P>
    <P>If you look at the speeches here today most of them concentrated on the impact on industry.  Certainly, mortgage holders were mentioned, but their situation was not analysed.  Think of ordinary householders in this city and country carrying that kind of burden.  The extraordinary thing is, it starts with them.  The crisis for them is not over; it is still being carried by them.  That figure will increase, if my figures are correct, at the rate of £32 million a month until the interest rate drops back to its original level and/or significant immediate measures are taken for these people.  I would like to think that in my consideration of this matter those figures will be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I have heard the figure trotted out today here for the increase in the repayment demand of the national debt which is in the order of £50 million.  Indeed, these mortgage holders will be paying that in the future with the effect on our reserves and on industry.  Nobody has mentioned the figure for the kind of burden that is being carried on the shoulders <Col N="1171" /> of ordinary Irish citizens.  In my case I shall have it added to the end of my mortgage.  Some people are paying it already, but all of them owe it now.  That was their contribution to the Government's policy of maintaining a hard currency.</P>
    <P>I would like to get confirmation from the Minister, first, in the context of the forthcoming budget, that the plight of those people will be taken into account and, second, that the level of contribution they have made should be acknowledged.  The impossibility of their bearing more should also be kept in mind in the framing of any future policy should the situation deteriorate again.</P>
    <P>I was very concerned at the conclusion of the Minister's speech where he said that, now that it is all over, things look pretty optimistic, that interest rates have not gone up, that they have settled down a little and that there will be greater opportunities for marketing in certain countries.  I am sure the Minister of State will deal with all of that in her contribution. But there is no analysis here of economic and monetary policy for the future.  Are we now back to where we were, hard currency being our objective from the new base, with the situation that interest rates are still at the extraordinary high of 13.5 per cent, with the situation that today our currency was valued as being in the order of £1.3p sterling?  The structural factors mentioned by Deputy Dukes and the problems in the European economy still remain.  The complacency that exists is not justified.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned that in the Minister's speech there is very little indication of any action or changes that have taken place.  He does not make reference &mdash; and I hope we will see something coming from this &mdash; to some analysis of the role of the Central Bank and its advisers.  In the context of criticisms publicly made recently and referred to many times by speakers here today, that will be an important and vital analysis that should be taken very seriously indeed.</P>
    <P>There should be greater honesty with <Col N="1172" /> the public because if we come to face again the choices between floating and the hard currency option we must have the price tags of them firmly delineated to the Irish people so that mortgage holders do not find themselves six months on having paid so dearly for a policy which was ultimately to fail.  We cannot be surprised if they look enviously at their brothers and sisters across the water who have had the opposite experience, who have had their mortgages slashed by as much as or a great deal more than we have had them increased by.</P>
    <P>I hope the budget would look very seriously at the problems that have faced this sector and that in any future economic and monetary policy the price paid by the individual mortgage holder is fully acknowledged and a specific price tag put on it.  Remember, it is going up every month still.  This should be a central concern in any future policy.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I join other Members of the House in wishing you well in the years ahead in your role.  I know you will not think it remiss of me if I on the same occasion, say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to Deputy Mary Flaherty for putting her name forward.  I have always felt that competition is good for the body politic.</P>
      <P>I am very glad, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to have the opportunity this evening to speak in this debate.  I followed most of it during the day and listened to the speakers since I came here this evening.  Quite obviously the debate has developed, I am glad to say, in not too acrimonious a fashion and there has been an obvious attempt by most Members who have spoken to think through the issues and to be very aware of what has happened and what is now the best road to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great disappointment, certainly to me, of recent weeks has been the rising chorus of voices that actually advocated a shift of focus so that the benchmark for our currency that is, for our entire economic policy, would be sterling and <Col N="1173" /> the UK.  What could such people have been thinking?</P>
    <P>The recent NESC report, comparing Ireland to other small, late industrialising European countries, concludes that Ireland in this century &ldquo;became a free rider on Britain's decline&rdquo;.  We must overlook the fact that our efforts to keep competitive over the years, particularly since the War, did rely on a repeated pattern of currency devaluation.  In 1970 there were 12 DM to the £.  In January last there were 2.64.  In 1980 there were 3.6 Swiss francs; in January last year there were 2.2.  In essence, over the years we had been doing just what the UK had been doing, depreciating.  It is only since 1986 that we made effective strides to move to a really firmer policy stance.</P>
    <P>Remember that by floating and devaluing the UK sought over recent months to restore its wage and other costs and its inflation to something close to what we had achieved by policy and by restraint since 1986.  It was that comparative loss of competitiveness that forced them down. Our comparative competitiveness did not require the same adjustment of us.  It should be a cause of some disappointment to all here that, encouraged by idle and unfounded talk about our competitiveness and by exaggeration of our exposure to sterling, the markets &mdash; that is, the speculators &mdash; were uneasy and unsupportive.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in all of the media&mdash;print, radio and television &mdash;about the seemingly behaviour of the speculators.  Then there was a strong attempt to turn that to one side.  I am most uneasy about the behaviour of the speculators at that time and comments I made during those days I do not regret.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak briefly in more detail on comparative measures of costs. In terms of comparative measures of costs, of efficiency and in prices, Irish performance since 1986 has been in line with that of France and Germany.  We diverged from the UK post war trend, a trend that we had tended to mirror until the early 1980s.  Hourly earnings in Ireland rose by about 31 per cent between 1986 and 1992.  This compares to an <Col N="1174" /> increase of 33 per cent in Germany and of 26 per cent in France.  Our 31 per cent contrast with the UK where over the same period, 1986 to 1992, the increase was 59 per cent.  That is a staggering fact and figure.  From my present post in labour affairs I contrast that figure from 1986-1992 with those in other countries. Unit wage costs measure both the tendency for wages to rise and, in addition, increasing efficiency, productivity and other improvements.  On a measure of unit wage costs Ireland has made the most startling improvement in competitiveness since 1986.  Ours actually decreased by 26 per cent between 1986 and 1992 compared with increases of 16 per cent in Germany, 6 per cent in France but 26 per cent in the UK.  Those two measures of competitiveness tend to be reflected in another measure of how a nation is performing internally that is the level of its prices, or its inflation. Between 1986 and 1992 our consumer prices increased by 21 per cent.  This performance has to be compared with 21 per cent in France, 15 per cent in Germany but again 45 per cent in the UK.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there had been a fundamental adjustment in the Irish economy, in fact a fundamental divergence from the United Kingdom trend.  The performance here was in line with what France and Germany had been able to attain.  Indeed, as I have shown, we did better in some respects.  We constantly do ourselves down as a nation and say we do not quite measure up in this respect or that respect. We do not give ourselves credit for much of our competitiveness or our standards raised.  The facts I have shown have been quite startling.  We are not saying it was any Government or Parliament that did it.  It was the citizens who did it.  We all did our bit.  We worked to transform our economic systems and we worked well, because we did manage to make our economy perform better.  I hope that no one will minimise the role which our ERM membership played in that effort. We did well because we had a standard to maintain; there was a yardstick, a benchmark.  The benchmark was not the UK, it was the DM, the FF and the other <Col N="1175" /> foreign currencies.  We had to achieve better economic performance and we did.  It showed up as greater competitiveness and better exports.</P>
    <P>Of course, there were winners and losers as a result of sterling devaluation. The process of adaptation to that devaluation involved evening out the gains and losses between the winners &mdash; who were basically importers of sterling goods and services &mdash; and the losers &mdash; basically those who sold for sterling or against sterling competition.  But, there was more gain than loss.  That is evident and can be measured by the excess of £500 million of our sterling imports over our exports sold for sterling.  The adjustment of the economy to the devaluation of sterling required time.  It required mechanisms like the Market Development Fund that was assisting that type of adaptation in firms that lost out from the change.  That adjustment was taking place and still is.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Treacy, spoke about the Market Development Fund.  I had intended to speak on it, so I will not read it into the record again.  Suffice to say that when I introduced it in the House in October it received a welcome from all sides of the House.  I left that area of responsibility knowing that the very firm policy, that market devaluation, was well received, well executed and administered and very well delivered and the firms who got in touch with the group running it found it most valuable.  They found the administration of it a most valuable exercise.</P>
    <P>Our currency is still a strong currency even after the recent ERM adjustment. That 10 per cent devaluation of our currency in the ERM may tend to put pressure on prices but policy can and must take care of that.  There must be no sense of easing the sort of disciplines that managed to keep us competitive.</P>
    <P>It was always envisaged that in the movement towards full European Monetary Union, which must still be our goal, countries would make the structural adjustments to ensure that their cost structures and general efficiency levels <Col N="1176" /> were appropriate.  Ours were appropriate. As I have said our economy had made the adjustments.  As a result a devaluation to go down part of the way with sterling was not called for until the interest rate shocks of two weeks ago. But the discipline needed now is even more critical.  It is critical because we must revert to being competitive on quality, on standards and on moderate cost growth, rather than following the low price strategies that following a devaluation course tends to inculcate.  Low price strategies are for low quality commodity markets.  We want to steer a course into higher quality, higher value markets, with prospects of higher margins.</P>
    <P>That means that we must push forward with extra vigour to address the sort of structural impediments in our economy and country that militate against winning market share in the prime and affluent markets in Europe and elsewhere.  It will not be enough to go with the same products or to sell them in the same old way.</P>
    <P>We have been deft entrepreneurs when it came to finding out new and better products abroad that could be imported and sold here.  We need to be at least as enterprising in finding out new and better products and services that we can make and supply to markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Transaction costs for our trade, such as our ports, our telephone costs, must be got into line.  We cannot go on with our past, easy tolerance of costs here that are higher than those faced by our competitors in other EC countries.  We have been too easy about accepting a facile argument; an argument that because our distribution system is different, we must accept higher costs.  It will not do; it never should have done and it certainly will not do for the future.</P>
    <P>Utilities, public services, the ports must develop a marked-led approach. The tariff or imposition on business must be in line with norms elsewhere, with best practice elsewhere.  Efficiency levels must be at least as good here as in the best comparator.  Prices, charges and impositions here, higher than those in competitor ERM countries, must be brought down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Take our ports, for example.  The objective must be to get those ports like Dublin where port charges were several times those in Northern Ireland or in Waterford, to be become as competitive as the most competitive.  We need to force greater competitiveness out of all our systems.</P>
    <P>We must look at training.  The capability level of a country's workforce is the key to its competitiveness.  It is the determinant of what it can do.  In Germany and Denmark where training and education for work are best developed, the quality, value and range of output tends to be highest.  Countries that devote less attention to training and to the preparation of their workforce tend to have lower productivity, lower value, lower margins.  It is not by accident that Belgian patés are available in all our EC markets: Belgian meat factories have workers who got training in meat preparation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we are moving towards a better, more broadly-based apprenticeship and training system.  Standards of attainment in training and education will be critical.  We must seek to achieve best practice here rather than anything lower.  This is important because what those at work are capable of doing constitutes the real underpinning of competitiveness.  It is the fundamental constraint of the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo; because it is that capability level which determines how, what and how well we can produce.  The capability levels of those at work are important determinants of competitiveness.  A well trained, well educated, thoroughly capable and versatile workforce in an economy that has got its costs in order is a basis for prosperity.  Of course, investment is needed to set it in train.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that the savings within the Irish economy, plus investments in Ireland from overseas, could set far more people to work if invested in productive assets here.</P>
    <P>The prospects of a good or a secure return on investment is not helped by a threat of fluctuation in exchange rates or by a risk of further devaluation.  That is <Col N="1178" /> why idle chatter about the possibility of alternative scenarios involving a stance, other than a firm currency one, can damage our prospects of attracting Irish or overseas productive investment.  We must not even postulate a variable exchange policy or a link with sterling. Instead, we must move towards removing the excess transaction cost that trading in different national currencies imposes. Our interests as a trading nation are best served by moving sooner, rather than later, to a single currency for Europe.</P>
    <P>The best result of this debate for Ireland's interest would be to confirm the approach we have taken in the past of wishing to make European Monetary Union a reality.  It is in our interest that as soon as possible the concerted movement towards this objective is put back on the rails.  The last six months have been a bad dream for Europe, and indeed, difficult for Ireland.</P>
    <P>This House, this country, this Government have a role to play in helping the constructive forces in Europe to get the momentum behind the grand design of European Union.  We have seen the destructive, the critical, the cynical forces do their worst.  They are not in our interest and we must not help them by joining in their destructive speculations.</P>

      <P>This debate should have taken place long before now. Indeed, it is farcical that the Dáil was not recalled earlier to discuss a crisis of such magnitude.  It demonstrates how irrelevant this House is in the eyes of the Government.  When the British and Italians withdrew from the ERM and the Spanish and Portugeese devalued their currencies the signals were clear for the Government to act and they did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate appreciation of the Irish pound resulted in a loss of competitiveness of our exports especially in <Col N="1179" /> the UK market which still accounts for over 30 per cent of our exports.  The currency crisis, as was pointed out here today, also resulted in higher interest rates resulting in a devastating increase in house mortgate for many families and penal increases in bank interest for industrialists, business people, farmers and, indeed, for people in all sections of our community.  The real effects of the crisis are only emerging now.  We hear daily reports of business closures, factories shedding large numbers of their work force et cetera.  If the Government had acted in time and carried out corrective measures it would have minimised the devastating effects of the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government refused to recall the Dáil to allow full and wide ranging debate on the crisis meant that a very one-sided argument was being put forward to the public.  The Government continuously stressed the high cost of devaluation.  It was made into an issue of national pride, a war between the financial speculators and the Minister for Finance.  While the Government were indulging in this lunacy and pursuing a totally inflexible line, they squandered our external reserves of somewhere in the region of £3 billion; they contributed to the loss of a considerable number of jobs by making it impossible for many businesses and manufacturing industries to sustain their workforce at the 1992 levels and inflicted major hardship on already hard-pressed mortgage holders and, indeed, the cynicism displayed by a number of the Government Ministers especially following the devaluation announcement was indeed despicable.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Spring and Ahern accused the Fine Gale Leader, John Bruton, of forcing them to devalue following a statement he made criticising, and rightly so, the Government's handling of the crisis.  Indeed, they looked for scapegoats elsewhere including the EC, the Bundesbank, the German Parliament, the British and the speculators. The simple fact is that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance did not grasp the opportunity presented to them on 21 <Col N="1180" /> November of being involved in a realignment with the Spanish and Portugeese. By failing to do so they left the punt open to wholesale speculation.  The blame rests on their own ineptitude to deal with the crisis at that time.  I would like to quote here from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 7 February 1993 from and article by Paul Tansey which sums it all up:</P>
    <P>The conduct of economic policy in Ireland over the past six months has been an unmitigated disaster.  The combination of political ineptitude, policy paralysis, the suppression of free debate and the bad judgments produced the humiliation of last weekend's enforced and ignominious devaluation of the Irish Pound.</P>
    <P>It poses the question which many people are asking at the moment, has the Cabinet the capacity and the expertise and, indeed, the experience to tackle the continuing currency crisis or, indeed, any crisis of similar magnitude in the future. Time will certainly tell but from the experience of the handling of this crisis I certainly doubt it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I can deal with the currency crisis as I perceive it &mdash; being a Border Deputy faced with this for the last 12 years &mdash; in the minutes allocated to me but I will attempt to do so.  Fianna Fáil are guilty of having made Irish money foreign currency in Ireland when we joined the EMS in 1979 and grouped with sterling making sterling foreign currency here.  Nothing wrong with that in the eyes of the nationalistic first class republicans in Fianna Fáil but what they failed to see is that Irish money is foreign currency in six north-eastern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if you could get a parallel with that in any democratic country throughout the world, that native currency is foreign currency in that land.  Fianna Fáil do not realise the blindless of talking economic independence without referring in any way to our relationship with Northern Ireland or Britain because Northern Ireland as we know it is <i>de facto</i> part of Britain although we do not accept <Col N="1181" /> that and we try to alter that.  But, <i>de facto</i>, economically, it is the same economic unit as Britain.  Fianna Fáil when they start talking about economics deal as independents, blind to the relationship we have with Northern Ireland and ten minutes later in a separate committee room in a separate speech they talk about political co-operation.  How can you have political co-operation and political unity in the island of Ireland if you do not strive to get economic unity?  It is not possible; it is a total contradiction.  It is not normal or natural for any country in the world that is trying to unite with a neighbour or to have unity within itself.</P>
    <P>I want to get this message across to the Fianna Fáil Party: until Fianna Fáil realise that when the price of butter, or a gallon of petrol, a motor car, bread and everything else is the same on both sides of the Border then and only then can you talk seriously about political unity.  While we are saying that economically we will act independently and while we condemn violence and promise to do everything in our power to secure peaceful solutions, we will not coerce, we will do everything in our power to stop the violence in Northern Ireland, by not realising that we must have economic unity before political unity and by not doing anything about it, we are contributing to the <i>status quo</i> and the <i>status quo</i>, as far as I am concerned, means murder and violence in the North of Ireland.  I am emotionally against that.  That is total anathema to everything I think about in politics, I cannot understand how experienced politicians serving years in Government cannot grasp this fundamental issue that separates both sides of our community.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Finance, the day after he broke with sterling, talking about our being too tied to the British market and that was what was causing us problems, sterling, that if we moved away from the British market we would not have to be so dependent on sterling.  Does that mean that we move away from Northern Ireland as well?  No, no.  The Minister for Finance never thought of that.</P>
    <P>The following night the Taoiseach <Col N="1182" /> addressed Cáirde Fáil in Dublin and told his audience oh, yes &mdash; with his republican cap on him &mdash; that we should not be dependent on the British economy indefinitely, but towards the end of his speech he went on to say that he is going to strive with everything in his command, every power that he has, to bring about peace and unity in this island.  There are two examples of total blindness on the part of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  I want to say that if we are serious about trying to bring about peace and normality on the island of Ireland we must look at first, the economics involved.  When the question of whether they will be better off or worse off if they join a united Ireland is no longer an issue in the minds of the protestant people of Northern Ireland, we can talk about the politics which separate us.  However, we cannot talk about the politics which separate us as long as people in Belfast, Derry, Newry or elsewhere in the North of Ireland, who are not inclined to listen to us at the moment, say they might not be better off south of the Border and therefore the devil they know is better than the one they do not know.</P>
    <P>The currency crisis started when we broke with sterling and that crisis will continue until, as equal partners in the European Community, we negotiate a new agreement with Great Britain on stability of currency.  That is fundamental. We do not have to go back on our knees to Britain to have an equality or stability of currency with them.  As equal partners in Europe we must recognise that our two countries are interdependent economically and we must work out a solution to the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>The currency crisis we have experienced stems from our break with sterling. On the three occasions on which we devalued, this was done not because of our currency differences in Europe or because we were trading with Europe, but because it was costing us too much to trade with Great Britain.  Deputy John Bruton devalued and Deputy Alan Dukes devalued.  The difference between the devaluations by Deputy Bruton and <Col N="1183" /> Deputy Dukes, as Minister for Finance, and this Minister's devaluation is that they did it before the damage was done. I remember having a conversation with the Taoiseach at the time, the then Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  He knew my feelings on the difference of value between sterling and the punt and he explained to me that if we waited too long we would be creating a situation of which speculators would take advantage. What did this Government do?  They waited and waited and waited again, week after week after week, for five months and then blamed the speculators for taking advantage of the position which they themselves had built for them.</P>
    <P>I do not know how blind a Government can be, but they created the situation for the speculators.  I know it was like having a choice between being hanged or shot when it came to devaluing.  I said privately to the Taoiseach before Christmas that at the end of the day he would have to devalue.  However reluctant we might be and though it might be anathema to us, it was the only safe choice.  Industry, the farmers, the tourist trade and the business people along the Border were telling us we had to devalue.  Everybody was telling us we had to devalue, except the economists in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance. I do not blame them; I blame the political heads for taking this chance. What were we doing?  We were behaving as empty pocket swanks, on the fast track in Europe, making people believe that we had more money than we have, talking about the strength of our economy, living up with the Jones'.  But who was paying the price?  The factories exporting to Britain and the people who have lost their jobs are paying the price.  I hope that, when this has been sorted out in the next few weeks, the workers whom the unions called to vote for the Labour Party will recognise that by going into Government the Labour Party have been forced to swallow the monetarist politics of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>To hear the Taoiseach talk about the strength of the currency and how we could battle against the falling value of sterling made me ask myself if he was in wonderland.  He is in wonderland. He is wondering how long he can go on.  He is wondering how long it will be until he has to devalue.  He is wondering how many factories are going to close before the crisis is over.  He is wondering how long the Labour Party will continue to back him.  The Labour Party is also in wonderland, wondering for how long their supporters will continue to support them while they swallow the monetarist politics of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>To listen to the Minister for Finance telling us we should almost abandon our markets with Britain so that we would not be dependent on sterling indicates a blindness I fail to understand.  I live along the Border and I have said many times in this House.  A party which follows policies which interfere with the normal natural trading between neighbours on both sides of the Border is not following policies conducive to Irish unity.  This Government is guilty of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government has always been guilty of this.  I have tried to emphasise this time and time again, but apparently no one listens.  We have hard economic and monetarist theories put forward here today.  I have listened to them in the House or in my office, but the key to our problem lies with sterling. The prospects for the future value of our currency depends on sterling.  You can say what you like about returning to sterling, <Col N="1185" /> but if sterling devalues again or weakens again we will have to devalue again, and if sterling weakens further we will have to devalue further.</P>
    <P>I heard it said in my party, after we broke with sterling and had to devalue, that whatever about having an association with sterling or being part of sterling, we would have to have control over our currency.  That is a very strong argument, but do we have control of our currency?  Whenever sterling weakens we go with them; whenever sterling strengthens we are in trouble.  During the transition period between weakness and strength our industries go through economic convulsions, not knowing what is happening, and our financiers do not know what is happening.</P>
    <P>One hundred and seventy years ago Grattan negotiated parity with Britain.  It lasted for 150 years.  Grattan argued that there were three or four basic positions for Ireland to obtain in relation to Great Britain &mdash; economic co-operation or union, as in what we now call the Common Market; political separation, common currency and one other. Common currency is the main one and that which lasts longest.  We have to get back to common currency or we will be in trouble.  It was done by Grattan 160 or so years ago and it must be done again.</P>
    <P>Having spent many years in this House and having experienced the difficulties in Border areas that many people south of the Border do not know exist, where currencies fluctuate and where businesses from one day to another are being threatened, where business people are not too sure what next week will be like, I have come to the conclusion that we must look afresh at our relationship with sterling.  If we have a stable relationship with sterling we will not have the economic convulsions which have destroyed our businesses over the last four or five months and which have threatened us since we broke with sterling.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte spoke glowingly of the link with sterling and the economic and monetary union we had with sterling from 1800-1979, but I believe that those of us acquainted with history do not look back on that as a glorious period in Ireland's economic history and it did not do great things for Ireland's economic development. Senator Joe Lee, in his book on Ireland since independence, has charted how we slavishly followed British economic policy.  We were in effective economic union with Britain for much of the period since independence.  We were tied to that country and while its people may have spoken the same language as we did, that was not the language of economic growth and development and economic innovation over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>By tying our economy in the past to that of Britain, which was not the most forward looking, progressive and growth economy, we were not achieving a great deal in terms of our potential economic growth.  I would hope that out of the difficult experiences of the last number of months we do not take it as a lesson that we should re-hitch ourselves to the sick man of Europe in terms of economic policy.  We must realise the reason that the currency markets have been in turmoil since Black Monday in September 1992 has been because Britain's economic policy has been in free fall, sterling has been up and <Col N="1187" /> down like a yo-yo, and generally down on the foreign exchanges.</P>
      <P>That has caused difficulties for us because 30 per cent of our trade is with Britain.  We must also realise that 70 per cent of our trade is with non-British markets. We face the economic choice of hitching our star to a market of 60 million people which is in decline, and which at the moment shows no clear economic policy, or a growing market of 350 million people.  We need to adopt our own psychological, cultural and economic thinking to markets which, while they may not be conducted in the same language, are where our economic future will lie, the markets in Europe.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problems underlying the currency crisis have been the lack of a UK economic policy and the continuing high German interest rates, as Germany sought to fund its economic and monetary union with East Germany through high interest rates rather than through a tax regime.  We have been the victims of that.</P>
      <P>A very fundamental problem also arises in relation to the whole planned transition to economic and monetary union.  The Delors report envisaged a progressive tightening of convergence which would occur to the point where the final stage of economic and monetary union would take place with hardly any noticeable change in expectations.  European currencies would gradually move to a point where there would be an almost imperceptible move to a single currency. It is quite clear that has not happened and is not going to happen.  As we approach monetary union there will be a temptation for speculators to take a one way bet on the difficult currencies in the system.  The lesson we have learned from our experience over the last five months is that we need to step up our diplomatic offensive and our efforts to ensure that the transition to economic and monetary union in Europe takes place sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Britain is not ready for that, let us go ahead without Britain.  Otherwise we run the risk of economic union, we have <Col N="1188" /> virtual unity in capital markets, particularly from the freeing of the capital markets from 1 January 1993 and there cannot be economic union and monetary divergence, it simply does not work.  It is absolutely essential that we would step up our diplomatic efforts and work flat out within Europe to ensure that we begin to achieve that kind of commitment to economic union.</P>
    <P>When Britain held the Presidency of the EC, there was no particular commitment to tackle the monetary problems. The Danes have had a change of Government and they have had their own problems.  Only late in the day, with the Danes finding in the Presidency that their own currency is under attack, there is a belated realisation in the Councils in Europe that we need to move hard on the monetary issue.  We need to accelerate the steps to be taken towards monetary union if we are not to offer hostages to fortune in terms of a very long planned run into 1999 for monetary union.  We should aim towards monetary union over the next year.</P>
    <P>In the historic experience of other countries in introducing a single currency the adoption of a new currency, where it has been successful, has generally been a fairly rapid transition rather than this long, gradual transition.  Indeed, if one were to wait for the Delors convergence, it might not come.  We should give much more active consideration to a fast track approach to European Monetary Union and to maintaining Ireland's position in the narrow band of the currency and in the fast track towards a single currency.</P>
    <P>We are a trading nation.  We export 70 per cent of our products.  We import 60 per cent of our consumer goods.  We have a greater interest than other countries in having a single European currency because of the stability that offers for trade and because of cutting down on the whole transaction costs of moving goods around and moving into different currencies.</P>
    <P>Because we have such an open economy we have that very strong vested interest in moving to a single currency. The fact that so much of our gross <Col N="1189" /> national product is made up of foreign flows in or out of balances of money and of trade, it is very easy not for anonymous speculators, but for ordinary Irish business, through timing of their payments in sterling or through timing of the movement of their goods, through leads and lags, to shift around quite a lot of money and to add to and exacerbate speculative pressures on the Irish currency.</P>
    <P>Those speculative pressures have not been helped in the past by the fact that economists and the different economic interests were very much divided at home on the merits of whether we went for a total hard currency policy, resisting devaluations, or looked at the merits of devaluation.  There are lessons to be learned from the experience of the last number of months and we must take appropriate action at European level to put monetary policy centre stage to ensure that we achieve a stable exchange rate.</P>
    <P>Out of that stable exchange rate we can expect lower interest rates.  That is the absolute key issue in terms of economic development.  If business people can leave their money in the bank and earn a real return of 15 per cent, why are they going to go out and invest in a risky venture?  It is absolutely important for economic growth here that we get interest rates down.  They have come down very significantly from the speculative level they reached during the currency crisis and the run up to devaluation. Two weeks ago we were seeing interest rates of the order of 40 per cent.  Now we have the key one month rate down to 15 per cent and the threat to mortgage rates has eased.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that we continue our pressure to tackle the fundamental problems that lie in the European Monetary System and to ensure that sooner rather than later we move to that particular economic convergence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Government was right in the decision it took last Saturday week.  In reality, we had no other choice.  Had we continued the <Col N="1190" />&ldquo;no devaluation&rdquo; line, we would have suffered untold damage to our economy with all that that would entail in terms of job losses and potential house repossessions. When mortgage rates reached 18 per cent or higher, as they did in the case of Irish Life Home Loans, and long established companies, such as Cadbury's in my own constituency, started to let people go, the Government had no choice but to act.  In my view there were two major elements which ultimately made devaluation inevitable.  First, the collapse of sterling and, second, the overwhelming might of speculative pressure. Neither factor has gone away.  We would do well to give some thought as to how we might act in the future.</P>
      <P>Whatever we believed, or wanted to believe, two weeks ago it is now painfully clear that the IR£ cannot sustain a significant revaluation against sterling. There are simply too many companies too close to the edge, too much of our trade is denominated in sterling.  Despite all the progress of the last two decades we still export over a third of all our exports to Britain and the sterling area. That being so, we simply cannot live with a 15 or 20 per cent differential between the British currency and ours.  Returning to a point made by Deputy Harte earlier, if we swallow the British currency inevitably we have to swallow the monetary policy of the British Conservative Government, something which I would certainly not be prepared to advocate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reflect for a few moments on Economic and Monetary Union.  I supported the Maastricht Treaty and I still support Economic and Monetary Union.  I am committed to European Union and I hope it can be achieved sooner rather than later.  European Union means a great deal more than Economic and Monetary Union and particularly European Monetary Union as it is usually defined and understood in this country.  It is a remarkable fact that <Col N="1191" /> four of our Community partners met what is loosely called the Maastricht convergence criteria in 1990.  In 1993 it is unlikely that any of the 12 member states will meet the criteria.  Even countries such as Belgium and Germany, so called core economies, have levels of borrowings higher than ours.  Countries like Italy are so far from obtaining the criteria that it is scarcely realistic to expect that they would be in the first batch in the single currency in 1997.</P>
    <P>In this context it is unrealistic and unwise to take money out of the economy in this time of recession.  Certainly, it is possible to improve efficiency and to cut out waste.  However, it would be wrong to cut essential services, or sacrifice jobs which would otherwise be sustainable, simply to stay within the Maastricht criteria. Those criteria have not been handed down on tablets of stone from some economic guru in the skies.  They are being ignored daily by all our Community partners.  It would be a profound mistake for us to engage in an accelerated programme of cuts simply in order to participate in the first phase of the single currency in 1997.</P>
    <P>The events of last week have shown, ultimately and painfully, that our richer partners are not too bothered whether we make it into the core club in 1997 or not.  Economic fundamentals notwithstanding we are clearly considered as part of the second tier.  This is hardly surprising since our most successful diplomatic effort of recent years was to persuade our partners that we were underdeveloped and needed help.</P>
    <P>I am not of course suggesting large scale borrowing.  I am certainly not suggesting a return to the profligacy of 1977 and thereafter, nor am I suggesting that we abandon the Maastricht criteria altogether. I am saying that we should invest prudently for economic growth and social stability and treat the Maastricht criteria as a medium term benchmark.</P>
    <P>I have read the Maastricht Treaty and I am not at all clear as to how these criteria are meant to be interpreted.  The Treaty requires that the budgetary policies <Col N="1192" /> of the participating countries converge between now and 1997.  This convergence is to be judged on the basis of the criteria as set out.  It is certainly not clear that we must meet the 3 per cent ceiling on Exchequer borrowing in each of the intervening years.  This could hardly be the case since none of the 12 member states could possibly meet that stringent requirement.  We should join our partners in taking a flexible and sensible approach to the Maastricht criteria. If we make it into the core club in four years time, well and good, but we should not take undue risks with jobs and living standards in the meantime.  Any further substantial loss in jobs and living standards will render us unable to partake in monetary union anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate my colleague, Deputy McDowell, on his maiden speech in this Chamber.  This is actually my second.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the history of the EMS, it seems a long time since Roy Jenkins, as President of the Commission, pointed us in the direction of Economic and Monetary Union, which at the time we thought was going to take four or five years.  It took until 1987 for any appreciable benefits to accrue to us.  The events of the past two years, the way in which the British Government joined the ERM &mdash; perhaps too late and on the wrong conditions &mdash; the enormous historic change in Eastern Europe, and in particular the incorporation so speedily, and against all the traditions of the EC, of East Germany, a major state of 20 million people into the EC, all these factors produced the climate which has been so hard to manage since September.  With hindsight it is easy to be critical of our Central Bank and also of the famous mandarins in the Department of Finance; but, conditions since September have been fairly unique and we have found ourselves faced with the emergence of a totally different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleagues on the other side of the House, I also felt that the Government's decision to devalue within the narrow band was correct, for the reasons <Col N="1193" /> that have been outlined by other speakers. It became particularly difficult for us to carry on this policy because of the unsustainable level of interest rates and the fact that at least one sixth of our exports go directly to the British market. These were deeply affected by the strength of our currency so that, in effect, up to a few weeks ago, we were putting an 18 per cent tax on those exports to Britain.</P>
    <P>On the second part of the motion, I would like to see that in the reform of the ERM a major priority would be the protection of jobs.  When you look at the way in which the Nordic countries in particular &mdash; other small, peripheral, perhaps open economies &mdash; have managed their currency situations, it is fair to say that they have always placed foremost what they see as their central fundamental interests, and particularly jobs.  Finland, which has a current unemployment rate worse than ours, and other Nordic countries have followed that type of development.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there was concern about job losses in Cadbury's.  It looked at one stage as if one quarter of the workforce of one of the biggest factories in Dublin would be devastated unless we made adjustments and looked for reform of the system as it now exists. There was also another major closure in Dublin North-East, that of a clothing company which is moving to Eastern Europe and which seems to be saying that labour costs in the very hard currency situation are difficult to sustain.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by speakers on the other side of the House to the situation in Britain.  It was a great tragedy, we all acknowledge, that the Labour Party, our sister party in Britain, did not make it back to power last April.  If they had won the election it would have led to fundamental changes in their fiscal exchange rates and indeed other management. As the situation emerged, however, it presented us with a very difficult climate.  The one thing that stays in my mind from Black Wednesday is the sight of 22 year old money managers moving perhaps £60 million worth of currency <Col N="1194" /> a day around the exchange and perhaps the equivalent of Britain's GNP flowing through it.  In recent weeks we have had the spectacle of a candidate for the Seanad from an Opposition party making the case, on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, that there was no speculation involved in the last couple of months in relation to our currency.  That was a very naïve judgement.  I fully support the position Deputies in Democratic Left may be taking in asking for some movement, through our Ministers, from ECOFIN to have an EC-wide regime of taxation on pure currency speculation as we move into the interim period.</P>
    <P>I fully support the second part of the motion.  Through the Council of Finance Ministers we should immediately try to embark on a programme which will bring the Economic and Monetary Institute, which starts next year, into full working order as soon as possible.  I support the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance in that regard. We have a choice of either having our interest rates and our monetary and economic policy determined by a non-elected, undemocratic out-of-control Bundesbank, run by Helmut Schlesinger, or in the next three years on the road to monetary union, of developing democratic institutions through ECOFIN, through the Council of Ministers and with a European Monetary Institute with real teeth.  That must be the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I support the motion but, like my colleague, I have some reservations regarding the third part of it.  With a projected growth rate of less than 2 per cent this year, I do not feel we should engage in any more deflationary policies but we should concentrate on reforming the exchange rate and working with similarly interested countries, such as Spain, which, under Felipe Gonzalez, the Labour Party Prime Minister, did so brilliantly in helping to get so much structural funding for the peripheral regions for the next few years.</P>

      <P>I congratulate new Members of the House on their interesting speeches and I wish them many long happy and fruitful days here.  Noticeably there was no reference in any of the speeches from the other side of the House to the question of confidence, the most important factor in financial markets or in any business.  We had to devalue for a number of reasons but the first of these was a lack of confidence.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the lead up to the situation. Many people mentioned September as the starting date for the sudden slide.  That was not the case.  The first rumblings were felt around the time of the Danish decision on Maastricht when a question mark was placed as to whether European integration was to continue at the same pace as previously envisaged. Another factor, too, has been left out of the argument.  We have heard about economic and monetary union, but nothing has been said about political commitment, and that is the other important factor.  Without the political commitment to European union and European monetary union, there will not be integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next in the sequence of events was a long discussion in France in relation to Maastricht, a discussion that did nothing in terms of confidence in a single unit of currency.  Subsequently, among our neighbours in the UK there was debate in the House of Commons on the whole question as to whether the British were fully committed to European union. Then there were the undignified exchanges across Europe relating to the <Col N="1196" /> Bundesbank and the German Chancellor, as to who was right and who was wrong and to the direction in which we were going.  All of that seriously undermined public confidence and the confidence of the markets in what was happening in Europe.  That is generally accepted now but it is too late.  All of what happened should have been foreseen and the Government should have recognised very early in the day that there was likely to be a slide at some later stage.  Instead of taking steps to deal with the situation they decided to call a general election. That had the effect of confidence in the economy being eroded seriously.  There followed protracted debates about who was going to form a Government.  That delay did not help to restore confidence. There was nothing to reassure markets. Eventually we had a Government.  Then, 6 p.m. on the day devaluation occurred one senior Government Minister spoke on the TV news and said there would be no devaluation.  Two hours later, another senior Government Minister, the Minister for Finance, announced devaluation. What did that do for confidence?  What must the international markets have thought of us?  They can only come to the conclusion that our Government does not know where it is going, with whom it is going or what direction it intends to take.</P>
    <P>Speculators are easy targets.  I do not have friends who are in that area.  If I had I might not be here but I want to point out that the proposal to resolve the problem by way of introducing penalties to discourage speculation will also have a peculiar effect on confidence in the currencies of the countries that introduce it. Members on the other side of the House have not recognised that yet.  When such penalties were introduced in other countries they did not have the impact people on the other side of the House would like to pretend they had.  The introduction of such penalties creates a doubt about the value of the currency or about confidence in that currency and, consequently, creates a serious problem.</P>
    <P>What degree of commitment is there in Europe now to a single currency?  What commitment is there to the total integration <Col N="1197" /> of Europe as was envisaged three or four years ago?  If that integration does not come about the problem will recur. Early in the campaign the Government should have gone to our European colleagues, impressed on them the seriousness of the situation, and implored them to take action which would clearly indicate to the financial markets worldwide that Europe was serious about its intentions, and intended to proceed towards integration.</P>
    <P>In the heat of the crisis Ministers went over to Europe, met the Bundesbank people, met Helmut Kohl and came home and reiterated that they were not going to devalue and had the approval of their colleagues in Europe in that regard. But there was no backup.  No means were put forward whereby they could have avoided devaluation.  All they said was that there would be no devaluation.  That was analogous to a first division goalkeeper going out to play a match and saying there would be no goal scored against him while secretly, he was nursing a hamstring injury.  Sadly, that is the way the Government has behaved.</P>
    <P>What worries me most is how this Government is going to respond to a similar situation which is sure to unfold in the future unless the political problems relating to European integration are addressed quickly.  The actions of speculators, those who express their confidence in currencies by way of speculation, will be determined by the confidence, according to their markets, in a particular currency at a particular time.  As long as two, three or four countries in Europe go their own way, or divert from the main course, there will always be a threat of a currency crisis.  I would ask the Minister to get his act together the next time to respond quickly, not to mislead us, not to allow business go to the wall and not to allow mortgage holders to be placed in fear of losing their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that I am winding up for the Opposition at this stage, being the final speaker from this side of the House.  I will attempt to put <Col N="1198" /> together a few thoughts arising out of the debate.</P>
      <P>It is very clear at this stage that three people bear the political responsibility for what began as a currency crisis and ended as a devaluation débâcle.  I refer to the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance who presided over a foolish and misguided policy from September last and who were joined at a later stage by the Tánaiste.  The Tánaiste has ample opportunity to bring a fresh and objective view to bear but immediately on going into office, he lost no time in committing himself and his party 100 per cent to support for a continuation of the political madness which was based on a totally misguided assumption that hard nosed currency merchants could be taken in by strong talk which was not underpinned by strong action.  That was the essential mistake made by Irish Governments since last September.  What is now clear is that the inevitable consequence of that approach was devaluation.  It was only a question of when.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused by the effort at one stage to blame my colleague and party leader Deputy John Bruton for the devaluation.  I have never heard such nonsense in my life.  It reminded me of the blame being cast on the chap in the crowd, who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes, and actually being blamed for the fact that he had no clothes.  We had members of the Government believing their own foolish rhetoric. We had the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, like King Canute thinking that strong words were going to keep back the tide.  Then, at the time when he was making some contribution to the debate, presiding over it all was the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, the emperor without any clothes.  He was making the same strong noises but he was not putting into effect the necessary policy measures which would underpin those strong words and which would convince those who deal in currency that we were serious and meant what we said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I was in the House for the Minister for Finance's speech.  He did not even have the good grace to apologise <Col N="1199" /> to those who have lost their jobs or who have gone out of business or who have been put out of their family homes as a result in his misjudgment and the misjudgment of his colleagues.  What is now very clear is that the same Minister for Finance was totally unprepared for dealing with the currency crisis when it erupted last September.  He said it was not as sudden or as unexpected as it may have seemed at the time.  Furthermore, he now admits that it had been abundantly clear for a considerable time that there were serious tensions in the system that called for urgent action.  In that context, I cannot quite understand the contradiction in his own speech where he, or whoever drafted the speech, tells us, that it was not as sudden and unexpected as it may have seemed at the time, but yet it came as a huge shock when it did come. It seems to be as contradictory as the other actions of the same Minister in recent times.  The question has to be asked, why were the Minister for Finance and the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government led by the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, not prepared for the crisis when it erupted?  That is just one of the many questions that have not been addressed by the Government in their attempt to justify what has been an appalling period of mismanagement as far as the economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are other questions to which satisfactory answers have not been given. Whatever about September and I accept that at the time they had two ways to go, they decided to go one way and in hindsight they probably should not have done so, but that is the case.  But, why did we not devalue in November?  On 21 November there was an ideal opportunity. We could have been spared a lot of the agony and the hardship resulting from the failed battle to defend the value of the £IR.  Was it because an attempt had been made during the election campaign to make political capital by way of criticism of John Bruton for the decision made by him in 1986, when he was Minister for Finance, when he acted decisively and devalued quickly when faced with a <Col N="1200" /> similar crisis at that time?  Was that the reason why the then Fianna Fáil Government refused to act, when perhaps their advisers may have been telling them to act?  I do not know, I can only say that it was rather ironic that one of the main criticisms they had of my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of the Opposition, was that he devalued in 1986.  Is it not a bit of a sick joke now?</P>
    <P>Another question has not been answered.  We have not been given any figure for the additional cost of the foreign borrowing which occurred since last September.  What is this figure?  There are costs involved from the point of view of the Exchequer, there are costs involved from the point of view of the Central Bank.  Do not tell me that is not a cost to the taxpayer, any surplus to the Central Bank goes into the Exchequer. There is also the famous national debt management agency which, of course, is another arm of the Exchequer.  Hundreds of millions of pounds of additional money were borrowed in Deutsche Marks, in particular, in the failed battle to defend the £IR and that will cost much more to repay now.  What is that cost?</P>
    <P>The next question that has not been addressed arises from the fact that exchange controls were not reintroduced in January.  Surely if the Government were serious about the absolute necessity of not devaluing they should have used that instrument.  Why was it not done?  I appreciate that exchange controls went out of business, as it were, on 31 December but there was and is a facility to reintroduce them on a temporary basis. Why was it not done?</P>
    <P>Another question which has not been fully addressed is why the Government failed to convince the other member states of the Community, after five months of pleading, to come to their support. It is openly admitted that the French were able to get special concessions from the Germans.  Is it that the Irish Government has so little clout on the European stage that they were unable to obtain the relatively small amount of support that would have been necessary to underpin their policy?  No explanation <Col N="1201" /> has been given for that political and diplomatic failure on the European stage.</P>
    <P>Even yet the Government has failed to appreciate fully the enormity of the damage that has been inflicted on the country.  Many jobs have been lost and, quite frankly, will never be retrieved.  I am particularly interested in the tourism industry but it has not been referred to in this debate so far to any great extent. This is the time of the year when bookings would have been made.  Many bookings have been lost, huge damage has been inflicted on our tourism industry and, even worse, I am told that there has been an enormous increase in the past two or three months in the number of summer holidays booked abroad by Irish people who would otherwise have been holidaying at home.  They could not afford to book at home.  That is an aspect that has been overlooked to a great degree in this whole débâcle.</P>
    <P>What confidence can we have in this Government if we are faced with a similar situation in the future?  Already there are indications of further sterling weakness leading to a creeping up of exchange rates and continuing high interest rates.  There is no indication of serious thought on the part of the Government or an examination of the policy options in the event of this trend continuing.  The Minister for Finance states that what ended up as an involuntary devaluation leaves the market in no doubt &ldquo;about the strength of our commitment to maintaining a stable currency&rdquo;. This clearly stands logic on its head because, in fact, what occurred did not happen by free choice, it was an enforced devaluation.  It is absolutely ridiculous for the Minister to be making statements of this kind.  The Minister's statement that there should be no doubt about our exchange rate policy sounds very hollow in the context of earlier statements over the past three or four months which turned out to be totally inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Neither has there been any constructive view offered by the Government as to the desirability of accelerating <Col N="1202" /> the pace towards the single European currency.  It does seem that while we are in a halfway house on the road towards a single currency we are in a very exposed and vulnerable position.  Surely, therefore, since we are already committed to a single currency it is very much in our interest to make every step possible to ensure that this occurs as soon as possible. Again, this is an option that does not appear to have been given serious consideration by the Government or, at least, it has not been pushed by the Government.  Our friend, Peter Sutherland was talking about this in Paris today but where are the statements of Government Ministers on this very issue or, indeed, even indicating that that option has been considered or, indeed, is even feasible?</P>
    <P>My worry, therefore, is that the recent record of bad judgment and misguided policy would be compounded by continuing inability to cope with the currency storm clouds that clearly still lie ahead. There is no point whatever in blaming Europe, or the man in the moon, for our problems.  The responsibility lies with the Government of the day to use good judgement and to apply the best policies to deal with situations such as the currency crisis.  On their record to date I have no confidence whatever in the ability of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance to discharge their responsibility in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The currency crisis began last September when, despite persistent denials from Norman Lamont, sterling left the ERM system and floated against the other currencies.  Speculators began to move against the IR£; interest rates were jacked up to unprecedented levels and the feeling expressed in Government and Civil Service circles was that this was a temporary problem which we would resolve with the support of our European partners.  Sterling continued to fall during the next few months and the situation <Col N="1203" /> deteriorated further at election time in November.  Interest rates were again pushed up to 100 per cent overnight levels by the Central Bank.  At that time also, a realignment of some currencies in the ERM occurred but Ireland abstained on that occasion.</P>
      <P>About that time, certain large Dublin financial institutions and market commentators argued that the IR£ would be devalued, that it was no longer a question of &ldquo;if&rdquo; but &ldquo;when&rdquo;.  The argument was advanced that we could no longer sustain a 10 per cent differential between our currency and sterling at a time when there had been a 22 per cent fall in the exchange rates since September 1992.</P>
      <P>Thirty per cent of our exports go to the United Kingdom.  The figure has fallen from 40 per cent at the time of our entry to the EC.  These exports provide jobs for up to 40 per cent of our manufacturing workforce.  Any loss of sterling earnings or fall in our exports to the United Kingdom would be seen as detrimental for our employment figures.  This was subsequently confirmed two months later.  Manufacturing industry in Ireland was paying exorbitant interest rates for borrowing compared to British manufacturers who were paying considerably lower rates and thus enjoying a considerable competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom is still our most important tourism earner and tourism interests feared a considerable fall-off in UK visitors in 1993 if the exchange rates with sterling remained unfavourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early January, as the new Government was being formed various statements were made.  Despite these statements, speculators continued to descend on the IR£.  Interest rates were pushed up to the 100 per cent overnight levels yet again and, at this stage, leaders of Irish industry and the manufacturers proclaimed that the exchange rate was unsustainable in the medium to longer term.  The growing chorus in Ireland for devaluation was matched by a statement from the ICTU that various financial institutions in Ireland had actively been encouraging the devaluation momentum <Col N="1204" /> and this set yet another debate in train within the media.  Sterling began to fall yet again and finally on Friday of the devaluation weekend leading employers and exporters predicted massive lay-offs and falling exports as a result of our noncompetitiveness with sterling.</P>
    <P>Devaluation was not the preferred option of the Government but it had no choice but to seek this adjustment.  It is important to understand why this devaluation became essential.  The devaluation of several currencies, both within the system and associated with it, in recent months, together with the devaluation and withdrawal of others, in particular sterling, led to a revaluation of the IR£. However, the markets were reluctant to accept this and in turn this forced Irish interest rates upwards, imposing a very heavy burden on Irish businesses and on mortgage holders.  In order to alleviate this burden and prevent further hardship the Government, with the agreement of our EC partners, obtained a 10 per cent devaluation of the IR£ within the exchange rate mechanism.  Despite devaluation however, the IR£ will continue to be one of the core currencies of the ERM in a movement towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Devaluation will help in the short to medium term.  The adjustment in the value of the IR£ will immediately restore the average competitiveness of Irish industry on a trade-weighted basis.  It will improve the position of exporters and those competing with goods produced abroad.  It is also expected that wholesale interest rates will ease back.  This will be sufficient to avoid a general increase in retail interest and mortgage rates which, despite the best efforts of the Government, would have been inevitable if wholesale rates had remained at the very high levels of recent times.  It is preferable to be cautious in expecting retail and mortgage rates to move down quickly to pre-September 1992 levels, but it seems clear that the early reductions in the European interest rates and the improving stability of the ERM will enable Irish interest rates to fall further in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> There has been some criticism of the Government commitment to maintaining the value of the IR£ in recent months.  It is important to defend this policy.  There was a confident expectation among Community member states that stability could be restored quickly by the end of 1992 at the latest.  In the event, this was not achieved.  The adjustment in the value of the IR£ will provide some immediate relief but there will be a cost to the economy that cannot be avoided.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Government is determined to take all the essential steps, through the budget and other policies, to minimise these costs.  To those who say that the Government should have sought the devaluation at an earlier stage, I would say it is quite possible that we would have had to devalue more than once in the last five months.  This would have had a particularly negative impact on the Irish economy.  The Government was right in its judgment and in resisting devaluation for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>There are important lessons to be learned from the devaluation of the IR£. Irish policy cannot be dictated by movements in sterling as this would lead to persistent volatility and increase the risk of inflationary pressures and a permanent premium on interest rates.  The Irish economy must diversify and loosen its dependence on the British market.  Irish business must recognise this as a fact of life and plan for the future on this basis.</P>
    <P>Recent events have also left the ERM at a crossroads.  It is clear that more effective mechanisms for mutual support and multilateral solidarity need to be urgently put in place.  The Government will, hopefully, insist that these issues be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Government acknowledge the widespread support it received from various sectors for the policy of maintaining the value of the currency.  That support will have been greatly appreciated by the Government. It is now up to all of us to maximise the advantages of the devaluation and minimise the disadvantages.  The realignment of the IR£ should ease considerably the pressure on all sectors of the economy. <Col N="1206" /> There should be no increase in inflation over last year's level of 3 per cent.  It is also important to stress that Ireland's currency remains within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism, unlike many others.  The Government will continue to ensure this is the case and continue to develop and strengthen the economy.  I, therefore, commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been on an issue of fundamental importance to the Irish economy.  It is not an occasion for political point scoring and I am glad to note that this is a view which has been widely shared by most, if not all of the Deputies present and, indeed, those who have contributed to the debate.</P>
      <P>The issue of devaluation centres very much on whether this country wishes to be part of the group of countries committed to stable, long term, low inflation, economic growth or if we want to be part of a more volatile exchange rate system which constrains trade and, ultimately, the creation of employment and improved living standards.</P>
      <P>When the currency crisis broke, last September, there were considerable grounds for this country to decide to remain within the ERM and to align with the hard currency ERM countries.  This was the clearly expressed view, not only of the Government but also of the representative bodies of Irish industry, the trade unions and many of our ERM partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many reasons for this.  The Italian lira and sterling were forced involuntarily from the ERM because the economic policies they had followed in fiscal, budgetary and income determination terms were not consistent with ERM membership.  This was not the case with Ireland where all the necessary fiscal, budgetary and income adjustments had been made with considerable success and benefit to the economy over the previous years.  There was also a widespread recognition that a stable currency system greatly helps and facilitates trade over <Col N="1207" /> time, especially for a country as dependent on trade as is Ireland.</P>
    <P>A stable Irish currency is easier to achieve within a stable ERM system than as part of a floating currency system, particularly if, in a floating system, the Irish currency is seen to be tied to weaker currencies, the value of which is likely to be volatile.</P>
    <P>It was widely anticipated at the time that a European Community firmly committed to the objectives set out in the Maastricht Treaty would take the steps necessary to retain the credibility of the path to economic and monetary union set out in that Treaty.  It was expected that with the help of such action currency stability could be regained across the ERM within a matter of months and that a downward adjustment of interest rates would therefore follow shortly.  In the event, the resolute and co-ordinated action required did not take place.  Speculative pressures against the Irish pound intensified.  Short-term interest rates increased to, and remained at, penal levels with the prospects of further increases as large scale movements of capital continued from the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Additional short term interest rate cuts in sterling in late January, which gave rise to a further weakening of sterling, placed additional burdens on Irish firms competing against UK firms on domestic and overseas markets and gave a further impetus to speculative pressures against the Irish pound.  These presaged further increases in interest rates here. An early and general realignment in conjunction with other narrow-band ERM currencies was and would have been the preferred option to this country but that option simply was not available.  The exceptional support required from our ERM partners in the exceptional circumstances prevailing was not forthcoming and a unilateral devaluation of the Irish pound became necessary and inevitable in the interests of safeguarding employment and the survival of many Irish firms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> The debate here today has been a good and frank debate on an issue of utter importance to the development of the Irish economy.  I was, therefore disappointed to hear Deputy Bruton refer to the &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; of debate in recent months on the currency issue and claim that any mention of devaluation was seen as treason.  This misrepresents the case. It was always accepted that a decision in this area was a hard choice.  There were no easy options.  The Government made it clear that there could be short term benefits from devaluation but long term problems.  These remain to be tackled. Based on the assessment of the situation the Government sought to maintain our exchange rate at its then level.  Does the Deputy think that the Government should have been seen to waver on this issue by a weak defence of our position? The financial markets would have immediately sensed our lack of resolve on this issue and increased the pressure. When a Government decides a policy it must defend it resolutely and strongly.  It has and had no other choice.</P>
    <P>I would also remind Deputy Bruton that prior to January there were no calls for devaluation from the trade union movement, IBEC or indeed his own party.  There was debate on the issue in the Dáil and extensively in the media. Both sides of the argument, for and against, were widely covered.  In that context the Government defended its policy robustly as it should.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also suggested that employers' PRSI should have been cut by 6 per cent last autumn.  A reduction in employers' PRSI is a costly, poorly targeted and probably ineffective approach to creating employment in the long run.  The cost of a 6 per cent reduction would be approximately £500 million.  The reduction would apply to all firms regardless of their financial position, ownership, labour costs and general tax position.  For many sectors and firms, employers' PRSI is the only effective contribution to Government revenues. Recent research has indicated that, because the loss of yield has to be collected in some other way, the net employment <Col N="1209" /> gain from such a measure would be minimal.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to current interest rates.  The reflows of funds from abroad since devaluation have been highly satisfactory.  The Central Bank's lending rate to the market is 13.75 per cent and the marginal blip in interbank rates above that level today is part of the normal settling process following the devaluation.  I expect the strong positive flows since devaluation will again bring rates back down to the level of official rates, which is 13.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>As the positions built up prior to devaluation are more fully unwound interbank rates should ease further.  As I have already said, this may take some time.  The progress of Irish interest rates over the remainder of the year will also be strongly influenced by interest rate developments in other narrow band countries, particularly Germany.  In this regard I will continue, as will my colleagues in Government, to press the case for lower rates at every suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to what he saw as the danger that the interest rates paid on Irish gilts would now increase to the levels prevailing in Spain.  At present, Irish 10-year gilt yields are well below those prevailing in Spain, and since our devaluation, our yields have fallen significantly. There seems to be no reason, therefore, to expect that Irish gilt yields will now rise to Spanish levels.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked what policy the Government had over the past few months to underpin our exchange rate by lowering costs.  It is alleged that the Government did nothing on this issue.  This is not true.</P>
    <P>Classically, in order to reduce the effect of the currency's appreciation it is necessary to reduce input costs to industry. In the main, these are interest rates and wages.  The Government were fully conscious of this and sought to alleviate the burden by way of an excessively high guarantee scheme.  This would have allowed industry, tourism, and the farming community to benefit from low interest rates on their working capital. However, by late January it became <Col N="1210" /> apparent that even with these schemes it might not be possible to avert a rise in retail interest rates which would probably have remained for some time and been slow to reduce.</P>
    <P>One of the other major costs to industry is wages.  The Government was prepared to examine with the social partners the need for pay moderation, but we needed a period of stability.  This was not forthcoming.  Perhaps the Deputies are suggesting that we should have tried to impose wage cuts.  I think they should come clean on this issue if this is precisely what they mean.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte and other Deputies made some suggestions that the official advice the Government received was wrong and came from a narrow set of advisers.  This is not correct.  Ministers consult widely with the business sector, the trade union movement and agricultural interests.  These contacts are part of the normal consultative process of our political culture.  In addition, a meeting of the Central Review Committee which formally represents the social partners was held to discuss the currency crisis. The Government had available to it advice from a wide variety of sources. In relation to the advice given to the Minister for Finance by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and other Government agencies, this advice was based on the wide experience of the advisers and their assessment of the consequences of the options available.  No question should be raised about the integrity of the people who offered that advice.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that we should have devalued earlier and that this would have brought lower interest rates and saved industry hardship.  This ignores the fact that because of generalised instability in the foreign exchange markets an earlier devaluation might not have lowered interest rates.  In the case of Spain, devaluation did not lead to significant lowering of interest rates there immediately after the first devaluation and they were obliged to devalue again. The Central Bank's key official interest rates have only now returned to the end <Col N="1211" /> September levels and it will still take time to bring them down further.</P>
    <P>The devaluation has undoubtedly eased the unsustainable pressures on many Irish firms and on the management of our currency that developed in particular from the beginning of this year.  In doing so it has improved the immediate prospects for employment retention and creation during the course of 1993 &mdash; a year which will be very difficult in any event because of the widespread economic recession across Europe, the US and Japan.  It also entails certain other effects that I have earlier outlined and which have consequences for employment creation and economic policies in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a number of lessons to be learnt from the experience of recent months.  We should focus our attention upon this.</P>
    <P>In the first place the timetable set for the achievement of economic and monetary union in the EC under the Maastricht Treaty looks somewhat less credible today than it did six months ago. It will take incisive action and effort at EC level to restore that credibility.  The forthcoming Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty which will take place on 18 May; the results of the general election in France in March and the ability of Germany to cope more effectively than has been the case to date with the extensive costs of unification will have a major influence on whether the impetus towards greater European integration, which has certainly been retarded in recent months, can be regained.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's perspective it is desirable and important that the vision and optimism for future economic growth and development, which progress towards great European integration promised less than 12 months ago, is regained.  Any prolonging of the transitional period towards economic and monetary union will create greater uncertainty for the business sector in Ireland which would be unhelpful to our policies for employment creation and retention.  That was the view expressed by Mr. Peter Sutherland in <Col N="1212" /> Paris today when he spoke about moving more quickly and effectively towards a single European currency.</P>
    <P>A second lesson is that we also need to develop, to a greater extent, a capacity to analyse events from the perspective not only of our own national interests, where we have tended to concentrate our analytical efforts in EC affairs to date, but also from the perspective of the Community as a whole and from the perspective of the other member states.  We need to have a much broader view of the direction in which the Community should go, from the Community's point of view and not just from our own narrow self national interest point of view.  In doing so we need to take greater account of the impact of events on, and the likely response from, both the member states with whom we share certain characteristics of peripherality and under-development but also the leading member states whose actions largely determine the ultimate Community response to major economic events.  By taking this wider analytical approach we can improve our own decision-making in relation to Community affairs and influence developments at Community level in a more effective way from Ireland's perspective.</P>
    <P>In this regard the political parties in this House have an unique role to play. The three Opposition parties opposite are involved in major European political groupings and have the ability and the opportunity to influence the debate on the future direction of Europe and to learn from that debate of the concerns of other participating parties, the European People's Party, the Liberal group and the Democratic Left group in the European Parliament.  The advice and knowledge that is available to the political domestic process at home from those European sources should inform all our debates more decisively than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we must seek to further diversify our pattern of overseas trade &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; because we need at the same time to strengthen trade between North and South on this island, which is far too weak at present.  It is clear <Col N="1213" /> that a widespread perception of almost satellite dependence on the UK market by Irish exporters, particularly by more labour-intensive indigenous industry, was a major factor in the belief of the financial markets that the devaluation of the Irish pound was inevitable once sterling had devalued and a major interest rate gap opened up between the cost of short term money here and in the UK.  This is in spite of the fact that exports of goods and services to the UK now account for less than one-third of our total exports compared with twice that level 20 years ago when we joined the European Community.  In the case of a number of sectors, however, where indigenous firms predominate, the UK market still accounts for well over 50 per cent of exports.  These tend to be more labour-intensive and financially less-stable sectors of Irish industry.  They are particularly vulnerable to loss of market share on both the Irish domestic market and on overseas markets, in the UK and elsewhere, if UK firms against which they compete gain a competitive advantage of the type which the devaluation of sterling confers in the short term.  I stress &ldquo;the short term&rdquo; because already there are many comments from various economic analysts which suggest that the UK will very rapidly import inflationary forces into its own economy.  Therefore, the short-term benefit of the substantial 15 per cent devaluation of sterling is very soon going to be wiped out.</P>
    <P>If Ireland's claim to membership of the band of hard-core ERM currencies which have the best chance of moving to economic and monetary union &mdash; ahead of other member states including the UK if necessary &mdash; is to have full credibility our dependence on the UK market must be further reduced.  This is not to say that the UK market will not remain, perhaps, the most important overseas market for a great many Irish firms.  It is the first natural overseas market for Irish firms and it would fly in the face of reality and market forces to ignore this.  We have built strong trading links for industrial goods with the UK over the years to the mutual benefit of both countries.  These <Col N="1214" /> links must be nurtured, and indeed strengthened, in the coming years.  But, in addition to the further development of these important trading links with the UK, it is very much in the interests of Irish firms to diversify into other European markets and particularly into the markets of the hard-core ERM currencies.  In doing so they will achieve greater stability of output, employment and income.  It is intended that the State industrial promotion agencies will intensify their efforts in helping Irish firms to seek such wider diversification opportunities in future years.</P>
    <P>A further lesson to be learned from the currency crisis is the absolute necessity to achieve major structural reforms in the Irish economy.  The recent devaluation of the Irish pound will provide a short term competitive advantage.  This will help safeguard output and jobs that would otherwise have undoubtedly been lost.  These benefits will, however, prove short term and transient if the cost structure which Irish industrial firms face &mdash; from both internal and external factors &mdash; is allowed to worsen relative to that facing firms with which they compete on the domestic and overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility for the adjustments now required to maintain and improve competitiveness rests with individual firms, both on the employer and employee sides.  Taxation, income, competition and social partnership policies will also be major determinants of the cost-competitiveness of Irish industry in the difficult period which lies ahead.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Culliton report provide a framework within which many of these issues can be tackled in a coherent way.  The implementation of these recommendations is a priority objective under the partnership programme for Government.  I am determined that major progress on this front will be achieved before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In that respect I suggest to the House that we have to learn from the lessons of past months, of the period of political uncertainty and instability in the general election and the subsequent formation <Col N="1215" /> of a Government.  All the analyses in September indicated that the currency crisis would be of short duration but further analyses, comment and judgment indicated that the change in interest rates, and the consequential reduction of tensions in the currencies, would take longer than had been originally anticipated. It is very easy to be wise after the event and I know Opposition parties have a unique ability to monopolise that kind of wisdom.</P>

The responsibility now for all sides of the House, is to learn from what has been a very expensive, difficult and traumatic experience for our society.  How are we going to do that?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the House that the way in which we proceed to do it is to implement successively the recommendations of the Culliton report over those sectors of the economy of which we have total and complete control.  The Bundesbank may significantly control the interest rates that predominate within Europe but it does not determine work practices in Dublin port, it does not prevent the implementation of the roads programme for this country, it does not determine how we operate our training programmes or how we reduce costs across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that the large number, 60 in total, of the recommendations that are contained in the Culliton report and the way in which the Moriarty task force has suggested that they should be implemented are the matters which in my view should be the focus <Col N="1216" /> of our attention over the next number of months.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputies present in the House that this new Administration, this new Government, has taken on as a priority the implementation of the Culliton report in the following manner. The Moriarty task force has produced three reports which are now a matter for public comment.  The Government, at its meeting last week, agreed to set up a special ministerial group consisting of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Tourism and Trade to implement, on a successive basis, the various recommendations of the Culliton report and, from time to time, as would be required, to bring on to that committee the relevant Minister whose Department was affected by the recommendations such as, for example, the Minister for the Environment in respect of roads.</P>
    <P>It will be our intention to bring into this House legislation to give effect to the agency restructuring associated with the recommendations of the Culliton report and to produce, on the one hand, IDA Ireland which will have a focus of attracting international investment into this country and on the other hand Forbairt which will have a very new and highly detailed focus on the fostering and development of indigenous industry within our economy.</P>
    <P>One thing is very clear from the Culliton report.  It is something we have learned to our cost and which we tended to ignore in the past, that is the need to develop strong, indigenous Irish companies in this country.  Indeed, it is the vulnerability of some of the more traditional Irish indigenous companies that was exposed in a manner that took, perhaps, some of us by surprise during the course of the sterling currency crisis. While the statistics indicating our dependence on the UK market are undoubtedly accurate, the relative weighting of much of the indigenous Irish industry, in terms of its dependence on the UK market, was greater than many of us had fully <Col N="1217" /> appreciated.  We should learn, therefore, and learn very quickly from what we discovered during the last three to four months and we should be prepared to apply that in a coherent and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that within the programme for this Government the commitment to implement Culliton is extensive and will be decisive.  I will be looking forward to the co-operation and, indeed, to the critical participation of all Deputies in regard to how best that can be done.</P>
    <P>One lesson that must finally and clearly be learned from the last four months is that this country at the end of the day has within its own hands the capacity and the ability to make its own way in the world. We must also realise that we are on our own and that we have a responsibility to make sure that we take the necessary steps ourselves and are not excessively dependent on external agencies or external forces to lead us to the kind of future we aspire to.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that this Government will be giving a renewed and deepened emphasis to developing indigenous industry in this country.  In addition, because of the scale of the employment crisis we will also be moving to implement, in a fairly coherent manner, the county enterprise partnership boards.  It would be my intention to come back to this House as soon as possible with detailed proposals as to how those county enterprise partnership boards will complement the work and the thrust of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>To return to the central theme of today's debate, what have we learned from the last four months and how can we apply the lessons that we have learned?  I would suggest that it is too easy to have the wisdom of hindsight.  Until very recently all the political parties were, on balance, recommending that the exchange rate policy pursued by the then administration of the Fianna Fáil Party, initially with the Progressive Democrats, and then on their own, was a policy that, if possible, should be pursued.  It became obvious after Christmas that the period <Col N="1218" /> of time of instability, of extended high level of interest rates in Germany and elsewhere, was going to be of a duration far in excess of anything that had originally been anticipated.  In the light of those pressures and of the totally unexpected virtual collapse in the value of sterling in early January, pressures were brought to bear on the Irish currency which simply could not be sustained.</P>
    <P>A number of individuals and a number of groups changed their view in relation to what the correct exchange rate policy should be.  One of the most prominent people to break ranks first, so to speak, was the leader of the Fine Gael Party. In that context the decision to devalue became inevitable and was, I believe, the correct decision in the light of the circumstances that prevailed at that time.</P>

No doubt I can look forward to the co-operation of the Opposition parties in helping us to apply those lessons to our economy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - River Suir (Waterford) Bridge.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The south-east is a pivotal location mainly through the existence of three ports in the region &mdash; New Ross, Rosslare and Waterford.  The major development currently being undertaken by the Waterford Harbour Commissioners at Belview, County Kilkenny, will further enhance this role.  It is therefore desirable to co-ordinate the needs of the region with that of the rest of the country.  The Irish roads plan currently being proposed does not give recognition to the fact that the south-east ports are the principal means for the transportation of goods to mainland Europe. There is an urgency about giving clear recognition to all routes linking Waterford port, which will become the premier port in the country following the completion of the Belview development.</P>
      <P>In order to get traffic through Waterford city quickly to Waterford Port and Rosslare Port, it is essential that a high level bridge be constructed across the River Suir.  It is totally unacceptable to the citizens of Waterford and south Kilkenny that all the core traffic that will result from this new development will make their lives a misery.  In addition, the creation of a bypass north of Waterford city through Newrath is currently required as part of the existing road structure.  As a representative of Kilkenny County Council, I can confirm that the development of a new river crossing for Waterford has the full support of that local authority.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the Government take this unique opportunity, with the advance of the Cohesion Fund and future Structural Funds, to put this integrated road plan in place not only for the benefit of Waterford and south Kilkenny but for the benefit of the country and the south-east region in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time allocated to me I want to make a number of specific points to the Minister.  First, this is the only specific project included in the sub-regional review committee's submission to Government.  It is supported by all counties and it is the only named project in that submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, it is not a question of this being a local issue.  This is a national issue, because the port being built at Belview in Waterford is designated, both at a European and Irish level, as Ireland's premier lo-lo port of access to Europe. Thirty per cent of all the goods leaving lo-lo ports here at present leave from the existing old port upriver.  By the time this new port reaches its full potential, 48 per cent of the traffic will be leaving from this area.  As the Minister is aware &mdash; I know he has been to Waterford &mdash; the problem is that, there is only one river crossing and it is in the city.  The Euro-route from Rosslare begins at the bridge in Waterford and winds down through the inner city.  The access to the port is at present carrying flammables, solids, liquids as well as toxic and corrosive substances and oxidising agents.  I am sure the House would agree that that is totally <Col N="1223" /> unacceptable.  If something is not done about it, we are facing very serious problems should an accident occur because of those substances being carried through a major built-up area.</P>
    <P>Third, the port being established at Belview is already ahead of schedule: a new bulk terminal port is now commencing and the contracts were awarded in the past week.  That port will also be operational before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The application to build a high level bridge over the River Suir in the city of Waterford goes back to the sixties.  When 14 or 15 years old, I remember looking at plans for the bridge.  This is the last chance the Government has, in view of the upcoming <i>tranche</i> of Structural Funds, to put in place a facility that is in the national and economic interest of this country.  There is no point in this Government, and the European Commission, accepting that that is to be the premier port if they are not going to put in place the supporting infrastructural network which is required to move goods and services from all over the country to the port at Belview.  If the Minister does not do that, then the planning which has gone on within his Department, the Department of the Marine and at EC level, will all be for nought and chaos will reign in terms of access to that port.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us his views on access transport to that port.  Would he agree with the subregional review committee's submission that the central plank of that is the construction of a high level bridge which will bypass the city of Waterford?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The submissions from the sub-regional review committees and those from the social partners and other groups and bodies are at present being examined. I am aware of the recommendation in the sub-regional report for a new high level bridge in Waterford.  The bridge in question was the subject of a bridge order application by Waterford Corporation in the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979, Waterford Corporation was <Col N="1224" /> advised that the application could not be progressed until information was made available about the acquisition of property that would be required for the construction of the bridge and associated approach roads.  It was also suggested to the local authority that the planned replacement of Redmond Bridge, which had become hazardous, would afford an opportunity to review the implications of a high level bridge proposal, particularly in relation to environmental and financial aspects and current and future traffic requirements.  The information which would need to be available for presentation at a bridge order inquiry has not yet been furnished by the local authority. At this stage the proposal would also require a formal environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>In view of the extensive programme of road improvements which have been carried out in the area in the meantime, including in particular the new Rice Bridge, which replaced the old Redmond Bridge, and also the new dual carriageways at Ferrybank and Dock Road and improvements to the Quay and Manor Street, any proposal for the provision of a further bridge would have to be examined very closely in relation to the likely costs, benefits and environmental issues arising from it.  I have no proposals at this stage for the provision of grants to meet the cost of a new high level bridge in Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair affording me the opportunity to raise this matter this evening.  Like many other Deputies, I attended a meeting last evening attended by up to 700 Aer Lingus staff when serious concern was expressed about the future of that company, not only the airline but also Team Aer Lingus.  It seems from the approach of this Government that when it talks about the viability and profitability of Aer Lingus it is taking an unnecessarily narrow view of the role and function of Aer Lingus in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus is one of the success stories <Col N="1225" /> of Irish public enterprise.  It is our fourth largest employer and is larger than Smurfits or Cement Roadstone.  It has 14,000 employees, more than 7,600 of whom pay tax to the Exchequer.  Its contribution to the economy is enormous and it has played a central role in the development of our tourism industry.  It has created a skill base second to none and its spin-off industries and subsidiaries make a major contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>It is essential in the future deregulated market in Europe that we have an airline which is capable of originating its business in Ireland and whose commitment would be to this country.  It is estimated that no more than two, possibly three, major airlines will survive in Europe in 1997.  It seems that, unless Aer Lingus is enabled to survive, those airlines will not have the same commitment to servicing the Irish market that an Irish airline would have.  That is not to deny that for Aer Lingus to survive it must have some arrangements with other European airlines, but in order to do so it must have equity to make it possible to enter such arrangements.</P>
    <P>We have spent billions of pounds on industrial development over the past few decades with relatively poor returns in terms of jobs created.  It costs the IDA around £17,000 in direct grants to create a single new job in the services and engineering sectors.  The amount of money that Aer Lingus needs is not that substantial compared to the sum spent on industrial development.  It would provide Aer Lingus with adequate equity and make social and economic sense.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern to me, in relation to the question of equity for the airline, is the survival of the Team Aer Lingus company.  There was considerable staff criticism last night of the management of Aer Lingus and of Team Aer Lingus. The difficulties of Aer Lingus have been compounded by the problems faced by Team Aer Lingus.  When that company was started it raised great hopes for the kind of enterprise that public companies could get involved in here and could be successful at.  I understand that potential business, worth up to £60 million and involving the overhaul of 11 aircraft, which would have guaranteed the jobs of <Col N="1226" /> 100 workers in Team Aer Lingus for two years, has been blocked by the Government on political grounds.  The proposal, it appears, was for the overhaul of 11 civilian aircraft from Libya two of them former Aer Lingus planes.  I am informed that the Department of Industry and Commerce only last month refused to allow Team Aer Lingus even to consider the business and the Irish businessman who tried to set up the deal was warned that he would be liable to prosecution if he attempted to set up the deal, which, the Government claimed, would be in breach of international sanctions against Libya.</P>
    <P>What puzzles me is that only last week considerable publicity was given to the resumption of the live cattle trade from this country to Libya, which is considered to be a great boom for farmers and the economy.  How is it that we are prohibited from providing jobs for Irish workers through the servicing of civilian planes from Libya but that exporters are quite free to export cattle to the same country?  It has also been suggested to me that aircraft companies in France in Germany are trading with Libya without any interference by their Governments. I want to make it clear that I do not approve in any way of General Gadaffi or his regime, but I wonder why they are singled out for particular attention.  Their record is no worse than many other countries with which we are trading freely.  In addition, they now seem to have severed the links they had with the IRA.</P>
    <P>Given our appalling levels of unemployment, can we afford to be so cavalier in refusing potential business for companies such as Team Aer Lingus?  Can we be so cavalier in allowing Aer Lingus to sink, as we did with other State enterprises, by not providing the equity that is essential to enable it to survive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am equally concerned about the future of Aer Lingus as Deputy De Rossa.  This concern is shared by my Government colleagues and by my colleagues on these benches, representing both Government parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Programme <Col N="1227" /> for Government contains a commitment to ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy.  The critical financial position of Aer Lingus was my first priority on taking office as Minister responsible for civil aviation.  I have already had two meetings with the chairman during which he briefed me on the financial position of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House clearly understands the proper chain of command procedures for dealing with matters of this nature.  It is management's job to manage the company and make proposals to the board.  It is the board's responsibility to assess these proposals and satisfy themselves that they are the best available.  Proposals, when approved by the board, are forwarded to me as Minister and I then have them assessed by my Department.  When this process has been completed to my satisfaction, I will bring proposals to the Government, who have the final say in such matters.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the board, in conjunction with management, are finalising detailed proposals to address the financial problems.  I expect to have the board's proposals very shortly and they will be carefully considered both by myself and by the Government.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Government will have to look at the position within the context of the overall budgetary constraints, which have recently been exacerbated by the devaluation of our currency.  Exchequer support will be conditional on the board producing a plan acceptable to the Government which will return the airline to sustained operational profitability and which will ensure that the group as a whole is returning sufficient profits to meet future needs.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of our aviation policy is to promote direct job creation in the Irish airline and aviation industry.  Aer Lingus has been a substantial employer over the years and its services have facilitated job creation in other sectors, notably in tourism.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus now has one of the most modern European fleets with associated high interest charges.  This, combined with the heavy losses which continue <Col N="1228" /> to be sustained by the airline, places a strong onus on Aer Lingus to ensure that its costs are at least as good as, if not better than, best industry practice.  If costs are not tackled aggressively the airline will not have a viable future.</P>
    <P>Along with reducing costs the airline must ensure that its yields are at sustainable levels.  The resolution of Aer Lingus's current difficulties and its future prosperity dictate that its fares must not only be competitive but also economically sustainable.  Failure to do this would simply mean that accumulated losses would keep mounting and any new capital invested would quickly disappear.</P>
    <P>The Government values the contribution which has been made by Aer Lingus to the economy over the years.  It has provided the critical mass, expertise and range of products which have helped spawn our national aviation industry.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to see Aer Lingus's contribution continue into the future.  The company is presently going through an exceptionally difficult period in its history.  I believe, however, that Aer Lingus can have a strong future if the right actions are taken now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you most sincerely, Sir, for allowing me an opportunity to raise this very important matter with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen.  I would ask the Minister to reinstate South Coast Community Television to the County Cork coastal region where thousands of viewers have been denied the facility of a multi-channel TV service. Other areas of the country &mdash; for example, Galway, home of the former Minister for Communications and now home of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; are enjoying a privilege which has been denied to the viewers in south-west County Cork.  It is of paramount importance that community groups throughout the country be granted a licence by the Minister.  No <Col N="1229" /> company should have a monopoly such as that enjoyed by the company using the MMDS system, who charge a rental of £140 per year.  South Coast Community Television charge a rental of between £20 and £30 per year for their services.  How can any Minister be so uncharitable as to give such a monopoly to any one group, thus preventing the weakest section of the community &mdash; the old, the infirm and the unemployed &mdash; from enjoying the same facility as their counterparts on the east coast.  How can the Minister allow open competition all along the east coast, while the people in the west and south-west are denied this facility?</P>
      <P>The MMDS system is not used in any other European country.  It is only in use in Canada and North Africa. Furthermore, MMDS is a microwave system that will prove very unsuitable for valleys and low-lying areas, common terrain in the south-west and the entire west of Ireland.  The Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties gave a commitment prior to the election to review national community television services.  Why are these two parties now reneging on these promises?  I call on the Minister to allow South Coast Community Television to operate, thus restoring equal rights to south-west Cork and the west of Ireland.  I would ask the Minister to let common sense prevail.</P>

Prior to the election clear commitments were given by Fianna Fáil and Labour for the continuation of community TV in south-west Cork.  These promises were quite unequivocal; in fact, there was a commitment given to introduce legislation if necessary.  I want that commitment <Col N="1230" /> fully honoured now so that the future of community TV can be secured.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to a monopoly. I am against monopolies in principle. It appears that there is a monopoly franchise to the MMDS operation.  This is totally wrong.  I am not trying to knock out the MMDS operation.  They are quite welcome to compete on a level playing field.  What I want is open competition; and, if they have faith in their product, I cannot see why they should not agree to that also.  The cost factor does arise; it costs me £30 per year.  I am not speaking for myself, but there are many poor people who simply cannot afford more than that.  The MMDS system involves an installation fee of more than £100 and an annual fee of £150.  That is beyond the reach of the poorer people in my constituency.  It is also significant that a voluntary group is involved in the provision of community TV and that a commercial operation, making money, is involved in the other system.  I have no problem about people being involved in a commercial operation, but they should not be looking for a monopoly to clear everybody else off the pitch.</P>
      <P>Essentially, what we are seeking in south west Cork is the same facility as is available in other parts of the country, by way of overspill along the east coast and by way of deflector on the west coast. There was outrage before the election where the previous Minister for Communications, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was instrumental in having the plug pulled on the operation in Carrigaline while 6,000 viewers continued to avail of the facility in her area, Galway West.  That was considered to be outrageous discrimination.  Now another Minister from the Galway West constituency, Deputy M.D. Higgins, the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, is presumably enjoying the same facilities that I do not enjoy in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil and Labour Government must act quickly.  It promised to do so.  If it fails, community television in south-west Cork will have no future.</P>

      <P>It is not <Col N="1231" /> the case that thousands of viewers in south-west Cork are denied the privilege of multi-channel viewing by my refusal to grant a licence for the transmission of such services in the area.  The truth of the matter is that Cork Communications Limited has a licence to relay a multi-channel television service to all homes in the Cork county and the west Waterford area.  Due to the constraints of good frequency management, the licence is exclusive and was issued only after an open competition for the franchise.  Contrary to the inference of the Deputies in their request for this debate, the situation in west Cork is no different from the situation in Galway.  In Galway the MMDS franchise is held by Cablelink (Galway) Limited. No so-called deflector system has been licensed there, no more than there has been in Cork.  As far as I am aware, an illegal transmitter in west Cork was closed down recently by its operators following the serving of a court order on the operators under the planning Acts.  My information is that the MMDS multi-channel service is available to all those homes in the Cork south-west area which for a very brief period recently were receiving illegal services.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is wrong for the Deputy to say that multi-channel services are not available.  They are being provided in an orderly and legal fashion in a part of the radio frequency spectrum which will not prevent or hinder the development of our national television services in the future, be they RTE, Teilifís na Gaelige, or any future national television service independent of RTE services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments examined this problem a number of times in detail, including Governments of which both Deputies were members, and concluded that it would be neither practical nor in the national interest to licence illegal rebroadcasting or deflector systems such as those operated by the South Coast Community TV company to which the Deputies refer.  The basic problem with <Col N="1232" /> the deflector systems is that they operate in a part of the UHF frequency band which is governed by an international treaty.  Under that treaty there are simply not enough frequencies available to Ireland to enable a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements such as RTE's frequency requirements.  The fact is that if the non-cabled public want multi-channel television &mdash; and all the evidence is that the vast majority of them do &mdash; then MMDS seems the only practicable option open to us at present to provide it.  The technical and internationally binding constraints on us with regard to the use of the radio frequency spectrum, and particularly that part of it used by deflector systems, are such that we believe it is not possible to legalise them.  We simply do not have access to sufficient frequencies &mdash; first to allow countrywide operation of community or deflector systems or, second, to give viewers in non-cabled areas something approaching the choice of television programmes that is available in cabled areas and still conserve frequency spectrum &mdash; to meet foreseeable developments in Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The cost of the service provided by the properly licensed companies such as Cork Communications Ltd. is often compared unfavourably with the illegal deflector services.  Usually such comparisons fail to compare like with like. The transmission facility per MMDS cell can cost up to £250,000.  There will be up to 29 cells throughout the country.  Up to £250 to £300 worth of equipment has to be installed in each subscriber's premises. Members can readily appreciate therefore that the investment required is sizeable by any standards.  The annual cost to an MMDS subscriber will approximate to the subscriber charge for the more modern cable systems installed in recent years &mdash; that is around £100 to £125 rental per annum.</P>
    <P>While the costs are dearer than deflectors, the comparisons made are invalid. The MMDS system is an 11-channel service and MMDS operators must pay licence fees, £20,000 in advance and 5 per cent of the annual rental.  They must also pay VAT and copyright fees &mdash; obligations <Col N="1233" /> avoided by the deflectors because of their illegal status.  Many people complain about the installation charge of between £100 and £125 for MMDS but forget that every deflector subscriber had to have a UHF aerial installed, which, we believe, in many instances cost £100 or more.  I appreciate that there has been some controversy about the introduction of MMDS.</P>

      <P>I also sympathise with those who had become accustomed to the illegal deflector services.  Nevertheless &mdash; and, as a lawyer, Deputy O'Keeffe will understand this &mdash; I would advise caution against those who pretend that there are any easy solutions to this problem.  The MMDS system provides the possibility of a professional high quality multi-channel service on a countrywide basis at a reasonable cost.  The service is now available in counties Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Meath, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Sligo, Galway, Roscommon and Offaly. I understand that there are in excess of 24,000 subscribers at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1987 and the end of 1994 over 70,000 Irish citizens will have received green cards to enable them to work permanently in the United States.  This represents the largest legal migration from Ireland since the 1960s at a time of recession in the USA.  In 1992, 11 groups across the US benefited from the £50,000 allocated by the Irish Government.  This sum represented a reduction of 75 per cent on the 1991 figure.  The services provided by the various groups include job placement, housing, health and maternity care, emigration advice, social services and pastoral counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since new immigrants are ineligible for any form of unemployment assistance for their first three years in the USA, assistance and guidance in their first year is crucial.  Because of the decrease in grant-aid in 1992 several agencies had to curtail their services for the increasing number of Irish immigrants as more Morrision visas <Col N="1234" /> are taken up.  According to some agencies in the US, some Irish immigrants are returning home to join the dole queues because immigrant agencies are struggling to provide help to get them employment with their vastly reduced resources. The services provided by many of the agencies are life supporting in emergency situations, where young Irish people have become jobless or homeless, have nervous breakdowns or are facing pregnancy as single parents, or become incapacitated because of an illness or injury.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to remind the Minister that specialised Irish agency systems in the USA are vital if newcomers are to compete in a very competitive and tight job market.  If they do not get intense assistance during their first month in the US they will run out of money and become exposed to many difficulties and dangers.  In some cases they just return home.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that grant-aid for US immigrant services is restored to at least its 1991 level of £200,000.</P>

      <P>The various Irish immigrant assistance groups in the United States provide much-needed services in a variety of areas, not just for the undocumented Irish there but also for all newly-arrived immigrants from Ireland. These groups do very valuable work and have shown great commitment in their concern for Irish immigrants.  The Government greatly appreciate that work and we are committed to giving whatever support is open to us to assist their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government funding for the work of immigrant assistance groups in the United States has been provided since 1990, when the problem of the undocumented Irish was identified as a serious issue.  It has unfortunately not been possible to maintain the funding at the original level, due to the very serious budgetary situation.  As Deputies, including Deputy Deenihan are aware, the budgetary constraints have not eased and therefore it has not been possible, despite every effort, to envisage an increase in 1993 in the allocation of £50,000 made <Col N="1235" /> available for immigrant advice services in the United States last year.</P>
    <P>Our consulates in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston have made and continue to make immigration issues a priority in their work.  In addition to the financial support by Government to the immigrant assistance groups, the consulates themselves devote very considerable time and resources to offering support and advice to immigrants.  In this they work closely with the immigrant assistance groups in their areas and I believe the value of this support is much appreciated by the various groups.</P>
    <P>The immigration working committees, established under the auspices of the consulates in the four cities, provide a useful forum for the exchange of information and views and represent an example of the kind of assistance provided by the consulates in this area.  Additionally, the consulates have helped in arranging or have participated in seminars to advise on the visa application process under the Morrison visa programme.  As the problem of the undocumented Irish in the United States begins to recede, the consulates are also now beginning to direct their attention, in conjunction with the immigrant assistance groups, to longer term needs of Irish immigrants in the US &mdash; such as job placement, social services entitlements, educational and training opportunities.  They will continue to be associated closely with the immigrant assistance groups in their efforts in these areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by assuring the House, and Deputy Deenihan, that the Government will continue to keep the situation under close review and will maintain through our consulates the existing excellent working relationship with the immigrant advice groups so that the best possible service can be provided for our immigrants in the United States, given the limitations of the current situation.</P>

      <P>Major repair work has been promised for Listowel Garda <Col N="1236" /> station for some time.  It is an extremely busy station with a total of 27 staff, including 18 gardaí, two sergeants, three detectives, a superintendent, a district clerk and two female clerical assistants. The station requires a new roof as a matter of urgency.  Slates have blown from the roof during times of high winds and they present danger to the public and the staff of the station.  There is an urgent need to replace the existing windows, provide an interview room, a medical room, a recreational room, a locker room and proper showering facilities.  There are no ramps, in the front or the back of the building, to allow easier access for the disabled.  There is also a need for a new cell block, as the two cells are inadequate.  Listowel is the only station with cells in a district which covers nine stations.  During times of major events, such as Listowel races, the cells are in greater use.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for the upgrading of fire safety standards, electrical rewiring of the station, the installation of heating and internal and external decoration. I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funding to ensure that the married quarters are converted immediately, that the accommodation in the station is brought up to standard and that an exceptionally hard-working staff can work in proper conditions.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the death sentence pronounced by a <i>fatwa</i> against Mr. Salman Rushdie in 1989.  We have made this clear to the Iranian authorities who can be in no doubt about the depth of our concern and our rejection of the threat against Mr. Rushdie's life.  We cannot accept a policy that advocates or condones the assassination of a writer because of what he has written.</P>
      <P>The European Community and its member states have condemned the <i>fatwa</i> and called for its revocation.  This was repeated at the UN General Assembly last year and by Heads of Government at the Edinburgh European Council in December.</P>
      <P>When Mr. Rushdie visited Ireland last month I discussed with him his situation and the possibilities open to Ireland and the international community to exert pressure to have the death threat withdrawn. We are considering this further with our Community partners.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to follow developments in Cambodia very closely and is particularly anxious to see the UN peace plan fully implemented.  We believe this plan provides the best way forward for Cambodia.</P>
      <P>The holding of free and fair elections from 23 to 25 May next is the critical element in the UN peace plan.  By registering to vote the overwhelming majority of the people of Cambodia have clearly indicated their wish to exercise their democratic rights.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any reports of recent mass killings by the Khmer Rouge.  Nonetheless, reports of Khmer Rouge actions against personnel from the United Nations Transitional Authority are very disturbing.  I wish to reiterate Ireland's full support for UNTAC and I condemn any attempt to undermine its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Security Council is fully seized of <Col N="825" /> the problem posed by the Khmer Rouge. In discussing the issue last week the Council was concerned about the recent outbreak of fighting.  In addition, last November the Council deplored the failure of the Khmer Rouge to meet its obligations under the Paris Agreements and imposed sanctions on the trade in logs and gems particularly from the areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General intends to visit Cambodia in April and will report his findings to the Security Council.  I await with interest his report and his analysis of the current situation.  In the run-up to the elections, Ireland and our partners in the Twelve will continue to follow developments in Cambodia very closely.</P>
    <P>The conditions facing Irish personnel with UNTAC in Cambodia are difficult due to the severe climatic conditions and the poor infrastructure in a country devastated by over a decade of civil war.  As UNTAC has become more established there has been some improvement in living conditions.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend the deep appreciation of the Government to those personnel from the Army and the Garda Síochána who have represented Ireland with such distinction with the United Nations force in Cambodia.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, which have been taken at international level to support the establishment of a provisional administration in Somalia, and to transform Operation Restore Hope into a long term process of civic reconstruction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Ireland's primary concerns in Somalia have been to ensure that sufficient humanitarian assistance is provided to the suffering Somali population and that there is adequate security to ensure its distribution; and to give all possible support to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their efforts to promote national reconciliation of the different Somali factions.</P>
      <P>Since the deployment of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), under the authority of the Security Council and United States command, the security in urban areas has improved dramatically.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently taking place between the US and the UN on the transfer of responsibility from UNITAF to the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II).  The timing of this transfer will be decided by the UN Security Council when it receives a recommendation from the Secretary-General, which is expected soon.</P>
      <P>Simultaneously, work has begun on the formation of a Somali national police force.  This will be the first element of a return to normal conditions in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the original objectives of the United Nations' involvement in Somalia was to promote national reconciliation. Under the aegis of the Secretary-General, Somali factions met last month in Addis Ababa.  They agreed on a number of steps &mdash; interim government and administration, representative elections, etc. &mdash; that should be taken to restore normal life to Somalia.  They also agreed to hold a national reconciliation conference in Mogadishu starting on 15 March.  Unfortunately, according to recent reports from Mogadishu, the factions led by General Aidid and General <Col N="827" /> Morgan have now withdrawn their agreement to the holding of the conference.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work with our EC partners to urge all Somali factions to participate in the national reconciliation conference.</P>
    <P>The Security Council will shortly decide, on the basis of the report by the Secretary-General on the UN's continuing role in the establishment of a new administration and in creating the conditions which will allow civic reconstruction to begin.  An overall political settlement is essential to enable Somalia rebuild from the ruins of civil strife and famine and to underpin long-term development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 46, 56 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I said in my statement on 18 January that the treatment of women in Bosnia is a shameful episode in the Yugoslav conflict and a gross affront to the personal dignity and fundamental human rights of the women concerned.  It demands a concerted and sustained response from the international community.</P>
      <P>Both the European Community and the United Nations have been active and have sent investigation missions to the area.  Copies of the Final Report of the Community's mission led by Dame Anne Warburton have been deposited in the Dáil Library.  The report is extensive and its findings are clear and damning.  The rape of Muslim women is perpetrated on a wide scale and in such a way as to be part of a clearly recognisable pattern sufficient to form an important element of war strategy.  The most reasoned estimates available place the number of victims at around 20,000, and suggest that there may be as many as 1,000 resulting pregnancies.  The evidence indicates that such abuse occurs mainly in small centres, for example schools, hotels, police stations; but there may be larger concentations of women held in detention centres in areas currently inaccessible to international investigation.</P>
      <P>The Special Rapporteur appointed by the UN Commission on Human Rights has also visited the region and reported on the large-scale violations of human rights there.  A further report by him will be available shortly and is expected to highlight the crimes against women.  It will be taken up at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva where Ireland and its partners in the Community will be pressing for strong international action.</P>
      <P>The report of the Warburton Mission contains over 20 recommendations for action grouped under four headings:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> first, it calls for an international meeting this month of Community member states, relevant EC bodies, and other interested governments to implement a plan of action to provide assistance and support for the victims;</P>
    <P>second, it contains a wide-ranging set of recommendations on such matters as hospital facilities, medical care, counselling, support groups, refuge camps, ambulance services, information and housing;</P>
    <P>third, it asks EC member states to consider making places available for Bosnian women; and</P>
    <P>fourth, the mission believes that there is a strong case for identifying the abuses as war crimes irrespective of whether they occur in national or international conflicts.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a proposal tabled by Ireland the General Affairs Council on 2 February adopted a decision which endorsed the report's findings and undertook to implement its recommendations. Beyond this the Council also agreed to our proposal for an early political approach to the leadership in the former Yugoslavia to impress on them the incontrovertible nature of the evidence, and the imperative need to bring these abhorrent practices to an end, and to demand access to locations associated with the practice of rape.  I expect that the Community will actively follow up these decisions.</P>
    <P>On the question of war crimes, work is proceeding at the UN, at the CSCE, and in the European Community.  A special Commission established by the UN Security Council last October is examining and analysing information on breaches of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions.  The CSCE has begun work on drafting a statute for a war crimes tribunal.  And the French Government are preparing proposals for the establishment of a War Crimes Tribunal which are expected to be made available shortly to the Twelve. I hope that the results of this work can lead to the early establishment of a Tribunal <Col N="830" /> to bring the perpetrators of these appalling crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>At the national level following my recent meetings with an all-party group of women TDs and with representatives of several Irish non-governmental organisations I announced a grant of £30,000 to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The Funding will come from this year's Vote for International Cooperation and is intended to assist the Centre to train people from Bosnia in rape counselling skills.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that since the Edinburgh European Council Ireland has been actively involved in this issue.  We shall continue to work for the implementation of an effective programme of action to assist the victims of rape and for continued international pressure on the parties involved to bring an end to these abhorrent crimes.</P>

      <P>The cost of a standard 32-page passport, which is valid for ten years, is £45.  In general, I do not feel that this charge &mdash; equivalent to an annual cost of £4.50p &mdash; can be considered unreasonable. However, I am conscious that the level of the fee may cause hardship for certain categories of applicants.  To lessen this hardship the Passport Office has introduced a number of special provisions: a three year passport, which costs £10.00, is available for persons under 18 or over 65 years of age; a collective passport, which cost £45.00, is available for groups of young people of over 5 and under 50 persons, who are travelling on educational, cultural or pilgrimage purposes to certain countries; a collective passport is also available for groups of <Col N="831" /> invalid pilgrims travelling to Lourdes; a low-season fee of £35.00 was introduced on a trial basis last year for applicants who apply for their passports during October and November.  The campaign proved very successful and I hope to see it continued this year.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a scheme similar to the British visitor's passport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the content of the question is concerned, I should like to refer the Deputy to the reply which my predecessor gave in response to his similar question on 4 November 1992.  That reply listed the reports produced by the body to date and explained how the Government has responded positively to the request made by the body at the beginning of 1991 to provide written observations on the various reports.  In similar fashion replies will be provided to the reports received in 1992 and I intend to continue this practice with regard to future reports.  I believe that these arrangements will contribute to ensuring that the reports are given the careful consideration which they merit, including by other Ministers who may have a direct <Col N="832" /> responsibility in the areas covered by these reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 50 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 28 July 1992 to provide for the admission of up to 200 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. A group of 178 arrived in Ireland on 2 September.  It was subsequently decided to admit 22 immediate family members of the refugees already here and arrangements are at present being made to locate these family members and organise their transport to Ireland.</P>
      <P>A reception centre for the refugees was established at Cherry Orchard.  There was close co-operation between the Refugee Agency, Civil Defence, the Irish Red Cross and the Eastern Health Board in the arrangements for the reception of the refugees.  These agencies are now actively seeking more permanent accommodation. In recent weeks, a number of families has been moved into private rented accomodation and this process will be continued for the remaining refugees over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that all the appropriate facilities and welfare arrangements have been provided for the refugees since their arrival in Ireland.  I note that the UN <Col N="833" /> High Commissioner for Refugees praised the arrangements which had been made by Ireland when she visited the Cherry Orchard Reception Centre in October.</P>
    <P>It is now six months since the arrival in Ireland of the group of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  I am conscious of the continuing refugee problem as a result of the conflict and of the heavy burden imposed on neighbouring states in the region, which have accepted large numbers of displaced people.  I will, therefore, be reviewing with my colleagues in Government what future action Ireland might take to assist in the tackling of this tragedy, bearing in mind our relatively limited capacity to absorb large numbers of refugees and also the needs of those families who have already arrived in the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 71 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict in former Yugoslavia has lasted for more than two years.  Throughout that period Ireland has been actively involved, particularly through the European Community, in the search for a <Col N="835" /> peaceful, negotiated solution.  The principal elements of our policy involve:</P>
    <P>&mdash;support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia chaired jointly by David Owen and Cyrus Vance</P>
    <P>&mdash;involvement in efforts in the region by the UN and the EC to establish the conditions necessary for a settlement</P>
    <P>&mdash;sustained international pressure, including sanctions, against Serbia and Montenegro</P>
    <P>&mdash;support for efforts to prevent a spill-over of the conflict</P>
    <P>&mdash;assistance to refugees and displaced persons, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;assistance for the victims of rape and support for the efforts to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>The killing, human misery and destruction in the former Yugoslavia has been horrific.  In such a war situation, it is not possible to give precise figures for the total number of casualties.  As many areas of conflict are inaccessible, verification of reported casualties by agencies on the ground is extremely difficult.  However, I believe that well in excess of 30,000 people have been killed and, as I indicated earlier, some 20,000 Muslim women have been raped.  UNHCR estimates that there are some 3 million displaced persons and refugees in the region and a further 700,000 in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The International Conference, cochaired by the EC and UN, is working to find a comprehensive solution to the conflict.  The primary objective in recent months has been a durable and lasting settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina.  This is essential for an overall settlement.  The plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina proposes constitutional arrangements, boundaries for ten provinces and arrangements to govern the cessation of hostilities and related monitoring.</P>
    <P>With its EC partners, Ireland has <Col N="836" /> called on the Security Council to give its full support both to the plan and the related interim arrangements to apply in advance of elections.  We have strongly urged all Bosnian parties to accept these proposals.  However, should the proposals developed by the International Conference be rejected, the Security Council will need to consider what further measures should be taken.</P>
    <P>The assistance provided to the conference by the UN, which we have actively supported, has been invaluable. Some 23,000 UN personnel are now serving in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Ireland has provided 36 personnel from the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána for service with the UN and EC Monitor Mission in the area.  I pay tribute to their bravery and dedication.</P>
    <P>To reduce the possibility of conflict spillover to neighbouring states, Ireland supported the despatch of a CSCE long term mission to Kosovo where tensions between its Albanian population and the Serbian authorities are high.  We would also wish to see a UN Peacekeeping presence established in Kosovo.  We strongly support meaningful negotiations on an autonomous status for that province.</P>
    <P>We have supported the deployment of UN Peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where inter-ethnic tension has also reached dangerous levels.  The Community is providing technical and financial assistance to that republic.  We have made clear our readiness to recognise the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. However, we wish this to be done in a manner which would avoid creating a further area of tension and potential conflict in the Balkans.  We therefore strongly support the efforts currently underway to seek a compromise on the name of the new state and on security measures between it and Greece.</P>
    <P>The members of the European Community have continued to withhold recognition from the federal entity of Serbia and Montenegro.  Primary responsibility for the violence and <Col N="837" /> destruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina rests with them.  The implementation of EC and UN sanctions is being reinforced. Further measures that might be necessary have been identified.</P>
    <P>Ireland has contributed £310,000 to the humanitarian relief effort, including financial assistance to the Sarajevo airlift operation and to the UNHCR.  We are considering what further contributions might be possible.  Two Irish Defence Forces personnel are assisting the UNHCR.

      <Quest>the initiatives, if any, which he has taken at UN or EC level to bring about a settlement of the postelection civil strife in Angola; if he will make a statement on the safety of any Irish personnel serving with the UN or otherwise in that country; and the level of diplomatic relations maintained with that country.</Quest>

      <P>Although Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Angola, we have followed with concern the deteriorating situation in that country.  We fully support all international efforts to bring about an immediate cease-fire, as part of a process leading to democracy in Angola.  At the meeting of the Southern African Development Community in Harare on 28 January, the Irish delegation called on all Angolans to respect the Bicesse peace agreements and to use them as a basis on which to build a new, prosperous Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve have called on both parties, and especially UNITA, to abide by the Bicesse Peace Accords and to resume the demobilisation process.  On 22 January, the Community and its member states called upon the President of Angola and the UNITA leader to respond positively to the UN Secretary-General's <Col N="838" /> call for an early meeting between them.  We are encouraged that representatives from the two parties met at the end of January in Addis Ababa, but a real commitment to a peaceful and stable Angola is required from both sides.</P>
    <P>In restating the Twelve's call to the two leaders to meet, I would also urge the military commanders of the Government and UNITA to meet to agree an immedate cease-fire.  The Twelve will continue to follow closely events in Angola and to take whatever action is possible in support of the restoration of peace to that war-torn country.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council on 29 January decided to extend the mandate of the UN Verification Mission in Angola (UNAVEM II) for a further three months to 30 April 1993.  In doing so, it strongly condemned the persistent violations of the peace accords, particularly the initial rejection by UNITA of the election results, and the resumption of hostilities.  It called upon both the Government and UNITA to fulfil their obligations under the peace accords. Ireland fully supports the UN Security Council's decision.</P>
    <P>There are currently two Irish military observers in Luanda.  They are coming to the end of their assignment and are expected to leave Angola at the end of February.  There are also two other Irish citizens working with the UN in Angola. All four individuals are reported to be safe.  A small number of missionaries are known to be working in Angola.  My Department will continue to remain in contact with their orders here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">

      <P>I am satisfied that the British <Col N="839" /> Government are aware of widespread concern at comments made by Mr. Mates some time ago, before he assumed ministerial office, which were broadcast on RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; TV programme of 28 January.  The British Government are also fully aware of the view of successive Irish Government that those killed on Bloody Sunday were engaged in peaceful protest and were not involved in violence. I therefore welcome the recent explicit recognition by the British Prime Minister that the victims of Bloody Sunday should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.  Mr. Major's statement clearly represents the authoritative position of the British Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>In the context of Northern Ireland the need for sensitivity in dealing with difficult and often emotive issues is obvious. There is therefore a particular responsibility on all those in public life to judge carefully the impact of their words so as to avoid exacerbating an already difficult situation.</P>

      <P>In 1992, 85 people died as a result of political violence in Northern Ireland.  Figures available for the first 11 months of 1992 indicate that during this period 1,020 persons suffered injuries due to political violence and there were 198 explosions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in Northern Ireland is entitled to lead his or her life in peace, protected from the threat of murder or maiming by paramilitaries.  I have made clear my utter revulsion at the heinous <Col N="840" /> activities of these groups, from whatever side they come.  Just as I have condemned Republican paramilitaries, I condemn the murderous brutality of Loyalist paramilitaries who last year were responsible for more deaths than any other group.</P>
    <P>The paramilitary threat was discussed in detail at last weeks meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference. The conference expressed its total and unequivocal condemnation of recent murders and other terrorists acts, from whichever section of the community they came.</P>
    <P>I emphasised to the Secretary of State at our meeting last week the Government's concern that everything possible be done to protect those at risk and the absolute need to bring to justice those responsible for crimes of violence.  Both Governments were in full agreement that the threat of violence must be faced as resolutely and effectively as possible, whatever the source.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a founder member of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which, since its establishment in 1973, has built up a set of principles and mechanisms governing such areas as security in Europe, European disarmament, co-operation on human rights, and co-operation in economics, science and technology and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Paris Summit in November 1990, at which the Heads of State or Government signed the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the CSCE has taken on new functions as a pan-European forum for security co-operation.  The Security Forum, established in Vienna last September, is involved in new negotiations on arms control, disarmament and confidence and security-building, as <Col N="841" /> well as playing an important role in conflict prevention.  The CSCE has also begun to establish new structures and institutions to meet the challenges posed by the rapidly changing political and security situation in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The CSCE has developed a wide range of procedures and mechanisms for crisis management and conflict prevention. CSCE missions are currently operating in several Eastern European countries and the former Yugoslavia to help organise ceasefires, to investigate human rights violations and to assist in the implementation of the U.N. sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>At the CSCE Council of Ministers meeting in Stockholm last December further structural reforms were agreed including the appointment of a CSCE Secretary-General and a High Commissioner on National Minorities.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates actively in the work of the CSCE at official and ministerial level.  We also work closely with our EC partners to present common positions in many areas of the CSCE.  We attach considerble importance to the role of the CSCE and will continue to play a full part in its activities, in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 59, 65 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>On 18 December Ireland together with its partners in the European Community, condemned Israel's decision to deport more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon. We urged the Israeli authorities to allow the deportees to return immediately.</P>
      <P>Since then I have written to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shimon Peres, making clear my great concern about the deportations; and I repeated my views to him at our bilateral meeting in Brussels on 1 February.  I stressed that the deportations, which took place without prior recourse to the Israeli legal system and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Resolution 799 of the Security Council, are contrary to international law and humanitarian principles.  Moreover, they have the political consequence of serving the interests of extremists who are seeking to destroy the Middle East peace process.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Israeli Government has decided to permit about 100 deportees to return and to reduce the deportation period for the others.  This is a step in the right direction, but it is insufficient.  We shall continue to press Israel, bilaterally and through the European Community, to comply in full with Security Council Resolution 799.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of UN sanctions is a matter for the UN Security Council, but I do not believe that the imposition of sanctions against Israel would be appropriate <Col N="843" /> while international efforts are under way to find a solution.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this issue particularly at the present time.  I may add that the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has been a central concern of the CSCE since its inception.</P>
      <P>The Charter of Paris for a New Europe signed by the CSCE Heads of State or Government in 1990 acknowledged that the rights of persons belonging to national minorities must be fully respected as part of universal human rights.  Subsequently, a meeting of Experts of National Minorities was convened in Geneva in July 1991 to hold a thorough discussion on the issue of national minorities and of the rights of persons belonging to them.</P>
      <P>The CSCE Heads of State or Government at their meeting in Helsinki in July 1992 decided to appoint a High Commissioner on National Minorities.  The Commissioner's mandate is to provide &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; and, as appropriate, &ldquo;early action&rdquo; in regard to tensions involving national minority issues that have the potential to develop into a conflict within the CSCE area, affecting peace, stability, or relations between CSCE Participating States.  The distinguished former Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Max van der Stoel, has recently taken up the position of High Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high priority attached by the Participating States to the minorities issue is also reflected in the decision of the Helsinki Summit to convene a Seminar <Col N="853" /> on Case Studies on National Minorities Issues for May 1993.  The Seminar, which will be organised by the CSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, will provide a forum in which the difficult situation facing minorities in many parts of Europe can be examined and views exchanged on how to provide for increased protection of minority rights.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Irish Official Development Assistance is to increase the capacity of the beneficiary countries to deal with the problems of their development and, in particular, to help to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged in the target countries.  In order to meet this objective, Ireland makes available to the beneficiary countries, either bilaterally or through international agencies and organisations, manpower, training, skills and material resources.</P>
      <P>Where it is possible and appropriate to do so, the resources made available under the programme are sourced in Ireland.  In addition, my Department encourages and assists Irish companies and individuals to compete for contracts in the aid field with, in particular, international agencies such as the EC, the UN and the World Bank.  Of course, the primary aim of ODA is the development of the beneficiary countries.</P>

It entered into force in January 1969. Ireland signed the Convention on 21 March 1968.  Ratification was delayed pending our adherence to other major UN human rights agreements, specifically the UN Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
      <P>In 1989, the Oireachtas enacted the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, which provides for protection from any form of incitement to hatred against groups of persons in the State on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 102 and 113 together.  I do not accept that there is discrimination in tax treatment as between widowed persons, on the one hand, and married couples, on the other. I assume that the Deputies' concerns stem from the tax treatment of widows-widowers in the years subsequent to the year of bereavement.  The position here is that the doubled rate bands available to married couples were introduced in the light of the Supreme Court Ruling in the Murphy case and, in accordance with that decision, are given in respect of two adults.</P>
      <P>The special position of widowed persons is recognised by the provision of a widowed personal allowance, currently standing at £2,600 compared to the single person's allowance of £2,100.  There is also a special ceiling on mortgage interest relief currently standing at £2,320 compared to £1,600 for a single person.  These provisions allow greater tax relief for widowed persons than is available to a single person.  Widowed persons with children, are also entitled to a widowed parent allowance, which brings the total basic allowances of a widowed parent up to the same level as those of a married couple.  In recognition of the special difficulties faced by widowed parents in the years following bereavement, a special tax allowance was introduced in 1991 for widowed parents with dependent children, to operate for the first three years following bereavement.  The allowance is £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second and £500 for the third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of the introduction of further concessions such as a housekeeper's allowance for widowed parents, I would point out that such an allowance would not only be costly in itself but it would be bound to lead to <Col N="859" /> calls for a similar allowance from other groups which would, in equity, be hard to resist.  The loss to the Exchequer would have to be made up by increased taxation elsewhere.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent decision issued by the European Commission to grant loans to the Eastern European Nuclear Industry; the plants, if any, to which this money has been allocated; and the financial implications, if any, for Ireland of this decision.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a draft decision dated 9 December 1992 which has been submitted by the European Commission to the Council of the European Communities.  This decision proposes to amend the existing Council decision in order to allow EURATOM loans to be made in respect of projects outside the Community in order to contribute to the financing required for improving the degree of efficiency and safety of nuclear power stations in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CCCE) and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the draft decision is solely to permit the use of EURATOM loans to contribute to the financing required to improve the efficiency and safety of existing unsafe nuclear power stations in these countries.  The Commission and indeed the international community has, for some time now, been seriously concerned with the state of many of the nuclear reactors in operation in these countries in that they do not meet internationally recognised safety standards.  The scale of the problems involved in the process of economic and social reform is such that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS are unable to find the necessary resources to finance improvements.  The Commission has therefore proposed that financing be provided from EURATOM <Col N="860" /> borrowings within the ceiling currently authorised.  This ceiling has not been reached due to the slowdown of investment in the nuclear industry within the Community.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say at this stage what particular plants will benefit but special emphasis is being placed on Soviet-designed reactors known as RBMKs (graphite-moderated pressure-tube type boiling water reactor), and VVERs (pressurised water reactor).</P>
    <P>Under existing EC budgetary arrangements, the proposal, if accepted, will not, in itself have direct financial implications for Ireland.  The guarantee of the State in which the project is located will normally be required for each loan though other first class securities may also be contemplated.  Only in the event of a default by the loan recipients or their governments would the proposal have some impact on the EC General Budget causing a small net increase in Ireland's EC Budget Contribution to cover any such defaults.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operations and role of the credit unions are essentially different from those of commercial deposit-taking institutions such as banks and building societies. The tax treatment of credit unions reflects the Government's acknowledgment of this difference.  When the DIRT arrangements were introduced in 1986, the then Government agreed that DIRT would not apply to interest income from credit unions, and this remains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the announcement of the new <Col N="862" /> DIRT arrangements in April of last year, the Irish League of Credit Unions has not requested the facility to offer savings facilities with the same DIRT arrangements as will apply for other deposit-taking institutions.  The League has indicated to me that it sets great store by the mutuality principle which underlies the credit unions, and which is distinct from the profit motivation of the banks.  The League considers that the extension of the new arrangements for Special Savings Accounts to credit unions would put them in the same category as the banks, a category in which the credit unions are adamant that they do not belong.</P>

      <P>The performance-related pay range recommended for the grade of Assistant Secretary in Report No. 30 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was put into effect on 1 January 1990.  Progress within the pay range, which replaced a fixed incremental scale, is dependent on the outcome of a formal assessment and rating of the individual's performance over the previous 12 months' service.</P>
      <P>Of the 111 staff serving on 1 January 1990, 109 opted to have the pay range applied to them.  Of the latter 71 had one year or more service on the maximum of the incremental pay scale and of these 37 were rated &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo;, 20 &ldquo;more than satisfactory&rdquo; and 14 &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; under the formal assessment procedures.  Available central records do not show the number of Assistant Secretaries who had actually completed one year's service on the maximum of that scale during 1990.</P>
      <P>The total number of Assistant Secretaries (and spouses) who had retired before 1 January 1990 and who had their pensions calculated by reference to a point on the pay range was 64.  Forty-three were placed on the maximum of the pay range, 13 were placed on the second last point and eight were placed on the third last point.</P>

    <P>Report No. 35 of the Review Body recommended that the pay range arrangement introduced in January 1990 be replaced by one consisting of an incremental scale plus bonus for performance assessed as exceptional.  This recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government.</P>

I have no objection in principle to this procedure.  Departments are encouraged to ensure that recently established firms, or firms which do not have previous experience of publicly funded contracts, are not excluded from invitation to tender without adequate grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of commercial State bodies <Col N="867" /> I am not aware, nor would I expect to be, having regard to the principle of commercial freedom for such bodies which was agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> of the procedures followed in this regard.  A decision of this nature is a matter for the commercial judgment of each State body.</P>

      <P>These savings schemes are not comparable. Savings Certificates provide a guaranteed tax-free return over a period of five years.  While the new Special Savings Accounts to which the 10 per cent Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) applies can offer a guaranteed rate of return for a maximum of two years, most of the rates on offer at present are for much shorter periods.  The returns available on Savings Certificates are kept under constant review.</P>

The effective rate of income tax given is the average effective rate of tax levied on each pound of total income as illustrated by the calculation in Table 52 of the Statistical Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1991.</P>

    <P>**Provisional estimates.</P>
    <P>2.  The income base liable to employee PRSI is reckonable earnings from insurable employment up to the income ceiling less superannuation contributions. There is also a low earnings threshold.  Figures are not available in respect of the PRSI income base but the yield from employee PRSI is shown in the table below.  The effective rate of PRSI on income up to the relevant ceiling is the same as the contribution rate.  For Class A employee PRSI, the rates for the relevant years are as follows; from 1979-80, the rate was 4.4 per cent; the 1980-81 rate was 4.5 per cent; the 1981-82 rate was 4.75 per cent and from 1982-83 to 1991-92 the rate was 5.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>3.  Figures are likewise not available in respect of the income base liable to the levies.  These are now collectible on reckonable earnings from insurable employment, as for employee PRSI, but with no ceiling, and on income from a trade or profession and on investment income.  There was a separate ceiling for <Col N="873" /> the Health levy up until 1991 when it was abolished.  The Health levy rate for the relevant years was 1 per cent from 1979-80 to 1986-87.  From 1987-88 to 1991-92 the rate was 1.25 per cent.  The Employment and Training levy which was introduced in 1982 has been charged at 1 per cent since 1982.  The Income levy which was charged at 1 per cent of income in the years 1983-1985 applied to the same income base as the other levies. Yield figures for the levies are on the table below.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics relating to the number of jobs created each year by the Business Expansion Scheme are not available.  However, in late 1990 a general review of the scheme was conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of the Marine, Tourism and Transport and Industry and Commerce. The review identified growth of approximately, 4,250 jobs in some 347 companies which had received almost £95 million investment under the scheme at a cost of some £49 million to the Exchequer.</P>

    <P>Statistics on the Business Expansion <Col N="877" /> Scheme are compiled by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of amounts invested in the scheme as formally notified to them in the tax year ending on 5 April each year.  On that basis, the estimated tax forgone on investments notified to the Commissioners in the tax years 1984-85 to 1992-93 are as follows:</P>

    </P>
    <P>(1)  The figures cover more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  They include tax <Col N="878" /> paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  They also include the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(2)  These figures include tax paid on income from trades and professions (including farming), together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  They also include withholding tax on professional fees.</P>
    <P>The yield in 1991 from non-PAYE taxpayers was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £30 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.</P>
    <P>The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>The figures in the table do not include receipts of deposit interest retention tax or of certain other miscellaneous tax payments. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these tax payments which are attributable to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that applications for sub-contractors C2 certificates have been refused on the basis that applicants have no fixed place of business in situations where such applicants are farmers' sons working from their parents' farms; and his views on whether this should be a valid ground of objection to the entitlement to C2 tax clearance certificates for those who are setting up as sub-contractors.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions to be met in order to qualify for a C2 certificate, which enables the applicant to receive payments from principal contractors without deduction of income tax, are as set out in Section 17 (7) (a) Finance Act 1970 (as amended). In summary form, these conditions are:</P>
      <P>(i)  that the person is, or is about to become, a sub-contractor engaged in the business of carrying out construction contracts (which last year &mdash; Section 28, Finance Act 1992 &mdash; was extended to include forestry operations and meat processing operations),</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the business is or will be carried on from a fixed place of business and has the equipment etc. required,</P>
      <P>(iii)  that proper records are kept,</P>
      <P>(iv)  that the person and his partners etc., have a record of tax compliance over the qualifying period, which is usually three years.</P>
      <P>However, the 1970 Act, in Section 17 (7) (b), gives Revenue the discretion to issue a C2 even when the full requirements are not met.  Accordingly, each case will be considered by Revenue on its own merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of a permanent address would not be the most likely basis for a refusal of a C2.  It is more likely that the reason would be the <Col N="880" /> lack of a tax compliance history over the qualifying period.</P>
    <P>In the case of farmers' sons working from their parents' farms, that should normally meet the requirement about a fixed place of business.</P>
    <P>In practice, the only category which would definitely not receive a C2 would be those who had not established a tax history.  According to the Revenue Commissioners, individuals in this group, if compliant for the tax year 1992/93 and subsequent years, will be considered for a C2 in later years.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the absence of a certificate need not prevent an individual or a company from carrying on a business as a sub-contractor.  If a sub-contractor on a construction, meat processing or forestry project does not have a C2 certificate, tax should be deducted from payments at a rate of 35 per cent and remitted to Revenue to be held on account pending finalisation of the tax liabilities of the sub-contractor.  Claims should be submitted to the inspector of taxes at four weekly intervals for repayment of any tax over-deducted.</P>

This river is not included in the priority lists of catchments which comprise the arterial drainage programme and there are no plans at present to undertake a drainage scheme in the catchment.  In these circumstances the question of a survey does not arise. Between 1969 and 1970 a minor scheme of works was carried out in conjunction <Col N="881" /> with the Northern Ireland Drainage Authorities on the Kilcoo River, also known as the County River, which for part of its length forms the Border between Counties Leitrim and Fermanagh and flows into Lough Melvin at its south-eastern shore.

      <P>The tax concessions for disabled drivers are provided for in the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989. When those Regulations were made in December 1989, an undertaking was given that they would be reviewed after they had been in operation for a year.  A considerable amount of work has been done in relation to this review but, unfortunately, it has not been possible to finalise it to date, primarily, because of work pressures arising from the very considerable volume of legislation which had to be processed throughout 1992 in preparation for the Single Market.  The completion of the review will be accorded priority once the forthcoming budget is out of the way.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to Areas of Scientific Interest.</P>
      <P>The identification of a site as an Area of Scientific Interest by the Office of Public Works does not prohibit a farmer selling his land or using it for afforestation. Consequently, the question of compensation does not arise.</P>
      <P>However, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works acts in an advisory capacity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other grant-aiding authorities, where proposed developments are to take place within Areas of Scientific Interest.</P>
      <P>If the National Parks and Wildlife Service advises that the proposed development will be environmentally damaging, then the grant aiding Department normally refuse grant aid.</P>
      <P>Government approval was given in December last year to designate a million and a quarter acres of land as Natural Heritage Areas.  These are the most important areas for conservation of Ireland's native flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>As a first step, Areas of Scientific Interest will be re-surveyed and designated as Natural Heritage Areas where they meet the necessary criteria.</P>
      <P>Under the Agri-Environment measures arising from Common Agricultural Policy reform, the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry is drawing up a scheme of aid for environmentally friendly farming.  Farmers whose land is in areas designated as Natural Heritage Areas may apply for such aid subject to certain conditions.  The details of the scheme will not be available until late 1993.</P>

      <P>Health Boards do not maintain statistical records in such a way as to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  It is estimated, that total expenditure on rent supplements under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme was in the region of £14 million in 1991 and £23 million in 1992.  The average weekly number of recipients in receipt of a rent supplement was approximately 9,300 in 1991 compared to 13,200 in 1992.</P>

      <P>It is my Department's policy to minimise customer inconvenience when seeking departmental services by introducing measures which reduce the need for recourse to Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  These measures are aimed at reducing the time taken by the Department to process claims for unemployment payments and where possible to pay claimants their unemployment payments from the first due date.  The measures include interviewing customers at local offices when they are making claims and using existing information on household income to speed up decision making.  In recent months recourse to supplementary welfare allowance, on an interim basis to those awaiting an unemployment payment, has been reduced significantly in the Eastern Health Board area following the introduction of such measures.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of carer's allowance is that the carer must be in a position to provide constant full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner(s).  In order to give this level of care, the scheme requires the carer to reside with the pensioner and not to be employed or self-employed outside the home.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, the person concerned failed to satisfy this condition of the scheme as she was employed outside the home on a part-time basis for five days each week.  Therefore, her application for Carer's Allowance was not allowed and she was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>She later appealed this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office which upheld the decision to disallow her application.  The decision of the Appeals Office in this matter is final and may only be changed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>If the employment circumstances of the person concerned change such that she fulfils the qualifying conditions of the scheme, she should re-apply for the allowance then.</P>

      <P>People in receipt of pensions from the United Kingdom can experience gains or losses in £ Irish terms with changes in the UK/Irish exchange rate. The deterioration in the value of sterling in recent months has meant that the advantage previously enjoyed when the Irish pound was below parity with sterling, has been eroded.</P>
      <P>A person in recipt of a UK Retirement Pension may also be entitled, if aged over 66, to an Old Age Non-Contributory Pension from my Department.  The UK Pension, would count as means for this purpose converted to Irish pounds by reference to an average exchange rate used by my Department.  A UK pensioner who is already in receipt of an Old Age Non-Contributory Pension and whose means have dropped as a result, is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of UK pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance for their family size, may contact the Community Welfare Officer at their local Health Centre.</P>
      <P>The recent 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish punt will also have the effect of significantly increasing the value of pensions payable from the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community Regulations on social security prescribe the procedures to be followed by member states in dealing with claims to benefit or pensions made by persons who have worked in more than one member state. It is a principle stated in the Regulations that the member states shall co-operate in processing claims as if they were dealing with a claim under their own legislation.</P>
      <P>When a claim for pension is made to my Department it is normal practice to examine entitlement to a pension based solely on the Irish insurance record initially.  Where the Irish insurance record is insufficient to secure a pension, entitlement may be established by combining insurance from more than one State (usually the United Kingdom in the case of Irish applicants).  Based on the proportion of contributions paid in each State, a pension known as a <i>pro rata</i> pension is awarded by one or &mdash; if there are sufficient contributions &mdash; each of the States involved (according to the rules applying in each State).  Until all the details are available on the number of contributions paid in each State it is impossible to determine accurately entitlement in any of the particular States.</P>
      <P>In cases involving aggregation of Irish and UK records for persons who lodge a claim in Ireland, my Department requests the UK Department of Social Security to supply the UK social insurance record.  A copy of the person's Irish insurance record is sent to the UK Department at that time to assist in the processing of possible UK entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has established a very good working relationship with the UK Department of Social Security.  The procedures laid down by the EC Regulations are followed when processing claims. However, where problems arise these are quickly addressed at operational level.  In addition regular meetings are held between the two Departments to discuss <Col N="893" /> ways of improving bilateral procedures and minimising delays.  My Department is satisfied generally with the service provided by the Department of Social Security and with the liaison arrangements currently operating as regards pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>Similar liaison arrangements are in place with the UK Department for claims to either Disability and Unemployment Benefit in cases where a person's Irish insurance record is insufficient.  Every effort is made to ensure that a prompt reply is made by the UK authorities, including telephone contact if necessary.</P>
    <P>Due to the difficulties associated with compiling insurance records, it is understandable that delays will occur in individual cases.  In processing pension claims regard must be had to the complete insurance record of the pensioner.  It may be difficult to compile this complete record, particularly if the pensioner moved several times between states.  Pensioners may not always be able to provide necessary details such as insurance numbers, addresses at which they lived or names of employers.</P>
    <P>It is not normally feasible to award an interim contributory pension while awaiting an insurance record from the Department of Social Security.  Without the UK record it is not possible to work out the pensioner's correct entitlement. It is also possible that even when the insurance records are combined that no entitlement to pension will be established.</P>
    <P>If there is an undue delay in compiling an insurance record the pensioner may be invited to apply for a non-contributory pension as an interim measure.  The pensioner also has the option of applying for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy the person concerned does not have sufficient Irish contributions to qualify her for a retirement pension under domestic legislation.  The Department of Social Security were requested on 23 November 1992 to provide details of her UK insurance record.  To date they have been unable to confirm her UK record.  My Department are aware though that the <Col N="894" /> person concerned was provided with details of her UK record by the UK Department of Social Security in November 1992 but the Benefits Agency of that UK Department are not satisfied that this is her complete record.</P>
    <P>Having examined the case, however, my Department are reasonably satisfied that the pensioner's complete UK record may not be substantially different from the details already supplied to her by the UK Department of Social Security.  It has been decided, therefore, to award her an Irish pension on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  The rate calculated is based on the UK record currently available.  If it eventually transpires that she has additional UK contributions which would have the effect of reducing the Irish element of the combined entitlements from both countries she will be obliged to refund to the Department any excess of Irish pension received.</P>
    <P>On this basis her weekly pension entitlement is provisionally set at £58.40 and is payable from 26 November 1992. My Department have arranged to issue a pension book to her.</P>

A payment of £5 per week is payable to eligible households from mid-October to mid-April.

      <P>My Department is committed to improving its services and facilities for all its customers.  Its plans for improved services include the substitution of cash payments by more modern payment methods and the introduction of more flexible signing arrangements.  These innovations will dramatically improve the queuing difficulties being experienced at some of the Department's local offices at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main queuing problem in the Department's Local Office in Castlebar arises essentially from the fact that some customers arrive outside the office from 9 a.m. onwards on pay days whereas the payout cannot begin until 10.15 a.m. when cash can be delivered by a local bank.  The payout arrangements have been well established for many years and would be well known in the area.  To facilitate customers the office extended the pay out time on Tuesdays into the <Col N="896" /> afternoon in October last.  More modern payment methods were introduced for just over 400 customers of the Castlebar Office in November, 1992.  These customers now &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; monthly and are paid at their local Post Office by &ldquo;Post-draft&rdquo;; this means that payout times for them are considerably extended.  It is hoped to extend modern payment methods to customers being paid in cash at this office in the near future.</P>

      <P>Credited PRSI contributions serve to protect a person's entitlement to social insurance benefits and pensions. They are used in conjunction with paid PRSI contributions in determining an applicant's entitlement.</P>
      <P>The benefits protected are those in respect of which the person had been insured when last in insurable employment which varies with the class or rate of PRSI contribution paid.  For example, for persons who had been insured at Class A rates, credited contributions are taken into account in determining entitlements to both long term and short term Social Welfare payments such as: Invalidity Pension; Retirement Pension; Old Age Contributory Pension; Deserted Wife's Benefit; Widow's and Orphan's Pensions; Unemployment Benefit; Disability Benefit; Maternity Benefit and Treatment Benefits.</P>
      <P>Similarly for those who had been in public sector employments and insured at Class B, the credits would normally reckon only towards Widow's and Orphan's Pension and related benefits.</P>

      <P>The social welfare legislation provides that a person who has paid less than 260 PRSI contributions since he or she first entered insurance is entitled to payment of disability benefit for a maximum period of 52 weeks.  To requalify for payment of disability benefit, a person requires a further 13 paid PRSI contributions or such lesser number as would bring to 260 the total number of PRSI contributions paid.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has a total of 249 contributions paid since she first entered insurance.  She made a claim to disability benefit on 22 September 1992.  However she had previously received payment of disability benefit for 52 weeks during the periods from 17 January 1990 to 21 June 1990 and from 28 September 1990 to 30 April 1991.  The deciding officer therefore disallowed her claim on the grounds that she had already received payment of disability benefit for the maximum period to which she was entitled and had not since requalified.  She was notified of this decision at the time.</P>
      <P>To requalify for further payment of disability benefit it would be necessary for the person concerned to be insurably employed for at least a further 11 weeks.</P>
      <P>She is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the appropriate maximum weekly rate of £129 up to 22 December 1992.  He was admitted to hospital on 20 December 1992 and claimed Disability Benefit.  He did not satisfy the contribution conditions for Disability Benefit and claimed Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  In assessing his entitlement to Supplementary Welfare Allowance the Community Welfare Officer took into account his wife's net earnings of £49.65 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> He was in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance in respect of the period 26 December 1992 up to 16 January 1993 and was paid at the weekly rate of £83.20 which included an £8 fuel allowance.  In addition, he was paid an exceptional needs payment amounting to £30.</P>
    <P>He reapplied for Unemployment Assistance on 11 January 1993 and resumed payment at the weekly rate of £129.  Further payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is administered by the Health Boards.  The scheme is designed to cater for immediate need and the determination of the rate payable in each case is a matter for the Health Boards. The provisions governing assessment of means for Supplementary Welfare Allowance purposes specify that the rate payable takes account of all household income.  In the assessment of means for Unemployment Assistance purposes a spouse's income up to a certain level is disregarded.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the delay in processing this application was due to the fact that it was in respect of the first registration of unregistered land, the title to which is based substantially on adverse possession. Acceptance of the title and the issue of notices to the interested persons had to await the lodgment of a supplementary affidavit claiming and establishing the adverse possession of the land. That affidavit was received in the Land Registry in August 1992 and the notices were issued in October 1992.  In the absence of any objection to the application, the finalisation of the registration was proceeded with and it was completed on 1 February 1993.  The applicant's solicitor has been so informed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> In addition, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act provides for a low cost purchase scheme in relation to existing ground rents on dwellinghouses. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987 extends indefinitely the operation of that scheme.</P>

      <P>While not accepting the Deputy's description of the conditions at Cork Courthouse, I am aware that conditions there are less than ideal.  To deal with these accommodation difficulties, the Office of Public Works was asked to conduct a study of what might be undertaken locally.  That office reported to my Department last week and I expect to make decisions on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the INOU on 4 February 1993, at their request and their application for funding <Col N="925" /> of £150,000 over a three year period was among the issues discussed.  I indicated at the meeting that I could make no commitment regarding financial assistance as such assistance would have to be decided in the context of a most difficult budget facing the Government and also in the context of the several other demands for assistance from groups assisting the unemployed including unemployed centres. In addition I indicated that perhaps my Department would not be the appropriate one to have responsibility for funding groups such as the INOU.</P>
      <P>The organisation will of course be able to continue to participate in the Social Employment Scheme through which it has already received funding of around £168,000.  The INOU have also received some £50,000 in aid for a project under the Horizon programme for the disadvantaged in respect of activities in the area of training for support workers in centres for the unemployed.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the IDA that since 1990, they have reported on their activities on the basis of actual job creation, actual spending by industry in the Irish <Col N="926" /> economy and the actual payment of grants to client companies.  Grant approval figures are no longer published as they have tended to confuse the situation in relation to actual payments to companies and hence the actual cost of industrial projects.

In this regard, I recently approved the tender proposal submitted by Dublin Corporation for phases 2B, 3 and 4 of the north city arterial watermain scheme which will significantly improve water supply services to this part of the city. I understand that the corporation have completed the contract arrangements for the construction of this scheme which is scheduled to commence shortly.</P>

      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): A major study in relation to recycling, commissioned by the Department of the Environment, has recently been completed.  The study examines a range of options for developing collection and recycling schemes and assesses the feasibility of various possible market interventions, including deposit refund schemes.  All of the options considered in the study will be evaluated in drawing up a national strategy on recycling.  As a first step in this process, I will shortly be seeking the views of industry, local authorities and consumers on the study's findings.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the housing needs in County Kildare as determined by the assessments of needs carried out by housing authorities as at 31 March 1991.  The results of the assessments are published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 1991, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  A further assessment is being carried out by housing authorities to determine the position as at 31 March 1993.</P>
      <P>Work on determining the number of houses to be allocated to each housing authority, including those in County Kildare, for the 1993 construction programme is well advanced and housing authorities will be notified of their allocations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The increased national programme of 3,500 local authority house starts for 1993, together with the various schemes under &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, will make a significant impact in reducing housing needs in County Kildare and elsewhere.  As already announced in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the aim of the Government's housing policies is to reduce the pressure on waiting lists to the greatest extent possible in the period 1993 to 1997.</P>

      <P>The proposals received from Kildare County Council regarding the traffic situation in Celbridge relate to non-national roads and the cost of implementing them falls to be financed from Kildare County Council's own resources, supplemented by the discretionary road grants provided annually for such roads.</P>
      <P>The question of providing grants, from the funds available for national roads, in respect of a further interchange on the Kilcock/Maynooth/Leixlip motorway would only arise in the context of a further motorway scheme under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974.  It is a matter for Kildare County Council to determine the scope of the works to be included in such a scheme.  Having regard to the evidence presented at the public inquiry into the existing scheme, particularly in relation to the need for and location of interchanges, a decision about the provision of road grants to meet the cost of preparation of a further scheme would not be appropriate until any such scheme has been determined.</P>
      <P>Having regard to my quasi-judicial function in relation to the determination of motorway schemes, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in the matter.</P>

The range of measures now available means that we can respond in a balanced way to the levels of threat presented by various types of dogs and the muzzling regulations are being reviewed in the context of these new provisions. There have been consultations with the Irish Veterinary Association, the Irish Kennel Club, the ISPCA and other bodies in relation to the control of dangerous dogs.

      <Quest>if in view of the fact that he requires a local public inquiry to be held into the environmental impact statement on the proposed new route of the N4 across the Curlews in counties Sligo and Roscommon, he will give the reason he has indicated to the county councils that they can go ahead with the preparation of compulsory purchase orders in connection with the preferred route and that the local public inquiry into the environmental impact statement would be held jointly with the inquiry into the compulsory purchase orders; whether holding the inquiry into the compulsory purchase orders for the preferred route before a decision on the environmental impact statement prejudices the whole issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The decision to hold one local public inquiry into the environmental impact statement and any compulsory purchase order that may arise in respect of the N4 Curlews project is in line with the practice currently applying to motorway projects and proposed to be applied to non-motorway road projects under Section 51 of the Roads Bill, 1991 as amended in Special Committee.  This approach allows all issues in relation to proposed projects to be considered together and avoids any unnecessary delays in completing interrelated statutory procedures.  The holding of a single local public inquiry and the concurrent determination of the environmental impact process and any necessary compulsory purchase order does not prejudice either process.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Council have been requested to review the environmental impact statement in the light of objections received, any new information available on sub-soil conditions and to have regard to these matters in drawing up any necessary compulsory purchase order.</P>

      <P>The decision reached on the Multi Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP) for the Irish fleet represents an extremely successful outcome for the Irish negotiators and has effectively reversed a previous Commission proposal which was to reduce our fishing fleet to around 35,000 GRT.  The objective for the Irish fleet at the end of this MAGP period, in 1996, is now 51,195 GRT, with some scope for increasing to 54,195 GRT.</P>
      <P>The MAGP decision divides the fleet into several categories, based on the species fished.  Some of these categories may have to be reduced slightly to bring capacity better into line with available stocks.  The policy and other implications of this decision generally for the Irish fleet are currently being considered.  The situation is that, with the assistance of EC funding, the fleet will be reoriented to exploit those species of fish where our quotas are not fully utilised and the fleet will be modernised in consultation with the industry and with European financial support.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 294, 297 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection rests with local coastal authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves.  Owners of private property have of course, the major role in protecting their own property.</P>
      <P>In order to formulate a programme of coast protection works for the next few years, the Department wrote to all maritime local authorities, Mayo included, in 1991, requesting them to submit a list of priorities for coast protection projects which they consider would be warranted and feasible and for which they would be prepared to make funds available.  To-date no reply has been received from Mayo County Council.</P>
      <P>When all the proposals from the various local authorities have been received I will examine the options available to me within available resources and put in place a comprehensive coast protection programme in which Mayo will be included.  The implementation of any programme will, of course, depend on the availability of funding from national and Community sources.</P>
      <P>Expenditure from the Vote of the Office of Public Works on coast protection in 1989 and from the Vote of the Department in 1990, 1991 and 1992 was as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333, 334 and 335 together.</P>
      <P>Applicants are assessed for installation aid on the basis of the date of setting up or installation.  In the case of a full-time farmer, the appropriate date is that on which the transfer documents are signed.  Where the applicant is a part-time farmer, the appropriate date for assessment is the date on which he/she sets up as a full-time farmer.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, the Labour Unit (MWU) for the holding is calculated on the basis of a standard man year of 2,100 hours.  Each enterprise on the holding is allocated a number of standard man days. The total man days for the holding is then divided by 225 standard man days in a standard man year, to give the Man Work Unit (MWU) requirement for the holding. Applicants for installation aid have two years from the date of setting up to attain the appropriate MWU.  Calculation of the MWU is carried out on the basis of the production year immediately preceding setting-up.</P>
      <P>All lands farmed by the applicant whether in full ownership, by lease or conacre are taken into account when calculating the MWU of the total farm enterprise.  However, only land owned or held on long term lease, minimum six years, can be included for determining eligibility for installation aid purposes. Thus where conacre or land held on short term lease is involved a pro-rata calculation is done to establish the appropriate MWU.</P>

      <P>The tax clearance system, which was introduced in 1988, applies to all grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities.  The aim of the system is to ensure that individuals who benefit from public grants or subsidies have their tax affairs in order.  From 1 September 1991 this system was extended to cover all payments of over £500, except payments <Col N="985" /> made under the Guarantee Section of FEOGA.</P>
      <P>The general position is that in order to qualify for grants between £500 and £5,000 the applicant must indicate on his grant application the tax district dealing with his affairs, furnish his tax reference number and indicate that, to the best of his knowledge, his tax affairs are in order. In the case of grants of £5,000 or more the applicant is required to produce a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In view of the difficulties this time frame posed for some farmers, particularly in the disadvantaged areas, the Government decided early in 1992 to postpone, until January, 1994, these requirements for headage grant applications by farmers in disadvantaged areas who did not yet have tax reference numbers. In addition steps are being taken to provide more comprehensive information to farmers in an effort to allay any fears about tax clearance particularly for those in receipt of social welfare means-tested benefits and pensions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340, 341, 395 and 396 together.</P>
      <P>It is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of Bovine TB and there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.  This view was supported at the Royal Irish Academy Conference on &ldquo;The Badger&rdquo; which was held in 1991.  In addition, a Review by the Economic and Social Research Institute entitled &ldquo;Badgers and Bovine TB in Ireland&rdquo;, published in 1989, concluded that in many parts of the country it may not be possible to control bovine TB without controlling the badger population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to control, badgers are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may only be removed under licence.  Where my Department is satisfied that there is a probable link between badgers and an outbreak of bovine TB in cattle application is made to the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works for a licence to remove badgers for postmortem. Applications are considered in the context of an agreed programme of research aimed at determining what role the badger plays in the transmission of bovine TB.  Badgers removed under licence are brought to the most conveniently <Col N="987" /> located veterinary laboratory for post mortem examination and disposal.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ongoing research projects including the quantifying of the number of badgers in the country and the incidence of TB in the badger population as well as examination of the extent to which the removal of badgers influences the level of bovine TB.  It is planned to commence a feasibility study shortly into the development of a vaccine for use in badgers and possibly other species.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the extent of Bovine Tuberculosis in the Aclare area of County Sligo, and I understand that a full disease investigation of the restricted holdings in the locality has been carried out.  Herdowners whose herds are restricted are being advised on an ongoing basis by departmental veterinary officials on the measures to be taken to combat infection. A licence to remove badgers from the area was obtained and operated which showed some indication of TB infection in the badger population. However, the nature of the terrain makes the identification of sets difficult and local herdowners have been asked to assist in this regard.  The overall position in County Sligo is that of 115 badgers taken for research in 1992, 16.5 per cent were found to have visible TB lesions.</P>
    <P>As part of the TB eradication programme high risk herds such as these are subjected to an intensive programme of special check testing.  In addition contiguous herds are being continuously monitored.</P>

      <P>The EC aid scheme for early retirement from farming which was established under Council Regulation EEC/No. 2079/92 requires an increase in the size of agricultural holding of the transferee so as to improve its economic viability.  As Community funding for the scheme will be provided only where an expansion has taken place, the intention is that the transferee must be in possession of some other land by lease or ownership prior to the transfer of land by the retiring farmer.  The size of the transferee's enlarged holding resulting from the transfer need not be greater than the transferor's original holding but must be such as to be capable of reaching an acceptable level of economic viability.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the enlargement provision laid down by the EC will not create undue difficulties for inter-family transfers.  Details of the scheme to operate in Ireland are at present being drawn up by my Department and it is expected that the scheme will be introduced, following clearance by the EC Commission, by the end of the summer of this year.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of establishing quotas for the suckler cow premium in 1992, farmers were allowed to apply in respect of dairy-type cows provided these cows were inseminated by a bull of a meat breed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible for the premium in future, suckler cows will have to be pure meat breeds or the progeny of a cross with a meat breed.  However, Ireland sought and obtained a derogation whereby producers who had received the premium in 1990 or 1991 will be allowed to include dairy-type cows inseminated <Col N="997" /> by bulls of a meat breed on their applications for 1993 and 1994.  However, the number of such cows eligible for the premium is limited to the total number of suckler cows in respect of which premium was paid in 1990 or 1991.</P>

      <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel is currently analysing in detail the data from the survey of the 10,000 townlands under appeal for inclusion into the disadvantaged areas.  When the panel has completed its analysis, it will make recommendations to the Department as to the new areas to be classified.  When the Department have examined the panel's recommendations I will seek Government approval to submit to the EC a formal request to extend the present disadvantaged areas in Ireland.  The EC Commission will in turn scrutinise the submission in detail and if satisfied prepare a proposal listing the townlands to be classified as disadvantaged for approval by the EC Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  When approved the list will be published by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Because of the size and complexity of the task it is not easy to predict when it will be finalised.  However, both my Department and the Appeals Panel are anxious to complete the entire appeals process as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the arable sector, producers of cereals, oilseeds and protein crops are entitled to claim compensatory payments subject to the setting aside in some circumstances of a proportion of arable land, which for this crop year is fixed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>Farmers entering 37 acres or less in this scheme are not required to withdraw land from production but may do so if they wish to avail of higher rates of compensation for oilseed and protein crops. Land must be left in set-aside for a seven month period commencing on 15 December 1992 and must be maintained in good agricultural condition without damaging the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to be eligible for set-aside, land must have been in arable production in the previous year; must not have been in permanent pasture for a five year period prior to 31 December 1991; and normally must have been farmed by the <Col N="1002" /> applicant in the two preceding years. Land set-aside under this scheme is subject to a six year rotation.  There is an option providing for non-rotational set-aside at a higher percentage of land withdrawal. The latter percentage has yet to be proposed by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The compensation payment currently fixed for the set-aside area is £261.91 per hectare (£105.99 per acre).</P>
    <P>An earlier aid scheme introduced in 1988, and designed to encourage the set-aside of arable land, was terminated in 1992.  However remaining payments arising from the five year set-aside arrangements under that scheme will continue until individual agreements have expired.</P>
    <P>As part of the agri-environment measure accompanying Common Agricultural Policy reform, aid may be given to farmers who undertake to set aside farmland for at least 20 years with a view to its use for purposes connected with the environment, in particular for the establishment of natural parks, the preservation of flora and fauna and the protection of hydrological systems.  My Department is currently drawing up a national scheme to give effect to this measure.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the report in question.  I have made a strong case to the Commission for aid for potato producers in County Donegal.  The Commission has replied that, while they can sympathise with the producers' difficulties, there are only limited means available to them to help in these circumstances and that it was never the intention that Community funds should be used to compensate for loss of income due to poor weather conditions.</P>
      <P>However, I am pursuing, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of Community intervention under the Community Support Framework for restoring agricultural production potential following natural disasters.</P>

At its meeting on 27 January 1993, the Government approved the following two Orders which delegate functions to both Ministers of State at my Department: (1) Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1993.  (2) Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 412 together.</P>
      <P>The timescale involved in processing applications for road freight carrier's licences for hauliers depends largely on whether or not the applicant has fully and correctly completed the application.</P>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations, 1991, applicants must satisfy the three main requirements of financial standing, good repute and professional competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> Where complete applications are received, the Department is generally in a position to issue licences within a period of three weeks of receipt.  Where incomplete applications are received, these are immediately returned to the applicants for rectification.  As a result the time it takes individual applicants to re-submit applications varies considerably from case to case.</P>
    <P>The system of application places the onus on the applicant to present initially to the Department a complete application, containing all the information and documentation required to assess and process the application.  The system is kept under constant review, with a view to minimising difficulties encountered by applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1987, the then Minister for Communications, Mr. Jim Mitchell, TD, announced the introduction of Multipoint Microwave Distribution Systems (MMDS) to this country.  In February 1988 his successor, Minister Burke, after a careful reappraisal of the matter announced the Government's decision to proceed with MMDS.  In effect, therefore, successive Governments have decided that it would neither be practical nor in the national interest to license illegal rebroadcasting or deflector systems. The reasons have been given in a number of replies to questions in this House.  In particular, I refer the Deputy to Question No. 65 on 18 May 1988, columns 1791-92, volume 380, Official Report No. 8 for that day, Question <Col N="1019" /> No. 87 on 20 November, 1990 columns 1802-3, volume 402, Official Report for that day and Question No. 2 on 2 April 1992, columns 417-419, volume 418 of the Official Report for that day.  It has also been explained in answer to parliamentary questions in the past why UHF deflector systems, for practical and policy reasons, cannot be licensed and, therefore, do not and never have constituted an acceptable alternative means of providing a multichannel television service on a nationwide basis to areas which are not cabled.</P>
      <P>On the question of cost I refer the Deputy to my predecessor's reply to Question No. 196 on 23 June 1992, columns 719-720, volume 421, No. 4, of the Official Report for that day.  Charges for MMDS will have to reflect the considerable investment involved in establishing MMDS systems and the ongoing operating costs such as licence fees and copyright charges associated with providing a high quality service on a national basis in a business-like way.  Inevitably, these costs will be higher than those associated with many of the deflector systems, which because of their illegal nature, avoid paying such costs. However, as with cable, there are &ldquo;easy payment&rdquo; schemes available to MMDS subscribers.</P>
      <P>The MMDS licence for the County Galway area, including Loughrea, is held by Cablelink Limited.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the situation where a survey of 12 countries reveals Ireland second from the top in the number of premature deaths from ischaemic heart disease affecting men between the age of 50 and 54; and the steps, if any, he intends to take to deal with this serious health problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the study to which the Deputy refers and the findings are, indeed, a cause for concern.  Ireland has had a relatively slow response rate to the international trends in the improvement in rates of premature death from heart disease but, nevertheless, there are now some encouraging and positive indications as far as this country is concerned. There have been decreases in the number of deaths from coronary heart disease in the 30-69 age group in both males and females during the 1980s of around 20 per cent.  While such reductions are welcome they are clearly no basis for complacency <Col N="1034" /> and my Department has a number of initiatives in place, and others planned, to maintain and accelerate the momentum in this area.</P>
      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit has initiated a major consultative exercise with the objective of agreeing a National Health Promotion Strategy which would be acceptable to and can be implemented by each of the eight health boards.  This strategy will seek to develop goals and targets for health promotion and to develop an agenda for national planning from which national priorities will emerge.  In this context it will be fully acknowledged that heart disease is the major cause of morbidity and premature mortality in Ireland and as such will be afforded the highest priority.  Last December, the Kilkenny Health Project, a major community-based research and demonstration pilot project funded by my Department and aimed at reducing the risk factors for ischaemic heart disease, submitted their report.  In finalising our National Strategy, full consideration will be given to the lessons learned from the Kilkenny Health Project.</P>
      <P>Parallel to the development of an effective intervention programme, it is necessary to have in place a research function which can give direction to the intervention and effectively evaluate the level of success.  In this context, my Department is currently seeking applications for a research project at national level which will monitor and analyse existing data on cardiovascular disease and in particular will analyse data on the intervention strategies most likely to be successful in preventing it.</P>
      <P>Effective intervention strategies generally require the co-ordinated efforts of relevant agencies both in the voluntary and statutory sector.  In this regard my Department has been supporting the Happy Heart initiative of the Irish Heart Foundation.</P>
      <P>In addition to these projects which are addressed specifically at preventing heart disease many other initiatives of my Department's Health Promotion Unit address individual risk factors for heart disease e.g. smoking, diet and exercise.</P>

      <P>Final details of funding of the Health Services in 1993 will not be known until Budget Day.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a number of commitments to improve health services for the elderly this year, including a reduction in hospital waiting lists for hip replacement, cataract operations and cardiac by-pass surgery, the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act and the publication of a health charter for the elderly.</P>
      <P>In addition, a sum of £400,000 has been made available to the National Co-ordinating Committee this year to achieve the objectives of the European Year in this country.

      <P>Over the last ten year period mortality rates from breast cancer per 100,000 female population has ranged between 32.9 in 1982 to 37.5 in 1991 (provisional figures) with a peak of 39.1 occurring in 1989.  The latest figures (1991 provisional) indicate that almost 55 per cent of deaths occurred in the over 65 age group.  My Department is supporting a major breast cancer screening programme currently underway at the Mater Foundation.  This programme, the Eccles Breast Screening Programme, is one of a network of seven pilot schemes on breast cancer screening in the European Community. The objectives of the screening programme are: to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women; to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women; to compare the specificity, sensitivity and <Col N="1046" /> predictive value of the mammography screening programme with that reported internationally.</P>
      <P>The programme is expected to finish its screening towards the end of 1994. This if the first programme of its kind in Ireland and the results of the programme will influence decisions on the national policy to be adopted in this area.</P>

My Department have participated in the work of the Advisory Committee on the Health Services established by the Health and Safety Authority, which has now published guidelines to assist health agencies to comply with the Act in the context of the particular hazards to be found in health care facilities.  Compliance with the Act is a matter for each individual employing authority.</P>
      <P>In regard to the particular comments referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that, provided correct safety procedures are followed, the staff working in nuclear medicine departments are not placed at any particular risk.  In regard to radiation risks, I would refer the Deputy to the detailed reply by the then Minister for Health to a question from him on 30 January, 1992 (Vol. 415, No. 2).  In relation to the other specific points raised, my Department have been active in advising health agencies in relation to protection of health staff from HIV and hepatitis B infection and have facilitated relevant hospital staff in obtaining vaccination against hepatitis.</P>

      <P>The full range of paediatric ophthalmology services, including neonatal services, is provided at the Department of Paediatric Ophthalmology, Temple Street Hospital. The Ophthalmology Department treats almost 7,000 out-patients and 550 inpatients per annum.</P>
      <P>There were 170 patients awaiting admission for ophthalmic surgery in the hospital, as of 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>I will consider as sympathetically as possible the recommendations for improvements made in the 1992 annual report of the Department of Paediatric Ophthalmology, in the context of the resources available to me in 1993.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, £20 million will be provided in 1993 for a major action programme to reduce hospital in-patient waiting lists in a number of specialities.  Ophthalmology will be a priority in the allocation of funds in this major action programme and I will be announcing my decisions in this matter in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the registration of stillbirths was not provided for in the original registration law which we have inherited from the last century, and it will require a change in primary legislation to achieve this.  However my Department have just begun a comprehensive review of the entire code of registration legislation covering births, deaths and marriages. The object of the review, which is a major task of considerable complexity, will be to determine how registration procedures and structures devised in Victorian times can be modified to suit modern conditions and needs.  I will ensure that the question of the registration of stillbirths is given sympathetic consideration within the context of the review.</P>

      <P>The Kilkenny health project, as the Deputy is aware, was a community based research and demonstration pilot project funded by my Department and aimed at reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Last December the project submitted their report to my Department.  It is a major objective of such a pilot project to provide lessons and experiences which <Col N="1054" /> can inform decisions about the interventions most likely to succeed at national level in reducing the incidence of heart disease.</P>
      <P>My Department's health promotion unit is currently preparing a national health promotion strategy document which will seek to develop an agenda for national planning from which national priorities will emerge.  It will be acknowledged in this strategy that heart disease is the major cause of morbidity and premature mortality in Ireland and as such will be afforded the highest priority. The lessons to be learned from the Kilkenny health project will be fully considered in the context of finalising the preparation of this strategy and it is my intention that significant funding will continue to be made available to address this serious health problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 and 474 together.</P>
      <P>Most health boards are now adopting a planned systematic approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children in preference to a demand based system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school based system ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes <Col N="1055" /> and to provide treatment if necessary. These classes are chosen with preventative treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and referred for treatment as necessary.  This development seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need and to ensure that all children have equal access to the same level of care.</P>
    <P>The generally accepted principles of public health dentistry do not require that all children should be screened by a dentist more than once every two years. The small number of children who require more frequent attendances will receive it under the systematic approach.</P>
    <P>All eligible children can, of course, avail of an emergency service for the relief of acute conditions requiring urgent attention.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the current difficulties at St. Mary's Nursing Home, Montenotte, Cork, and the anxiety that these difficulties are causing to patients of the home, to their relatives and to the staff working in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 73 patients resident in St. Mary's Nursing Home, of whom 40 are subvented by the Southern Health Board at a rate of £52.15 per week under Section 54 of the Health Act, 1970. <Col N="1056" /> As the remaining 33 patients, who are not entitled to receive section 54 subventions, are unable to meet the fees of the home, the Southern Health Board offered to subvent them under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970, at a rate of £52 per week for the duration of their stay in the home.</P>
    <P>The management of the home has rejected this offer and has demanded that subvention be paid in respect of the full complement of 90 beds, even though there are currently only 73 patients in the home and that the Southern Health Board makes St. Mary's financially viable.</P>
    <P>In view of its responsibility to allocate scarce funds for nursing care in a fair manner the Southern Health Board could not agree to these demands.  The Southern Health Board has been sympathetic to the difficulties being experienced at St. Mary's Home and has offered to make extra funds available over and above its obligation towards the home.  It is not the responsibility of health boards nor of my Department to ensure the viability of nursing homes which have been established by private individuals as private concerns.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are shortcomings in the current system of subvention of patients in nursing homes.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which will be implemented this year, within the overall resources made available to implement the Act provides a new system of subventing patients in nursing homes, following an assessment of the dependency and means of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>Some of the pupils in question are eligible for transport to Naas post-primary centre, the others to Celbridge post-primary centre.</P>
      <P>Because they are basically eligible for transport to one or other of these two centres, the most that can be offered to them in respect of their attendance at Clane is concessionary transport from the catchment boundary of their appropriate school.</P>
      <P>This concession is subject to spare seats being available on existing services, after all eligible pupils have been accommodated, and no extra cost being incurred.</P>

The Programme for a Partnership Government envisages the expansion of the psychological service to cover the whole primary sector to ensure that every child with learning or behavioural difficulties has access to help at the earliest stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a psychological service for the primary sector will take into account the results of a three year pilot project which commenced on 1 September 1990.  It is operating in two areas, one urban, West Tallaght/Clondalkin <Col N="1074" /> and one mainly rural, South Tipperary. An independent evaluator has been appointed to assess the project.</P>

      <P>I anticipate a decision being taken shortly on the number of pupils to be catered for in the school.  In that light, decisions will be taken in relation to the location and schedule of accommodation to be provided.  It is not possible, at this stage, to state when work on the proposed school is expected to begin or when it is likely to be completed.

      <P>Consultants were commissioned to assist my Department in a study to determine the need and provision for post-primary school places in the Castleknock/ Hartstown/Huntstown/Dunboyne areas.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study indicated that there was an immediate need for a new post primary school in Hartstown to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne. The findings also indicated that the needs of the Castleknock pupils can continue to be met by the post primary schools which currently cater for the majority of them.  The conclusions of the report has been accepted by the Department.  In view of other pressing demands on limited resources the provision of a separate primary school for the area would therefore not be appropriate in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The work of the consultants was confidential to the Department.  I would like to point out, however, that during the course of the study in question the consultants met with the local interest groups and their views were taken into account in the preparation of the report.  My Department also took full cognisance of the submission made by these groups.</P>
