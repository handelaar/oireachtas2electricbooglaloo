      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of additional legal experts who have been recruited by the Attorney General's Office since the Government assumed office.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two senior parliamentary draftsmen have been appointed to the Attorney General's office in the period in question.  It is likely that there will also be recruitment of legal assistants, additional to the filling of an existing vacancy for a legal assistant.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to passing the legislation necessary to implement the provisions of the Programme for a Partnership Government, we are examining the need to have additional legal expertise in individual Departments based on the legislative requirements of Departments.  We will recruit additional legal personnel judged necessary in the light of that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Does he consider that this meets the paragraph on drafting legislation set out in page 42 of the Programme for Government?  I would draw <Col N="714" /> the attention of the Taoiseach to page 18 of that programme which states that the Government proposes to put a time limit on debates on Bills at Second Stage and to examine the introduction of a procedure to allow individual Members to introduce Bills of a non-controversial nature.  In keeping with that promise, will the Taoiseach consider recruiting staff to the Houses of the Oireachtas so that Members of the House wishing to introduce Private Members' Bills can be facilitated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking a separate question.  We are talking here about the Attorney General's office, its staffing and what we are doing about it. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that 43 Bills have been published this year, a 100 per cent increase on previous years; 32 Bills were listed for publication, 12 have been published and we are expecting another 11 shortly.  There will also be two Bills which are not on the list.  That illustrates a big advance from where we were but the Government is not satisfied that it completes the picture. Some Government Departments would be well served by having legal assistants attached to their Departments.  There are a few very good legal assistants in the system but if that can be extended into Government itself so that the preparatory work which needs to be done can be completed before the Bill goes to the Attorney General's office, that would be a very good advance because the delays that take place in the Attorney General's office are often caused by details that could have been worked out in the Departments if they had people trained to do it.  The Deputy will appreciate that it takes about ten years to train a parliamentary draftsman and such people are very difficult to find.  I know that recently the Attorney General has been considering a retired Irish person in another country who might wish to come home who could be a great help in training younger people.  We have improved things significantly in a short period.  If we manage to find the right people to put <Col N="715" /> into some Departments legislation will be produced more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, as almost all Bills are now going to committees, that the main Opposition spokespersons, not just the main Opposition spokespersons of the biggest party, are at a great disadvantage in that they are presented with Bills with perhaps a week within which to consider them and have no drafting assistants available whereas the chairperson and the convenor of each of these committees have a certain amount of resources available to them?  Will the Taoiseach consider making resources, at least assistants for the drafting of amendments to Bills, available to the main Opposition parties so that the Legislature can do the job which it is meant to do?</P>

      <P>The question deals with recruitment to the Attorney General's office.  We are having quite an extension of that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look at what the Deputy is suggesting in the context of Oireachtas reform, but the type of people for whom we are looking are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that if the Revenue Commissioners want to produce new legislation to impose a tax on people, they can do it literally overnight because they have their own legal drafting in-house, whereas if another Department wants to produce legislation of the same complexity it takes a year because of the requirement on them to go to the parliamentary draftsman's office? Will the Taoiseach agree that the imbalance between law reform and tax is a symptom of what is wrong with our public administration as, like Government policy, it is based towards increasing taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>Let us not stray from the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the principle of what Deputy Bruton is saying in relation to the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to produce Bills quickly.</P>

      <P>Overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Overnight in some cases, but they are heavily endowed with people with expertise in that area.  We have been looking at the possibility of getting other Departments to recruit people with expertise so that they can do a better job and more in-depth preparatory work before Bills come to the Attorney General's office because sometimes that is where the logjam appears. We have very good draftsmen who have not been legally trained in some Departments, but over a period of years they have acquired that expertise and the technical staff.  I am sure Deputy Bruton would be aware of some of those.  We are trying to strike a balance in both respects, trying to recruit people in the Departments who can take part of the workload and at the same time train people for the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies are offering.  I remind the House that in accordance with an Order of the Dáil of 7 February last 30 minutes only are allowed on Tuesdays for questions to the Taoiseach.  Deputies should bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach's proposals require a change in Cabinet procedure instructions because at present drafting must be carried out in the Parliamentary Draftsman's office.  Under existing instructions, Departments are not allowed to draft their own legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparatory work and the detail involved in preparing legislation for the draftsman can speed up the process.  Frequently the draftsman spends a lot of time on details which should have been dealt with in the <Col N="717" /> Department involved if it had the expertise to do so.  Deputy Bruton is correct in that, in the final analysis, it is the draftsman who drafts legislation, but if his work is made easier he could produce many more Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the word &ldquo;draftsman&rdquo; will be changed to &ldquo;drafts-person&rdquo; following the enactment of the Interpretation Bill.  Would the Taoiseach consider in certain circumstances contracting out the drafting of Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Attorney General to consider that matter as some Bills might be suitable for contracting out to legal people.  However, from the Attorney General's advice that is not possible in the case of a large number of Bills, but the Government has advised that some short or less intricate Bills may be suitable for contracting out and the people in the Law Library may be of assistance in that regard.  We have advised the Attorney General to contract out the drafting of any Bills he believes suitable.</P>

      <P>Will the new staffing at the Office of the Attorney General enable that office to sort out its apparent problems with producing the Extradition (Amendment) Bill?  When does the Taoiseach expect that Bill to come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated already that there is a vacancy for a legal assistant and that two senior parliamentary draftsmen have been appointed to the office. The Whips are monitoring the matter every week and we believe that if we can sort out the problem before it gets to the office of the Attorney General we will produce many more Bills.  Suitable people are not easy to find.  It takes approximately ten years to train a person in the expertise required in that area. We are not opposed to recruiting more people to the office but, from the point of view of producing Bills, it would be more advantageous to have more work carried out in the Departments and less <Col N="718" /> piled on to the Attorney General and parliamentary draftsman.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  I asked him specifically if the new staffing arrangements would assist the Attorney General's office in bringing forward the Extradition (Amendment) Bill and when we might expect that Bill to come before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on various occasions in the House that that Bill will be published before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 November last, I had the pleasure of participating in a conference organised by the North-West Region Cross Border Group which has as its objective the development of a strategy for growth in the region, building on its strengths.</P>
      <P>The Government is very conscious of the need to maximise growth throughout this island through an integrated approach to development and through close economic co-operation.  To this end, a common chapter appears in the development plans for both Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The North-West Region Cross Border Study Group is an excellent example of this kind of integrated, co-operative approach and reflects the dynamism and hard work of the communities involved. For that reason, the Government is happy to give the group every assistance possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-West Region Cross Border Group brings together four local authorities &mdash; Derry City Council, Donegal County Council, Limavady Borough Council and Strabane District Council &mdash;<Col N="719" /> and a population of 280,000 people in a development strategy for growth in this region.</P>
    <P>The development strategy consists of two core elements: identifying and building on shared strengths, in particular those which exist on both sides of the Border; and overcoming peripherality and creating outward vision.  The group has set itself a comprehensive agenda for development of natural resources, tourism, industry, economic restructuring and overall growth.</P>
    <P>The group's secretariat has been funded through the EC INTERREG Programme.  It is intended to support the group's work where possible through the round of European Union-funded Operational Programmes 1994-1999.</P>
    <P>The conference brought together representatives from a very broad economic, social and political spectrum.  In my address to the conference, I stated that the group was contributing in a very concrete way to the wider effort of developing personal contacts and to the breaking down of barriers on this island. I said that the considerable efforts being pursued in the north-west region are an important part of the wider co-operative process, and that the foundations are in place for a substantial deepening of North-South co-operation.  The current search for peace, if successful, could make the biggest contribution of all both to the quality of life on this island and to economic prospects.</P>
    <P>While attending the conference, I took the opportunity for brief informal discussions about the peace process with other participants, notably the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and the leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and welcome the fact that he participated in that event because I also believe that the development of North-South economic relations is very important in the development of peace and security on both sides of the Border. Was the Taoiseach aware of the contacts <Col N="720" /> between the British Government and the IRA at the time of his discussions on the peace process with Sir Patrick Mayhew and John Hume?  Was he aware of the extent of the contacts?  Did John Major brief the Taoiseach on his contacts with the IRA during the period of those contacts? Also, is the process in which John Major is engaged with the IRA part of the peace process about which the Taoiseach has spoken on numerous occasions during past months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are specific questions on the Order Paper in relation to the meeting with the British premier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but as the Taoiseach stated he discussed the peace process with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, and the Leader of the SDLP, John Hume, I believe my question is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, on the morning of the meeting in question there was a leak to the <i>Irish Press</i> and that was the focus of attention at a conference which should have been about North-South economic co-operation, the subject which the four councils involved wanted to discuss.  That is what they wanted Sir Patrick Mayhew, John Hume, myself and others to focus our attention on at the conference.  Deputy De Rossa will appreciate that the focus of attention was not where it should have been.</P>
      <P>I had a very brief discussion with Sir Patrick Mayhew, who had to leave shortly after making his address to the conference to attend another engagement. The basis of our discussion was the peace initiative taking place and he brought me up to date on progress in that area.  Other Ministers were to discuss the matter with him and others in the following week.  Undoubtedly, I will receive a report on those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards any meetings or contracts the British Government has had with Sinn Fein or the IRA, that is a matter for them.  I am not going to get involved in any discussion but I should say, in <Col N="721" /> response to Deputy De Rossa, that it did not form part of my peace initiative with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>I had more time to discuss the matter with John Hume.  As I said on a number of occasions in the House, John Hume brought the Government up to date with an evaluation following the suspension of his talks with Gerry Adams.  I said at the time that there were elements in those talks which, if developed, could make a contribution towards the building of a peace process.  I also said that other inputs were required and, in keeping with his own statement, that the two Governments should take the initiative and progress it.  That is the process we have been involved in since then.  Indeed, John Hume and I discussed it in Derry on the day of the conference.</P>

      <P>I merely alert Members to the need to deal with as many of the Questions to the Taoiseach as possible having regard to the time limit involved.  I shall be going on to priority questions shortly after 3 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the leak of a confidential document which had been circulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Will he include the leaker of this document among the maligned forces who are seeking to derail the peace process to which he referred elsewhere?  Has anyone yet owned up to this leak?  Does he expect the inquiry will be successful and when does he expect it to conclude?  Will it include those to whom the Official Secrets Act does not apply, namely Ministers and others who are not civil servants?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that everybody is making all the necessary efforts to bring the person to justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Bruton, and every Member of this House, I deplore the leak of official documents, especially in a sensitive area at a sensitive time &mdash; not that I would advocate leaks at any time &mdash; as it has the effect of <Col N="722" /> feulling fears and uncertainty in the Unionist community.  Indeed, we discovered during the weekend that there has been another leak in another Government area.  I should say that this is unhelpful to the process in which we are engaged.  In relation to the investigation of the leak the Deputy may take it that it is being carried out at full speed and with the normal efficiency of the Garda Síochána under Detective Superintendent Jim McHugh.  They know better than the Deputy or I how to investigate any leak.  I have no doubt that it will be difficult to establish the source. Let us hope that we establish its source and identify the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may take it from me, on behalf of the Government, that we will take the appropriate action if the Garda report that the person has been discovered. This has been an undesirable development in recent times and has been distinctly unhelpful to pushing ahead with the peace process.  However, I do not think the Governments can afford to let people who have an interest in slowing, postponing or undermining the peace initiative to take the initiative and it is up to both Governments to rise above this and not to be blown off course by the actions of such people.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the main activity, so far as the peace process is concerned, seems to be taking place between the British Government and the Provisional IRA and that to a large extent the Government has been sidelined in this process?  Second, was the Taoiseach accompanied by his special adviser on Northern Ireland affairs during his visit to Derry last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was accompanied to Derry by a number of people, including my special adviser.  In relation to the peace initiative I do not consider that the Government has been sidelined.  As I said, it is not a matter for me to comment on what actions the British Government may take in having discussions or receiving communications from Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA; this is a matter for them.  We want to progress the peace initiative.  In this regard I hope to be in touch with the British Prime Minister later this evening.  As the House will appreciate, we need some time to evaluate all the revelations and the events that have taken place during the past few days to see what effect this may have on the initiative.  Let us hope that at the end of the day we will find a way to progress it to a successful conclusion.  That would be the wish of everybody in this House and throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>

May I suggest to the Taoiseach that it might be helpful if he were to indicate to the House whether there is any truth in the allegations made on the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme last night that there were contacts between the Government and the IRA given that the British Government has published details on the range of contacts it has had with the IRA and that therefore everybody would approach a summit with their cards on the table?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it clear on a number of occasions in this House that I do not propose to comment on every television programme or newspaper report on any particular aspect and I have no intention of doing so now.  Let me repeat what I said on a number of occasions in this House.  I have made it clear that I have never met the IRA or Sinn Fein.  I have also made it clear that there is a wide range of people who in one way or another make an input either to me or my Department.  They may come to see me, write to me or contact me and I gather all the information that they have.  They know of any shifts of opinion in both communities and from this I have to make a final evaluation.  It is my evaluation that there is an opportunity for peace and it is up to all of us to exercise our judgment; to be calm, courageous and, indeed, clear in our thinking.</P>
      <P>Let us not be deflected down alleyways or culs de sac.  The positive objective is peace and, with the full support of the Government, I will continue my efforts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach can be assured that the objective he has outlined is fully shared by all the Members of this House.  We hope this process will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things I would like him to clarify.  Has the Taoiseach authorised contact, discussions, negotiations or otherwise with the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin?  It would be as well for us to know the full facts.  Is it a fact that the Irish Government is awaiting a response <Col N="726" /> from the UK Government to a proposal and for how long?  Will this affect the date of the summit meeting with Mr. Major?  What is the Taoiseach's attitude to the proposal to establish a select committee on Northern Ireland at Westminster? Last, and perhaps most important, does the Taoiseach now really believe that Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA are genuinely seeking political progress by peaceful and democratic means alone?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the last question, it is an evaluation that one must make.  I have made my evaluation clear.  I believe there is an opportunity for peace and that it is incumbent on all of us to test it and make sure that we seek every possible opportunity to bring about peace and a permanent cessation of violence.  That is what the people of this country want and it is the biggest single thing we could achieve for this country.</P>
      <P>In regard to business in the House of Commons, we will leave that to the House of Commons.  It is not for me to get involved in their business.</P>
      <P>On the third part of the question, I want to repeat that since I became Taoiseach I have made it abundantly clear, not alone to people in this House but to my Department and everybody else, that I am set on a path to try to find a different way forward after 25 years of violence.  I made it clear to anybody who wanted to talk to me about it that my door was open; I have operated an open door policy and I cannot see how anybody could object to that.  I have also said clearly in this House that I have upheld the policy of successive Governments on the question of talking to the IRA and Sinn Féin, that if they gave up their violence there would be a seat at the conference table for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be brutally honest about this. Is Deputy O'Keeffe or anybody in this House suggesting that I should not talk to Mr. John Hume while he is, as everybody in the world knows, carrying on discussions and conversations with the IRA?  I do not believe that is the position and consequently we should not go into any more detail.  People are coming down <Col N="727" /> here week after week genuinely trying to make a contribution to finding a formula for peace.  I am not prepared to endanger their lives, and I am certainly not going to betray the confidence they have placed in me in continuing my initiative to try to find a formula for peace.  It is a sensitive and difficult area.  Let us be honest with ourselves; we want peace and we are going to try to get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is unity in this House on the question of pursuing peace.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  However, we have a responsibility in this House to clarify what precisely the Government is at when it is pursuing that objective.  I very much welcome the apparent realisation by the IRA that their campaign has been futile and we would all call on them today to stop their campaign of murdering members of the security forces and, indeed, on the Loyalists to stop murdering Catholics.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not reply to my earlier question when he said he has not met members of the IRA or of Sinn Féin. Has he relayed messages to the IRA through departmental officials or community leaders in relation to the conditions for participation by the IRA or Sinn Féin in talks?  Can he confirm that both the Irish and British Governments are at one in insisting that the only way the IRA or Sinn Féin can become involved in the talks process is on the basis of a full cessation of violence, and that no other conditions will be met in order for them to call off their campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it clear on a number of occasions, and I repeat it today, that there will be a seat at the conference table for democratically elected people when they renounce violence and when we are satisfied that there is a genuine cessation of violence.  That has been my position and it has also been the position of the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the contacts I have, I maintain a wide range of contacts with community leaders, churchmen, church leaders, social workers, housewives, <Col N="728" /> bank managers, sporting organisations etc. as I do with the SDLP and with Mr. John Hume in particular.  Mr. Hume and I have been working together for at least 18 months, perhaps two years, to try to advance this matter.  I believe everybody would want me to continue that and I intend to do so.</P>
    <P>I have said time and again that we want to see not alone a cease-fire but a permanent cessation of violence, a turning away from the violence that has destroyed two communities in the North and back towards the peace process and the talks process.  If we get a cessation of violence the talks process, which unfortunately is not ready to restart yet, will have a better opportunity of making progress than it would otherwise have.  I have upheld and will continue to uphold the policies of previous Governments on talking to paramilitaries and the conditions on which they can join the talks process around the conference table.</P>

      <P>On 29 June in the House the Taoiseach stated that any contact with representatives of Sinn Féin would be conditional on a definitive rejection of violence by that organisation as a means of achieving political objectives. Can the Taoiseach confirm that that remains Government policy and that he has authorised no departure from that policy of no contact without a definitive rejection of violence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy and the policy of the Government remains that there will be no seat at the conference table until there is a definitive rejection of violence, until we are satisfied that there has been a real cessation of violence and not just a temporary cease-fire to get to the table.  That could not be clearer.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  Has the Taoiseach noted, regarding the communications disclosed yesterday, that even after the tragedy of the Warrington bombing the lines of communications remained open and that the British Government stood by the nine points referred to in the message of 19 March? Will he agree it is a good indication that there is a future in the peace process, that some credit should be given to the British and at that time the deserved response was a total cessation of violence by the IRA?  The Taoiseach referred to the patchwork of matters developing, when one looks at the patchwork of communications between the British and Irish Governments, the British Government and the Provisional movement, Hume and the Irish Government, one blank is very obvious, the lack of direct communication with the Unionists which is essential to any lasting agreement.  Will the Taoiseach do his utmost to remedy that deficiency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that I am doing my utmost and will continue to do my utmost in that regard.  I would welcome visits here from any level of political leadership in the <Col N="731" /> Unionist community.  I have met quite a number of people, including prominent people, and I can only use the opportunity presented by those people who come to see me to remedy the situation. I sent an article to <i>The Telegraph,</i> I have done interviews on the North of Ireland and the Tánaiste has gone out of his way to try to make contact by inviting people down here.  I fully recognise that we need to have an understanding of the fears and suspicions of the Unionist community in approaching a peace and we are doing everything we can is this regard.  I have already stressed to the British Prime Minister that he should use his position to tell the Unionist population that they should have no fears in regard to the peace initiative.  Their fears and suspicions will be taken care of, they should be assured that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without a majority of the people living there desiring a change.  Consent for a change will have to be forthcoming.  The peace initiative we are pursuing does not in any way change the position.</P>
      <P>We want peace first and then for the political talks to take place which would include, I hope following a cessation of violence, representatives of Sinn Féin at the table who would then have the opportunity of making their input and putting their ideas forward as to what the future for Ireland should be.  That is the only way forward.  I want 25 years of violence to end.  I have said on a number of occasions in this House &mdash; and the Tánaiste repeated it here and elsewhere &mdash; that we believe there is an opportunity for peace.  In line with what Deputy Currie said, we believe our responsibility is to pursue that opportunity in the hope of bringing about a permanent cessation of violence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of accommodation roads is the responsibility of the individuals they serve.  No grants are provided for that purpose by my Department.  However, grants for the construction and improvement of non-public roads are provided, through the local improvements scheme, by my Department.  The grants are allocated to the county councils to which the administration of the scheme is devolved, subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968 and to general guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1968 Act, councils may carry out works only by way of agreements with the landowners concerned. The guidelines encourage each council, when preparing its annual programme of works, to ensure, as far as practicable, <Col N="733" /> that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the county as a whole.  The criteria to be used for this purpose are a matter for individual councils and I do not propose to change this arrangement.</P>
    <P>Funds are provided separately by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the improvement of non-public roads in Gaeltacht areas.  The administration of these funds is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the needs of the Gaeltacht areas not adequately met by the Minister's Department?  Is that the reason for a parallel scheme to look after our accommodation roads?  Surely his Department and the local authority are in the best position to identify areas of spending in the relevant functional areas. Why do accommodation roads in Gaeltacht areas need a separate funding scheme apart from those operated by the Department of the Environment?  I hope the Minister will agree that the present political patronage now involved in the spending of the Gaeltacht amenity schemes on the boithre áise, the accommodation roads, by the local Fianna Fáil organisation and various Fianna Fáil Ministers could be avoided if all moneys spent on accommodation roads were channelled through his Department and the relevant local authority, who are in the best position to identify the needs.

Pending consideration by the government of a report from the committee, I cannot say what changes may be made in existing arrangements.

      <asker>Mrs. Doyle</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>whether he will make the reduction of waste at source an absolute priority in Ireland's waste policy.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the <Col N="740" /> National Development Plan, the Government recognises the need for Irish waste policy to reflect the primacy accorded in EU policy to waste prevention, reduction and reuse.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, makes important provision in this regard by incorporating prevention and elimination of waste as explicit criteria in the new system of integrated pollution control to be operated by the agency.</P>
      <P>The new waste Bill, which is now being drafted, will also provide legislative support for waste prevention and reduction policies.  A recently published consultants' report for my Department on clean technologies is intended to encourage further initiatives by the public and private sectors in this area.</P>
      <P>Waste recovery and waste disposal, carried out in accordance with strict environmental standards, will also remain valid options in terms of waste management in Ireland and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I know that my constituency colleague beside him has a particular interest in this area.  Does the Minister agree that waste reduction at source is an absolute priority?  There was no reference to this in the Programme for Government.  Will the Minister confirm, particularly in view of the fact that the waste Bill will be introduced soon, that the Bill will be constructed in such a way that absolute priority will be given to reducing waste?  Will the Minister give the latest figures for municipal waste generated per annum?  The only figures I can find are those in an An Foras Forbartha report of 1987 which relate to 1984-85. We need up to date data on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of the question, the hierarchy of waste management policies gives primacy to waste minimisation.  That is the first aim, followed by reuse and recycling, the introduction of clean technologies and, finally, the management of the residual waste arising from that.  I am unable off the top of my head to give the volume of <Col N="741" /> municipal waste but I think &mdash; I could be wrong &mdash; it is probably as close to two million tonnes as makes no difference. The level of waste is increasing at the rate of approximately 3 per cent per annum, which is phenomenal.  A real attempt has to be made, not only through legislation dealing with waste but also through Community measures, to reduce the volume of waste which presents great problems both in terms of cost and the management of our environment generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information about this reported complaint either from the European Commission or from Greenpeace. Information on enforcement of environmental legislation is published regularly by my Department in the Environment Bulletin and from time to time in response to parliamentary questions. While the pattern of activity varies <Col N="742" /> according to the provisions involved, I am satisfied that, in comparative terms, enforcement of environmental legislation in Ireland is generally good.</P>
    <P>A major purpose of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, is to improve the regulation of activities of major polluting potential by entrusting responsibility for their control to the new agency.  The agency, which is being mobilised at present, will also support and supervise the performance of environmental protection functions by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely surprised that the Minister's usually well informed Department has not read the many newspaper reports on the very comprehensive complaint made by Greenpeace to the European Commission about the litany of breaches of pollution regulations, the non-implementation of EC directives and regulations, the number of local authorities which have not yet made waste plans and, despite the usual rhetoric from the Minister on these matters, the general lack of enforcement of good environmental standards.  When will we see sight of the waste management Bill?  Will we see this Bill, which has been promised so often in this House, before the Minister proceeds to built a toxic waste incinerator, before the Kill dump is opened or before any of the other decisions on waste management are taken?  When will the Government put forward a national waste plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject Deputy Gilmore's contention that Ireland is in some way deficient in either its capacity or determination to transpose Community directives and regulations into Irish law and implement their provisions.  I refer the Deputy to some published documents in this regard as distinct from the hit-and-run expeditions, to which I am very used, by Greenpeace in circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where I am not <Col N="743" /> even shown the courtesy of being sent a copy of the letter.  I have no knowledge about this reported complaint.  I refer the Deputy to published data on the 7,500 investigations of water pollution which have been carried out in Ireland, the 1,000 warnings and notices issued and the 1,000 people with various technical skills employed indirectly by the State &mdash; for example, by local authorities, health boards and fishery boards &mdash; on a full-time basis to implement environmental policy.  I looked at the record of other countries in this regard.  Up to 90 per cent of EC directives in this area have been written into Irish law.  Only one or two other countries have a better record than Ireland in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is time we tried to rise above our defeatist inferiority complex.  The many people employed in this area are doing good work.  Of course, we can improve our efforts.  However, one should look at the published data before one refers to the isolated incidents which regrettably occur.  I would like to be able to eliminate the possibility of such incidents, and if the Deputy was on this side of the House he would also like to do this.  However, he will have to live with some problems for a little longer.</P>

      <P>Cork County Council has submitted outline proposals for a bypass of Ballincollig and, while these have been discussed between officials of my Department and the council, a route has still to be settled.  The question of providing the bypass is being considered in the preparation of the Transport Operational Programme under the National Development Plan, 1994-99.  In this context, I will have to have regard to the estimated cost of the project, the number of major improvement schemes requiring funding countrywide and the overall funds available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The council's comments on the need for improvements in the management and maintenance by local authorities of their rented houses reflect issues and concerns which I and my Department have been pressing for some time so as to secure more effective, efficient and economical spending of the significant resources devoted by local authorities to the programme. These matters were included in the comprehensive memorandum which I had issued to local authorities last March to assist them in the preparation of the statements of policy for effective housing management and maintenance which they were required to adopt in accordance with section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  It is the responsibility of each authority to implement the policies, changes and operational systems identified in their statements of policy to ensure that dwellings are properly managed and maintained. My Department will continue to support authorities by way of advice and seminars on housing management and on other matters as identified by authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that increases are being sought by local authorities in their estimates for next year for the repair and maintenance of local authority houses?  This does not seem to indicate a move by local authorities to pay heed to the Minister's circular letters or the strident comments by the NESC in its report on the need for more cost effectiveness in the maintenance and repair of local authority houses, bearing in mind the struggle by local authorities in some areas, excluding the area we are in at present, to keep down service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The management and maintenance of rented dwellings is the responsibility of local authorities, to be funded from their revenue resources.  In <Col N="746" /> 1991 their expenditure in this area totalled £82 million, £35.5 million of which was spent on maintenance and £46.6 million of which was spent on management. This expenditure, and the manner in which it is spent, are matters for decision by local authorities and do not require my approval or the approval of the Department.  The NESC report welcomes the initiatives taken by the Department but suggests that the Department should conduct a detailed analysis of the costs of maintenance and the requirement to ensure that the condition of the housing stock is not permitted to deteriorate further.</P>
      <P>As management and maintenance are matters for local authorities, and in view of the widely differing circumstances and conditions applying in the 1987 authorities, such an exercise is best carried out locally.  Local authorities were asked to undertake a detailed review of their housing stock as far back as February 1992.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute the report's contention that the local authorities' management and maintenance of their housing stock is capable of being carried out on a more cost effective basis.  Their analyses of the problem is similar to the Department's view outlined in the memorandum issued last March to assist authorities in the preparation of their statements of policy for the effective management and maintenance of their rented housing stock and the report acknowledges the benefits of the initiatives pursued by the Department.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the statements of policy require authorities to review their housing management and maintenance systems and to provide for their development and improvement in an effective, efficient and economical way.  The fact that local authorities are increasing the amounts within that programme for maintenance as opposed to management indicates that they are now implementing the policy statements they drew up and submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that there has been a deterioration in the <Col N="747" /> maintenance service in a number of local authorities?  Will he agree that the service in some local authority areas is as bad as he alleged about Dublin Corporation some months ago when he talked about a phantom service in relation to its maintenance programme?  What action has the Minister taken in view of the threat he made at that time that if Dublin Corporation had not supplied an alternative policy and programme by 31 August he would privatise it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum which I issued to local authorities, a copy of which was placed in the Oireachtas Library and which I am sure the Deputy has read, analysed management and maintenance expenditure and practices and outlined areas of concern.  It also specified matters to be addressed by authorities when drawing up their statements.</P>
      <P>In regard to maintenance, authorities, including Dublin Corporation were requested to outline their broad approach to housing maintenance and set out their proposals in relation to response maintenance, which was the norm, and planned maintenance and the resources required, etc.  They were also asked to set out the manner in which the housing maintenance function within the authority is organised; the method by which the authority proposed to carry out the different types of maintenance work, i.e. by direct labour, contract or through a tenants' organisation and the extent to which it is proposed to carry out the various tasks using these methods; the standards which the authorities seek to achieve in their maintenance programme and have the performance by direct labour units, contractors, etc., assessed and monitored to ensure effectiveness of the operation and value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most authorities have now adopted statements of policy and it is evident they recognise that major improvements are required.  I am satisfied with the initiative taken by the Department and by myself &mdash; I have given special attention to this area &mdash; but I am concerned that £800 million has been spent in the past ten <Col N="748" /> years in this area without the the provision of a good service for the tenants it is intended to serve.  I am satisfied that local authorities throughout the country, including Dublin Corporation, have taken this on board and are now changing their systems to allow a more efficient service which will not in future be described as a phantom service which it was in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly from the point of view of many tenants, the house maintenance service they have been experiencing has been of a phantom nature. Was the Minister's threat earlier this year in regard to privatising the house maintenance service serious or was it just one of the &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; statements we have now become accustomed to from him?  Is he serious about privatising the house maintenance services or does he intend to comply with the Programme for Government which did not envisage privatising these services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that what I said at that time was clarified in great detail in a Seanad debate on the housing area.  I was referring to the restrictive practices operated by members of trade unions in Dublin Corporation's maintenance area that go back almost one hundred years and are of such a nature that they do not allow the workers, the members of the union, to work.  I was advising the members of the trade unions, of which I am a member, to change their practices because the public, the corporation management or the Government would not continue to tolerate a situation where in Dublin city £40 million was being spent per annum on house management and maintenance without a service being provided.  I think they have taken that very solidly on board and I am glad to be able to tell the House that there have been discussions since then between the management of Dublin Corporation and the trade unions with a view to removing these restrictive practices. That does not represent all the problems in that area, there are also management problems and new management <Col N="749" /> systems are required.  I am satisfied by the statement of policy emanating from Dublin Corporation that the management have also taken that on board and that change is being implemented on both sides in this regard which should result in a better service and better use of the very large sums of money available to Dublin Corporation to provide services for its tenants which is its responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give specific examples of the improvements carried out with which he is now satisfied in local authority areas other than Dublin in response to the circular and criticisms highlighted in the NESC report and by others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements we are talking about are contained in the detailed policy statements drawn up by the local authorities which indicate major changes by them in their practices.  The main change is an area respond system which is being organised in many local authorities, particularly in urban areas, as opposed to the fire brigade system where the officials and staff were stationed centrally and simply responded to calls from tenants.  There is now an organised system of maintenance being put in place in accordance with the wishes I expressed to them through the memorandum and I am satisfied that will have the effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not all as good as I would like them to be but there are some very good examples.  We are following this up with a series of seminars for staff and tenants to enable them to become positively involved.  All the indications are that local authorities now provide a large amount of the money available, namely, 100 per cent of rents and 40 per cent of the revenue from sales. That is the money available for housing management and maintenance and a greater amount of it is now being allocated <Col N="750" /> to the maintenance of the housing stock and the areas surrounding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy has discussed that with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he aware that the tenants of local authorities and the Comptroller and Auditor General are very concerned about this problem?  Is he aware also that more money is spent on maintenance in Dublin Corporation than is collected in rents while, at the same time, within the canal areas, 9,600 flats are in need of major refurbishment according to the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing?  This money, if spent properly, could be used to finance the refurbishment of those flats.  Will the Minister agree that the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing, which highlights this matter and which has been commended by his Department, has made a major contribution?  Will he support its full implementation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I compliment the Deputy, who, when Lord Mayor, initiated the Lord Mayor's report on housing in Dublin.  It was an excellent report welcomed specifically by me and my Department.  I share the concerns expressed in the report and elsewhere, I have also expressed them.  I am now satisfied that there is change, part of that change was brought about by the adoption by the corporation of the Lord Mayor's report which ensured that there were changes in policy.  The way forward is direct management involvement of tenants <Col N="751" /> in the decisions that affect them, the removal of restrictive practices and new management systems.  All those are contained in the new policies being put forward in the Lord Mayor's report and in the policies adopted by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say how much I welcome the Minister of State's assurance that a change is coming.  It is badly needed.  I hope that the recommendations in respect of which he has given credit to the former Lord Mayor are implemented.  Why is the Minister of State sure that the facts he has given about grants are somewhat more accurate than those to which he referred in a recent radio programme when he spoke about £8,000, which everybody is now contesting and cannot be substantiated? I have here an article, the caption of which read &ldquo;Stagg Lashes Corpo House Repair Service&rdquo;, which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Thursday, 13 May 1993, when an assurance was given that if the Dublin Corporation policy had not changed by 31 August steps would be taken to privatise the maintenance section.  I take it from what the Minister of State has said that he has today given this House an assurance that the necessary steps have now been taken so that we can look forward to a speedy improvement in the maintenance performance of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  Of course, management and maintenance are the responsibility of the elected members of Dublin Corporation in so far as they draw up a policy which is implemented by their management people and by the staff of Dublin Corporation.  I should say that my good offices will continue to be available to Dublin Corporation, and to other local authorities, to ensure that these policies are implemented.  I will blast any local authority again, including Dublin Corporation, <Col N="752" /> if I deem it necessary to do so, if and when they fail in their duty in this regard.  The responsibility lies first with the elected members of all local authorities whose responsibility it is to draw up policy for maintenance and management and not leave it, as many elected members of local authorities do, to their officials simply to rubber stamp it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lough Derg water quality report was prepared, as a regional initiative, by the Lough Derg working group comprising broadly-based representation from Shannon Development, three county councils, Bord na Móna, the ESB, the University of Limerick and the private sector.  I consider that a similar regional-based arrangement, rather <Col N="756" /> than a central Government committee, will afford the best means of carrying forward the objectives of this excellent report.</P>
      <P>Nationally administered programmes, such as my Department's water and sanitary services programme, will of course seek to accommodate and support the objectives of the Lough Derg report as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the report on this waterway demonstrates an appalling, unacceptable level of mismanagement and abuse, particularly on the part of local authorities under the direct control of his Department?  In view of the fact that Lough Derg is a major national water resource, renowned as a tourist, recreational and leisure area, giving substantial employment, will the Minister give the House an assurance that the recommendations in that report will be funded and implemented by his Department? Will he agree there needs to be an exceptional degree of co-operation and co-ordination between his Department and the various other Government Departments involved, including statutory bodies and local authorities, to enable a resolution to be found to this wanton destruction of an invaluable amenity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While the vast majority of the recommendations fall to be implemented by local authorities, it is fair to say &mdash; as the Deputy has implied &mdash; that the remit also falls on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the sampling of soil and slurry storage facilities, on Bord na Móna in relation to peat silting and on the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to the hydrometric network.  Co-ordination between all of those authorities will be essential to the successful implementation of a necessary but quite expensive scheme of remedial action which will entail very considerable resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to commit the maximum resources possible to the operational programme for environmental <Col N="757" /> services in the areas of responsibility which fall to local authorities.  We must also continue to have discussions in relation to some of the phosphate problems, particularly with the detergent producers and other groups who can help to ensure that the waste pipeline creating this problem is cut off.  It is one thing to try to have the maximum resources possible to deal with an existing problem but the necessity to cut off the avenues which are continuing to create these waste problems must also be attacked.  I assure Deputy Lowry that all the necessary resources, as far as is practicable and possible, will be provided.  I am sure he has seen evidence of that in Ballina and in the pump out facilities at Mountshannon, Tullamore, Portumna, Terryglass and other centres around the Shannon where we have not only to deal with the Lough Derg problem but with those up river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this question makes specific mention of Lough Derg but I am sure the Minister will be aware of similar problems along the Shannon. Perhaps he would make a comprehensive statement to the House in relation to problems in Lough Ree and the stem of the river between Athlone and Banagher which is very severely silted?  Will the Minister agree that the River Shannon needs a new authority as its problems are exacerbated where there is one navigation authority and where the ESB and Bord na Móna have certain authority? Would it not be much better if there was a single authority to govern navigation and pollution control on the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the problems upstream in Lough Derg, one of the very good experiences of the regional group representing Galway, Clare, north Tipperary and Limerick was the fact that those groups were able to come together <Col N="758" /> and reach agreement on the first priority phase&mdash;Lough Derg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a single authority has been trotted out on a number of occasions and merits consideration. The Environmental Protection Agency has a very specific mandate in the area of pollution.  I do not think another group should take over that responsibility as far as the Shannon is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I support the greatest possible co-ordination &mdash; this was covered in part by Deputy Lowry's supplementary question &mdash; between the local authorities, the State agencies and other various groups.  It should not always be necessary to establish a new structure to do something.  We want to give as many resources as we can to the organisations involved, instead of establishing another structure, to see if the necessary works can be carried out.</P>

Will he confirm that the operational programme, which will put in place the environmental protection measures, will take account of the need to protect and improve the water quality in the Shannon which is the prime tourist resource in the midlands?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would dearly wish, as Minister for the Environment, to be able to tell everyone there were enough resources to do everything but that would not be credible or possible.  I hope to be able to demonstrate in the operational programme for environmental services, <Col N="759" /> that the share out of these funds will be even-handed as far as the need and geographic area is concerned.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to expenditure incurred in coastal regions.  Those familiar with the ENVIREG programme in some of the Border areas and in the south west will know that a number of schemes qualified for inclusion in that programme which may have given rise to the views expressed by Deputy Gallagher. I would like to be able to address the problem nationally in the overall programme during the next six years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>

To the extent that I can find resources which would take account not only of the needs of Deputy Lowry's constituency and others in the region and elsewhere I will certainly do all I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

      <P>To regionalise the matter, is the Minister prepared to make a commitment to Offaly County Council that the appropriate funds will be made available to Birr and Tullamore in view of his reply to the initial question regarding his commitment to improve the water quality in Shannon?  Does he accept that this is a specific problem as far as Tullamore and Birr sewerage schemes are concerned and is he prepared to give a commitment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that rather than setting up a new agency his Department might strengthen those authorities along the River Shannon who have authority to act, i.e., the local authorities. Will the Minister specifically outline the 1994 allocations to local authorities in Counties Roscommon, Westmeath and Longford?  What funds will he make available towards the improvement of water quality along the River Shannon since all those counties will have riparian lands in 1994?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to say. The operational programme for environmental services will be submitted to the European Commission as soon as possible, I hope within the next few weeks. The answer to this question is tied into the current debate on the Estimates which will be resolved in the course of the next two weeks.  I hope to be able to start new schemes to enable the Deputy to relax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to the Minister's reply.  Because of the substantial outbreak of algae bloom reported on Louth Derg last year I wrote to the Minister suggesting he should take the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry into his confidence to devise a scheme whereby farmers and others would refrain from additional use of fertiliser on the banks of Louth Derg.  Has the Minister taken any initiative in that area apart from setting up his committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy <Col N="761" /> Carey has come in to debate this issue.  I am also glad he touched on an area which, while it is the specific responsibility of another Minister, indirectly falls to me in relation to problems associated with intensive use of special types of fertiliser.  It has emerged from the Lough Derg report that in some cases the overuse of certain fertilisers was not only a cause of the problems at the lake but had no economic value for the farm.  I have already had consultations with Teagasc and the local farming organisations in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>when it is expected that a decision will be made on the Irish representatives on the Committee of the Regions as provided for under the Treaty on European Union; when the members will be selected; the criteria to be used; the date that has been scheduled for the first meeting of the committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides that the members of the Committee of the Regions will be appointed by the Council of Ministers acting on proposals from member states. Proposals in relation to Ireland's representatives will be finalised as soon as possible by the Government so as to allow the appointments to be made in time for the first meeting of the committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that his reply is virtually the same as that given in the House on 19 May last? What progress has been made since 19 May on devising a method for the appointment of the nine representatives <Col N="762" /> to the Committee of the Regions?  Will the Minister confirm that the Government has come up with a formula for selection to the committee which would give five seats to Fianna Fáil, three seats to the Labour Party and one seat to the Fine Gael Party on that committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of selection of members varies between member states.  Towards the end of October there was a request from the Belgian Presidency, who were anxious to clarify this matter, for the Irish nominations and the selection process is nearing completion. The chairperson of the General Council of County Councils and the chairperson of Údarás na Gaeltachta have been selected.</P>

At this stage nine states have given their nominations to the Belgian Presidency.  It is important that the announcement be made very soon because preliminary work is necessary in relation to the establishement of the committee.  It is important that the Irish have a say in that process.  Therefore it is essential that an early decision be made.</P>

Why has the deadline, in addition to the ground rules, been changed?  People who had agreed to pay sums of money to the Revenue Commissioners and where no dispute was involved are now being covered by the amnesty.

She then stopped and stated it would appear her information was out of date and would report again to the House on the matter.  I gave notice then that I would raise the matter by way of special notice question today. I am not saying the Minister deliberately misled the House but, as her information was not accurate and she stated she would have to check it, I ask you Sir, to request <Col N="895" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to investigate the matter and find out why that information was not supplied to the House.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  &mdash;(1)  Where in pursuance of Article 13.6, the President, on the advice of the Government, grants a pardon expressed to be a &ldquo;free pardon&rdquo;, then unless a contrary intention is expressed in such pardon, the person to whom such pardon is granted shall be deemed thereafter never to have committed the offence in respect of which it was granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> (2)  The foregoing provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to the powers conferred on the President under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this amendment the Progressive Democrats are attempting for the first time to enact into law the legal effect of a pardon, in particular a presidential pardon.  During the Second and Committee Stages debates my party voiced vigorous opposition to the two routes which the Minister proposes to take to deal with alleged miscarriage of justice cases.  Opposition to those routes is shared by Deputies from all sides of the House.  In fact, it was difficult to find a Deputy on the Government side to support the routes the Minister has adopted.</P>
    <P>We tried to tease out the reasons the Government opted for the dual route, referral of the case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the establishment by a Minister of a tribunal with inquisitorial powers as recommended by the Martin Commission leading to a presidential pardon.  If one reads the Official Report of the debate on Committee Stage one will see that there was a lack of confidence on the part of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice. Deputy O'Dea, in the legal effect of a presidential pardon.  We are moving this amendment in the hope that it will buttress the legal effect of the alternative route in sections 7 and 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>To highlight the lack of confidence on the part of the Minister of State in a presidential pardon let me quote what he said on Committee Stage at column 829 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 10 November 1993:</P>
    <P>I regard a pardon from the President as an important and crucial entitlement for persons who for whatever reason cannot go back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  For that reason it is vital to have such a provision.  It is to an extent a second best solution as the conviction will not be set aside. However, in the circumstances I have outlined it is a good second best way <Col N="900" /> of dealing with such a case.  We should not include in legislation a second best solution for those who have been found by a tribunal to be the victims of a miscarriage of justice. </P>
    <P>When I raised the matter of the legal effect of a pardon and asked the Minister of State if he thought a pardon cleared the conviction he replied at column 866: &ldquo;My advice is that it does not&rdquo;.  I then went on to raise the recent case of Nicky Kelly.  Indeed, on the issue of a presidential pardon there are only three cases to be dealt with because there has not been a judicial decision as to the legal effect of a pardon.  For that reason we need to clarify in this legislation what the ultimate remedy of a pardon will mean for the person who opts for this route. The Minister of State indicated he was of the opinion that the conviction in the Nicky Kelly case had not been set aside by the presidential pardon.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the text of the presidential pardon granted to Nicky Kelly:</P>
    <P>Now I, Mary Robinson, President of Ireland, do hereby, on the advice of the Government, pardon the said Edward Noel Kelly in respect of the said convictions and wholly remit the said punishments of twelve years' penal servitude to which the said Edward Noel Kelly was sentenced as aforesaid to the intent that he shall henceforth stand released and discharged from all penalties, forfeitures and disqualifications incident to or consequent on the said convictions as if he had not been so charged or convicted.</P>
    <P>Given under my Official Seal this 29th day of April 1992. </P>
    <P Just="Right">Mary Robinson,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Uachtarán na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>In the exchanges between the Minister of State and me he indicated, as I said, that his advice from the Department of Justice was that the pardon did not clear the conviction.  He went on to say at column 866 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Whether Nicky Kelly is happy is not <Col N="901" /> my problem.  I am talking about the law.  The Deputy asked me a legal question and the advice I have is that the conviction still stands and only a court of law can set aside a conviction.</P>
    <P>On the question of presidential pardons in the United Kingdom the court decided in the case R. <i>v.</i> Foster that because the British law relating to pardons was founded on the royal prerogative of mercy a pardon did not reach the conviction. Needless to say they also refer cases back to the Court of Appeal.  In the United States, Canada and New Zealand all the courts have held &mdash; this is laid down in statute &mdash; that a pardon reaches the conviction.  Indeed, it removes the infamy and blots out the blame and guilt. When the Martin Commission examined the law relating to pardons in Ireland &mdash; there were two cases in the 1940s, the Quinn and Brady cases &mdash; it concluded that a presidential pardon removes infamy.</P>
    <P>There is disagreement as to the legal effect of a pardon and because of this it is appropriate and timely to clarify the effect in this legislation.  If we have to live with this dual system &mdash; referral of ordinary cases back to the Court of Criminal Appeal while in exceptional cases involving miscarrige of justice, similar to the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six where there was conspiracy, lies, perjury and, perhaps, policy malpractice, the persons concerned may take the alternative route, the second best solution as described by the Minister of State &mdash; there has to be equality for those who opt for the alternative route. It would be unworthy to pass legislation under which the person who opts for the alternative route of a presidential pardon dealt with in sections 7 and 8 of the Bill would end up with a lesser remedy where the conviction would still stand.</P>
    <P>We oppose the concept of a dual route because, if this House clarified the legal effect of a presidential pardon, there would be no need to refer a case back to the courts.  For the first time in Irish law this amendment would clarify the legal effect of a pardon.  I am interested in <Col N="902" /> hearing the response of the Minister of State as it is important to get the legislation right.  As I said, there was vocal and vigorous opposition on all sides of the House; Members were bewildered as to why the recommendations of the Martin Commission were not being followed. The reason is that the Minister of State believes that only a court can overturn or quash a conviction.  That is the reason a second best solution is being offered in those cases involving a miscarriage of justice.  If a person, by virtue of the circumstances of his case, has to opt for the alternative route of a pardon there must be a fair, generous and unequivocal remedy.  What we would be saying to people like Nicky Kelly is that they are being pardoned but they are still guilty and we are giving them a certain amount in compensation.  The infamy would not be removed and their guilt would not be blotted out.  It is clear from the text of the presidential pardon granted to Nicky Kelly that the conviction was reached &ldquo;as if he had not been so charged or convicted&rdquo;.  In other words, it was as if he had never been arrested and no one had ever suspected him. However, this is not consistent with the views expressed by the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  Therefore, the matter has to be clarified and the only way to remove the doubt is to clarify the legal effect of a pardon in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not opposed to the amendment I would like to tease out one or two points in relation to it.  I support its general thrust as long as it includes other circumstances.  Indeed, there should be two types of pardon, the first should say that a person is innocent while the other should say that because of some other act the person is being pardoned and forgiven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that somebody driving away from a bank heist knocks down a child and stops.  The court would, presumably, have to find the person guilty, but in the circumstances the Government might wish to recommend a pardon.  In those circumstances it simply could not be said that the person had not committed <Col N="903" /> any offence and was innocent. These are different circumstances from those outlined by Deputy O'Donnell.  I would certainly support this amendment, but there should be circumstances where the presidential prerogative, on the recommendation of the Government, should be allowed to apply if the Government, in the interests of public policy and natural justice, feels that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>I would not like this to be exclusive. There may come a time when there is a need to pardon people who are actually guilty.  This could well be the case in regard to people who have been involved in atrocities who might give up their violent campaign and come to the peace table.  In those circumstances the Government may well wish to recommend a pardon, perhaps even a blanket pardon, but one could never say such people were innocent.</P>
    <P>I would certainly support this amendment in the case of people governed by the circumstances outlined by Deputy O'Donnell.  However, I would not like it to be the case that the President can only pardon people on the recommendation of the Government where it is proven that they were innocent in the first instance.  There should be two strings to this, and it should be clear on the granting of a pardon what the circumstances are. I have no difficulty with this amendment but I do not want it to give rise at some stage in the future to the Government being unable to pardon somebody who has been involved in a criminal activity on the basis of some other generous or peace-seeking act that they had done. The argument made by Deputy O'Donnell is a good one and if the two can be taken in tandem I am happy to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of what is meant by the term &ldquo;presidential pardon&rdquo;.  I looked up the law books in the meantime to see if there were any legal decisions on the ambit of a presidential pardon and I found that there <Col N="904" /> were not.  Therefore Deputy O'Donnell is wrong to refer to Irish law relating to pardons.  There is no such law.  This amendment was not moved on Committee Stage.  Yesterday was the first we heard of it.  I say that not to criticise but to make the point that a suggested change such as this must be referred to the Attorney General for his views as to its constitutionality or otherwise.  Although I am not closing my mind to the proposal yet, the initial reaction of the Attorney General has been quite negative.  I will explain why.</P>
      <P>Article 13.6 of the Constitution vests the power of pardon in the President.  I am not aware of any decision of the High Court or Supreme Court which interprets this Article in terms of the basis for granting a pardon or the effects of a pardon. Certain Articles of the Constitution provide for their regulation by law &mdash; indeed section 11 of this Bill does that in relation to Article 34.4.3 &mdash; but Article 13.6 does not provide for this.  It must surely be highly questionable as to whether the Legislature can, in these circumstances, legislate so as to define the meaning and effect of a constitutional provision.  The saver in subsection (2) of the amendment does not in any way lessen the extent of this proposed legislative interpretation of the Constitution.  All that subsection (2) says is that the power of the President to grant a pardon will not be affected by this amendment, but the effect of any such pardon would still be governed by subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Another difficulty I have with the proposal is the use of the expression &ldquo;free pardon&rdquo;.  This does not occur in Article 13.6, which simply provides for the grant of a pardon.  Furthermore, the proposal to legislate on what would be called &ldquo;free pardons&rdquo; clearly envisages the granting of at least one other category of pardon, otherwise the amendment need only refer to the word &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;.  What are these categories?  To whom will they apply and on what basis will they be granted?  These are reasonable questions to ask of legislation which purports to interpret the meaning and effect of pardons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> That latter point is a technical one which could possibly be overcome.  The main difficulty is a constitutional one. The term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo; appears in Article 13.6 of the Constitution to which we are all subject.  There are certain articles in the Constitution which state that the Oireachtas can regulate those provisions by law &mdash; it can state what they mean, limit them, expand them etc.  That does not apply in Article 13.6.  Because it appears only in a constitutional provision, there is only one way we can ever find out what the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo; in Article 13.6 of the Constitution means, and that is if the courts have to adjudicate on it.  We are not in a position to interpret it, to say it means this or that, that it means more or less than we think it means or that it means something if the President expresses herself in a certain way.  Another point strikes me in regard to the text of the Deputy's amendment in which it is stated: &ldquo;unless a contrary intention is expressed in such pardon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will probably make the point that pardons are usually expressed in clear and unambiguous language. However, if this were to be amended so that the President could use the term &ldquo;free pardon&rdquo; but the rest of the terminology was somewhat ambiguous, we would have a ridiculous situation where the person who has got the pardon would not know what the effect of the pardon was, despite the fact that we had taken a constitutional risk by putting this into the legislation.  That is just a minor point. The major difficulty is that this is one of the terms in the Constitution which we are not entitled to interpret in any way by legislation.  The court is the only institution that can give us a clear exposition of what that term means.</P>
    <P>I intend to do some further research and have further talks with the Attorney General on the subject between now and the Bill coming before the Seanad. However initial indications are that there would be a constitutional difficulty in accepting this amendment as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister has not had much time to look at this.  It <Col N="906" /> was only during exchanges between the Minister, myself and other Deputies that the legal effect of a pardon was disclosed, so my only opportunity was to put down an amendment on Report Stage.  There is a distinction in the wording of Article 13.6 where it stated that the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are thereby vested in the President.  It is obvious that there is a distinction between the right to pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment, otherwise the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; would not be there.  That Article expressly allows a non-judicial organ of the State to exercise a judicial function which is to set aside a sentence or grant a pardon.  I do not think the constitutional fears are valid.  However, I accept the Minister's assurance that he will look into it further.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that we are not competent to legislate on this matter. In relation to miscarriage of justice cases for which we are legislating at present, since a pardon is being offered as an alternative route to the full remedy which the courts would give, namely, quashing the conviction, we cannot legislate fairly by giving a lesser option than the dual route.  In other words we are saying that anyone who does not make it back to the Court of Criminal Appeal by virtue of the circumstances of his or her case &mdash; for example, in regard to case evidence, perjury and so on which we discussed &mdash; will be offered a second best solution. That is not acceptable and that position must be considered.  We may have to wait for the courts to deliberate on the legal effect of a pardon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two cases to which I referred in the forties were called the two pardon cases by the Martin Commission because a presidential pardon was granted in those cases.  The document executed under seal by the President in the 1940 Thomas Quinn case stated that the Government was satisfied that the convict had not committed the crime.  In the 1943 Brady case the document executed under seal by the President stated that <Col N="907" /> the Government was of the opinion that the convict had been mistakenly found guilty.  Those are the only two cases which relate directly or indirectly to the pardon.</P>
    <P>Compensation was paid in both cases, but there was a reluctance generally to typify the Government's action of a pardon as distinct from a full remission of punishment.  I accept that the law is not clear in this regard and that is why there is a need to legislate in this case.  It may happen that Nicky Kelly may take a case seeking a declaratory action to see whether his pardon removed the guilt and quashed his conviction.  He may be interested to take such a case.  He is under the impression that under the terms of his pardon his guilt has been removed and he would be unhappy if the position were otherwise.  The first person in a miscarriage of justice case who must use the route under the proposed legislation will <Col N="908" /> have to go to court to seek a declaratory action as to the legal effect of the pardon. That is a long procedure and at this stage we could stitch into the legislation what is meant by a presidential pardon.  We should not look foolishly to the UK system.</P>
    <P>If we look to the UK system, which gave us the appalling vista of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, we will be looking in the wrong direction. We are an independent Republic with our own Constitution and should be able to enact legislation to fit our set of circumstances. I hastily prepared this amendment, but the reasoning behind the Minister's dual route only came to light on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will consider this matter further and seek the advice of the Attorney General in that regard.</P>

It should be noted that Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 4 proposes the replacement of section 2 while amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in the name of Deputy Éamon Gilmore merely propose to insert new sections before section 2 and, therefore, must be taken first. Amendments must be dealt with in order as, on Report Stage, the Bill must be dealt with line by line.  Whereas the amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore propose to insert new sections between lines 30 and 31 on page 3, Deputy Mitchell's amendments seek to delete lines 31 to 33 in page 3 and lines 1 to 39 on page 4.

    <P>I am standing in for Deputy Gilmore who is involved with the debate on the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1993, which also comes within his remit.  This is one of the curses of having four Deputies only to cover all matters.</P>
    <P>These amendments deal with the heart of the Martin report &mdash; how a person or persons who have been convicted can seek to have their cases reopened having gone through all the legal procedures. This Bill arose initially from concerns expressed in Ireland about the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and, to an extent, the Nicky Kelly and Tallaght Two cases.  I missed the Second and Committee Stage debates, but I find it extraordinary that the Government in 1990 should have decided to go completely against the recommendations in the Martin report although it accepted them <Col N="912" /> in principle.  Yet three years later a Bill published by the Government goes completely against the heart of the Martin report which recommended a committee system of appeal in circumstances where information indicated there had been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>The Martin report specifically argued against the idea of going back to the court itself.  Having referred to the power of the Home Secretary in England to refer a case to the Court of Appeal, the committee stated:</P>
    <P>No analogous power exists in our jurisdiction.  We doubt, however, whether in circumstances such as those mentioned reference to the Court system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth.  We propose to set out a number of reasons which have led us to take such a view...Courts reach their decisions on legally admissible evidence, not on hearsay, not on rumour.  Any departure from the strict rules of evidence in the conduct of Court proceedings would in our view be entirely undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is not impossible to conceive of cases in which, years after conviction, with all legal avenues explored and all appeal procedures exhausted, there might come to light a mass of cogent information [it makes a clear distinction between information and evidence] and documentation inadmissible as evidence in Court proceedings, but of such a nature and emanating from such sources as to cause fair-minded persons to have grave doubts as to the propriety of the conviction.  Justice would appear to require that such matters be inquired into and given the fullest consideration. Unless a court were to relax the rules of evidence in such cases but not in others, a court would not appear the most suitable forum in which to pursue what must essentially be a matter of inquiry.</P>
    <P>It will no doubt be present in the minds of many that the recent release of wrongfully convicted persons in </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> England some 15 years after the event, came about thanks to painstaking investigation and inquiry by police officers.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances which we envisage as existing in those rare cases in which matters come to light casting substantial doubt on the correctness of a conviction, we feel that further recourse to the Court system is likely to prove inappropriate, as must recourse to any system other than one which is essentially inquisitorial in nature &mdash; which our Courts are not.</P>
    <P>We have given this aspect of the matter the fullest consideration and have taken into account the many submissions received.  As a result, we are of the view that in the circumstances envisaged, where substantial doubt may arise as to the propriety of the conviction, the setting up of an independent body with statutory powers of inquiry is by far the most effective manner of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from that part of the report in detail because it is the heart of the issue with which the Bill is attempting to deal.  I find it incomprehensible that after setting up a committee to look at how alleged miscarriages of justice may be dealt with and enabling that committee to look at the issues in detail, the Government &mdash; it should be borne in mind that the major component of this Government is the same as that in the last Government which accepted the Martin report in principle &mdash; should turn around and reject the key recommendation in that report.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has introduced a type of committee appeal system whereby a person may appeal to the President for a pardon and that a committee of inquiry will be established in those circumstances.  However, it seems that any such appeal to the President would seek to establish that the person was not guilty in any sense.  Of course, miscarriages of justice do not necessarily always apply to cases where there is no fault involved.  That is why we retabled on Report Stage an amendment which <Col N="914" /> seeks to establish a standing committee of inquiry.  Amendment No. 2 sets out in detail the type of committee which should be established, taking into account the recommendation of the Martin Committee on how it should be established, while amendment No. 3 sets out who may apply to such a committee to have a case heard.</P>
    <P>It is not a good idea to propose that people seeking to have a miscarriage of justice overturned should have to return to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which will already have decided that they are guilty.  It seems to me that there would be an in-built disincentive to reverse a decision already made by the same court, as referred to by the Martin report, particularly in view of the fact that such a court would not be enabled to deal with information which could not stand up as evidence.  Therefore, information which may well weigh with a committee of inquiry into these matters could probably not even be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal since it must inevitably comply with the rules of evidence.</P>
    <P>Witnesses who may wish to come forward in a case where a convicted person is seeking to overturn a conviction may be reluctant to go to court for fear of the consequences for themselves in legal terms in that they may have been involved in some way in the original crime.  A court of inquiry would have greater latitude to enable such people to come before it.  It is for those reasons that I believe it would be far better that this Bill adopt the recommendations of the Martin report and I urge the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in the name of Deputy Éamon Gilmore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 4 is a replica of an amendment I moved on Committee Stage when I asked the Minister to take full cognisance of the argument I made at that time and bring before this House in full measure the recommendations of the Martin Committee or to accept the amendment proposed by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's approach is fundamentally different from the approach <Col N="915" /> recommended by the Martin Committee. Judge Martin is a lawyer of considerable experience and standing.  Before he was appointed to the Bench he had to be at least ten years at the Bar.  He chaired a committee comprised of a widely drawn group of people, including officials from the Department and many others.  A number of eminent people made submissions to that committee.  Indeed, a number of Members of this House, some of them now in Cabinet, some of them former Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them ex-TDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; made submissions to that committee.  The committee deliberated and made recommendations.  Its fundamental recommendation was that the current appeal procedure is not satisfactory because it entails going back to the courts.  The committee, which was chaired by a judge, stated that the courts in these circumstances were not the appropriate place to review alleged in justices of this kind, for a number of reasons but particularly because a court is bound, by judges' rules to the sort of evidence it can accept.  The committee stated that a Scottish Act, to which it referred, gave a good example where hearsay evidence could be used in certain circumstances. The committee felt that in certain circumstances, in reviewing a conviction, hearsay evidence might be necessary.</P>
      <P>If, for instance, one person told another person that it was they who had murdered somebody and not the person who was convicted, as I understand it that evidence would not be admissible in a court of law because it would be regarded as hearsay evidence.  However, if there were reasonable grounds to hear such evidence, a tribunal of inquiry could hear it, particularly if we brought forward similar legislation to that set out in the Scottish Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister has not chosen to do this.  I can only presume it is because of certain recommendations <Col N="916" /> made by members of the Judiciary who perhaps may feel that it will be a reflection on them if this House decides to follow to the letter the recommendations made by the Martin report. The courts have a difficult job to do. I would be critical of them in another context; I believe they badly need to be reformed.  However, in suggesting that we adopt the recommendations of the Martin report I am not casting aspersions on the integrity of our courts.  I am simply saying that the Martin report stated that the courts were not equipped to carry out this particular function and it recommended the establishment of a statutory inquiry body under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act.  It specifically recommended against a reference appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The report states: &ldquo;We doubt, however, whether references to the court system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In making this point I do not wish to offend anybody, but I believe the courts are too involved in administering law rather than justice.  Perhaps that has to be the way, because there must be established rules that everyone can understand and on all occasions the courts must adhere to those rules.  However, they are not necessarily the best rules for establishing the truth and in most cases judges will give offenders the benefit of the doubt, if there is a reasonable doubt. They do not set out necessarily to establish the truth; they set out to establish what can be proven by the law, and the two are not always the same thing.  That is why I believe the Martin Committee recommended the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry rather than referring back to the courts to resolve an issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that such reviews shall be brought by way of an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals from the Special Criminal Court, the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Criminal Court can be directly referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Minister proposes a second appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which I understand, is covered by one Supreme <Col N="917" /> Court and two High Court judges but with different judges hearing the appeal. That goes completely against the recommendations of the Martin report.  There are a small number of Supreme Court and High Court judges and if the Court of Criminal Appeal, consisting of three eminent judges, confirms a person's guilt on appeal but some other facts arise from that appeal, the effect of this Bill will be that three additional judges will then be required to second guess the original views of their colleagues.  That is not satisfactory and I see no grounds whatsoever to go against the recommendations of an independent committee, chaired by a judge.  It held the view that the courts were not the appropriate place for these appeals to be heard because the rules of evidence were not sufficient to establish the truth.</P>
    <P>My amendment, or a similar one, would at least facilitate the gathering of evidence to establish the truth and not just what the law allows us to establish in terms of the rules of court.  I would have no objection to a tribunal of inquiry exonerating a person who was found to be innocent.  In order to keep within some framework I have worded my amendment in such a way that they would make a recommendation to a court which then would have to take evidence, including hearsay evidence, into account.</P>
    <P>As I complained on the Order of Business today, my amendment No. 4 is simply one worded by me in that I do not have the type of facilities available to the Minister.  I would be happy if the Minister would apply the principle of my amendment, but if not I shall have to press it.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 6 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 4, line 3, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or</P>
    <P>(iii)  on summary conviction and has received a custodial sentence of at least six months, and&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I made the case for this amendment on Committee Stage.  Perhaps we are too inclined to deal with cases on indictment. <Col N="918" /> Where there is a summary conviction, in circumstances in which a person can establish that there is a newly established fact, such a person should be free to pursue his or her innocence in the same manner.  The Minister had heard me make the case on Committee Stage.  At this stage I would ask the Minister to give that point serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 in my name are related so I shall comment on both together.  My amendment No. 7 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 4, line 25, after &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who declined to bring it before the Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 8 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 4, line 25, after &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or a fact, the importance of which was known to a person (including the convicted person) who failed, neglected or refused to bring such fact to the notice of the Trial Court, or the Appeal Court, because of a reasonable fear for that person's safety or another person's safety, or because of the imposition of duress on the person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I made the case largely for these amendments on Committee Stage.  Where a party to the proceedings knew and had available to him or her information which affected the proceedings and did not bring it to the notice of the court, that is a fact which should be allowed under the provisions of section 2 (4) as constituting grounds for reconsideration of such a case.  Amendment No. 8 deals with the case of a person who knew of a fact that was relevant but, because it was likely they would have their head blown off, their children shot, or some other imposition of duress, they were unable to bring that fact to the notice of the court.  If that threat has passed and they wish to bring the information to the attention of the court and their bona fides can be established, then the courts should allow such information to be taken into account and form part of an appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> My amendment No. 10 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, line 20, to delete &ldquo;Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) (a) in the Bill as amended in Select Committee reads:</P>
    <P>(a)  where the appeal is based on new or additional evidence, direct the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to have such inquiries carried out as the Court considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of determining whether further evidence ought to be adduced;</P>
    <P>This function should be that of the Attorney General because it is possible that the matter which is the cause of concern could well be the actions of the Garda Síochána themselves.  Since time would have elapsed before such an appeal was heard, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána could well have been substituted by an acting member of the force, a Chief Superintendent or an Assistant Commissioner, but the Commissioner himself may well have been involved in the original case, however peripherally.  If Garda behaviour itself is the cause of complaint, should the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána be the person who carries out these directions on behalf of the courts?  The task could be entrusted to the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Similarly, the Director of Public Prosecutions or his office could be the subject of a complaint, for example, if they had not brought evidence to the attention of the court or something of that kind.  It is hypothetical but these sorts of cases can arise.  It appears to me that the Attorney General would be the correct State law officer to be directed by the court in such cases.</P>
    <P>Probably the Attorney General himself could not carry out these investigations. He might require the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to undertake these investigations on his behalf, but at least they would be carried out under his supervision in the knowledge that he would be accountable to the <Col N="920" /> courts.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or any other garda, of whatever rank, working for the Attorney General in such circumstances would be aware of that fact.  The Attorney General is a law officer of such seniority that any garda officer, of whatever rank, coming before him would have to explain what investigations had been carried out, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. The rules of court would not apply.  It would be a very simple, straightforward matter, explaining exactly how the officer concerned had carried out those investigations.</P>
    <P>I believe the Attorney General should be the officer designated, not the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I say that without wishing to cast any aspersions on either the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Since we are setting up an independent review structure we should place it as far as possible beyond any suggestion of interference by persons who may themselves be involved in part of the procedures being investigated.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 11 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, to delete lines 45 to 48 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  A legal aid certificate which was granted in relation to the trial of an accused person shall have effect as if it had been granted also in relation to an application under section 2 and, if the Court has ordered a re-trial under this section, in relation to his re-trial.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This entails the deletion of section 3 (7) and the substitution of the words contained in the amendment.  That does not require any further explanation.  I made the point on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to consider it.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 17 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 8, line 3, after &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who declined to bring it before the Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> This seeks to add to section 7 (4) of the Bill the words contained in my amendment. This is a point which could reasonably be made in a petition for a grant of pardon.  I have already made the point as to how these types of circumstances can arise and could recur in a petition for grant of pardon.  My amendments Nos. 21 and 22 seek to amend the provisions of section 9 dealing with compensation for miscarriage of justice.  I note that amendment No. 22 has been printed twice on the sheet of amendments before me.  Perhaps that could be checked.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 22 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 9, line 25, after &ldquo;trial&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who declined to bring it before the Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 21, on a separate sheet, drawing attention to a printing error, reads:</P>
    <P>In page 9, line 19, before &ldquo;, and&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or a fact the importance of which was known to a party to the proceedings who declined to bring it before the Court&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>Amendment No. 22 makes the same point.  That is the essential point I have been making right through, which I want to apply to section 9 of the Bill also.  I have taken together nine of my amendments, as requested, which are a substantial part of the 17 amendments before us.  I hope the Minister, having heard the reasoned debate on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage, will not simply tell us why he cannot accept any of these amendments. I am concerned about this Bill and I hope the Minister will take into account the fundamental concern which this House is expressing about the committee of inquiry rather than a court, the other concerns expressed and my particular <Col N="922" /> suggestion regarding the Attorney General as opposed to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments touch the very heart of this Bill and, as the two previous speakers said, call into question the exact reasons this Bill has been tendered in its present form and why the report of the Martin Committee has been effectively dumped.  There must be a number of reasons for that.  First, no explanation has ever been tendered to this House as to why the principle of the Martin Committee has been effectively side-tracked.  Second, nobody has ever explained to this House from where precisely the legal thinking that lies behind this Bill comes.  It was denied by the Minister of State on Committee Stage that members of the Judiciary lobbied against this Bill and we must accept his denial. Therefore, it means that Judge Martin is the only judge with criminal experience who expressed any view on this issue.  His views are diametrically opposite to those now being put before this House.  Apparently no other judge has been consulted and no process of consultation has ever been mentioned by the Minister as an excuse for such a departure from the terms of the Martin Committee report. No reason has ever been tendered for this U-turn.  Of course, that calls into question the reason such a U-turn should have been made.  That is a mystery which lies within the intestines of the bureaucracy and we may never find out the truth. I strongly believe that some members of the Judiciary have had an influence, perhaps through the Attorney General's Office, on the Government's thinking on this issue.  I do not believe that such an unexplained U-turn could be presented to us with no supporting justification and without an adequate indication as to why Judge Martin's report should be effectively discarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever change of mind is responsible, the reality is that the Government is now putting before this House appallingly incompetent legislation which is badly thought out and underpinned by no real rational thought, the Department <Col N="923" /> of Justice, unfortunately, on this occasion is making a pig's ear out of this issue.  It is disastrous and the Minister should be warned that he will have to take responsibility for the mess that will emanate from this legislation.  First, in the course of his remarks this afternoon the Minister of State betrayed what I can only suggest is a fundamental misunderstanding of the law relating to pardon.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in our Constitution which states that a pardon cannot touch the question of guilt as well as punishment. In common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, the law provides that a free pardon eradicates conviction, guilt and punishment.  The law in the neighbouring jurisdiction in Britain is that a pardon does not remove the conviction. The reason advanced in the leading case on that issue for that viewpoint is that it is part of the Royal prerogative of mercy and since it is not part of the Royal prerogative of justice, which is extinct, it can only be a mercy measure and, therefore, cannot deal with the conviction itself.  In many of the other self-respecting common law countries where this issue has been addressed, there has been no difficulty in saying that a pardon should affect both guilt and punishment.</P>
    <P>The logic of what the Minister said today on this issue is disturbing.  It means that Nicky Kelly who has received between £600,000 and £800,000 of tax-payers' money in compensation and a presidential pardon in the terms read to this House by Deputy O'Donnell earlier still stands guilty in the eyes of the law if what the Minister has said is true.  It is evidently untrue &mdash; and he is evidently wrong on this issue &mdash; that Nicky Kelly's pardon exculpates him and that he stands in the eyes of the law, on the exercise of the President's pardon, without the taint of guilt on his record.  That is what I believe is the case.  It is terrible that the Minister has come in here, on the basis of a misunderstanding and a mishmash view of English legal authorities and said that Nicky Kelly still stands guilty in the eyes of the Irish law although he received <Col N="924" /> £600,000 or £800,000 as compensation for what was done to him and a pardon which, on the face of it, seeks to exculpate him.</P>
    <P>This is not something which will go away.  By his remarks today the Minister of State had better get one thing straight. He will face a declaratory action by Nicky Kelly and others who are mistreated in this way, who are given money and told to go away and given a pardon which purports to exculpate them.  When they read the Official Report they find that the Minister thinks they are still guilty in the eyes of the law.  It is a disgrace that the Minister of State has said these things here today and that the public at large were misled in this way.  It is about time that the Minister, instead of coming in here saying he does not know the effect of a pardon, did some research on the issue and came back with a view on what a pardon is.  If he is in doubt as to whether, as a matter of pre-existing common law, a pardon touches the issue of guilt he should come to this House with a measure to declare it does.  He apparently said to Deputy O'Donnell earlier that he had received some kind of informal advice that the Legislature was not competent to define the effects of a free pardon.  If that is so, it is strange that we are the only country that I know of which is competent to define the effect of a free pardon.  Perhaps the Minister would like to research the distinctions between various classes of pardons, for example, conditional pardons and free pardons &mdash; all of which are well known in common law.  If the Minister is saying that those categories do not exist in Ireland or that the Legislature is not competent to define the effects of each, without prejudice to the wider powers of the President under the Constitution, the informal advice from the Attorney General's Office is grossly defective.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Department of Justice had better justify why it is acting on such poor advice and on fundamental errors of criminal law in the way it is approaching this issue?  I say this with a degree of regret because I accept it is <Col N="925" /> desirable that a Bill should be brought before this House to remedy the problem and that it has been brought forward fairly smartly.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has not consulted widely during the preparation of this Bill. As far as I know, he never consulted any sizeable number involved in the administration of the criminal law, neither, as far as I know, did he sound out those who would be seen as international experts on what is open to the Government.  In particular, I believe the Department received a letter yesterday &mdash; somewhat belatedly perhaps &mdash; from the Bar Council pointing out that they were deeply disturbed by the line the Minister of State is taking in this Bill.  Will the Minister of State confirm if that is the case and why he has not consulted with anybody when such a letter was sent and nothing has been done about it?  Why has there been no consultation with anybody who knows anything about this subject?  Why has the Minister of State ploughed his own furrow?  Why have we got this Bill, which I believe will cause far more mischief than it will remedy in terms of public satisfaction with the law?</P>
    <P>The amendments tabled by Deputy O'Donnell and I, which are grouped together in this discussion, effectively to delete the whole panoply of references of appeal of these cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The reason we have taken this view, which we set out previously, on Second and Committee Stages, is that we are fundamentally of the view that more and more injustice will be created by clogging up the courts with futile stupid appeals by people who have a vested interest in fabricating evidence for the purpose of trying to exonerate themselves.</P>
    <P>That is what we believe the effect of this Bill will be.  People who are serving 15 years know they have nothing better to do but to stare at the ceiling of their cell or send out a message that they would like an alibi witness who was undiscoverable at the time of the original offence.  They would have nothing better to do than to think up newly discovered facts as to why they are not guilty.  The <Col N="926" /> damage that that will do to the system of criminal jury verdicts in this country will be massive.  Also for some unknown reason &mdash; it is twice as foolish as the general proposition on which the Bill is based &mdash; the proposal that if some newly discovered fact comes to the knowledge of a person in Mountjoy Prison concerning his sentence, he should bring it back to the Court of Criminal Appeal and have them reassess his sentence in the light of the new information.  What is this?  That he was not as bad as everybody made out, or that some witness of his character exaggerated his character to his detriment, or that his victim staged a quicker recovery than the judge had envisaged?  For instance, in a rape case, if a victim was not as badly damaged psychologically as the court was led to believe, that therefore, this newly discovered fact should be brought to the court's attention in order that it may change its sentence.</P>
    <P>What type of nonsense will that lead to in the courts?  In relation to sentences, would it not be far easier for the Department of Justice, if it was satisfied that newly discovered facts came to light &mdash; a concept hard to grasp in this context &mdash; to commute the sentence accordingly. The Minister has a power under the 1951 Act to slash any sentence on a discretionary basis and I cannot imagine what possible purpose would be served by having a court hearing which would entail the Garda having to chase around trying to discover whether there are newly discovered facts which deal only with mitigation of penalty.</P>
    <P>I think this shows a crass ignorance &mdash; I regret being too harsh in my words &mdash; on the part of the draftsman that we should now have rehearings of trials based on newly discovered facts when there is no demand for it.  Nobody has ever demanded that that should be done. I have never heard a single politician in this House ever request a change in the law so that the Court of Criminal Appeal can vary sentences on the basis that some newly discovered fact relating only to the sentence has now become available.  It is a futile, silly proposal, dreamt up by <Col N="927" /> people with no practical experience of its likely consequences.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue in this matter is whether the Court of Criminal Appeal is going to function as a fact finding body in the case of suspected miscarriages of justice.  It is clear from what has happened thus far that the Government is working on the assumption that it cannot have the equivalent of the English system; which would probably be unconstitutional. That is a method of filtration of allegations, such as suggested by Democratic Left.  If there is a right of access to the Court of Criminal Appeal, then a reference system by the Home Secretary, which translates into a reference system by the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General or whoever, is probably unconstitutional.  We are left in a position that if any remedy is made available in the Court of Criminal Appeal, then unless it is frivolous and vexatious &mdash; that is dealt with in the Bill &mdash; it must be open to everybody who has been convicted to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>I believe this is based on a foolish misunderstanding of the nature of pardon and on the only way to effectively cancel a conviction: an order by the Court of Criminal Appeal quashing a conviction is the only way a conviction can effectively be put aside.  The Department of Justice officials who drafted this Bill have been advised by someone &mdash; we know not whom &mdash; that a pardon cannot do the same thing.  I regard that as a fundamental error that ought to be exposed. I believe its consequences will be manifold and far-reaching.</P>
    <P>If the Court of Criminal Appeal is now to start hearing witnesses in respect of newly discovered evidence, the question that arises immediately for answer is: what are the Court of Criminal Appeal to do with such evidence when it becomes available to them?  We have to look back to the Birmingham Six case in England to see the same conundrum and how it caused absolute mayhem when it was not properly addressed in the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Let me remind the Minister of State at the Department of Justice of the case of one Ms Joyce Lynass.  Ms Joyce Lynass was a woman police constable who was stationed in a police station where people suspected of bombing offences were interrogated.  She gave evidence at their trial but never mentioned alleged abuses and brutality which she later said she saw. She changed her mind at some stage in the ensuing years and came to the Court of Criminal Appeal with no motive whatsoever, unless she was a publicity seeker of the grossest kind, and admitted that her evidence on the first occasion was perjury and stated that she had in fact seen major abuse of the people who had made confessions in the station to which she was attached.  Hers was very significant evidence.  Presumably, if it had been heard by the original jury it would have had to go into the weighing scales in their determination of what was to happen.  Her case was flung out of court and obloquy was heaped on her.  She was told she was a perjurer and the proof of her dishonest character, according to their Lordships in the Court of Appeal, was that she was admitting to be a perjurer since her first evidence never mentioned any of these things, even though she had been sworn on the occasion of that trial to tell the truth.</P>
    <P>Therefore, somebody who comes before a group of three judges who are not good judges of fact in criminal matters, as experience has shown, faces the horrific prospect of not only having his or her evidence rejected but of being disbelieved and branded a perjurer by three people who of themselves have no right or status under our Constitution to determine matters of fact in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>The right to trial by jury is in place under the Constitution.  If the Court of Criminal Appeal here and the Court of Appeal in England consider factual evidence and decide on it, that is a departure from trial by jury and people will be kept in jail because three judges have decided that new evidence tendered which was not available on the last occasion is faulty or incredible.  Will the Minister of State <Col N="929" /> tell me what it is about this pathetic set of proposals which will save us from the same fate when the next scandal or suspected miscarriage of justice comes before the courts?  There is nothing different in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the Court of Criminal Appeal and its powers do not clearly set out what happens when evidence which it is believed would have an effect is put before it.  Is the Court of Criminal Appeal to assess its credibility or decide to have a jury re-empanelled to go over the whole trial again?  The Bill does not say which must be done and that is of crucial importance.  It does not specify that the court must, if it discovers evidence which if true would sway the jury's mind, order a second trial.  In many cases there are good reasons why a second trial could not be ordered.  If a person comes back with a crucial witness five or seven years on, half of the primary witnesses originally available to the prosecution may have died or emigrated or have completely forgotten all the relevant evidence and the possibility of reconvening them for a trial would be practically zero.  Under this Bill we are asking three men who are not suitable judges of fact to decide on new evidence which was not available at the original trial, to decide on whether or not the original jury might have been affected by this evidence and grant a retrial because the prosecution's case might have disintegrated. Alternatively if they decide that the evidence could have tipped the balance, they will quash the conviction because they are no longer satisfied that a jury could have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt if it had heard this evidence.  That involves coming to a view on the credibility of evidence put before the court.</P>
    <P>This proposal is a recipe for disaster. It means that every criminal jury verdict in murder and serious rape cases will be the first step in a long legal battle when every convicted person realises that there is an open door through which he can come back again and again with new witnesses, as long as he does not fall into the &ldquo;frivolous and vexatious&rdquo; category.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> In a celebrated case recently decided in the court the defence was that the man did not know how he had come to be in a particular place when a public house blew up around him.  If his memory is jogged in five or ten years time will we see him back in the Court of Criminal Appeal saying that he can now produce somebody who saw him being dragged into the premises?  Is this the kind of nonsense this legislation is inviting?</P>

      <P>There will be a huge amount of money for barristers, most of which will be wasted.  This could be avoided if we took on board what the Martin Committee suggested.  It will be a vast waste of public resources and the Court of Criminal Appeal will be bogged down in these kinds of cases.  The court will find that witnesses will be produced who require to be investigated by the police and typically the police will find that they are people without character who have previous convictions and so on. All these matters will be rehearsed before the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scenario does not even deal with the man who wants to change his evidence, who wants to say that he told lies. As Deputy De Rossa pointed out and as the Martin Committee made clear, if one perjured somebody into jail or if one is a policeman who beat somebody up to get <Col N="931" /> a confession and had a change of heart ten years later and the accused is still rotting in Portlaoise, one could easily go before the committee system proposed by the Martin Committee and could confess in private and refuse to give the evidence in public so as not to expose oneself to an action by the accused for falsely putting him into jail.  What kind of remedy is provided in the Bill for such a person?  None.  The Minister has not thought about how this will work in practice. It is great for the Minister to come in here and say that he is implementing legislation to deal with miscarriages of justice, but it defies belief that the Minister is creating more and more problems without having consulted with anybody who knows anything about the issue and has come up with a group of futile proposals as the answer to the problem.  He does not realise that he will magnify all the problems already associated with criminal law.  It defies belief that this process could have led to this Bill being put before the House in these circumstances and that this is the Minister's best effort at dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions which were taken out on Committee Stage in relation to compensation shows how futile the whole thing is.  If the onus of proof was beyond reasonable doubt, as the Department of Justice officials who drafted this Bill originally proposed, Edward Noel Kelly would not have got any money because it was never decided beyond a reasonable doubt that he was entitled to compensation.  This is the kind of nonsense that we have to face.  That man has £800,000 compensation and is now being told by the Minister that he has not even got an exculpation of guilt.  If there is a High Court case which declares that this pardon given to Edward Noel Kelly touches his guilt as well as his penalties, it will be a very expensive lesson in law for the Department of Justice and they will then realise that there was no point in having all these return trips to the Court of Criminal Appeal because there was a very simple method of arriving at the same result which was free of all the <Col N="932" /> legal doubts they are rehearsing in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is wrong but it is never too late for the Government to say that it has got it wrong.  The Government has rushed this through without consulting anybody.  This matter has been before the House over a period of a month but the Government has achieved nothing in terms of addressing the fundamental principle.  Even today the Minister has said he is not satisfied as to the effect of a pardon.  If he seriously thinks that the effect of a pardon is not to touch guilt, he will have litigation in the High Court in the case of Nicky Kelly because what the Minister has said today is that in the eyes of the law that man stands guilty.  What chance would Edward Noel Kelly have of going back to the Court of Criminal Appeal and availing of this ridiculous procedure so many years later if the Minister is right about the fact that his guilt still stands?</P>
    <P>What chance would he have of availing of this ridiculous procedure?  Would he bring his new evidence to the Court of Criminal Appeal and say he has discovered several discreditable facts about those who may or may not have interrogated him?  What would the Court of Criminal Appeal do then?  It would grant him free legal aid, the DPP would have to brief counsel and, under the provisions of this Bill, the matter would have to be investigated by the Garda Síochána. They would have to again investigate the Edward Noel Kelly case.  What is the point of this provision?  Does the Minister not realise it would not even satisfactorily address a case such as the Tallaght Two or be of assistance to the Birmingham Six because this type of provision got them into the mess in the first place.  Constables Lynass and Clarke had their reputations destroyed by this type of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Neither would this provision be of any assistance to Edward Noel Kelly.  Who will it assist?  With what type of injustices is it supposed to deal?  It will not affect genuine cases which a committee of inquiry or a pardon procedure would cover.  It will summon, like summoning spirits from a graveyard, every type of <Col N="933" /> lunatic application.  Everybody serving a life sentence in our prison system at present will see a chink of light and try to establish new facts.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of what will happen as a result of this provision.  Let us suppose ten to 20 people are sent to jail on the evidence of two gardaí who took their confessions even though many protests were made before juries and so on that they had abused their interviewees.  If it is proven that those gardaí assaulted a person in one of the cases, will that be a newly discovered fact which, if the original jury had discovered, would have caused them to take a different view of the gardaí?  If one of those gardaí, while drunk in a pub, admits to beating up a number of people in the past, does it mean everybody convicted by him will have a newly discovered fact to bring before the Court of Criminal Appeal?</P>
    <P>When one examines the details of the legislation one begins to see what is radically wrong with it.  This is not fantasy on my part.  It was discovered that the West Midlands Crime Squad was riddled with corruption.  Does it mean that everybody convicted on the evidence of a member of the West Midlands Crime Squad can say they have a newly discovered fact that the people who gave evidence against them, although posturing as credible witnesses, were brazen liars?  Would this provision open the doors for such cases?  In such circumstances, how would one distinguish between those who made genuine confessions and those who did not?  Would it mean letting them all go if the Court of Criminal Appeal takes a single view in a number of cases?  Each case will set a precedent.  If it is proven that a garda is not a credible witness in one case, he or she cannot be deemed a credible witness in any other case.  If judges disbelieve the gardaí, or believe them and disbelieve others, we are departing completely from the notion of a jury verdict.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (d) of the legislation states that the Court of Criminal Appeal may quash a conviction in certain cases and, if it appears to the court that the appellant <Col N="934" /> could have been found guilty of some other offence and that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty, it could substitute for the verdict a verdict of guilty of the other offence.  I do not usually come in here and state that something is unconstitutional but I suspect that provision is unconstitutional. For example, if a person found in a premises says he did not intend to commit a murder but to commit a burglary and brings witnesses along to prove he was there to commit a burglary and did not commit the murder, is it open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to say he is not guilty of murder but, if any of the evidence is true, he must be guilty of committing a burglary and impose sentence accordignly?</P>
    <P>Is the Department of Justice aware that in the People <i>v.</i> Davis case in the past year a judge of the High Court and the Central Criminal Court directed a jury to find a person guilty of murder, asked them not to leave the jury box and said that on the basis of the evidence presented no jury could reasonably withhold a verdict of murder.  The jury insisted on retiring and came back with a verdict of manslaughter.  Although, under the provisions of this legislation, the Supreme Court will not decide such cases in the future, it stated in such cases a judge is not competent to direct a jury as to what they should be satisfied with. If that is the position in a murder case, does not the same principle apply where judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal state that on the evidence the jury would have been satisfied in respect of a matter?</P>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal is not a fact finding body and this section of the Bill purports to give it jurisdiction to convict people of offences with which they were not even charged, which is remarkable.  Who devised that idea, where was it tested or what consultation was held among constitutional criminal lawyers?  I do not bleieve any effort was made in that regard.  This is lazy minded nonsense from the Department of Justice and it should not be allowed to be enacted in its present form.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for taking up the <Col N="935" /> time of the House on this matter.  I believe passionately that I am correct, that I will be proven right and have the ultimate satisfaction, wherever I am in a few years' time, of indicating to the Minister the foolishness of this legislation, if it is enacted.  I have never seen a Minister, on a Bill as important as this and based on a report conducted by experts, doing a U-turn on the expert advice received and literally tearing up the principles of the experts who were asked by the Government to consider the report.  It is not as if a group of self-interested barristers, a group of foolish laypeople with no idea about the law or a group of people whose judgment is defective, regardless of status, arrived at the conclusions of the report of the Martin Committee.  A number of senior civil servants and a senior member of the Garda Síochána were on the board and it was chaired by an experienced judge. The Attorney General's Office was also represented.</P>
    <P>They all considered these issues and come to the view that what the Minister proposes is fundamentally wrong, they had the guts to point out the futility of the course the Minister is undertaking. He has not answered their arguments or dealt with the faults they identified in the course he is pursuing.  Instead he has adopted a weak-minded approach, that we will try the system which has been tried and failed in Britain and add to it a little ingredient of a committee of inquiry to assist the Government.</P>
    <P>I strongly counsel the Minister of State to abandon the principle of this Bill and adopt what his experts told him was the right approach to this problem.  If he fails to do this he will do more damage in one Bill to the idea that a jury's verdict is final and that the sentence imposed by a court is final than the terrorists and subversives have done to the rule of law. Everybody who is in jail for 15 to 20 years is going to regard this Bill as their potential passport to freedom.  It contains nothing to protect the legal system from all the scandals which befell the British system when judges began to substitute <Col N="936" /> their own determinations as to the credibility of witnesses instead of allowing juries to do so.  That is what is at stake here.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage I implore the Minister of State to go to the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Irish association of law teachers and the criminal lawyers association for their observations on this Bill. I genuinely assure him that he would have room for thought and hesitation and would say that perhaps now is not the time to proceed with this measure but rather to look again at the principle of the Martin report to see whether it is the right way around the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has said that somebody who cannot prove in a court of law that they are innocent because evidence is not available &mdash; for instance, the person who can prove they are innocent will not stand up in a court of law &mdash; can be given a pardon but, because the Minister of State misunderstands the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;, they would still be guilty. He has said, effectively, that Edward Noel Kelly has been given £800,000 and a pardon which on the face of it exculpates him but he still stands guilty in the eyes of the law.  A Minister of State who comes before the House that misinformed and badly advised as to produce a Bill of this kind should at least do us the courtesy of hesitating before proceeding any further with the legislation.  There are many opinions and plenty of expertise available on this matter but none of it is apparent in this Bill; quite the reverse, this Bill is a charter for chaos in the administration of the criminal law and the responsibility of this will lie firmly with the Minister of State if he proceeds any further with this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to repeat that we support the principle of this legislation which is to provide a remedy in cases alleging a miscarriage of justice. There is a need for such a remedy.  Recent legal history, both here and in the United Kingdom in particular, shows that despite the fact there is a good track record in regard to our justice system through several appeals procedures on <Col N="937" /> rare occasions &mdash; we have to believe this &mdash; substantial doubts may exist in certain cases, as to the propriety of a conviction. Therefore there is a need to set up a review body.</P>
      <P>While we agree that there is a need for a review body we believe that sections 7 and 8 buttressed by a clarity as to the legal effect of a pardon, are adequate to deal with the cases this legislation seeks to address.  As my colleague said, there has never been a call to put in place an open-ended system whereby ordinary cases would be referred back to the courts when new evidence is presented.  One point I would like to make about the committee system which has been put in place in this new Dáil is that on Committee Stage the Minister of State was accessible; perhaps he was too accessible in that we had a heated debate on the legal effect of a pardon and on the Nicky Kelly case.  However, it proved useful because in that interchange of ideas we discovered that the rationale and the reason the Government is going against the advice of the Martin committee &mdash; this was a source of bewilderment for all Deputies &mdash; and pursuing instead the dual option.  There was never any demand for the first option &mdash; referral back to the courts.  This interferes with the principle of finality and <i>res adjudicata</i> in criminal cases.  As Deputy McDowell said, it will also lead to chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State admitted that the people concerned in cases involving lies, a conspiracy of silence, perjury and where prisoners are abused by the authorities will be able to avail of the second best solution of a pardon because there are some doubts as to the legal effect of a pardon, according to the Minister of State.  We must remember that the purpose of the legislation is to provide a remedy in cases involving a miscarriage of justice &mdash; those odd and unusual cases.  The Department, rather than attempting to solve the original problem and to provide a review system in cases involving an alleged miscarriage of justice, has confused the issue.  What we have got instead is this needless referral to the courts for ordinary criminals <Col N="938" /> while the persons concerned in the cases that do not fit into that category will be able to opt for the alternative route of a pardon which is also unsatisfactory.  In providing these two options the Minister of State is pleasing nobody and confusing everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides have nothing to gain politically in pointing out the errors in this legislation.  It is not a political matter, it is a question of getting it right. There is widespread agreement arising from the lessons we learned in the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six cases that there is a need for a review body.  A special committee was set up to examine this matter but the Minister of State has turned his face against its recommendations and opted instead to implement in part the recommendations of the Martin committee.  In the process cases will be needlessly referred back to the courts.  However, this will cause untold problems.  A practitioner such as Deputy McDowell is in the best position to be the judge of that.  I am not happy with sections 7 and 8.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to opt for the dual route I could live with it because it will be proved in the future that the proposal to refer cases back to the courts was a disaster.  If I felt that the second option, the second best solution of a pardon for those who have been abused and been the victims of a miscarriage of justice was good enough I could live with the dual route but, given the confusion and the lack of clarity as to the legal effect of a pardon, this matter is in a mess.  It should be clarified in legislation so that at least we would be able to say that we have learned the lessons from previous cases and that we have produced a system under which a real remedy will be provided to blot out the guilt of somebody who has been found by a tribunal to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.  I urge the Minister of State to think again.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage the Minister of State had no option but to be responsive given the vigorous opposition of Deputies. Indeed, it was difficult to find a Government Deputy, even in the Labour Party, <Col N="939" /> who supported this proposal.  I urge the Minister to go back to the Attorney General, to consult more widely and to reconsider the matter.  How he will do this before tomorrow is beyond me, but perhaps the other House will provide an opportunity.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the previous contributors. Although one might have a certain sympathy with what Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell say, I fail to see the logic of their argument.  The suggestion is that if the matter were referred to a tribunal the chaos and the constant referrals would end.  There is no evidence to support that contention: a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  The court is the appropriate body to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>It has been contended that anybody can newly discover a fact.  That is true. But in the Bill it is stated that the newly-discovered fact must show that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  To that extent it must go to the root of the case and is of fundamental importance to the administration of justice.  That much must be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Court of Criminal Appeal itself, I do not think a person of Deputy McDowell's standing in the legal world would suggest for one moment that the Court of Criminal Appeal would ignore a newly-discovered fact which showed that there had been a miscarriage of justice. That suggestion, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that perhaps the Court of Criminal Appeal which cannot be trusted to consider a new fact which shows there has been a miscarriage of justice should not have heard the case in the first instance.  That <Col N="940" /> kind of logic will not wash with anybody in the Four Courts or with anybody out in the street listening to this debate.  In short, the measure the Minister is introducing, although complex, appears to be just about the best way of dealing with these matters.  The suggestion that there will be constant referrals and no finality is to say that a newly-discovered fact can be anything once it is some kind of fact. That is not the case.  Neither is it the case that one would avoid constant referrals by having a tribunal.</P>
    <P>In general terms the administration of criminal justice here has been of the highest standard.  However, there are and have been cases where it is clear, <i>prima facie</i> at any rate, that an injustice was done.  There is no self-respecting judge on the Court of Criminal Appeal who would ignore a new fact which showed that there had been a miscarriage of justice. To be fair, the Court of Criminal Appeal has no vested interest in convicting people of crimes.  Deputy McDowell would accept that much.  For that matter, no court has a vested interest in convicting people of crimes.  Some balance is called for and I sincerely hope I have provided that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to deal with the case of Edward Noel Kelly.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Donnell asked me if a pardon, as contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution, touched guilt.  I said I had taken advice and that I was of the view that it did not set aside the conviction.  All I can have in relation to this is a view, because we will not know exactly what the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo; in Article 13.6 of the Constitution means until the courts interpret that term.  We cannot interpret, expand or delimit it.  We cannot say it means a certain thing if a President or somebody else says something in a certain way.  That is the only point I make.  I am not saying definitely that the pardon granted to Mr. Kelly did not exculpate him.  I am just saying what view I took and that the term has not been defined.  I fully accept the terms of the pardon granted by President Robinson <Col N="941" /> which Deputy O'Donnell has read into the record.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell said that whatever he or I may be in a few years' time, he will be able to say that he was proved right and I was proved wrong.  Given Deputy McDowell's record of predictions to date, I am happy to tell the House that I will sleep well tonight.</P>
      <P>I will not have time to deal with all the points made by Deputy McDowell between now and 7 o'clock.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I will deal with each and every point he made, however long it takes.  These amendments were discussed at some length on Committee Stage and revealed quite a clear difference between the approach of the Government and that of the Opposition on how best to review alleged miscarriages of justice.  In keeping with the positive and constructive spirit of the debate on Committee Stage, I said that I would look again at the amendments to see if there was any way in which a compromise could be reached.  I gave it a great deal of thought and a close reading of the Martin committee report does not convince me that I am wrong; nor does what I heard on Second Stage, on Committee Stage or here tonight convince me that I am wrong.  I am still open to being convinced if somebody can put up a convincing argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with each and every point the Deputy made.  I do not want to go over all the points I made on Committee Stage, but I am anxious to give Deputies a clear and reasonable explanation of my position and that of the Minister.  There is a strong and compelling argument in favour of enabling the Court of Criminal Appeal to re-examine a case where fresh evidence emerges. Our Constitution requires justice to be administered in courts established by law.  The Court of Criminal Appeal was established by law for the precise purpose of hearing appeals against conviction or sentence.  It is entirely reasonable, sensible <Col N="942" /> and proper to say that the court should hear further appeals based on fresh evidence.  That is the type of work for which the court was created and in respect of which its powers are being improved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Much was made on Committee Stage of restrictions which apply to the court, such as rules of evidence and sanctions against people who commit perjury.  In fact, these are not restrictions which prevent the court from getting at the truth, but protection for people accused of crimes, protection which centuries of judicial experience has found to be desirable. There are good reasons why evidence must generally be heard direct from a witness, and not second or third-hand; why people cannot with impunity change their evidence on oath from one hearing to the next; and why a defence witness who claims to be the real culprit should have to bear responsibility for that position.  The argument that we should move away from the Court of Criminal Appeal in this Bill is an argument that we should move away from the essential safeguards and protections that are an intrinsic part of our system of criminal law.  Of course the Bill anticipates and provides for cases which would not be suitable for the courts, but that is a very different matter from a complete abandonment of court appeals.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the main argument I have heard against the inclusion of the court in this Bill is that the court will, in the teeth of fresh evidence, invariably hold to its previous affirmation of conviction or sentence.  I do not accept that in any way and I reject what is, no matter how it is dressed up, a slight on the integrity of the court.</P>

It would be a total misrepresentation of the position of those people to suggest that Deputies on this side of the House, who are arguing a valid case, are casting a slur on the Judiciary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If it makes Deputies opposite happier I withdraw my comment, no personal insult was intended by it.  Deputy De Rossa's point refers to the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, in the United Kingdom, but we are referring to the Irish courts.  In saying that I am not casting any slur on the English courts and I will deal with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the court will impartially assess any fresh evidence and base any decision on that and that alone.  In any event, the argument that the court will <Col N="945" /> somehow be reluctant to change from its previous verdict in a case because of a natural human disinclination to admit a mistake is inherently flawed.  Any new appeal will be based on fresh evidence, that is evidence which was not put to the court in the first place.  A court can only decide a case on the evidence before it, so what possible reluctance could the court have in saying that if it had heard this evidence at the first appeal, it would not have affirmed the conviction?</P>
    <P>Of course, the Martin committee was concerned to deal with the issue of alleged miscarriages of justice which are not suitable for assessment by a court.  I acknowledge that there could be such cases and that provision must be made for them.  In that regard the Bill faithfully follows the recommendations of the Martin committee and provides that cases not suitable for the Court of Criminal Appeal can be referred to a committee of inquiry which will give its opinion as to whether the President should be advised to grant a pardon.  The precise effect of a pardon was raised by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage. I do not believe there was much difference of substance between us on the issue.  Having listened to the discussions tonight I may have to change that view and I will come back to that point.</P>
    <P>What is beyond doubt is that a Presidential pardon cannot be granted where a person remains guilty of an offence. This point was well made by Deputy Gilmore on Committee Stage when he said that the establishment of committees to recommend Presidential pardons can, by definition, only deal with cases where there has been no guilt of any kind.</P>
    <P>The technicality matter is a different one and I will come back to that point. Deputy Gilmore's point is correct and it highlights the importance of providing a procedure whereby convicted persons may, on the basis of new evidence, seek to have a lesser conviction imposed or to have a sentence reduced.  Section 2 provides that procedure.  Only the Court of Criminal Appeal can substitute a lesser conviction or reduce a sentence in these <Col N="946" /> cases.  To oppose a referral back to the court would be to leave persons in such a situation without a remedy.</P>
    <P>The reference in Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 3 to the Government taking such other action as it considers appropriate does not meet this crucial point.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the power to commute or remit a punishment, forfeiture or disqualification imposed by a court.  However, this would leave in place the conviction affirmed on appeal and the convicted person liable to any consequences which flow from that. Commutation or remission of sentence is a valuable constitutional option, but it would not be an answer to many of the types of cases which could arise under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The essence of this Bill is a balanced approach to cases of alleged miscarriage of justice.  The Bill recognises that not every case can be dealt with by the courts and not every case can be dealt with by committees of inquiry.  I would ask Deputies themselves to recognise this and to support the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to apply to summary convictions the new provision of returning to a court of appeal with fresh evidence.  On Committee Stage, I explained why that would not be a practical proposal and, for the same reasons, it is still not practical.</P>
    <P>The first point that strikes me about this amendment is that it proposes that the Court of Criminal Appeal should hear second or subsequent appeals against summary convictions.  That is a completely unrealistic proposal.  If the principle is to be accepted of permitting persons who have unsuccessfully appealed against summary convictions to appeal once again on the basis of fresh evidence, then the only possible court would be the Circuit Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>It is, however, difficult to see how the Circuit Criminal Court could deal with such a further appeal because of the way in which summary offences are tried and the way in which appeals are heard.  Proceedings in the District Court are not recorded nor is any appeal to the Circuit Criminal Court.  Unlike the Court of <Col N="947" /> Criminal Appeal, which can consider an appeal or order a retrial, appeals to the Circuit Criminal Court are by way of a complete rehearing before the judge sitting without a jury.  Such a judge, hearing a further appeal, would have no transcript of the trial or the appeal.  The only option open to the judge would be to conduct a rehearing, but the judge would have nothing against which to assess the significance of the fresh evidence to even decide whether there ought to be a rehearing.  The new statutory procedures for the consideration of a pardon will apply to persons convicted of summary offences where fresh evidence comes to light.  This seems to me to be the only practical remedy in such cases.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 7, 8, 17, 21 and 22, concern was expressed on Second Stage that a convicted person who holds back exculpatory evidence for a genuine reason, for example out of fear or a desire to protect another person, should not be prevented from adducing evidence of this on an application under section 2 or in a petition for a pardon.  The circumstances where this might happen would be exceptionally rare, but I accepted that the possibility should be provided for and, accordingly, appropriate Committee Stage amendments in the Minister's name made clear that a convicted person may apply to the court under section 2, or have a petition for a pardon considered under the new procedure in section 7, even where the fresh evidence had been withheld by himself or herself.  Of course, there would have to be a reasonable explanation as to why the evidence had not previously been adduced and the court or the Minister for Justice, as the case might be, would have to be satisfied of this.  The amendments I tabled on Committee Stage so provided and dealt with the substance of amendments Nos. 7 and 8 now proposed by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The amendments now being debated are the same as those tabled by the Deputy and debated on Committee Stage.  I explained then, and I will now explain again, that these amendments <Col N="948" /> provide for a circumstance already provided for in the Bill &mdash; provided even before the Minister's Committee Stage amendments.  The reason is that if a person other than the accused declines to bring relevant evidence before the court, and if this subsequently comes to the attention of the accused, then that will constitute a newly discovered fact.  The definition of newly discovered fact clearly covers that position.  The only issue of concern, therefore, is a situation where the accused himself or herself holds back exculpatory evidence.  This situation is explicitly provided for in the Bill as a result of the Committee Stage amendments.</P>
    <P>Having explained why I cannot accept the first three amendments in this grouping, I want to set out the reason I cannot accept the remaining two amendments. Essentially, the position is that any situation whereby a person other than the accused withholds evidence is already covered by the definition of newly-discovered fact.  This applies to section 9 as much as to sections 2 and 7.  However, while I believe that an accused who deliberately withholds exculpatory evidence should always be enabled to establish his or her innocence, I do not accept that such a person should be entitled to compensation. That would be the effect of the fourth and fifth of these amendments to section 9 and I must oppose them albeit for a slightly different reason from that which applies to the first three amendments.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 10, I undertook on Committee Stage to have another look at this amendment to see if, in light of the arguments put forward on Committee Stage, I could accept it.  In relation to the precise details of the amendment, I will refer briefly to the purpose of the provision.  In section 3 (3) (a) the Court of Criminal Appeal is being given an important new power to order the Garda Commissioner to carry out inquiries to see if further evidence ought to be adduced.  The court's role will be to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it and not to carry out an inquiry itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> There may be cases where issues raised by the appellant or prosecution cannot be resolved on the facts available and which the court may wish to have investigated further.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>There are in this State more than 300,000 people unemployed. Political and legislative action is needed to remove the barriers to job creation and to modernise outdated legislation where it inhibits people from taking risks, thereby creating new jobs for themselves and others.  There is a limit to the contribution that Opposition politicians can make.  We engage in negative criticism of Government when it gets it wrong and prod lethargic Ministers into action to address issues which have been for far too long ignored.  We also produce alternative tax plans and policy documents. However, since we are in a minority position in the Dáil, it is the Government which at the end of the day determines the policies to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the few methods by which an Opposition party can bring a positive proposal before the Oireachtas is by use of Private Members' Bills.  The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is the tenth Private Members' Bill I have published on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, the third this year.  This Bill is designed to address problems relating to the commercial property sector which create particular difficulties for those who wish to start up businesses.  It addresses an area which this Government and the previous Government indicated they <Col N="950" /> intended to address with amending legislation but in respect of which to date no Government legislation has been published. I intend, first, to describe the background problems which give rise to the need for such a Bill and then to refer to the detailed proposals contained in it.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, as it relates to leases for the occupation of commercial property, acts as a barrier to business and job creation.  Under its provisions a tenant of a commercial property becomes entitled to a 35 year lease after only three years continuous business occupation.  This has resulted in only very short term or very long term leases being available.  Legislation in force in other European Union countries provides for a much more flexible regime for the leasing of commercial property.</P>
    <P>The current law is widely perceived as being disadvantageous to both landlords and tenants.  Among the difficulties caused by the current law are the following. Many landlords are unwilling to lease premises for periods longer than two years and nine months as they do not wish to commit themselves to a 35 year letting.  Such short term leases are a disincentive to tenants who wish to or need to modernise and fit out newly acquired premises as, upon completion of the letting period, there is no certainty their lease will be renewed.  Many tenants do not want to make the financial commitment to a 35 year letting as they may be uncertain as to their ability to meet such financial commitment.  Many people starting up new businesses envisage an initial three to five year growth period and then wish to move to larger premises without the burden of having to dispose of a leasehold interest of long duration. The possibility of longer start-up leases would facilitate tenants obtaining a reasonable return on money invested in leased premises without creating the burden that arises from a 35 year commitment.</P>
    <P>The IDA has over a number of years experienced considerable difficulty with the existing Landlord and Tenant Acts when seeking to attract multinationals to <Col N="951" /> the country on a leasehold basis.  The current law is a disincentive to overseas business wishing to locate and lease property in Ireland.  Such businesses are used to medium term leases and their accounting practices, which require them to treat long term leases as a liability, act as a deterrent to their locating here.  This was recognised by the Government in the case of firms wishing to locate in the International Financial Services Centre in that the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1989, removed the leasehold renewal rights granted in the period 1989-94 for companies trading in the IFSC.  Even where a landlord and tenant wish to enter into their own arrangements and do not want to be bound by the current law, they are prevented from opting out of the provisions contained in this Act.</P>
    <P>The need to change the law in this area has been known for some time.  A recent survey undertaken by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce of a representative mixture of businesses in Dublin city, a mix which included both landlord and tenants, shows that 78 per cent of those surveyed favoured change, 64 per cent of whom were landlords and 83 per cent tenants.  There was a desire for change among all sections of the business community. In the context of this survey it was quite clear that the majority of people in all sectors of business in Dublin city favoured change.  The results of this survey are mirrored by views of business people in towns and cities throughout Ireland, who believe that the current law creates difficulties and barriers for business. This survey, published only a short time ago, was conducted at a time when Fine Gael was preparing the legislation which is before the House.  It is interesting that the feedback we got from the business community was mirrored in the results contained in that survey.  I think I am right in saying that this survey is the first of its kind published in an attempt to address this area in detail.</P>
    <P>The need for reform has been highlighted not only by Dublin Chamber of Commerce but also by other groups and <Col N="952" /> organisations working with the business community and dealing particularly with business premises.  It is interesting that since publication of this Bill the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, whose members are directly involved in the leasing of premises, acting on behalf of both landlords and tenants, indicated their support for this measure and expressed the hope that this Bill will be successful in its passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with the Bill's proposals. The provisions contained in the Bill will provide a modern legal framework for business tenancies.  They are designed to provide for flexibility while also ensuring for business tenants the security of tenure necessary to maintain continuity in their businesses.  Under the Bill's provisions the right to a new tenancy will arise upon five year's continuous occupation of a business premises instead of the current period of three years.  As a result it will be possible for landlords to provide for longer leases than are available at present without being obliged to enter into a 35 year leasehold agreement upon termination of the tenancy.  Moreover, tenants who do not wish to be committed to unduly long leases but who wish to have reasonable security of tenure to realise the benefits of any moneys invested by them in a property leased will be able to enter into leases of longer duration than is possible under present law.</P>
    <P>Typically, in the context of this Bill what is at present the two year and nine months lease will become, in circumstances where the landlord or tenant do not wish to be committed to a longer lease, a four year and nine months lease, if people do not entirely opt out of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  Because of the proposed opt out provision it would be possible, in effect, for landlords and tenants to enter into whatever arrangements suit them in the context of the tenancy agreed for the business for which it is required.  Under this Bill it will be possible for the first time for landlords and tenants to voluntarily contract out of the statutory leasehold renewal rights <Col N="953" /> and obligations contained in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.  There was a time when it was necessary to ensure that such an opt out could not take place.  This was at a time when business tenants were very much at the mercy of landlords.  The provisions in the 1980 Act had a function in their day, which perhaps was a good deal prior to 1980.  Nowadays the arrangements entered into should very much depend on what each side wish to agree in the context of the existing market.  Due to the difficult business climate, business premises are available for leasing in most areas.  It is more a tenants' market than a landlords' market.  The curiosity is that in many respects the current law makes life a great deal more difficult for tenants in the commercial property sector rather than providing protection.  This was proved in the survey carried out by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce where a large number of tenants leasing business premises indicated their support for change in the law.</P>
    <P>Where the right to renewal of tenancy is relied upon, the current law applicable to business premises is modified by the Bill to provide for a 15-year as opposed to a 35-year lease, with five year rent reviews.  This does not mean that at the end of the 15-year period a tenant running a successful business who wishes to maintain his business in the original premises is prevented from doing so.  The Bill will allow for renewal of the lease for a further 15-year term.  The Bill also provides that after the 15-year period a tenant should not feel bound to renew the lease for a further 15-year period, as perhaps is the case under the present law. The difficulties which can arise in such circumstances will not arise under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the specific provisions contained in the Bill.  Section 1 deals with the Title of the Bill, while section 2 is the definition section.  Section 3 is a substantive section which proposes to change the current legal position.  This section proposes to amend section 13 (1) (a) of the 1980 Act so as to provide that the right to a new tenancy under the Act <Col N="954" /> will only arise upon the business tenant being in continuous occupation of a premises as a tenant for a period of five years instead of the current period of three years.  Accordingly, a landlord wishing to lease a premises but not wishing to make a long term commitment to a tenant will, under this section, be free to enter into a longer leasehold arrangement than is possible under the present law.  Moreover, tenants who do not wish to be committed to unduly long leases but who wish to have reasonable security of tenure in order to realise the benefits of any moneys invested by them in the property leased will under the Bill be able to enter into leases of longer duration than is possible under the present law.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that tenants will be allowed legally to contract out of their statutory lease renewal rights if they so wish at the time they are entering into a leasehold arrangement.  In order to do this they must be acting in a bona fide manner, which effectively means they must have their own independent legal advice and understand the nature of the arrangements they are entering into and what they are contracting out of.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the general position in regard to the renewal of leases in the context of the term of years which becomes available by way of a statutory right to a new lease.  Under the current law, when a tenant invokes his right to a new tenancy a landlord can be required to enter into a lease of 35 years duration. Provision is contained in current legislation for rent reviews every five years. Under this section it will be possible, if the tenant is agreeable, for a lease of a lesser duration to be entered into.  In the case of business premises, this section provides for the new tenancy to be for a period of 15 years instead of a period of 35 years.  Provision contained in the legislation for rent reviews every five years mirrors the current position where there can be rent reviews every five years in the case of a 35 year lease.  In this case rent reviews will apply to 15 year leases.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is essentially a technical section.  Section 85 of the 1980 Act renders <Col N="955" /> void any agreement to opt out of the provisions contained in the Act with regard to the right of a new tenancy.  This technical amendment to the 1980 Act will allow business premises to avail of the opt out provision in the Bill.  If this provision was not included there could be a difficulty in the interpretation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this legislation is confined only to commercial premises and commercial leases.  It does not address the broader issues which arise in other forms of leasehold arrangements. It is designed to meet a particular need within the business community and to remove artificial barriers to the creation of business or artificial barriers which give rise to difficulties in arranging for suitable premises to be made available to people, particularly in the start-up business sector.  The Bill covers all areas from the retail area to the manufacturing and services areas.  Many of the reasons which gave rise in 1989 to changing the law as it applies to the Financial Services Centre, a small area of Dublin, apply equally in terms of changing the law on a national basis.</P>
    <P>This relatively simple and straightforward Bill addresses an issue which to date has not been regarded as a priority by the Government.  Having regard to the pressures on it and the different areas which require legislation, it is understandable that this area has not been addressed to date by the Government. The Bill, if implemented, will provide badly needed flexibility in regard to the provision of commercial property for leasing and help to create an environment which encourages people to take the risks involved in creating their own businesses, while removing artificial burdens imposed by out-dated legislation.  The Bill contains no hidden political agenda and poses no political dangers of any nature to the Government or either Government party.  It is a modest, unexceptional measure with which the Government could not have any great argument.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will not have the same knee-jerk opposition to this Bill <Col N="956" /> as it had to the Refugee Protection Bill, which was brought before the House earlier this year.  I ask the Government not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage but rather allow it to proceed to be dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I will be happy to take on board any constructive amendments which might be tabled to ensure that the Bill meets the objective for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill has widespread support within the business community.  It will bring our laws in regard to business premises into line with the laws in many other European Union countries.  This is a technical, uncontroversial measure which I hope will be supported by all Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill and to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, a man of tremendous energy and skill, on the introduction of his tenth Bill in this House.  He always introduces Bills which are badly needed. I am sure the Minister for Justice, who has brought forward a number of Bills since she took office, will be very happy to have Deputy Shatter's expertise available to her.  The experts in the Bills Office are good, but I doubt very much if they are any better than Deputy Shatter, who deserves praise for the easy manner in which he can formulate Bills.  I suppose his training in the legal profession has been of benefit to him.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will indicate her welcome for this Bill which will resolve a problem.  In general, landlords and tenants have tempestuous relationships.  On occasions landlords find it difficult to remove tenants from their flats and on other occasions the tenants do not wish to remain in the flats because of the treatment they are receiving from landlords. The whole question of landlord and tenant should be reviewed across the board as well as the question of ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be welcomed by young people wishing to set up in business. Establishing a new business can be an <Col N="957" /> expensive process.  People have to decide whether to take a risk which may cost them quite an amount of money over a long period of time.  Under the proposals in this Bill they will be getting a fair crack of the whip.  Under the old legislation two years and nine months was too short a time frame for those who were serious about what they were trying to do.  The period of four years and nine months is certainly more fair.  It gives people an opportunity to get established, thereby allowing them to consider what their chances of success will be.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to set up innovation centres around the country with adequate rooms and floor space to encourage people to develop their ideas, because this country depends on people having ideas.  We must no longer believe that the old system will work.  Those who can come up with new ideas are needed in our society.  When these people have gone through the innovation stage we hope to have enterprise centres established in most towns where they can rent out floor space, thereby expanding on their initial developments.</P>
    <P>This Bill will encourage landlords to rent their premises because they will be aware that there will no longer be a 35 year lease commitment.  The Bill will also helps the young person starting off in business because he or she will not be bound by that lease commitment.  In fairness to both sides, a 35 year commitment is too long.  Many rents are completely unrealistic from the landlord's point of view; and from the point of view of someone who has not much money but who is hoping to become a millionaire as a result of a particular invention, a long term lease can be discouraging.  In section 5, the proposal for a 15 year lease will give people an opportunity to cut their cloth to suit their measure.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce revealed that 64 per cent of landlords and 83 per cent of tenants were in favour of a change in the present law.  That is sufficient proof that this Bill is needed both by landlords and tenants.  If the people involved in this area want change we must provide that <Col N="958" /> change.  I hope the Minister will accept what is proposed in this Bill and put those proposals into action.  I am sure many people around the country will benefit from the effect of this Bill, people in towns like Carlow and many more where there are many buildings that could be used if landlords felt satisfied to lease them and if tenants were happy to rent them.  Tenants should have the option of a five year rent period with the possibility of an extension.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to encourage young people and landlords alike.  In so doing it will be a help to the country in general, because we have to get industry up and running, we have to get people working and if problems exist in regard to the length of time one can rent a premises they will have a negative effect.  The concept of a 35 year lease is now out of date.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will welcome it also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to commend Deputy Shatter for the work which he put into preparing this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993-97, contains a commitment to amend the law on business tenancies.  While the Government has substantial reservations about the detail of some of what the Bill proposes, it does recognise the need for change in the law in this area.  In the circumstances the Government does not propose to oppose the Second Reading of the Bill on the basis that it will then be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security where I will bring forward amendments.  From my experience of the new committee system I believe it is ideally placed to deal with legislation of this nature and, in particular, to resolve differences of approach in the detail of the measures.  I should make it clear, however, that the reservations to which I have referred are of real significance and that the Government intends to use Committee Stage to advance its own approach in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the long title of the Bill refers to an Act to amend the law of landlord and <Col N="959" /> tenant, I am sure Deputy Shatter will accept that what the Bill in its detail sets out to do is, in the context of legislation in this area generally, quite modest in its scope.  In particular the Bill confines itself to amending aspects of the law in relation to business tenancies.  Given the difficulties which have come to light particularly in recent months in relation to residential tenancies &mdash; for example, the controversy about Mespil Estate &mdash; there may be some concern about the fact that in bringing forward proposals in the area of our landlord and tenant law the Deputy's party has chosen to give priority to the limited area of business tenancies rather than bring forward proposals to meet the concerns expressed by members of his own party and many others about the law in relation to security of tenure for residential tenants.  In the circumstances it might be helpful if I were to set out briefly the present position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that last May I replied to Private Notice Questions about Mespil Estate and I indicated that I would look at what amendments might be desirable and possible in the relevant areas of our landlord and tenant law.  There is clearly a very difficult balance to be drawn between, on the one hand, the level of protection which can be reasonably afforded to residential tenants and, on the other hand, the position of owners of such property.  The difficult reality in this area is that changes in the law which might be considered desirable in the context of the rights of tenants cannot be considered in isolation from their likely effect on the willigness of people to make available their property for rental in this sector.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I informed the House at Question Time that, given the stage which the assessment of the law in this area which had been under way in my Department had reached, the clearly complex issues which arose, the involvement of the Department of the Environment in related areas and the board nature of the considerations which had to be taken into account, I proposed to <Col N="960" /> establish a working group which would effectively be able to advance this matter. I have since appointed a senior official in my Department to chair the group and the other membership and terms of reference of the group will be finalised shortly.  As I have already indicated to the House, I will ensure that the group will report in the new year.</P>
    <P>I accept, of course, that different considerations apply in the area of business tenancies.  There is, as I have mentioned, a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to bring forward legislation to amend the law in this area and, indeed, proposals in this regard had been brought to an advanced stage within my Department.  The House will appreciate that in so far as my Department is concerned there is a heavy legislative workload and this inevitably means that Bills have to be prioritised.  While not wishing in any way to belittle the significance of the measure before the House, I think few would argue that legislative proposals in areas such as unduly lenient sentences, the decriminalisation of certain sexual offences, public order, miscarriages of justice and confiscation of the proceeds of crime should have been in any way slowed down in favour of an amendment to the law on business tenancies.  Equally, I am sure that the House will understand why in recent months in the area of landlord and tenant law I have had to give priority to the assessment in relation to security of tenure of residential tenants which I have referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Accepting, as the Government does, the need for changes in the law in relation to business tenancies, the question which must be addressed is whether the proposals in the Bill adequately address the difficulties to which our present law gives rise.  Deputy Shatter has set out much of the background to this matter both in his speech this evening and the explanatory memorandum which accompanied his Bill.  It might be useful to the House if I were also to do so, even at the risk of going over some of the same ground again.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (1) (a) of the Landlord and <Col N="961" /> Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 gives a right to a new tenancy to business tenants of three years standing.  In the absence of agreement between the parties, the Circuit Court sets the terms of the new tenancy.  The period of that tenancy is for a 35-year term unless the tenant opts for a shorter term.  The rent is subject to review by the court at five year intervals.</P>
    <P>For commercial reasons, two kinds of business leases only are normally offered under existing law: a lease for a term under three years &mdash; where there would not be a right of renewal &mdash; or a long term lease of up to 20 years or more. This means, essentially, that a potential business tenant is faced with the offer of a lease for less than three years which may be insufficient to recoup start up costs such as the fitting out of premises etc. or a very lengthy lease which might represent too great a commitment.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, long term leases of 20 years or so are generally favoured by landlords because they allow them to protect and retain control of their investment and avoid court renewals during that period.  As against that, the present arrangements are argued to work against the interests of landlords, particularly in the semi-State sector where property is held for long term development.  Such property can prove unattractive for tenants if offered for less than three years, while at the same time there is an understandable reluctance on the part of organisations in this sector to enter into very lengthy leases as they will ultimately require the property for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its report on land law and conveyancing law looked at the issue of business leases and concluded that many landlords would be prepared to let properties for up to five years and possibly more if they could be sure that tenants would not be entitled to a new lease.  On the other hand, they believed that many tenants would wish to be able to obtain lettings for more than the present three years even at the expense of not being entitled to a renewal of the tenancy at its expiry.  The commission's conclusions were borne out by a <Col N="962" /> survey recently conducted by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce which showed that about 80 per cent of those surveyed in Dublin favoured an initial short lease &mdash; without a right of renewal &mdash; of between five and ten years.  It is also the case that property investors and business tenants in other countries are accustomed to medium-term leasing and more flexibility in leasing arrangements than our present law allows.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Law Reform Commission report my Department circulated to a wide range of interested groups a position paper which canvassed a number of options about possible changes in the law in this area. The response to the paper was uniform in the sense that all of those consulted favoured change in this area with a view to providing a greater level of flexibility in leasing arrangements.  However, there was far from being a consensus as to what precise changes would be desirable.</P>
    <P>In the position paper three possible options for change were set out.  I should stress that these were merely illustrative and were included only for the purpose of attempting better to focus the response to the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>The first option was to increase the existing three-year qualifying period for a new business tenancy to five, seven or ten years.  It was argued in the discussion paper that this would solve the problem of those such as public service bodies who have property for which they have no immediate use who find the present three-year period too short for letting purposes.  On the other hand, it was suggested that to allow tenancies in the range of seven to ten years without any rights to a new tenancy or compensation in lieu might be perceived as being unfair on tenants.</P>
    <P>The second option was to the effect that, as well as increasing the three-year limit, parties when entering a new lease would be able, subject to obtaining independent legal advice, to opt out of the provisions of the 1980 Act.  In other words, the parties could decide at the time of entering into a lease that the protections available in the 1980 Act in <Col N="963" /> relation to security of tenure &mdash; such as the right of renewal of the lease after three years or whatever new limit might be set &mdash; would not apply to that lease. This was described in the discussion paper as an option which would represent a major departure from general policy in the landlord and tenant code; that it would in all likelihood result in many new leases being made outside of the 1980 Act and could render statutory provisions in this area more or less redundant.</P>
    <P>The third option was that, as well as increasing the three-year limit, or, indeed, leaving that limit alone and allowing parties to opt out of the 1980 Act provisions, there would be provision for the payment of compensation for disturbance to a business tenant if the landlord wished to terminate the lease &mdash; which, under this proposal, the landlord would have an absolute right to do &mdash; some time after the qualifying period for a new tenancy.  The discussion paper explained that this would mean that a lease granted for a term less than the number of years which would be specified in section 13 (1) (a) of the 1980 Act, either as at present or as amendend, would give no entitlement to a new tenancy or compensation.  In the case of a lease granted for a longer period, say, 15 or 20 years, the landlord would have a choice whether to allow or refuse the tenant a new tenancy.  If the landlord refused, the tenant would be generally entitled under section 58 of the 1980 Act to compensation.</P>
    <P>The responses to the discussion paper were far from uniform as to which of these options &mdash; or, indeed, any other options &mdash; should be pursued.  However, there was fairly general agreement that the third option which suggested compensation arrangements was, basically, a non-runner.  If the period before the right to a new tenancy accrued was to be increased it should be done on a similar basis to the existing provisions in relation to the three-year period, that is, that there should be no right to compensation where there was no obligation to renew the lease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Whether with knowledge of the contents of the discussion paper or otherwise, the Deputy's proposals in the Bill represent a form of the second option which I have outlined.  As I understand them, the Deputy's proposals amount to this: there would be an increase in the period before a right of renewal accrues from three years to five years; in setting the terms of a new tenancy the court would be able to fix the duration at up to 15 years rather than 35 years as at present.  In addition &mdash; and crucially &mdash; the Bill would allow people, when entering into new tenancies, to renounce in writing their right to a new tenancy under the 1980 Act, even as amended by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House would accept that it would not be sensible to attempt to assess any of these measures separately.  I think there is broad agreement about the difficulties which we are trying to address.  What is involved is bringing forward a package of inter-dependent measures which in their entirety would best deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I have to make it clear that the Government has fundamental difficulties with the proposal in the Bill that there would be a right for parties entering a new leasing arrangement to have the right to contract out of the protections contained in the 1989 Act.  At present such arrangements are specifically prohibited by that Act.  The Law Reform Commission did recommend in its report that this should be allowed, subject to the parties involved having obtained independent legal advice.  It is also the case that the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act disallows the right to a new tenancy under the 1980 Act in so far as financial services companies locating in the Custom House Docks are concerned, but those provisions cater for the very particular leasing requirements of both landlords and tenants &mdash; development companies and financial services companies respectively in the docks area.  The considerations which gave rise to those provisions do not apply to proposals in the area of business tenancies generally.  The proposals <Col N="965" /> in the Bill before the House are of far more general application.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the points which were made in my Department's discussion paper about introducing a right to contract out.  I think that they are worth repeating and expanding on.</P>
    <P>This type of arrangement would represent a major departure from the general policy which has been pursued for decades in our landlord and tenant code. In all likelihood it would result in many, if not most or virtually all, new leases being made outside the 1980 Act.  In practice it could render statutory provisions in this area more or less redundant.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is a view held by some people that, where parties freely enter into contracts in relation to the leasing of property, it is none of the State's business to impinge in any way on such arrangements.  There are two points I would make about that.  First, our landlord and tenant code has never been influenced by that view and, even while there may be difficulties with particular aspects of that code &mdash; for example, those issues which the Bill seeks to redress &mdash; I believe that, by and large, the central approach contained in that code has served us well.  Given the complex issues involved, and indeed the troubled history surrounding the issue of relations between landlord and tenant generally, it seems to me that it would be most unwise to set about dismantling, particularly in a piecemeal fashion, central tenets of that code.  Second, such a view seems to presuppose an absolute equality on the part of landlord and tenant when entering into a leasing arrangement.  That would be fine if we were just dealing with arrangements on the part of large organisations or corporations between themselves.  In reality, what can be involved is one individual successfully setting up a small business who could find himself or herself many years down the road having no rights at all in relation to the property where he or she has developed that business.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would be much of an exaggeration to contend that if the contracting out arrangement were to <Col N="966" /> stand then the rest of what the Bill proposes would be largely irrelevant in that few, if any, leases would be made available without the landlord insisting on the tenant agreeing to contract out of the statutory protections contained in the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>However, I do accept that in not accepting a right to contract out there would be scope to go perhaps further than the Deputy has done in relation to the other provisions of the Bill.  In particular, I believe that without a right to contract out an increase in the period where rights of renewal accrue from three to five years would be insufficient.  Subject to any views which might be expressed about this matter during the course of this debate, I have it in mind to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage which would increase the period to ten years.</P>
    <P>Also it has been represented to me that, where a court is setting the terms of a new tenancy under our present law, the right of the tenant to opt for a lease of any period &mdash; however short &mdash; of less than 35 years is open to abuse in that the tenant may opt for a very short term and invite recourse to the courts again within a short period.  Accordingly, I propose on Committee Stage to introduce an amendment to provide that where the terms of a new tenancy are being set it must be for a minimum of five years with a maximum of 25 years.</P>
    <P>On a technical note &mdash; in terms of drafting &mdash; it would be desirable if the Bill contained a commencement provision that it would come into effect, say, a month after its enactment.  It would be fair to people about to enter leasing arrangements to have a reasonable time to take into account the implications of the changes being effected under the Act.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there may be genuine differences of opinion as to the detail of the approach which should be taken in the Bill.  Deputy Shatter has set out the thinking behind his approach and I have set out my views about changes in the Bill which I regard as desirable.  These matters can be teased out more fully at the select committee and I propose to consult <Col N="967" /> the chairman of that committee, Deputy Dan Wallace, about referring the Bill to it.  The necessary motion to that effect can be brought before the House by Deputy Shatter or myself at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill carries with it a number of difficulties.  The whole problem with the landlord and tenant code, as I understand it, is that it is trying to match inequalities of bargaining power in relation to business and ordinary domestic tenancies.  From that perspective one has to bear in mind that the philosophy lying behind the landlord and tenant code is that bargaining power is not equal.  If it was equal in every case there would be no need to stipulate what should or should not be in leases or to have protections for domestic tenants and the like.  I take the Minister's point that it is naïve to assume you start on the basis of equal bargaining power in all business tenancies which cover such a magnitude, for example, the ordinary Joe Soap or Josephine Soap &mdash; now that we have to be politically correct &mdash; on the one hand as well as huge companies dealing with each other at arm's length on the other.</P>
      <P>While I listened to Deputy Shatter advocating that it should be possible to contract out let us be clear on what will happen.  The vast majority of landlords will slap two documents on the table and say: &ldquo;sign both, and if you do not sign both you will get neither&rdquo;.  That is the reality.  Very few landlords will give an option.  If the contracting out provision takes effect for business tenancies only it will be in cases where solicitors are being sued for negligence, for failing to advise their clients about Deputy Shatter's amendment, in reality the vast majority of them will contract out.  There is no point in codding ourselves.  We have to realise that the vast majority of landlords will contract out or will force a tenant to contract out of the system.  You then have to ask yourself if that is fair to everybody. Is it fair to big business or to the small individual operator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it there are several <Col N="968" /> reasons for giving people a right of renewal.  First, they built up their own goodwill in a particular place.  The consequences of being pushed out, at the whim of the landlord, are immense for a small business.  If you set up a florist, cake or shoe shop in one place and you are told at the end of five or ten years that you must leave, it is not easy to move.  You cannot pick up a new, suitable premises as you would a taxi.  There is not a perfect market in land.  There is certainly no perfect market in relation to retail commercial premises.  We are talking here not simply about shopkeepers but restaurateurs or people running licensed premises, goodwill cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb or shifted from one socket to another.  The real world does not work like that.  While I have very little sympathy for big businesses who can use their own market clout to extract concessions from their landlord, the reality is that in large shopping centres the person setting up a business as a florist, a cake shop or a restaurant in one of the modern complexes, is very much at the mercy of the landlord.</P>
    <P>In most towns there is only one shopping centre and one or two locations available to a would-be restaurateur.  In most towns if a restaurateur is forced to close they cannot find a suitable alternative premises.  By lumping all business tenancies together and saying they should all operate on the same basis is to ignore commercial realities; that inequality of bargaining power does exist even among businesses.  The second basic proposition &mdash; with which even Deputy Shatter would have to agree &mdash; is that the great majority of landlords will slap two documents down in front of their would-be tenants, one of which will be a renunciation of the statutory protection.  At that moment the tenant will not be in a position to say that he wants his statutory rights and try to persuade the landlord by some kind of argument or appeal to his best instincts to give him statutory protection.  That will not happen.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an opt out clause in principle, it must take account of the <Col N="969" /> unfairness for which the present ban of opt out clauses was designed to deal with. When a business tenancy is coming to the end and there is no entitlement under the 1980 Act, two things happen.  First, the landlord can sum up the options open to his tenant.  In the case of a restaurant the landlord will say that it is doing a thriving trade and that if it has to move there will be considerable costs in terms of advertising, relocating staff, fitting out a new premises and so on.  In those circumstances because the market is a fairly cruel place a landlord will increase the rent on the new lease, if he has to offer a new lease, to reflect the fact that the tenant will have to incur substantial expenditure by having to move.  Deputy Shatter should take on board the fact that landlords in possession of premises and whose tenants are coming to the end of their term, are bound to be in a position where they will have increased bargaining power over their tenant.  If the tenant is put out on to the street there is so much loss involved that he or she is obliged by market forces to pay in excess of the market rent to avoid the inconvenience of moving which becomes an asset in the landlord's bargaining power in such a situation.</P>
    <P>Another point which Deputy Shatter should also bear in mind is that, for example, if I were to establish a florist shop or a restaurant in Rathmines Shopping Centre or wherever and after five or seven years I came to the end of my lease without a right of renewal the landlord can effectively take my goodwill.  Most people do not care who owns a florist shop, a jewellers shop or whatever. Depending on the nature of the trade the goodwill can effectively be snaffled by the landlord if the tenant is put out.  In the real world a landlord can effectively help himself to his tenant's goodwill by putting them out and refusing a new tenancy. That again increases the landlord's bargaining power over the captive tenant rather than over anybody else because he can tell the tenant that he will take the goodwill he has built up and pocket the benefit, or alternatively impose huge liabilities in terms of the tenant having <Col N="970" /> to relocate his business, with the added expense of relocating staff and of advertising change of telephone numbers. When dealing with businesses which depend on passing trade or trade generated by the telephone, location can be all important.  It is not good enough simply to approach this on the basis of a free for all market, because we do not have a perfect market.  The Progressive Democrats believe in the market system, but it believes in a fair market system; and I do not believe we will achieve fairness or economic justice if we pretend that everybody is competing in the market on the same basis.  Anybody with common sense will realise that opt outs will become the norm in 99 per cent of cases and, effectively, that means we are ending the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act in commercial cases.  Do we want to do that?  Do we want to do that under the guise of an opt out provision that would be universal?  If we want to scrap the rights of protection for tenants in occupation on a comprehensive basis, let us do it; but let us not cod ourselves that we are merely bringing in a system where there is a mere opt out clause, because that will become universal.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of the commencement period for this statute if it became law.  I wonder if it is fair to discriminate against those who are approaching the third year in occupation of a premises and to rob them of their entitlements?  What will happen to those in occupation for seven years if the Minister's proposal for a ten year lease comes into effect?  Will they suddenly be robbed of their rights of protection?  I think the Minister will need to take account of this if she is bringing in a ten year entitlement. At present somebody who has been in occupation for seven years has a new lease in the bag if the landlord proposes to serve notice to quit on a person with a monthly tenancy, whereas if the Minister extends the period from three to ten years a great many people will lose what they thought were very solid entitlements.  I do not have a magical solution, but I think we need to think through this provision <Col N="971" /> and that a set of transitional provisions would be necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the peculiar features of Deputy Shatter's Bill is that if the tenant prior to the commencement of the tenancy executed a document making a bona fide renunciation of rights, that renunciation might not be apparent to somebody who subsequently bought the tenant's lease unless it is written into the lease.  It would be quite possible for a landlord and a tenant to have a document sitting in a desk somewhere and for people to be dealing with the lease as though it carried certain rights, because the renunciation clause would not be stamped all over it. I suppose it is true that anybody purchasing a leasehold interest would advise his solicitor to find out from the landlord whether such a renunciation existed, but there is a number of issues as to whether it would provide good security.  It is just a technical problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the issue of noncommercial tenancies.  I believe that noncommercial tenancy arrangements must be addressed.  In that context there is some double thinking in the present law which needs to be corrected.  As any urban Deputy knows, frequently there are elderly people who are living alone in flats and coming up to their nineteenth year in occupation.  If they remain in occupation for 20 years they become entitled to a 35 year lease with five year rent reviews.  All they want, however, is to be left alone.  Many of them are in their seventies and eighties and do not want a 35 year lease &mdash; in fact, they could not care less what is going to happen in 35 years' time &mdash; but those people are regularly evicted from their homes and flats by landlords who know they cannot afford to allow possession of their flat to be converted into a 35 year lease.</P>
    <P>I believe that lies at the bottom of a substantial number of unfair eviction cases of elderly people, because landlords simply cannot afford the risk of having tenants in occupation for 20 years. I have come across cases at my clinics where the landlord would be quite willing to say to the tenant &ldquo;If you deal with me <Col N="972" /> honourably I will leave you there&rdquo;.  But the statute forces the landlord to take one view or another and, even if he trusts the little old lady absolutely, he cannot trust her executor not to claim a tenancy when she should die.  It is very unfair that people are evicted from their homes simply because if they stay any longer there are cataclysmic consequences from the landlord's point of view.</P>
    <P>In avoiding that issue, Deputy Shatter did not want to get sucked into that quagmire in terms of morality and all the rest. Nonetheless, I accept what the Minister said, that if we passed a measure amending the Landlord and Tenant Acts and did not attempt to look at those issues in the near future, people would look at us circumspectly and wonder how it is that our priorities are such that we are worried about the business community but are not worried about people being flung out of their homes in those circumstances.  I do not have any easy answers, but I believe that elderly people in particular should be given some type of personal tenancy, a life tenancy, instead of a tenancy that they can hand on in their wills to nephews and nieces just because the landlord has left them in occupation for 20 years.  The Minister should examine this.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister has signalled a willingness to accept the necessity of amending legislation in this area and that Deputy Shatter's Bill will be the means by which this matter will be moved up the order of priorities.  I have a grave difficulty, which I share with the Minister, about simply pretending that there is an absolutely fair open market and that all one has to do is let the strong and the weak come to their own bargains and never interfere.  Although Deputy Shatter &mdash; doubtless in good faith &mdash; thinks it is fair to allow people to opt out, if opt out becomes the universal norm, effectively the previously protective code ceases to exist any more.  I can see there are some rational grounds perhaps for arguing that that should be done, but if that is to be done let us not pretend it is an opt out clause in the exceptional <Col N="973" /> circumstances with which we are engaged.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to comment on the five year and the 15 year periods provided for in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I think the five year period is sensible and I would not agree with the Minister that ten years' continuous occupation should be the minimum before one gets protection.  I do not accept that somebody who has been in occupation for seven or eight years running a restaurant or some other business should have nothing to show for it.  All of these are matters of degree and personal judgment.  Three years ago by almost in the batting of an eyelid.  Funnily enough, I had to take a leasehold of an office when I moved my office out of Leinster House to my constituency, as Members will all be glad to know.  In that context I had to sign a lease and the one thing my landlord was absolutely scared about was giving me rights under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  Whether three years is a reasonable view of my longevity in this job is a matter for another day.</P>

      <P>In the end I had to put a clause in my own lease that it was for my temporary convenience as a Member of Dáil Éireann &mdash; Members will be glad to know it is a temporary little convenience &mdash; and by so doing I and my landloard could effectively opt out of the protection of the 1980 Act.</P>
      <P>Apart from temporary convenience lettings, a vast number of businesses need protection, and the big thing is to save them from the predatory landlord at the end of their lease.  As sure as night follows day if a landlord sees a large restaurant coming to the end of its leasehold entitlement and he has the power to turf the lessees out on the street or charge a new rent, that power and the inconvenience to the tenant will be translated into more money for the landlord.  That is exploitation, as it is taking advantage; it is sharing in the tenant goodwill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> When one sees the vast word processed leases handed to tenants of shopping centres, where everything is stacked in favour of the landlord and the terms of the lease are extremely onerous, one could be forgiven for believing that the landlord is the person sucking all the profit out of the shopping centres in question, that the landlord is not just providing a factor of production but is also effectively a sleeping partner in most of the businesses because of the vast amount of rent tenants are charged and the onerous conditions put on them.</P>
    <P>Landlords are a valuable part of our enterprise culture but investing in property is not taking a risk.  The real risk-takers are the tenants in most cases.  We as a society should keep the balance in favour of real enterprise and that involves protecting tenants from landlords who will just share in their profits if they can.</P>

      <P>This Bill represents another notch in the legislative gun of my colleague Deputy Shatter who has had two of the many Bills he has brought before the House accepted.  It is encouraging to see that Deputy Shatter has found time to put together another Bill which has been accepted by the Government to plug a glaring legal loophole.  The Minister deserves credit for addressing this issue and seeing that the solution provided by Deputy Shatter's Bill is the answer in principle and for accepting it on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal short term business lease granted is two years and 11 months so as to ensure that there will be no tenant rights.  It is a curse and a plague for new businesses.  The problem arises not just in Dublin as I have has representations from country towns on this issue.  The 80 per cent poll in Dublin by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce probably reflects all towns and cities throughout the country. If we are to give priority to enterprise, people investing in starting a business must be given some security. Even though at the moment they appear to have security under the 1980 Act, they do not have it, because most landlords will not take a gamble on them by giving <Col N="975" /> a lease longer than two years and 11 months.  The net effect is that the entrepreneur is taking the chance, is getting the business going and in many instances the business established actually accrues to the benefit of the landlord at the end of that period who more often than not will not return the lease.  This problem affects the establishment of business and the encouragement of enterprise throughout the country.  The Bill is much more important than it may at first appear.  It is not just an arcane matter of interest to lawyers, it is of major interest to the business sector, particularly to young enterpreneurs who want to set up in the services sector.  We must have change.</P>
    <P>Now that the House has accepted that we need change and the central thrust of the Bill has been accepted we will argue on Committee Stage on what is best for the country.  The Minister should reconsider her approach.  It is important to have an opt out clause.  The ten year alternative proposed by the Minister is mad because instead of new businesses starting off for two years and 11 months, the business will go for some period up to ten years so that the investor will acquire no tenant rights but will be much longer in possession and will have probably developed the business.  That person may then find himself out on his ear along with his enterprise.  A ten year basic term without right of renewal is not the answer.  We must consider the opt out clause proposed by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>The tradition was that the landlords were in a dominant position and much of the legislation introduced by Wyndham and Ashbourne before the foundation of the State and legislation introduced in the early days of the State tried to give some support to essentially defenceless tenants.  Things have now changed and in many instances it is the landlord who is in the weaker position.  We are not talking about multinationals or absentee landlords but about people who are often not very well off, who, have perhaps, inherited some property the income from which is largely their only income.  In my <Col N="976" /> town, two sisters are in a terrible position because part of their premises is tenanted by somebody with tenant rights.  They can neither sell the place nor get the tenant to take over the entire premises.  They are without a penny, and are now being pressed by the bank who are threatening to sell them out.  Let us forget the image of the landlord putting the tenants in impossible situations.  The days of Captain Boycott are long gone.  The people who must get priority are those who try to get enterprise going, small business people who often take premises from people in similar situations in terms of equality.  Those getting involved in business nowadays will get independent legal advice.  If they do not I would not say much for their chances of prospering in business.  In that situation there is not a dominant position for the landlord.  I urge the Government to consider that issue between now and Committee Stage and to think twice before forcing a change in the opt out clause.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the enterprise of my colleague in confronting this issue and going to the trouble of drafting a good Bill to provide a solution.  I am glad the Government has accepted the Bill and I look forward to a good debate on Committee Stage.  I hope all of us will approach this issue with a genuinely open mind and will listen and debate the few controversial issues so that we can ultimately put on the Statute Book an Act which is the sum of the goodwill and knowledge of all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are in a position to wind up the Bill this evening.  I thank Members who spoke on it and the Minister for not opposing it.  My party is anxious to make progress on this Bill and sees no reason for spreading the debate over the four evenings to which we are traditionally entitled in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a few brief comments on the Minister's speech.  I welcome her approach.  Such an approach should be taken more often in regard to Private Members' Bills.  We should view them as a vehicle to address constructively <Col N="977" /> issues to which the Government, because of demands, has a difficulty in giving priority.  Bills that come before the House in this way should be teased out across party lines on Committee Stage so that we can produce the best solution in the interest of the people on the issues being addressed, be they major or minor.  If such issues need to be addressed, Private Members' time should be used in a constructive manner to do so.  I welcome this opportunity.  This is the first time in the lifetime of this Government this has happened.  To date every Private Members' Bill introduced in this House produced a knee-jerk reaction by the Government.  I am glad we are dealing with this Bill in a different manner and hope it will set a precedent for other proposals, not alone from my party but also from Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated there might be some concern about the Fine Gael Party giving priority to the limited area of business tenancies rather than introducing proposals to meet the concerns of residential tenants and their security of tenure.  I am sure the Minister did not mean to be ungenerous in her remarks but they could be misinterpreted to suggest that we have no particular concern for the security of tenants in residential premises.  Members of the Fine Gael Party were to the forefront in highlighting the problems experienced by the tenants of the Mespil Road flats, about which Deputy McDowell spoke earlier.  We are addressing this area this evening because it needs to be addressed and is somewhat less complex than the issue of residential tenure, but we may deal with that at a later date.</P>
    <P>With all the resources at the disposal of the Government and the Minister's Department, the best she could do in that area so far was from a committee to make recommendations to her.  I am not being critical of her in that regard, but I do not want people to believe that the Fine Gael Party is concerned with the business sector and not with the residential sector. I make no excuse for introducing legislation designed to modernise anachronistic <Col N="978" /> legislation in the area of the business world, business tenancies and commercial properties, which actively erects a barrier to business and job creation.  All of us in this House have an interest in removing those barriers.</P>
    <P>I accept there is no solution to the problem set in tables of stone.  The proposals contained in this Bill were designed to generate the discussion we have had this evening and to set out the measure which we believe will work best in resolving the existing difficulties.  It was interesting to hear the Minister's reference to the interdepartmental committee which has proposed three different sets of possible solutions.  The Minister stated that this Bill seemed to be on all fours with its second solution.  I think she implicitly wondered if I had discovered the contents of the proposals of the internal committee.  I have no idea what is contained in those proposals, but the three proposals under debate gave rise to major difficulties for the Department in making choices as to the best solution.  It is a matter of judgment and the choices are difficult.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will see the merit in the suggestion that the right of renewal should arise after five years and not three years.  That is designed to ensure that people can have a reasonable start-up period without being committed to 35-years leases.  It is designed also to ensure that when a person sets up a business and invests in property, be it in the manufacturing, retail or services area, he or she has reasonable time in that premises to get a reasonable return.  It also recognises that when a person is in business for five or more years the business becomes identified with the property out of which it is operated.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned at the suggestion that tenants should have a right of renewal only at the end of a ten-year tenancy.  I do not wish to conflict with the Minister, but her objections to the opt-out provision would apply equally to the suggestion that one should not have a right of renewal as a tenant until one is in a premises for ten years.  That might cause problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> We have had a great deal of debate this evening on whether there should be a right to opt out; that is a value judgment.  I have similar concerns to those expressed by the Minister and Deputy McDowell with regard to the position of a person who has built up a business over ten or 15 years.  That person may have signed a lease with an opt out provision, the business may be identified with the premises out of which it operates and at the end of the period the person could be in a difficult position.  We must strike a balance in that regard and that matter should be debated on Committee Stage.  There is no ideological view in that regard.  It is a matter of judgment.</P>
    <P>When the Law Reform Commission considered the options in this area it stated that where independent legal advice is available and where parties are operating at arm's length they should be free to negotiate and opt out provisions should apply.  That is reflected in current law in some EC member states.  In some states where the law is being reformed at present they have provided for an opt out provision particularly because, as outlined by my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe, the market has changed for some large companies who own property and who try to impose tenancy arrangements. Such tenancy arrangements may be disadvantageous to tenants not just in the context of renewal but also in other areas. In the current economic climate the majority of landlords and tenants are operating at arm's length.  If a landlord insists on a tenant opting out, in the current business environment one can be relatively certain that other landlords in the same area will be willing to conclude leases under which one is not required to opt out.  We wrestled with that issue in preparing this Bill.  We had an interesting discussion on it this evening, but the Minister missed the point in that all the arguments she used against the opt out provision would apply equally to her suggestion that one would not have a right of renewal unless one had a ten-year tenancy.  We would benefit from dealing with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> I have no difficulty with the Minister's suggestion that there should be a provision in the Bill stating it should come into operation one month after its enactment. However, the Bill is drafted on the basis that if it proves successful it would operate from the day the President signs it.  I fail to understand the need for a one month lead-in period because there would then be an interregnum of four weeks in which people might enter into new business arrangements.  This Bill will not require any statutory instruments or preparation prior to becoming operative. That matter could be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised a matter to which the Minister did not refer but which has some merit.  I considered inserting this in the Bill initially, but because I do not believe it is a problem in practice I omitted it.  However, for theoretical reasons and in case somebody is affected by it, perhaps we should include it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell, too, asked what the position would be for a person who had a tenancy for three or four years if the Minister decided to insert a ten year period provision and the tenancy expired within that period.  Under the law such a person would be entitled to seek a renewal of the lease whereas under the Minister's proposal, that there be a ten year period, they would not.  I hope the Minister will think again in regard to the ten year period.</P>
    <P>The same issue arises under the Bill as drafted.  In theory there could be someone somewhere in the country who has signed a lease for four years.  Let us say for arguments sake that this Bill becomes law next March and provides for a five year period one could arguably say that someone who had signed a four year lease was entitled to a 35-year lease with five year breaks but by virtue of the fact that the law had been changed they would lose their right to seek a renewal.</P>
    <P>I drafted a provision to address that issue.  However, the advice available to me was that it was a wonderful academic argument but that in practice no one probably found himself in that position. <Col N="981" /> The reality is that every person either has a lease for two years and nine months or a lease of substantially longer duration, well beyond the five year period provided for in this legislation in terms of renewal. They might have, as the Minister suggested a 20-year lease with five year breaks or a 35-year lease with five year breaks.  Therefore in practice one either has a lease for two years and nine months or a lease of much longer duration.  It is theoretically possible that one may have a lease for a transitional period of three to five years but this is highly unlikely in practice.  Nevertheless if the Bill was to remain in its present from it might be the case that we should insert that kind of provision.</P>
    <P>We have had a constructive discussion on this Bill this evening.  The Minister has referred to it as a modest measure.  I am not going to make any major claims. When I opened the debate I do not think I used the word modest but rather referred to it as a simple, straightforward Bill and as an unexceptional measure. Despite the fact that neither I nor the Minister knew what the other was going to say I held a similar view but Deputy O'Keeffe was right in one respect.  It is not relevant to Dublin only, it will have an impact on the business community throughout the country.  For many people who decide to take the plunge and start up their own business and rent a modest shop as a retail outlet or small premises for manufacturing purposes this Bill is of substantial importance and, if enacted in its present form or in a slightly modified form, it will certainly remove current barriers to job creation which inhibit people from taking risks in starting up their own businesses.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe was right when he said we had changed as a country.  If a survey had been conducted among tenants 20 years ago &mdash; the majority of people who responded to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce survey were tenants &mdash; the view would have been not to change the law, to keep it as it was.  What was very interesting in the recent survey was that more tenants than landlords wanted the law changed.  In a modest <Col N="982" /> Bill we may be introducing an important reform when it comes to leasing commercial property.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security is uniquely well qualified to take the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I am pleased that the House is not dividing on it this evening and there is no need to detain the House for three more evenings to debate the measure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  Through the Government and Fine Gael Whips we should arrange to have the appropriate motion placed before the House during the course of this week to refer Committee Stage to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I hope we will then make substantial progress on Committee Stage if not this side of Christmas, soon after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this topic which, as you will recall, we did not reach on a previous occasion because of what happened during the course of an earlier debate on the Adjournment in which the Minister was no modest participant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to certain provisions contained in the Finance Act which are wrong in principle.  Indeed, it is ridiculous that they are on the Statute Book.  I refer in particular to two consecutive sections one of which states that payments of value added tax should be made in advance; instead of being paid <Col N="983" /> early in the New Year they will now be paid in December.  As a result of this provision £145 million will be paid to the Exchequer.  Come January this money will be repaid in the from of input credits which means that the persons concerned will not have to pay the next amount of VAT on the due date.</P>
    <P>What we have, in effect, is a revolving door whereby the £145 million which will be paid in advance will be repaid in the form of input credits in respect of the advance payments.  Effectively, the Government is borrowing this sum of money for a period of six weeks without having to pay any interest on it.</P>
    <P>This measure was designed because VAT is no longer payable on imports at the point of entry in keeping with our obligations under the Single Market.  The Minister made the argument during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill that this represented a significant loss to the Exchequer and that it had to be made good through this revolving door system. I do not buy that argument for the reason that this provision will remain for good. Therefore advance payments will continue to be made each December and repaid each January in perpetuity or for as long as this provision remains.  This is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the request that if this famous amnesty delivers a once off cash windfall next year that some of it be used to get rid of this revolving door system.</P>
    <P>Following the European Court ruling is there any legal basis on which the Government could ask people to make advance payments in respect of this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may recall that, on 23 November last, the Minister for Finance answered two parliamentary questions on the special VAT advance payment measure but, for the benefit of the House, I will repeat the essential elements of the Minister's reply to those questions and perhaps expand a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The Finance Act, 1993, made provision for the special advance VAT payment as one of a series of measures taken to offset the greater part of the substantial cash-flow loss to the Exchequer arising from the abolition, from 1 January last, of VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade.  The special advance payment will be required from the largest VAT remitters and represents an advance on the payment they would normally make in the following January.  Full credit for the advance payment will be granted to traders against their normal VAT liability in January.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act provided that liability for the advance payment would arise for taxpayers whose annual net VAT liability exceeded £120,000.  Therefore, from the very beginning, the great majority of VAT-registered taxpayers, numbering some 132,000 in all, were excluded from the requirement to make the special advance payment.  The Act also enabled the Minister for Finance to increase the threshold.  Last month, a review of the latest statistics enabled him to raise the threshold to £300,000, thereby immediately absolving some 1,000 taxpayers from the obligation to make the advance payment.  It was estimated, at that stage, that the revenue yield from the 1,000 or so top remitters who remained subject to the initiative would be approximately £145 million, as budgeted for originally.</P>
    <P>Since then, there has been a judgment of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg arising from an Italian VAT case which has implications for our special advance payment measure. Essentially, the court has ruled to be invalid any VAT payment requirements which would impose a liability greater than that actually incurred at the time the payment is made.  Thus, to avoid any possible conflict between EU law, as interpreted by the court, and our provisions, the Minister has modified the provisions governing the payment required from the traders involved.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday, the Minister for Finance made an order giving taxpayers the option of making the advance payment on the notified basis, i.e., equivalent to <Col N="985" /> one-twelfth of their total net VAT due in the 12 months ended 30 June of the relevant year, or on the basis of their liabilities for November, whichever is the lesser.  I have no doubt that this prompt decision will, given continuing budgetary constraints, be seen as fair and will alleviate many of the concerns expressed by the traders affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that his recent action has consequences for the 1993 budgetary outturn; it is estimated the revised arrangements will leave a shortfall of some £65 million as compared with the original budget target for the measure.  Taking account of this shortfall, he remains satisfied that the EBR for 1993 will be reasonably close to the budgetary estimate of 2.9 per cent of GNP.  I also want to make it clear that, given the inherent nature of the measure, the new provisions will not have any budgetary implications for 1994.  This is because, from the outset, it has involved two broadly offsetting effects in that year. The same applies to the modified version which has been put in place.  Accordingly, it does not have any bearing on room for manoeuvre in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners issued a total of 1,087 notices to VAT payers on 4 November, 1993 about the advance payment.  These taxpayers have been contacted again by the Revenue Commissioners concerning the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate traders in calculating their November liability in the context of deciding whether they want to pay the amount of the advance payment as notified or their November liability, the order which was made provides that the due date for payment will be construed as 10 December, rather than 1 December as stipulated in the Finance Act, 1993.  In the event of non-compliance with the advance payment measure, any surcharge due will now, in view of the revised payment date, be calculated from 10 December.  Traders will, of course, still be able to defer payment until 21 December if a prior arrangement has been agreed with Revenue.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have just said, <Col N="986" /> it will be obvious that the Minister for Finance does not intend to abandon the measure this year or for the foreseeable future.  It remains vital in current budgetary circumstances.  He will, of course, keep its operation under review, in particular in relation to the threshold for liability.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is a cash-flow measure does not mean that it is unimportant or that it should be denigrated in any way. Cash-flow is crucial both in the Exchequer and business worlds.  Let me assure the House that business fully appreciates what is involved here and, indeed, that IBEC accepted the need for the particular initiative in the context of the significant repercussions on the public finances arising from the abolition, on 1 January 1993, of VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade.  I would also point to the inherent fairness of the measure in general terms, in that it gives the business community the benefit of the cash-flow gain &mdash; approximately £200 million &mdash; for most of the year and that full credit will be granted against the normal VAT payments made in January of the following year.  The Minister has shown considerable understanding and concern for the taxpayers involved, as evidenced by the amended arrangements put in place, firstly in ensuring that, by raising the threshold to £300,000, only the top taxpayers, approximately 1,000, will have to make a payment and second by moving quickly to clarify their liability in the light of the recent Court of Justice decision.  As a result of the recent decision, the majority of those taxpayers who have expressed concerns will find that they will now have the option of paying a reduced amount and, indeed, some may find they now have no liability under the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now accepted by the Department of Justice, the Office of Public Works and the Garda authorities that major renovation works must be carried <Col N="987" /> out on Listowel Garda station in County Kerry.  It is an extremely busy station with a total of 27 staff including 18 gardaí, two sergeants, three detectives, a superintendent, a district clerk and two female clerical assistants.  It is proposed to refurbish the existing building and to incorporate the adjacent married quarters, thereby providing much needed additional accommodation brought up to a standard which is in keeping with a modern district headquarters.</P>
      <P>The barracks requires a new roof as a matter of urgency.  Slates are often blown from the roof during high winds.  These flying slates are a danger to both the public and the staff of the station.  There is also an urgent need to replace the existing windows, to provide an interview room, a medical room, recreation room, locker room and proper showering facilities.</P>
      <P>There are no ramps either at the front or back of the building to allow easier access to the station for the disabled. There are four steps, each nine inches in height at the front entrance to the station. This makes it impossible for a wheelchair to gain access to the building.</P>
      <P>There is need also for a new cell block. The present two cells are inadequate. Listowel is the only station with cells in a district which includes nine stations.  At times of major events, such as Listowel races, the cells are not adequate to meet the increased demand.</P>
      <P>There is a need also to upgrade fire safety standards, instal heating, carry out electrical rewiring and internal and external decoration.</P>
      <P>I understand the project is in the planning stage and that the Office of Public Works is currently drawing up plans for the proposed renovations.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this process is completed as soon as possible so that a contract can be placed in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the dedicated members of the Garda Síochána in Listowel.  This is reflected in the very low crime rate in the Listowel district. The Garda have close contact with <Col N="988" /> the local community and many of the members are actively involved in local community organisations.  They deserve a proper comfortable working environment.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that this barracks occupies the site of the original Royal Irish Constabulary barracks that was burned down in the early part of the twenties during the War of Independence. The Minister may have heard of the famous Listowel Mutiny when RIC members at the barracks refused to obey orders from Dublin Castle or become involved in the murdering campaign of the Auxiliaries and the Black and Tans. They gave up their commissionerships and their rank because of that.  I hope the present staff will not have to stage a walkout or any type of protest in order to get their building renovated and that the Minister will do his best for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a major renovation scheme is required at Listowel Garda station, County Kerry.  It is proposed to refurbish the existing building and to incorporate the adjacent married quarters, thereby providing much needed additional accommodation brought up to a standard which is in keeping with a modern district headquarters.</P>
      <P>This project is at the planning stage at present.  Following an on-site visit earlier this month by officials from my Department and the Garda housing officer, an Office of Public Works architect is currently drawing up plans for the proposed renovations.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration the fact that the planning process is at a very early stage, it is not possible to say exactly when finance will be required for the Listowel project.  It takes roughly one year from the initial planning stage of a project until a contract can be placed. This, of course, is provided no unforeseen problems are encountered at any stage.  It is unlikely, however, in the light of overall priorities throughout the country and available resources, that work will commence before 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> I can assure Deputy Deenihan that I am completely committed to bringing Garda accommodation in all divisions to a proper standard.  However, he will appreciate that, given available resources, each project must be addressed within the context of overall priorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The building programme is based on priorities agreed following consultation with the Garda representative associations and is designed to attempt to focus expenditure where it is most urgently needed.</P>
    <P>A very considerable investment has, in fact, been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years.  Since the launch of the Garda building programme in 1982 in excess of £52 million has been spent on new works.  This year alone, between new works and maintenance almost £6 million has been spent.  Many members of the force have benefited from this expenditure and I am satisfied that good progress is being made towards eliminating accommodation problems not only in Kerry but throughout the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The campaign to provide a renal dialysis unit in Cavan General Hospital has been ongoing for some time.  A major fund raising campaign was launched in July 1992 by the Cavan-Monaghan branch of the Irish Kidney Association. Thankfully, that campaign met with tremendous success.  At the outset I wish to compliment the officers of the Cavan-Monaghan branch of the Irish Kidney Association, the personnel in Cavan General Hospital and the people of Cavan-Monaghan for their generous contribution to this worthy cause.  That campaign was launched with the purpose of raising £200,000 as the local contribution <Col N="990" /> towards the establishment of the unit and to date in excess of £200,000 has been raised.  The funding was raised at a time when there were other worthy causes seeking financial assistance.  As a result of the commitment given by the Department of Health to consider the provision of a dialysis unit at Cavan General Hospital in the context of the 1993 Estimates, the Irish Kidney Association agreed to raise funds for the total capital cost of equipment for the unit.</P>
    <P>A unit of the type needed for dialysis services can be located in a six bed ward in Cavan General Hospital under the management of Dr. Frank Walker, consultant physician, who has extensive experience in nephrology.  Such a unit will be viable and will provide cover in Cavan, Monaghan and the neighbouring counties of Meath, Leitrim, Westmeath and Longford.  I understand the North-Eastern Health Board in its proposals to the Department of Health outlined the need for such a service in the geographical area to which I have referred and the breakdown with regard to hospital personnel and medical equipment.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members would number among their friends people who have experienced total kidney failure.  We are all aware of the hardship endured by patients having to travel to Dublin maybe three days a week to spend four hours per day on a kidney machine.  Regardless of the weather, that travel is difficult and is a particular cause of hardship to people who suffer ill-health.  The strains imposed by that travel on those in need of dialysis are wrong and inhuman.  We must remember also that the chances of employment for kidney patients are significantly reduced because of their physical condition and the duration of travel to and from the dialysis unit.</P>
    <P>The benefits to the Cavan-Monaghan area and parts of the neighbouring counties of having a dialysis unit in Cavan General Hospital are obvious.  It would mean less travelling, less anxiety and hardship for patients and their families and the distinct possibility that patients might be able to return to full time <Col N="991" /> employment.  We are very fortunate that Dr. Frank Walker, consultant at Cavan General Hospital, is one of the country's leading nephrologists and has kindly agreed to take charge of the unit in addition to his other hospital duties. People in the Cavan-Monaghan area, particularly members of the local branch of the Irish Kidney Association and the various fund raising committees of the two counties and members and officials of the health board, are anxious that funding be provided in the 1994 allocation to the North-Eastern Health Board to provide a dialysis service in the new year.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the local kidney association ensured the collection of £200,000 towards this worthy health service development and I appeal to the Minister to give this request favourable consideration. The Minister will be aware of the determination of the chief executive officer, officials and members of the North-Eastern Health Board to rationalise and provide a more comprehensive range of health services within the northeast. The establishment of the renal dialysis unit at Cavan General Hospital is an essential and important element of that strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this important issue and outlining his real and deep concern in relation to the needs of dialysis patients in Cavan.  I would like to record my concern in this area also.  It is an area about which I have been concerned since I became Minister 11 months ago.  There is a number of areas around the country where dialysis is needed and is currently unavailable.  Consequently, patients are required to travel long distances for this essential treatment.  I am aware that the Irish Kidney Association is anxious to see the establishment of a satellite dialysis service at Cavan General Hospital.  As the Deputy indicated, the local branch of the association had a successful fund raising the campaign and has donated dialysis equipment to the hospital.  This achievement indicates the level of commitment <Col N="992" /> and dedication of the people involved and is a clear sign of the generosity and goodwill of those who contributed.</P>
      <P>The provision of services at Cavan General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  Proposals for the establishment of a dialysis service at Cavan General Hospital must be considered by the board in the context of its overall service priorities and the resources available to it to meet those priorities.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to stress that I hope to see the provision of a dialysis unit at Cavan General Hospital as soon as resources allow for such provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tonight I want to discuss the hardships caused to parents of children and adults with mental handicap.  It is incredible that parents who have children with disability have to go out with boxes collecting, day in, day out, year in, year out, to see their children get a chance in life.  I have some knowledge of the cost imposed on the parents and friends in Carlow since I have been involved with the training centre for young people with disability.  I use Carlow as an example because what happens in Carlow happens across the country, including the Minister's county of Wexford.  I was amazed to discover that this year alone because the training centre was extended, the parents and friends contributed the sum of £36,000, comprising the capital expense of £20,000 and the running costs of £16,000.  On top of that they still have to provide money for St. Lazerian's Special School and Teach Sonais, which is a home from home for the trainees in the training centre.  The £36,000 that has been used in the Delta Centre is not the centre's full bill for this year; that amount might be only half its bill.  In 1992 its overall expenses were £25,000; in 1991, it was £36,000; and in 1990 it spent £56,000. Since 1990 it has spent a total of £83,000 on capital expenses and £70,000 on running <Col N="993" /> expenses, which gives a total of £153,000, an absolutely staggering figure. All this money was raised on a voluntary basis, by organising such events as sponsored walks, cabarets, cake sales and envelope collections.  Is it not time that people who have children with a disability, whether mental or physical, were given a fair crack of the whip?</P>
      <P>During the weekend I met a person from Cork involved with the Cope organisation, a body that has to raise £150,000 this year.  In regard to the Rehabilitation Institute, which does such wonderful work in training, there is a cap of £10,000 on its lottery prize money which puts it at a disadvantage because it cannot compete with the national lottery.  People will gamble their £1 on the national lottery rather than on the Rehabilitation Institute lottery because they stand the chance of winning more money.  It is time that the Rehabilitation Institute was allowed raise its prize money so that people would be encouraged to give their money to a deserving cause.  The Rehabilitation Institute too deserves a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the last election the Minister's party made promises about appointing a Minister in charge of this area and said they would make £25 million available for this purpose.  Perhaps the Ministers for Health and Education could work together in this regard.  The Government has already allocated £8 million &mdash; I do not want a discussion on this matter &mdash; but why should parents who already contribute to the parish school have to pay for extensions and repairs to the special school which their child is attending?  If a national school needs new furniture or a roof extension the whole parish is involved in contributing towards the expense.  However, in regard to the special schools, only the parents of the children attending the school as well as their friends contribute.  A cap should be put on the amount of money parents and friends pay.  A 30 per cent contribution is acceptable if one is talking about £5,000 but an extension costing £100,000 is a different matter.  Surely the State has a duty to provide training centres for <Col N="994" /> people with a disability, mental or physical. It is not good enough to provide 70 or 80 per cent of the cost.  We should go out of our way to help people with a disability.  Parents have enough problems trying to help these people without having to attend meetings night after night to discuss fund-raising events.</P>
    <P>At certain weekends the national lottery adds £1 million as an extra bonus prize and that money would be far better spent on facilities for the mentally handicapped. Most people believe it is obscene to give £1 million to one individual.  If it was shared in this way it would make a tremendous difference to many people.  I hope the Minister will have good news in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>About 15,500 persons have a moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap and most require extensive support from the health services.  A further 10,000 who have a mild mental handicap require ongoing support from the health services.  More than 13,000 people with a mental handicap were in receipt of specialised mental handicap services at the end of 1992.  Of that number 6,600 were in residential care and approximately 6,800 attended day care or workshop services.  In addition, some 7,500 children attend special schools and classes operated under the aegis of the Department of Education.  Total health expenditure on services for people with a mental handicap will exceed £217 million in 1993. Another indication of the Government's commitment in the area of mental handicap provision has been the appointment this year of a Minister for Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility to co-ordinate services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in the House on previous occasions, the Government is committed to developing and expanding services for people with a mental handicap.  An additional £8.5 million was made available this year for the development of mental handicap services.  From this sum, £2 million was made available to strengthen the funding base of directly funded <Col N="995" /> mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.  Some £4 million was allocated to the health board regions to provide a broad range of services, including 90 residential places, emergency and respite care beds, 200 day places, increased home support services and early intervention/child education and development services.  This funding also facilitated the continued transfer of people with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements in services for people with a mental handicap.  Some £2.5 million capital was allocated to the health board regions to support the initiatives put in place this year.  This is the largest amount ever allocated for the development of services for people with a mental handicap and is in addition to the £6 million made available in 1992, which has been repeated in 1993.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that there are sizeable <Col N="996" /> numbers of persons with a mental handicap still on waiting lists for day and residential facilities and I can assure the House of my commitment and that of this Government to continue to make further resources available to meet these needs. The question of the provision of additional resources in 1994 is currently the subject of discussions in the context of the budgetary arrangements for 1994. The additional funding provided will be allocated having regard to whatever guidelines may be issued by my Department and the priority developments identified by the regional mental handicap coordinating committees.</P>
    <P>I will certainly bring to the attention of the appropriate Minister the views of the Deputy in relation to the allocation of national lottery funding and fund-raising generally.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 December 1993.</P>

      <P>It is an objective of the Plan for Social Housing to mitigate the extent and the effects of undue social segregation in housing. Housing authorities have been requested to have regard to this objective in planning their own housing programmes and other activities in the social housing area. However, this would not preclude the provision of individual housing schemes to cater for a particular category of need such as the elderly, the homeless, etc. Indeed, the provision of such schemes on a moderate scale in certain areas could contribute to the promotion of the objective of ensuring balanced communities. In the case of a voluntary housing scheme, a local community has the right to make objections on planning grounds to the planning authority when notice of <Col N="768" /> the planning application is given and, if they are aggrieved by the decision of the planning authority, to appeal against that decision to An Bord Pleanála.  More generally, of course, it is open to any group to make representations to a housing authority as to how they regard a particular proposal in the context of the objective I have referred to.</P>

      <P>The following measures, in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government, have been or are being taken to improve the accommodation position of homeless persons:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; The expansion of the local authority house building programme to 3,500 <Col N="769" />&ldquo;starts&rdquo; this year and the commitment to an appropriate long term house building programme will benefit the homeless as well as other categories of persons in need of housing;</P>
    <P>&mdash; The capital funding for voluntary bodies providing housing accommodation was increased from £11 million in 1992 to £12½ million in 1993. A substantial part of the expenditure under this scheme goes on the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.  The new 107 unit development for homeless persons being provided by the Salvation Army at Granby Court, Dublin, with the aid of substantial grants, is expected to come into operation in early 1994 while their existing hostel at York House will continue in operation. In the case of York House, I have sanctioned a grant of £600,000 to secure its retention as a hostel for the homeless.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The level of recoupment to local authorities for expenditure incurred by them under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 on accommodating homeless persons has been increased from 80 per cent to 90 per cent with effect from 1 April, 1993. The provision in the Department's Vote to meet this recoupment has been increased to £1 million in 1993, compared to expenditure £674,000 in 1992.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The emergency accommodation provided by the Army at Lower Grangegorman will continue in operation.  Dublin Corporation are finalising arrangements with a voluntary body to take over the operation of this facility from the Army. The net cost involved will be 90 per cent funded by my Department under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An extended referral service for homeless persons in the Dublin area seeking accommodation outside the normal opening hours of the Eastern <Col N="770" /> Health Board's Homeless Persons Unit has recently been introduced. There will be a freephone service available up to 1 a.m. from Mondays to Fridays and from 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  Dublin Corporation will be recouped 90 per cent of the cost of the service by my Department.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An assessment of the number of homeless persons at 31 March, 1993 has been carried out by local authorities and details will be published in the Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin for September 1993.  </P>

      <P>Housing authorities are already permitted to acquire existing dwellings as part of their housing programmes.  Indeed, under the Plan for Social Housing local authorities <Col N="774" /> are required, in planning their programmes, to consider systematically the option of purchasing existing houses &mdash; even those in need of improvement &mdash; as opposed to new building.  Local authorities have again been reminded of this in the context of this year's major expansion of their housing programmes and, while definitive figures are not yet available, there is evidence that there has been a considerable increase in the number of houses purchased by local authorities this year.</P>

      <P>The case for upgrading national secondary road N71 to national primary status has been examined in my Department but the conclusion is that reclassification is not warranted.  I would point out, however, that the National Development Plan proposes to increase investment in the national secondary road network generally and that the Plan identifies the N71 as a route of significant economic importance which will be targeted for investment during the period of the plan.  Over £3.85 million in grants has already been provided for works on the N71 between the years 1990 and 1992. This year, likely expenditure from grants on the N71 will amount to over £4.6 million, the bulk of which is being allocated to the Cork/Bandon section.  The Bandon/Dunmanway/Bantry regional road (R586) broadly parallels the N71 and its reclassification to national status would not be justified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 127 and 147 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Ltd., the <Col N="778" /> development company established under the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, has drawn up a development programme for its properties in the Temple Bar Area providing for cultural, residential, leisure and small business uses involving expenditure of £100 million over a five year implementation period to be completed by April 1996.  In addition, it is estimated that private sector projects valued at about £100 million will be carried out in the Temple Bar Area over the period.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the cultural element of Temple Bar Properties' programme will cost £37.5 million and it is proposed that this will be financed jointly by EC Structural Funds and Exchequer funds. Projects approved for aid from Structural Funds must be cleared by me for Exchequer counterpart funding before any building work commences.  To date, sums of £2 million and £1.5 million have been paid towards the cultural programme from the European Regional Development Fund and the Exchequer, respectively.  The balance of £34 million needed to complete the cultural programme will be met by £19.5 million from Structural Funds and £14.5 million from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>An EC pilot project involving the Irish Film Centre and infrastructural works such as relaying of cobble stones and provision of new street lighting and street furniture, has been approved for funding of £3.6 million from European Regional Development Fund.  Of this amount, £2.87 million has been received to date. A matching contribution of £3.6 million is being provided by a combination of Dublin Corporation, Temple Bar Properties and other contributions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all of the normal reporting arrangements are in place in the case of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. in relation to financial and other matters.  Progress reports on the activities of these two companies, on which my Department is represented, are submitted on a regular basis.  In both cases, the accounts are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <Quest>his response to the consideration by Dublin County Council of its draft development plan; if he will use the powers available to him to reverse rezoning decisions made by the Council which cannot be justified on planning grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Dublin County Council has completed its examination of, and voted on, the detail of the draft development plan, the amendments and material alterations.  All that remains now is the formal adoption of the plan.</P>
      <P>My views on rezoning in County Dublin are a matter of public record. I understand that in their more recent consideration of the development plan, the council have scaled back on the extent of the extra zonings earlier proposed but I will obviously have to reserve my position on the matter until I and my Department have had an opportunity of studying the plan as finally adopted.</P>
      <P>The adoption of a development plan has always been the preserve of the elected local councils.  The law provides for open and extensive consultation with the public before the council adopts the plan.  This is as it should be, because local councils and the public they represent are in a better position than central Government to form judgments on the details of land use policy for their areas.  Accordingly, while there are limited powers of intervention open to me, I would be extremely slow to use them to overturn decisions of this kind arrived at at local level.  The whole thrust of my policies on local government has been to devolve greater responsibilities on local authorities. Besides, I would be very reluctant to intiate a course of action which could lead to the involvement of a Minister for the Environment, for the first time since 1977, in specific local planning decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say also that my statutory powers of intervention, such as they are, arise only after the development plan has <Col N="780" /> been adopted.  I will consider, at that stage, all aspects of the matter, including any compensation consequences of actions I might take.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I can assure the House that any proposals for funding arising from the necessity to service newly zoned lands will be subjected to the most rigorous assessment in my Department. It is not my intention to use taxpayers' money to provide the funds to service an excessive amount of rezoned land, or land which has been rezoned on a haphazard basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 173 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999,</i> the development strategy for national primary routes will focus on four key corridors.  These have been selected to include routes which are part of the trans european road network proposed by the EC to reduce the impact of Ireland's peripheral location within the EC, to promote economic integration, to provide access to all major centres of population and open up remote areas, and to integrate the strategic internal network with the access transport network of ports and airports.  The North/South <Col N="784" /> corridor consists of Euroroute E01 and E30, that is National Primary Routes N1, N11 and N25.  These link the three largest centres of population (Dublin, Belfast and Cork) and provide access to four commercial seaports (Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork).</P>
    <P>While national primary routes N9 and N10 are not included in any of the four corridors referred to in the plan, there is also provision in the plan for investment in national primary routes not included in the corridors in order to tackle deficiencies on these roads and to assist regional development.  Investment in the N9 and N10 routes will be considered in this context over the period of the Plan.</P>
    <P>The submission of the south east regional review group emphasised the importance of improving the road links between Dublin and Waterford and, while it identified certain works or these links as having a high priority, it did not accord priority to one route over another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last July, Tipperary (NR) County Council, following an evaluation of all available options by an expert design team, submitted a proposal for a by-pass on a route to the north of the town of Nenagh and requested funding for this proposal.  Having given full consideration to the council's request, I have recently informed them that I cannot accede to it.  The reasons for this decision were set out extensively in a statement which I issued on 23 November and which is incorporated in the Appendix to this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied, having examined all the relevant documentation, that the route recommended in the route selection report prepared by the expert design team &mdash; a southern line with a link from the national secondary route N52 to the N7 south west of the town &mdash; provides a satisfactory rate of return, entails less severance than the northern route and <Col N="789" /> would provide a high service inter urban road on this national primary route.</P>
    <P>I have advised the council that, without prejudice to any statutory procedures which may arise, I would be prepared to give approval, in principle, to proposals for this latter route option and to finance the necessary development costs to enable the council to advance the scheme.  I have asked the council to consider the matter fully and to make a further recommendation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Should the council decide to adopt the southern route option for the by-pass, it is a matter for them to submit proposals for approval.  On receipt of that approval, it would also be a matter for the council to proceed with the detailed design of the scheme and, if necessary, with the preparation of a compulsory purchase order to acquire the necessary lands.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Appendix</P>
    <P>Statement issued by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the Nenagh By-Pass</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Smith, T.D., stated today (23 November) that he could not accede to Tipperary (NR) County Council's request for funding for a Northern By-Pass of Nenagh.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This option has too many drawbacks for the people of Nenagh&rdquo;, the Minister said.  &ldquo;Although it would be a cheaper option in the short term, it represents very poor value for money compared to the other proposals considered by the design team who prepared a comprehensive report for the Council. Besides, construction of the northern route, to the standards expected today on a national primary road, would have very serious implications for many of those who live along the route.  Some examples of what I have in mind are:</P>
    <P> (i) there would be a need for a long embankment to provide grade separation where the by-pass would cross the Dromineer and Portroe roads.  The embankment would be well over 20 feet high in some places and would run <Col N="790" /> for over 1¼ miles of the 5 mile length of the by-pass.  It would have a severe impact on dwellings near the line of the route: some dwellings on the Portroe Road would have to be demolished, and the new road would seriously affect the living environment of those in other dwellings.  If at-grade junctions (either roundabouts or signal controlled junctions) were provided at these locations, the By-Pass would not provide an acceptable level of service for a national primary route, and substantial interference with residential properties would still be involved.</P>
    <P>(ii)  where the Northern By-Pass route meets the N7 Dublin Road to the north-east of Nenagh, construction of a grade-separated junction could have a significant impact on residential properties on both sides of the existing national road; acquisition and demolition of some or all of the houses involved would almost certainly be required.</P>
    <P>(iii) similarly, while construction of a grade-separated junction with the N52 national secondary road from Borrisokane would be quite feasible from an engineering point of view, such a junction would have a very severe impact on property in the vicinity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had carefully examined the report which was drawn up by the design team and which recommends a southern line for the By-Pass, together with a link from the national secondary road N52 (the Borrisokane Road) to the main Limerick Road southwest of the town.  &ldquo;This option has many attractions &mdash; although it would be more expensive initially, it represents good value for money and would be a better long term investment.  It involves less breaking up of land holdings and communities and it provides for a high service inter-urban road on this critical national primary route.  I am prepared to approve this option in principle and to finance the necessary development costs to enable the council to advance the project.  Subject to any statutory procedures that <Col N="791" /> might arise, I will also be willing to make grants available to meet the full cost of implementation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have pointed out before,&rdquo; the Minister said, &ldquo;that routes for by-passes of major towns are being settled all over the country with relatively little difficulty. Nenagh is already chock-a-block with traffic, much of it heavy commercial traffic which has no business in the town centre &mdash; and the situation will get worse year by year, with a 3 per cent annual growth rate predicted by the design team&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he, personally, had approached the question of route selection with an open mind. &ldquo;I wanted to see all the options fully evaluated, so that the full implications of each would be clear when a decision came to be made.  I would be delighted if it were possible for me to go along with the county council's proposal in this case &mdash; but that would be the soft option, and, to my mind the wrong one.  I have personally devoted a considerable time to a study of the report on the various options, and the maps and plans.  That study has forced me to the conclusion that the proposed northern route cannot be accepted and implemented without damage of a kind which I am not prepared to inflict on the environs of Nenagh, and the people who live there.  I am confident that the decision which I have now taken, having carefully considered all of the issues involved, is in the best interests of all of the people of Nenagh, and its hinterland. There is no time to lose if the Nenagh By-Pass is to be included in the Transport Operational Programme currently being prepared for submission to the EC.  It is time that we progressed to the next phase, namely, the provision of the By-Pass itself.  That must now be the overriding priority.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Member States of the EU and Japan are already recognised for the purpose of driving licence exchange under the terms of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989.  I made an order on 26 November declaring Australia, Austria, Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland to be so recognised.  These countries will provide reciprocal facilities to holders of Irish licences.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the driver testing regimes in the United States meet the standards prescribed in the Directive on driving licences.  In most states, licences do not distinguish between drivers who passed their driving tests in vehicles with automatic transmission and drivers who qualified in vehicles with manual transmission; this arrangement also conflicts with the requirements of the Directive.</P>

Conversely, where a valuation is increased on appeal, the ratepayer would be liable for additional rates calculated on the amount of the increase in valuation in respect of the relevant period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 125, 133, 134 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the Custom House Docks and the Temple Bar Areas in Dublin, the incentives available under the Urban Renewal Scheme will expire on 31 July, 1994.  Given this deadline, it would be of no practical benefit to designate any new areas at this stage.</P>
      <P>In 1992 an additional 7 acres were designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 in Tallaght and earlier this year an area of similar size, incorporating the Ballymun Town Centre, was designated. Apart from these two areas, no other area was designated in the past two years and no requests for such designation were received from Dublin Corporation for any other area.</P>
      <P>While the Programme for a Partnership Government contains no commitment to extend the scheme to any new areas, I am at present reviewing the contribution the scheme has made to urban renewal with a view to developing future policy options.  I cannot, however, indicate at this stage of the review what proposals will emerge.</P>

      <P>Nicaragua is not one of the priority countries for Irish aid, but we have given a modest amount of aid to Nicaragua in recent years under our NGO co-financing scheme.  This year a total of £26,700 is being allocated to two Nicaraguan NGOs, one for a project assisting women farmers and the other to help the disabled.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which is an agency under the auspices of my Department, is currently sponsoring six development workers in Nicaragua, all of whom are working in Nicaragua for periods ranging from two to five years.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change our policy in relation to applications for aid from Nicaragua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union, through which we also contribute assistance, has approved 17 million ECU in aid this year and will shortly consider a proposal for a further similar sum.  I am glad to note that Nicaragua has recently signed an <Col N="801" /> agreement with the International Monetary Fund which should help it to obtain international financing for its development.</P>

      <P>There are 50 permanent staff in the Passport Office.  In addition there is sanction from the Department of Finance to hire up to 80 temporary staff each year to cope with the demand in peak season.  These temporary staff are drawn from a panel established by competitive interview some time ago.  No staff are seconded from other Departments.</P>
      <P>With regard to plans for staffing in 1994, a review of the resources available to the Passport Office was conducted recently and its findings are being studied at the moment with a view to determining staff and general resource levels for 1994 and beyond.</P>

      <P>At the request of Deputy Davern, I met a deputation from Clonmel Corporation comprisiong the Mayor of Clonmel, Councillor Michael O'Brien, Alderman Sean Lyons, Councillor Thomas Morris and the Town Clerk, Ms Bernadette Kinsella, in relation to the Main Guard, Clonmel on Friday 12 November 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thanked the deputation for the great gesture of Clonmel Corporation in transferring ownership of the Main Guard to the Office of Public Works and acknowledged that this was a magnificent local contribution to the restoration project.  I informed the deputation that it is proposed to restore the original structure of the Main Guard.  The restoration programme will be determined by a detailed structural and architectural survey and the findings of an archaeological excavation. The Office of Public Works has included the Main Guard as a priority project in its application for EC Structural Funds and is awaiting a formal response to the application.  As restoration work and research is painstakingly slow it is estimated that the <Col N="803" /> restoration process will be spread over four years.</P>
    <P>I assured the deputation that the public would be kept fully informed about the restoration work through the establishment of a local liaison group comprised of local representatives, officials, and local heritage groups and that a model of the restored building would be put on public display.</P>

      <P>Within the past 30 years some 1,100 archaeological excavations licences have been granted by the Commissioners of Public Works, under the National Monuments Acts.  At present, a major exercise is being undertaken by the Commissioners to computerise the records of some 1,500 licences, which have been granted since the enactment of the initial legislation in 1930.  On completion of this exercise, towards the latter end of 1994, it will be possible to detail outstanding excavation reports and the archaeologists concerned.</P>
      <P>At present, details are not readily available as to which excavations were in receipt of Exchequer funding, but the proportion of such excavations is likely to be relatively small.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the lone parent allowance is one of the social welfare payments which is taxable.  As the benefit is not taxed at source it is necessary to adjust the tax-free allowance of the claimant in order to take account of the benefit.  The method applied in the case of lone parent's benefit is exactly the same method as applied in the taxation of other long term social welfare benefits.  I do not accept that this practice is discriminatory.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill provides the basis for the tax amnesty, the primary objectives of which are to</P>
      <P>&mdash;obtain the best possible yield from undisclosed tax liabilities for the period up to 5 April 1991, given that such liabilities are difficult to detect</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;to facilitate the use for the purpose of general economic activity and employment of those funds, related <Col N="810" /> to tax evasion, which have up to now held dormant, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to give those who failed to meet their tax obligations in the past one last chance to put their tax affairs in order, in advance of more stringent penalties for tax fraud, and the continuing strengthening of Revenue's compliance programmes. </P>
    <P>To achieve these objectives it was necessary to introduce an incentive for tax-payers to encourage them to bring their tax affairs up-to-date.  However, this incentive is balanced by the introduction of stringent penalties for those who fail to put their tax affairs in order.  The amnesty is not an option for those who failed to pay their taxes in the past.  It is an obligation to which they must adhere under pain of penalties.  Moreover, the benefits of the amnesty are only available to those who regularise all of their pre-1991 tax affairs and also make a full disclosure, on time, in relation to their present tax liabilities.  The legislation also provides for new penalties which include mandatory prison sentences and fines ranging fron 25 per cent to 200 per cent of the tax evaded.</P>
    <P>Taking the full view of both its &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; and &ldquo;stick&rdquo; elements, the tax amnesty is not just an absolution for past wrongs.  It is a mechanism for bringing in those who have not met their obligations in the past and exposing them to their full liability for tax from this point on.  This can only be to the benefit of all taxpayers.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply on 18 November 1993 to a question by Deputy Broughan, the &ldquo;incentive amnesty&rdquo; applies not only to previously undisclosed liabilities but also to previously disclosed or identified liabilities which may be in arrears.  However, to protect the Exchequer yield from the Revenue Commissioners' ongoing enforcement and collection programmes, certain categories of tax arrears, including arrears which had been passed to the Sheriff or solicitor for collection, had to be excluded from the scope of the amnesty. Arrears which are with the Sheriff or solicitor are at an advanced stage of collection and the taxpayers concerned had defied all attempts over a period at collection by the Collector-General.  It was not considered appropriate therefore that such tax arrears should be included in the incentive amnesty.  The arrears do however come within the scope of the general amnesty which provides for a waiver of interest and penalties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="812" /> that some 137,000 letters issued to taxpayers in October of this year, informing them of the substantial benefits to be gained from participation in either the Incentive Amnesty or the General Amnesty (or both if appropriate). Those letters were not demands for tax.  They were issued to ensure that taxpayers affected did not overlook the opportunity of clearing outstanding liabilities through the amnesty scheme.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers were informed of amounts of taxes which appeared on the computer records of the Collector-General and were advised that, if they disputed the amount shown in the letter, they should contact their local inspector of taxes to clarify liabilities and to have their records amended if the figures &mdash; in some cases based on estimates &mdash; were too high.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the letters which issued to taxpayers would have included taxes due prior to 1988 in cases where such tax was still recorded as outstanding.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that a concerned effort has been made to collect such moneys in the five years since 1988.  An Arrears Identification and Review Programme was set up in May, 1989 with extra resources to pursue those taxpayers who had not availed of the 1988 amnesty.  This was a co-ordinated programme between the Collector-General's Office and inspectors of taxes.  Its aim was to confirm the amount of the liability where necessary, to identify any amount which was <i>prima facie</i> uncollectible and then to decide on the most suitable form of enforcement action for collectible arrears.  To date, upwards of 50,000 cases have been addressed under that Programme and some £286 million has been collected.  The Programme was resource intensive and was still underway when the amnesty was announced.  At that stage, the Programme had been addressing the more difficult and time consuming cases.  It is against that background that the letters which issued in October would have contained an element of arrears going back to years prior to 1988.</P>
    <P>Any taxpayer who now finds that amounts of tax that he/she paid in 1988 <Col N="813" /> still appear as outstanding on his/her records should immediately contact the Collector-General at St. Martin's House, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4 to have the matter put right.  As indicated above the collection of entrenched arrears of tax is resource intensive requiring individual detailed case working.  In this context there is no evidence to suggest that a statute of limitations would improve collection measures.  Indeed, it would have the complete opposite effect if it fortified non compliant taxpayers in their resistance to payment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no delay in dealing with requests by taxpayers for computer printouts of their liabilities to tax.  The average time taken in dealing with such requests was three days.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that up to Monday 29 November, 1993 a total of 274,222 computer printed statements were issued by the Collector-General's Office in respect of some 79,300 cases.  This does not include statements issued by the local inspectors of taxes in response to calls by taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from bodies representing accountants and tax practitioners and from numerous individual practitioners, requesting an extension of the deadline for making a declaration under the incentive amnesty and I have raised the issue at today's Government meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> In view of the huge level of interest in the amnesty and of the real difficulties faced by practitioners in processing of applications the Government today decided to extend the deadline for declarations until 21 December 1993, thus providing practitioners with an additional three weeks to process applications.  Provision for the extended deadline will be made, to apply retrospectively, in next year's Finance Act.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the registration of vehicles in the State and the collection of vehicle registration tax.  Section 134 of the Finance Act, 1992 enables a vehicle to be registered in the State without payment of vehicle registration tax if the vehicle is the personal property of a private individual when s/he is transferring his/her normal residence from a place outside the State to a place in the State.  Regulations provide that a vehicle which has availed of this relief cannot be sold, hired out, lent, given as security or otherwise diposed of in the State during the period of 12 months following its registration unless the vehicle registration tax is paid on it.  The Regulations also provide that the Commissioners may waive this restriction where they are satisfied that there are circumstances which justify the non-payment of the tax.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue commissioners that the person concerned had a car registered last July which was imported under the transfer of residence provisions.  If he wishes to dispose of the car before July, 1994 he may apply to the Vehicle Registration Office, Tullamore, County Offaly to have the restriction lifted and his case will be considered.</P>

    <P>The difficulty arises in relation to employees now receiving redundancy payments based on past service with previous companies including a company which went into receivership in September, 1984.  The employees concerned terminated their employments in September, 1984 when the original company went into receivership and they received statutory redundancy.  In the circumstances the service prior to September, 1984 must be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the Standard <Col N="817" /> Capital Superannuation Benefit as such service would not be regarded as &ldquo;service in the office or employment&rdquo; for the purposes of the legislation governing the relief.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the registration of all vehicles in the State and the collection of vehicle registration tax.  Section 134 of the Finance Act, 1992 permits a vehicle to be registered in the State without payment of vehicle registration tax if it is the personal property of a private individual when s/he is transferring his/her normal residence from a place outside the State to a place in the State.  Regulations provide that a vehicle which has availed of this relief cannot be sold, hired out, lent, given as security or otherwise disposed of in the State during the period of 12 months following its registration unless the vehicle registration tax is paid on it. However, the Regulations also provide that this restriction may be waived by the Commissioners where they are satisfied that there are circumstances which justify the non-payment of the tax.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned had a car registered last June which was imported under the provisions outlined above.  An application to remove the conditions regarding the disposal of the car was recently made on behalf of the person to the Commissioners.  As they are satisfied that circumstances exist for granting the application they have authorised the removal of the restriction.  The person is now free to dispose of the car in the State.</P>

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, is not as a general rule, payable to people in full-time education.  However, I have introduced a number of &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education schemes on a pilot basis, both at second level and at third level, which give long term unemployed people and lone parents the opportunity to improve their academic qualifications and thereby enhance their prospects of returning to the work force.  Participants in those schemes who are unemployed, receive a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments as well as social welfare secondary benefits, including rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. I introduced the third level allowance in July 1990 and participation levels have increased every year.  Over 500 are expected to participate in the current 1993-94 academic year.  The allowance is <Col N="820" /> not available, however, to people pursuing post-graduate studies.  In the context of the ongoing review of the schemes I am having the situation of people who require a post-graduate qualification in order to take up employment examined.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, which is the labour protection legislation which specifies that, in general, an employee must have one year's service in order to qualify for protection under the legislation.  The Unfair Dismissal Acts, 1977 to 1933, provide that, in general, an employee must have worked continuously for the same employer for one year before he or she becomes eligible to claim redress for unfair dismissal.  The requirement of a year's continuous service does not apply to an employee dismissed due to pregnancy or for exercising rights under the Maternity Protection of Employee's Act, 1981, or where dismissal resulted from the employee's trade union membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissal (Amendment) Act, 1993, which came into effect on 1 October 1993, introduced specific antievasion provisions in relation to the length of service requirements.  The new provisions provide that a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in determining if an employee has the necessary service, may consider whether the employment of a person on a series of two or more contracts of employment, between which there was no more than 26 weeks of a break, was <Col N="828" /> for the purpose of avoidance of liability by the employer under the legislation. Where it is so found, the length of the various contracts may be added together to assess the length of service of an employee for eligibility under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions apply in relation to a person who is employed on second or subsequent fixed term or specified purpose contracts with the same employer. In those cases, the rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal are empowered to add together the service of an employee, if they consider that the employment of a person on such contracts, between which there was no more than three months of a break, was for the purpose of avoidance of liability under the legislation.</P>

      <P>The European Employment Service (EURES) is a network made up of the national employment services of the EC member states. FÁS is the Irish member of the EURES network.  Over the last two years more than 3,000 Irish job seekers have been directly placed in employment through the EURES network.  It is estimated that approximately 9,000 people were interviewed in making these placements.</P>
      <P>In the last two years FÁS has received in excess of 20,000 inquiries in relation to the EURES programme and employment opportunities in the EC.  FÁS has a programme of pre-emigration advice and counselling from specially trained staff in all of its locations throughout the country.  It should be noted that in the majority of cases people were advised to stay in Ireland rather than to emigrate where sustainable employment could not be ensured.</P>
      <P>In order to enhance the development of the EURES programme FÁS has specialised staff based in three other member states &mdash; the UK, the Netherlands and Germany &mdash; to help indentify job opportunities and to offer assistance if the need arises.</P>
      <P>The EURES system is still very much at the early stages of its development and has yet to reach its full potential.  I am sure that as it develops there will be increased opportunities for Irish people to avail of this most valuable placement system.  Such a system means that Irish people who intend to emigrate to other countries in the EC can now be better prepared beforehand.</P>

      <P>Discussions are taking place in a national context with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association regarding promoting the use of phosphate free detergents.  Considerable progress has been made in the increased use domestically of phosphate-free products which now represent about 40 per cent of overall domestic consumption of washing powders and liquids.

      <P>Under the National Development Plan, it is proposed that grants amounting to £475 million will be provided for the improvement of non-national roads in the period 1994-1999. As indicated in the plan, a new scheme of specific grants to local authorities will be introduced for EC co-financed improvement projects.  The level of funding for each individual authority will be determined annually and will depend, <i>inter alia,</i> on the suitability and relative priority of schemes put forward by the authority.</P>

      <P>Departures for the parameters iron and manganese have been granted in accordance with the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, in respect of the Ashbourne water supply.  These departures relate to exceedances of the maximum admissible concentrations, MAC, arising from naturally occurring conditions affecting this groundwater source.  In order to redress the high iron and manganese levels of the Ashbourne water supply, I have recently approved Meath County Council's proposals to instal a filtration system which will reduce the level of these substances below the MAC.  I understand that work will commence in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The rate support grant payments for each county council and each county borough corporation for the years 1980 to date are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Valid comparisons between the annual rate support grant allocations are not possible due to the many adjustments in local financial arrangements since 1986, including the elimination of levies and statutory demands, the writing-off of Local Loans Fund debt repayments, the provision for direct rate payments by the ESB to local authorities.  For these reasons, and the assumptions which would have to be made relating to variations in rate levels, standards of collection and valuation of domestic property, any attempt to estimate the potential receipts from domestic rates, had they not been abolished, would be highly speculative.</P>

      <P>In October 1992, Cork County Council submitted proposals to my Department to extend public lighting on national secondary road N71 in Bantry between the Abbey Burial Ground and the West Lodge Hotel.  The accident statistics for the period 1988-1992 show that only one minor accident occurred during the hours of darkness on the section of road in question.  For this reason, and due to competing demands for funding for other schemes, the proposal is not regarded as a priority one and the council have been informed accordingly.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a need to introduce a pro-rata scheme for payment of vehicle road tax similar to the system as applies in the UK and other countries; and if there is an unfair anomaly in that a vehicle owner is obliged to pay a full month's road tax when, in many instances, the vehicle may be in road use for as little as one day in that month.</Quest>

      <P>In Ireland, motor tax is payable on an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly basis.  In the United Kingdom motor tax is payable annually or half yearly.</P>
      <P>Motor tax is calculated in Ireland on a &ldquo;whole month&rdquo; basis.  Thus, if a tax liability arises in respect of the registration or use of a vehicle on any day in a month, road tax is calculated from the beginning of the month.</P>
      <P>If a motorist wishes to avoid paying tax for a particular month, the purchase-registration of a new-imported used vehicle, or the purchase-use of a secondhand car, can generally be deferred from the end of one month to the beginning of the following month.  The exception is a private individual personally importing a vehicle: such an importation must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners not later than the next working day after the arrival of the vehicle in the State and compulsory registration follows shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to provide for the calculation of motor tax for periods of less than one month.  The cost to the State, and the additional administative procedures involved, would be disproportionate to the benefits for the relatively small number of motorists who are adversely affected, to a significant degree, under the present system.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission provides legal and technical assistance to the shareholders in privately-owned commonages to partition their commonage where this can be shown to improve the agricultural potential of their holdings.  The shareholders in this commonage, all of whom are registered as owning their shares, or who have shown conclusively that they are entitled to be so registered, requested such assistance. They agreed to the scheme of division which is now in place on the ground. Effectively this scheme is an agreement between the shareholders as to how they will hold land they already own.  The person referred to in the Deputy's question is not a shareholder in the commonage and the Land Commission did not have the authority of the other shareholders to include him in the scheme.  If he wishes to obtain a portion of the divided commonage it is up to him to negotiate the purchase of such a portion from the owners of the commonage.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, Ireland secured £6 million from the proceeds of the final year of the EC milk co-responsibility levy to assist dairy farmers in their preparations to meet the standards set by the EC Dairy Hygiene Directive.  The major part of this money will be directed towards farmers who need to invest in on-farm cooling equipment, or in milking machine parts.  Individual grants will be up to £1,750 in the case of the former and up to £500 in the latter subject to a maximum of 50 per cent of actual cost in both cases. Implementation of the scheme will be carried out by the ICOS under contract to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan 1994-99 also includes provision for a grant scheme to assist farmers in meeting the <Col N="859" /> on-farm structural standards required by the directive.  While it is intended that substantial moneys will be made available for this scheme, details of its operation cannot be finalised until the plan is approved by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to the June 1993 special beef premium scheme application from the person named for animals of 21 months of age or over.  The position is that the person named applied for grants on ten animals under that scheme and submitted cattle identity cards in respect of all of them for punching and stamping. He may, therefore, sell all of these animals if he wishes to do so.</P>
      <P>However, animals in respect of which special beef premium is being claimed in the current application period which closes on 30 November 1993 have to be retained for a minimum period of two months after application.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulations payments for the 1993 special beef premium schemes could not commence until after 1 November 1993 and even then only a 60 per cent advance can be paid in cases where the necessary administrative or on-the-spot checks have been carried out.  Payment of these advances is now commencing.</P>

    <P>A working party under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer of my Department is presently examining all aspects of tuberculosis including notification, surveillance, treatment and contact tracing procedures.  Their aim is to ensure that there is an appropriate framework to deal with all problems associated with tuberculosis.  I expect the group to present its report to me early next year and one of the issues which it is addressing is the need to have up-to-date and accurate information regarding new cases of tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed in relation to this matter.  I understand that at present under the terms of the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 23) Order, 1992, full VAT is refundable on medical equipment valued over £20,000 which has been purchased from voluntary funds and is donated to a <Col N="873" /> hospital.  The Deputy will appreciate that the present exemption is tightly drawn and does not extend to recipients, other than those operating hospitals.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the scope of the present Order to accommodate the needs of medical research outside of the hospital setting is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance in the first instance.  I will be making him aware of my concerns in relation to the possible implications for the funding of medical research of a continuation of the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  211 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board which has responsibility for the provision of both inpatient and community based psychiatric services in St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital catchment area has furnised the data that the Deputy has sought. This is set out in the following tabular statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the policy set out in the report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future,</i> patients have been discharged from St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital to community and other more appropriate settings.  This has enabled the board to rationalise the use of facilities and employment of staff in St. <Col N="875" /> Loman's Hospital.  As part of this process, the facilities at the hospital dedicated to mental handicap have, since 1989, been de-designated and are now formally separate from the psychiatic hospitals.  This has allowed persons with mental handicap without significant psychiatric disturbance to be more appropriately <Col N="876" /> cared for by the mental handicap services.  These patients and the psychiatric nursing and other staff providing services in this unit have not been counted in the figures provided in the table for 1989 and subsequent years.  Some 63.5 staff provide services to these patients. The data furnished by the board should be read in this light.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a letter from a person (details supplied) in Dublin 2 about inaccurate and misleading information being given to public representatives by his Department regarding pay increases given to psychologists employed by the Department of Education which should have automatically applied to psychologists employed by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has not issued inaccurate or misleading information to public representatives on the question of the health board psychologists' pay claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general background to this issue has been dealt with at length and in great detail in this House in recent weeks in both Adjournment Debates and parliamentary questions.  There is a long and complex history of pay relationships <Col N="878" /> between psychologists employed by health boards and psychologists working in the Department of Education.  Arbitration Report (No. 132) issued in July 1988 did establish a pay link between both groups at that time.  However, in the absence of a claim from psychologists for either maintaining or breaking a pay relationship with any other group, health service management could not simply automatically adjust the pay of psychologists.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for monitoring and advancing the pay position of any group rests with the people concerned and their trade union representatives.  Health board psychologists did not lodge a claim for an increase in pay and restoration of relationships with the relevant Department of Education grades until 1992 and that claim is being processed through the normal industrial relations channels.  An offer has already been made to the psychologists restoring the relationship with Department of Education psychologists from 1 January 1994.  This offer was <Col N="879" /> rejected on the basis that the effective date was unacceptable.  A third party adjudication hearing took place on this remaining issue on Monday 22 November 1993 and it is expected that the arbitrator's findings will be made available within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 235 together.  As the Deputies may be aware, concessionary teaching posts are allocated to primary schools who are included in the scheme of assistance for schools in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicant schools are assessed and <Col N="881" /> prioritised in order of need by reference to a range of socio-economic indicators. The factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>This year an additional 68 posts were allocated under this scheme using the above criteria.  This brings the total number of concessionary posts to 293 at primary level.  The question of a further expansion of the scheme to embrace additional schools is being kept under review and the needs of all schools, including that mentioned by the Deputies, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>It was not possible to include the major extension project for Tullyallen promary school, County Louth in the national schools' capital programme for 1993 because of other demands which were considered to be of higher priority.</P>
      <P>It will be considered for inclusion in the 1994 school building programme in the light of availability resourses and other commitments and priorities.  The question of grant-aiding the project will only arise when the contract is ready to be placed.</P>

      <P>On 30 September 1992 there were 29,783 pupils aged four years and 56,351 pupils aged five years enrolled in ordinary classes in primary schools.  These are provisional figures.  The information regarding the enrolments on 30 September 1993 are not yet available as all primary schools have not yet submitted the returns to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total free books grant paid in respect of pupils in junior and senior infants' standards in primary schools in the 1992-93 school year was £239,272. The grant is not paid in respect of age <Col N="889" /> and information on that basis is not, therefore, available.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the capitation grant paid to all primary schools for the 1992-93 school year was £18,328,911.  The grant is paid in respect of the running costs of schools as a whole on the basis of total enrolment but is not apportioned on the basis of age groups.</P>
