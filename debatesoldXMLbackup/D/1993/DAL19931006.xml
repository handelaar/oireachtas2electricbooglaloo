    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's number one EC priority at present is to see measures put in place to boost economic growth and employment.</P>
      <P>Ireland has forwarded to the Commission its contribution in regard to the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment which the Commission is to submit to the December European Council.  I understand that Ireland's contribution was in fact laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday.  Key points in the Irish contribution are:</P>
      <P>(a)  the basis for sustainable economic growth across the Community is co-ordinated Member State macroeconomic policies;</P>
      <P>(b)  the Community should aim at recapturing over time a European competitive edge and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> (c)  tax systems in the Community should become more job-oriented.</P>
    <P>These points reflect our key priority of increasing growth and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the European Community will be delighted to get this advice from the Taoiseach, but would he not consider that he might be better to address the fact that the policies of his Government do not meet the criteria he is advising European Governments to adopt?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that, for example, we have the tax system that is most anti-pathetic to jobs, that we have the poorest record in Europe in turning economic growth into jobs and that since the National Plan &mdash; for which we received large sums of EC money &mdash; was adopted, 98,000 people have emigrated and 63,000 have joined the dole queue?  Because Irish policies are deficient the expenditure of that money has not resulted in an increase in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be well aware that in recent times we have managed to stabilise the unemployment problem and that our quarterly figures issued in the past few days show quite clearly that we are managing our economy better than any other European State.  The Deputy is surely not unaware that there has been a deep world recession and that many of the factors which he attributes to increasing unemployment arose from that situation.  Of course, the Deputy tends to ignore the reality that we have the fastest growing population in Europe.  Despite the problems we are out-performing Europe.  It is not a question of the Irish Government advising the Community as to what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Copenhagen Summit we were all asked to submit a paper on what we believed needed to be done in European terms.  The Deputy will be the first to agree that Europe is not performing well, that it is on a low growth-rate path, that it needs to get its act together and that the single biggest priority is unemployment <Col N="15" /> which should be addressed in a co-ordinated way.  During the past nine months I have been striving to get the unemployment problem onto the top of the agenda.  It is now in that position and will be there at the EC December Summit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I try to persuade the Taoiseach that the unemployment problem is not an accident or an act of God, but that the tax system presided over by him as Minister for Finance and now as Taoiseach and which costs an employer £3.33 to pay £1 to an employee in take home pay, discourages, first, employers from creating jobs and, second, people currently on welfare from taking jobs.  Until the tax system is changed there is no point in the Government offering advice to people in Europe whose tax policies are not as anti-jobs as ours are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also that I was the first Minister in 20 years to attack the taxation problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always recognised that there must be improvements at the lower end and while considerable improvement has been made more is required.  All those issues will be the subject of discussions on a possible future <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> between the social partners and <Col N="16" /> the Government.  I would remind the Deputy also that our investment programme from now until the end of 1999 will be published next Monday.  This programme deals with a £20 million investment in the economy and clearly has jobs as its priority.  In all its policies and strategies the Government has given full priority to jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since apparently we will not have another chance to ask the Taoiseach about this issue, can he say whether he intends to make any reference to his concerns, if he has any, about the GATT agreement in his preparation for the December Summit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this question is about the objectives for the Summit.  Clearly, if the world trade problem is not sorted out by then it will have to be discussed at the Summit.  Surely Deputy Dukes should not be prevented from asking if this is a Government priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since I became Taoiseach, I have made the establishment of peace in the North of Ireland my top priority.  At my first press conference on 6 February 1992 after being elected leader of Fianna Fáil, I stated: &ldquo;We have all condemned these killings but we must prove that we have not bankrupted our determination to find a solution to this problem&rdquo;.  I went on: &ldquo;I have a good personal relationship with John Major.  I look forward to meeting him to try to end the cruelty of this conflict ... we must put no limits on what we must do to change all that&rdquo;.  Over the past 12 months, I have reiterated repeatedly my commitment to the search for a formula for peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This priority is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government under the heading &ldquo;Working for Peace&rdquo;, which states that the future welfare of all the people of Ireland is overshadowed by the conflict in Northern Ireland, which causes a heavy toll in human suffering and imposes a pointless and unwanted burden in terms of wasted resources and lost economic opportunity.  The Programme further states that a key element <Col N="21" /> in the Government's programme will be the search for an end to this conflict. This search for peace remains an absolute priority for this Government.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in London on 10 September last, both Governments reaffirmed their aim of a comprehensive political settlement which will address all the main relationships and agreed to continue to co-operate closely and actively to promote political progress by every possible means.  Both sides underlined the urgency and importance of the search for political agreement and stated their conviction that the objectives of the talks process, as set out in the statement of 26 March 1991, are valid and achievable.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing to do everything possible to get these talks going again.  For our part, we are completely committed to political dialogue and very much hope that the talks can be resumed.</P>
    <P>As regards constitutional issues, the Programme for a Partnership Government refers to the need for the final outcome of negotiations to be acceptable to the people, North and South.  It further states that the Government will seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package, which would achieve a balanced accommodation of the different positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues.  There has been no change in the Government's position on this matter.  A referendum would give the opportunity to all the people of this island to pronounce similtaneously on the form that future relationships might take on this island.</P>
    <P>I met the British Prime Minister in London on 16 June last.  A further meeting will, in the normal course, take place towards the end of the year.  If, however, I judge a meeting to be necessary before then, I will not hesitate to seek it.</P>
    <P>As regards speculation on the possibility of a deal having been agreed by the British Government with the UUP in return for their support in the House of Commons votes on 22 July on the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty and in <Col N="22" /> the ensuing confidence vote, Deputies will be aware that Prime Minister Major made a statement in this regard in the House of Commons on 23 July.  As I have already made clear, I have had no reason not to accept that statement in good faith.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of a possible US envoy to Northern Ireland, we are very appreciative of the goodwill and firm support of the United States in our efforts to achieve peace and stability on our island.  The option of a more active United States role remains, an offer of assistance and involvement that should be welcomed on all sides, although what form this might take, if implemented, naturally depends on developments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the process of dialogue between the leader of the SDLP and Sinn Féin, the Government has noted the joint statement issued on 25 September.  The present position is that the SDLP leader will brief both myself and the Tánaiste on the progress of that process of dialogue tomorrow morning.  When the Government has had time to reflect on the briefing given to us, we will decide how best to continue our efforts for the achievement of the objective of peace on this island.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there will only be peace on this island if both communities in Northern Ireland are happy; that there is no chance of the Unionist community being happy with any deal negotiated without their involvement and which is presented to them as a <i>fait accompli</i>, to say yes or no to, any more than there would be a chance of this being agreed to by the Nationalist community if it involved a dilution of what they have already gained under the Anglo-Irish Agreement? Therefore, will the Taoiseach agree that the really important talks are those between the Unionists and the Nationalists, between the two communities, rather than talks within any one community? In that context there is a key unanswered question about the Government's policy on this matter.  The Taoiseach referred to a referendum which he is willing to put to the Irish people.  Will this be a constitutional referendum?  In particular, can he confirm that he would be willing, if the overall deal is satisfactory, to recommend, as leader of Fianna Fáil, in that referendum an amendment to the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first question was whether I accept that there has to be an acceptance on the part of both communities before there can be a lasting peace on this island.  My reply is quite clearly, yes.  The violence in the North of Ireland has two sources, Loyalist paramilitaries and the Provisional IRA.  It is logical to expect that there will have to be efforts in both directions in trying to secure a cessation of violence. The Loyalist paramilitaries have made it clear on a number of occasions and are on public record as saying that their violence is reactive to the violence of the Provisional IRA.  Therefore, it is logical to try to secure a cessation of violence on the other side on the basis that the Loyalist paramilitaries have made it clear that if the other side ceases they will also cease.  I accept, therefore, that there has to be an acceptance on both sides.  Not only will this involve the parties in the North, it will also involve the British and Irish Governments who have their responsibilities and a job to do in that regard.  On the question of what would happen if an overall agreement or settlement is reached, the Deputy must not have been listening.  I said in my initial reply: &ldquo;As regards constitutional issues, the Programme for a Partnership Government refers to the need for the final outcome of negotiations to be <Col N="25" /> acceptable to the people, North and South.&rdquo;  That also answers the Deputy's first question.</P>
      <P>I stated further that the Government would seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package which would achieve a balanced accommodation of the different positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues.  Quite clearly, if an overall settlement is the final outcome, that would be put to the people, North and South, in a referendum I have consistently said that and it is what the Government programme clearly indicates.</P>

      <P>I have two questions to which I would like a clear answer from the Taoiseach.  The first relates to Articles 2 and 3.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that this is a time for courage rather than caution and that in relation to Articles 2 and 3 he should now make a declaration of intent to submit to the people by way of referendum a proposal to amend Articles 2 and 3 in the context of an overall settlement to reflect an aspiration to unity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Does the Taoiseach agree with the view expressed by the Fine Gael Front Bench this morning that the whole situation would be helped by more open debate and transparency and that the best way to achieve that is by arranging a full debate on Northern Ireland in Government time, bearing in mind that virtually everybody in this House is keen to see peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland at the earliest possible date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my views as clear as I can to those who want to listen.  I said in Bodenstown last year, and it is reflected again in the Programme for Government, that in the event of an overall settlement requiring constitutional change it will be put to the people, North and South.  Can I be any clearer than that?  It is in the Programme for Government and I said it on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>On the question of a debate in the House, I was asked time and time again to establish a foreign affairs committee, which we have done.  It is a very good forum in which this can be done without any bickering or political advantage being taken.</P>
      <P>In regard to transparency I do not know what the Deputy has in mind, but to proceed from the position we are in at the moment will demand a considerable amount of work by both Governments.  I do not think it would be proper or wise if details of every discussion were made public and would not be helpful to the achievement of the objective of a just and lasting peace on this island.  However, the Government will keep the House informed as much as possible.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Hume-Adams talks, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House the principles on <Col N="27" /> which he would judge the proposals being put to him by Mr. John Hume?  I draw his attention to statements by Provisional Sinn Féin and the council of the IRA which clearly indicate they have not moved one iota from their demands, (1) for British withdrawal, (2) for national self-determination by the Irish people as a whole and, (3) a demand of the British Government that they pressurise Unionists to accept this particular approach.  In view of that, will the Taoiseach indicate the principles on which he will approach the report from Mr. John Hume?  For instance, will he stand by Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which clearly states that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom will not be changed without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland as distinct from the demand of the Provisional IRA that it be changed as a result of a decision of the people of Ireland as a whole, which is completely different?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is putting his own interpretation on statements that are quite clearly not in accordance with the statements I have in front of me. The Hume-Adams joint statement states: &ldquo;Our discussions, aimed at the creation of a peace process which would involve all parties, have made considerable progress&rdquo;. What I am talking about here is peace and a peace process.  The last paragraph says:</P>
      <P>We are convinced from our discussions that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island which will provide a solid basis for peace.  Such process would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their allegiance and agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems clear that we are talking about a peace process.  I will not speculate on what John Hume may report to the Tánaiste and me tomorrow, I will await that report.  I assure the Deputy and the House that we are engaged in trying to find a formula for peace and anything that contributes to that will be taken into account by us.  We will listen to the report tomorrow.  We will evaluate it and have discussions with our Government colleagues next Tuesday.  It is not helpful to go into detail and try to impute certain ideas to people.  This is a difficult and delicate operation.  I ask for restraint and patience from the Members of this House and indeed from the general public. There is no instant solution to this problem and it should not be complicated and made all the more difficult.  Everybody knows how sensitive this is.  If everybody in this House is totally and absolutely committed to the peace process, as we are, then we should be sensitive and restrained and not make political points. <Col N="29" /> It is not a time for that here or between the communities of Northern Ireland. We want to see the two communities there in an environment that peace can transform totally and to have serious political talks on the future of the peoples of this island and how best they can live together without the impediment of violence.</P>

      <P>In his initial reply the Taoiseach said it was the objective of the two Governments to co-operate openly, actively and directly with one another in trying to find a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland.  Having regard to this, does he think that the attitude adopted by Mr. Major in coming to an agreement with the Unionists &mdash; this is the <Col N="31" /> perception in Northern Ireland &mdash; could be regarded as active co-operation with the Irish Government in trying to find a solution?  Given the sensitive nature of the problems in Northern Ireland, both Governments must be constantly concerned to ensure that one community does not appear to be given an advantage over the other.  If this happens on the Nationalist side there is a danger that it may play into the hands of the men of violence on that side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is always conscious not to make any statement or take any action which would drive the two communities in the North further apart.  The Government is making every effort both publicly and behind the scenes to try to get the peace process back on the rails; it is totally committed to doing this.  Having said that, the Government believes that the achievement of a cessation in violence would transform the situation for both communities in the North.  I am addressing the position of both communities as I believe both of them have a vested interest in the achievement of a cessation of violence.  Both the Unionist and Nationalist communities have suffered enormously from violence over the past 25 years.  There should be no cause for fear about the building of a peace process. People know the objective and no solution will be imposed over their heads without agreement on how both communities can live together on this island in the future.  That is the objective of the exercise.</P>

      <P>I think the Taoiseach missed the point I was trying to make, that is, he must be seen to be actively engaged with his counterpart in the British Government in any decisions made in regard to Northern Ireland.  The fact that the Leader of the British Government sought support from one party seems to indicate a lack of co-operation. An assurance was given that no such deal was done but the perception in the North of Ireland, which can only be of help to <Col N="32" /> the men of violence, is that a deal was done.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs let that vacuum remain for three months by not calling a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference and not publicly objecting to this action.  There was a dereliction of duty by both of them.</P>

The morning after the alleged deal, Sir Patrick Mayhew contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs to assure him that no deal was made.  We took that assurance at face value and in good faith and we will continue to do so until the opposite is proven.</P>

      <P>Twenty-five years after the first civil rights march all our efforts must be directed towards the greatest civil right of all, the right to life.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if two essential principles are included in the Hume-Adams peace process &mdash; the permanent cessation of all violence and the consent of the Unionists to any change in their status in the future, including the right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; as well as the right to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash; his Government will support this peace process?  I am confident that those two essential principles will be included in that peace process.  Having worked closely with John Hume for a quarter of a century, I know that those two principles have been part and parcel of all his political activity during that time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Currie is correct in what he has said: if one reads the statement issued after the Hume-Adams meetings one will see that those two principles are enshrined in it.  I wish to avail of the opportunity tomorrow to seek an elaboration of the statement and get a full report of the present position.  The statement is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Our discussions, aimed at the creation of a peace process which would involve all parties, have made consideable progress.  We agreed to forward a report on the position reached to date to Dublin for consideration.</P>
    <P>The last paragraph of the statement enshrines the second principle to which Deputy Currie referred:</P>
    <P>We are convinced from our discussions that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace.  Such a process would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their allegiance and agreement.</P>
    <P>It is clear from those quotations that the two principles to which Deputy Currie referred are enshrined in the statement.</P>

      <P>Two supplementaries arise from the Taoiseach's initial reply. The Taoiseach referred to the intention of the Government to seek agreement to a referendum being held simultaneously on both sides of the Border when some consensus is reached.  Will that be a constitutional referendum?  If Articles 2 and 3 are included in such a referendum, how can a question be put in that way?  In reply to an earlier supplementary from, I think, Deputy O'Keeffe, the Taoiseach rather grudgingly said that Articles 2 and 3 would be included in such a package. If that is so, how does the Taoiseach reconcile that with the statement he made earlier this year in County Tipperary that there would be no change in Articles 2 and 3?  If that can now be agreed by the Government why could it not have been put forward by it a year ago?</P>

However, I want to again put on the record of this House that that was a selected extract from a speech given in Tipperary.  If the Deputy wishes, I will send him a full copy of the speech before he relinquishes the burdensome office of leadership of the party.  I have made the position quite clear today and I would say to Deputy O'Malley and others that we would be happy to arrive at the position where we could sit down and devise a wording for a referendum in the event of an overall settlement being agreed.  In that context, I have said quite clearly that it will involve, if necessary or appropriate, constitutional changes.  We must wait and see what the overall agreement will be but I have made the position quite clear on a number of occasions and I cannot add anything further to it.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Taoiseach did not get the import of what I said.  In the interviews to which Deputy De Rossa referred earlier, by the leader of Sinn Féin, it was said their objective was peace.  We should not pretend that that prerogative lies with us only.  The chances of achieving peace would be much greater if the talks were resumed and seen to be leading to a political solution. Indeed the Taoiseach and his Government have a responsibility, along with the British Government, to get those talks going again.  I want to know what the Taoiseach is doing to bring that about and what progress he hopes to make very shortly in that regard.  The longer the vacuum that existed during the summer continues, with no talks and no prospect of talks, and an apparent lack of interest on the part of this Government in their resumption, then the greater chance have the men of violence of resuming their activities.</P>

Bilateral talks are taking place between the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, his Ministers and the various political leaders there. The Irish Government is ready to sit at the table tomorrow morning.  In so far as the other parties there are concerned, it is a matter for them to decide.  I understand that the Alliance Party is ready to sit at the table, as is the SDLP.  The DUP has made it clear it is not ready to do so.  The position of the Unionist Party is not clear but discussions are continuing between them and Sir Patrick Mayhew in an effort to have the talks process resumed.  There is no question of this Government sitting back in relation to these talks.  That does not mean we should not be involved in endeavouring to get a peace process going and a cessation of violence which <Col N="43" /> would give considerable impetus to the overall talks process.</P>

Will he not also agree that people are not afraid of peace but rather they are afraid of a process which is intended to bring peace but may lead in the opposite direction because of the conditions laid down for that process? The fear is that it may not be a peace process but rather a civil war process. That fear needs to be allayed by the Taoiseach's returning to this House and telling us precisely what is that process.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to make a clear appeal to the IRA to stop killing people now, on the grounds that their own declaration that they are in favour of agreement is inconsistent with continuing to murder people.  Will he say clearly that no discussions into which he is willing to enter will give any succour or justification whatsoever for the continuance of violence?  Will he agree that the main obstacle to the resumption of talks in Northern Ireland is Unionist distrust which emanates directly and solely from the continuance of the IRA campaign of violence?</P>

      <P>I began answering questions today on the basis that violence emanates from two different quarters, that there are statements from one side that their violence is reactive and, if the other violence stops, they will stop.  I do not know how Deputy John Bruton can be so confused.  Our repudiation of violence is as strong today as it ever was.  If one party says they will stop if the other stops, then surely it is logical &mdash; if one is interested in peace &mdash; to endeavour to find a process that will procure a cessation of violence from one side on the basis that, if one gets the first in place, the other will follow suit.  I do not accept that <Col N="44" /> this is not a logical direction to pursue on the part of anybody interested in peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 444 and 448 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the Parents for Integration Association regarding the integration of mentally handicapped children into ordinary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for representatives of the association to meet with senior officials of my Department's inspectorate in the very near future to discuss the association's concerns.  While it is my policy to encourage the maximum possible level of integration of handicapped <Col N="45" /> children into ordinary schools, the pace of such development and the degree to which integration can be achieved will vary depending on the specific and evolving needs of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I should point out that I am currently making arrangements to publish the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which is giving particular attention to the question of integration of children with disabilities and the support services required in this area.  I intend to invite those who made submissions, including Parents for Integration Association, to study the report and attend a one day seminar organised by my Department to respond to its findings.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs are provided for in a number of ways.  Depending on their abilities they can attend special schools, special classes in ordinary national schools or can be integrated into ordinary classes in national schools.  Children with special needs who are capable of attending mainstream classes have access to a range of supports.  The largest category of such pupils, those in need of remedial tuition, receive the support of 1,032 remedial teachers operating within the primary school sector: 86 additional remedial teachers were appointed to this service in September, 1993.  The location of these posts were as outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 218 and 228 of 9 June 1993</P>
    <P>The Visiting Teacher Service, which traditionally dealt only with visual and hearing impaired children, was expanded in 1992 as part of a development aimed at meeting the needs of other categories of handicapped children in ordinary schools.  An additional eight visiting teachers were appointed for this purpose, bringing the total of such teachers to 38. As a first step in the process, the service was extended to embrace 44 Downs Syndrome children, identified by the Downs Syndrome Association as requiring support. Additional Downs Syndrome children will receive the support of this service as the caseloads of the visiting teachers permit.</P>
    <P>As part of a further initiative in this <Col N="46" /> area, my Department has already appointed seven special resource teachers in selected schools to support ordinary teaching staff in dealing with children with special needs.  While no such appointments have been made to date in 1993, the question of further such appointments is being actively considered.</P>
    <P>At post primary level, approximately 354 whole-time teacher equivalents have been sanctioned by my Department to support the integration of children with special needs at post-primary level.  Eight whole-time teacher equivalents were allocated for the first time in 1993-94.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, irrespective of how she might voice her support for the principle of integration, the parents of Down's Syndrome children spent all last year and this summer bringing their mentally handicapped children to school after begging for admission and that the principals of those schools spent their time begging the Department of Education for the necessary resources?  For example, one child, Niamh McGrath, who attends school in Killester, is benefiting by only two hours extra per week as a result of this so-called additional help.  In the case of Niamh Wilson who attends Beaumont school, she is benefiting by two hours that were poached from the existing pilot project.  Does the Minister regard that as adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was poached from anywhere.  In the case of the visiting teacher service there are 38 visiting teachers including eight teachers appointed in 1992 as part of a development aimed at extending the service to embrace Downs Syndrome children as well as the traditional group of hearing and visually impaired children.  The eight new posts referred to include two posts targeted specifically at Downs Syndrome children in the Dublin area.  I fully recognise that there has been intensive lobbying and concern by parents of all those children who require special care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> I trust that the Deputy and the parents will find that this Minister is responding to the problem.  I have already met two deputations of parents of Downs Syndrome children and I have indicated to them that they should study the Special Education report.  I will then target resources where they are most needed.  I do not think there is much difference between my views and those of the Deputy in regard to the need for additional resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair that these people should have to beg for an adequate level of service for their children? Is it not a fact that the handicapped are at the bottom of the priority ladder, that time and again the mentally handicapped, through their parents, have had to take Ministers for Education to court in order to receive their basic constitutional entitlement, that is an adequate level of primary education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the past has not been satisfactory and as a result the Department of Education and previous Ministers set up the Special Education Review Committee in order to review the services available for the many categories of children who must be served by the Department of Education. In the Programme for Government there is a specific commitment to the mentally handicapped.  In order for me to respond in a positive way which will benefit the children concerned I must make sure that the available resources are targeted where they are most needed.  That is probably best done in partnership with those concerned.  I refer specifically to the Parents for Integration Association which represents a number of families in Dublin city and I look forward to their response to the Special Education Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 80 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I have made it quite clear in my statements that I am opposed to any selective entrance tests being applied to pupils by post-primary school authorities.  In my statement of 12 August last, I outlined my reasons for this.  I would stress in particular that the school is part of its local community and is funded by the State on behalf of the community.  Selection tests at entry deny some children from the community the right to attend their local school.  These tests hit hardest at pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unjust for the school to deny these pupils entry on the basis of selective entry tests.  My Department is involved in continuing discussions with the post-primary school authorities in relation to the steps necessary to achieve my objective.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at present until those discussions have been completed. While I have not set any specific deadline for the matter to be finalised I <Col N="49" /> am anxious that the principle of selection based on tests be discontinued for the school year 1994-95.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have precise information on how many voluntary secondary schools refused entry to applicant pupils in 1992 on the basis of entrance tests; the matter is, in any event, one of principle rather than of quantity.  My concern is that all post-primary schools should have fair and objective admission procedures.</P>
    <P>I would hope that a memorandum of understanding will be agreed before too long with the school managerial authorities. I would prefer, therefore, at this stage not to comment on the issue of withholding State funding from non-compliant schools and I am sure that the Deputies will accept my reasons for this given that discussions are ongoing and have yet to be completed with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that the question of fee-paying secondary schools is a separate issue and as such will be addressed separately after the forthcoming Education Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

      <P>The Minister said that the refusal of many voluntary secondary schools to accept some pupils was based on principle rather than quantity; to me it would appear to be based on ideology rather than on education.  The initial announcement was in April at one of the teachers' conferences.  From time to time throughout the summer there were banner headlines in all the national newspapers to the effect that the Minister would take the fee paying schools to task because of selective entry.  I asked the Minister a specific question: how many voluntary secondary schools refused entry to applicant students in 1992, where are those schools and to what extent do they operate selective entry?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is ideology to stand here as the Minister for Education and ask that students have equal access to facilities provided by taxpayers. I am aware of the headlines but they were not instigated by me.  At present a national debate is taking place as a result of the publication of the Green Paper.  The headlines and the subjects referred came into the public arena because of the publication of the Green Paper and will, I am sure, be referred to at the forthcoming education convention which is being hosted by me, beginning on Monday next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not right in saying there are only 55 fee paying schools in the country?  In the context of the Minister's purge against those schools I asked how many apply selective entry, where they are and to what extent they operate this practice.  Therefore, is the Minister not making a major song and dance about something that is trivial, giving the impression that by doing something about the fee paying schools, which have given a tremendous service and which go back to long before the Minister's department was in existence, she would rectify the crucial issue which is equal access of children, including those from disadvantaged areas, to education?</P>

      <P>I do not consider it a major song and dance to ensure that children are not declared or branded failures in their communities at the age of 11 and 12.  I would refer the Deputy to my initial reply.  This subject does not refer specifically to fee paying or free and voluntary schools, it refers to selective entry tests for all schools.  I hope that when we have concluded our agreement we will know how many schools practice selective entry tests.  Until schools are expected to publish their criteria it is an unknown quantity.  I have stated already that I do not believe we are talking about a very big problem.  The decision to initiate selective tests for children of 11 and 12 years of age damages the primary school curriculum, damages some children who are hurt by it and leaves parents totally bewildered as to the role their school has to play in their community.</P>

      <P>I have examined each of the cases brought to my attention regarding the eligibility of those students wishing to study medicine in UCG and I am pleased to say that arrangements have been made to enable the five students in question to avail of the scholarships at University College, Galway this year.

      <P>In that respect I thank the Minister, the Secretary and other senior officials of her Department, as well as members of the Higher Education Authority, for the enormous amount of work they put into finding a solution to what was a complex and what appeared to be a very intractable problem.  Can the Minister give this House an assurance that the difficulty encountered by the young students in question will not be experienced by students who may be in a similar position next year?  That is very important.  Will the Minister acknowledge that it is nothing short of a disgrace that the Department of Education should, on the one hand, design a school scholarship scheme and, on the other, fail to rectify the conditions where young people who win those scholarships are precluded from finding places in universities to pursue the discipline of their choice?  Further, can the Minister make provision in relation to the CAO application forms next year whereby young people who bid for scholarships will be able to indicate on those forms their likely choice in the event of their being successful?  Can the Minister allow for <Col N="53" /> flexibility in the filling of the forms so that students may be enabled to avail of first round offers rather than be left, as the students in question were left, for six full weeks wondering whether they would get a place in university to follow the course of their choice and, if so, whether they would be entitled to draw down the scholarship they had earned as a result of their excellent results in the leaving certificate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in reassuring the Deputy that the scheme will be reviewed.  For the sake of the students, as well as the Minister and the officials, it is very important that that be done.  It is certainly not the intention of the Department of Education to have a case such as this on the debating table in the week when the universities reopen. There are two kinds of scholarship, the trí-Ghaeilge and the Gaeltacht, but there is a good deal of confusion as between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trí Ghaeilge scholarships are awarded to people living in the Gaeltacht and can be taken up in the pursuance of a course in whatever discipline one wishes.  They apply only to pupils who pursue university courses trí Ghaeilge and were available in University College Galway and in Colaiste Mhuire, Marino.  I agree that the question of the range of courses and the institutions at which they may be pursued is a big constraint.  Earlier, I signalled that there would be a review in the Department of the two scholarship schemes because, although five students were facilitated through this scheme because they could find ex-quota places in Galway University, there are many other people who believe they should have been able to take up the scholarships at other universities.  There is an anomaly here.  I would prefer not to have to be accommodating but to review the practice and the rules so that everybody, regardless of whether they know Deputy Quill or know the Minister for Education, will know their entitlements and be in a position to take up the places they have won.  I congratulate the students referred to and also the other three who <Col N="54" /> have been brought to our notice and who wish to pursue the study of medicine trí-Ghaeilge in Galway University.</P>

      <P>Targeted funding for research projects is made through Eolas, through the Office of Science and Technology of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The provision of resources for research and development is being addressed by the Government in the context of the National Plan which is to be announced shortly.  As the Deputy will be aware a substantial programme of investment in research and development is nearing completion under the current National Development Plan.  This included the provision of major improvements in research and development facilities at Dublin City University, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, University College, Cork, University College, Dublin, University College Galway, University of Limerick and Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of significant developments in this context also in the Dublin Institute of Technology and a number of Regional Technical Colleges, e.g. Waterford, Tallaght and Cork. Examples of projects included in the programme are the food science, aquaculture and microelectronics facilities in University College Cork, the Science and Technology Centre in Maynooth, and the science and technology facilities in Dublin City University.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister read the article but does she not accept that the heading &ldquo;Irish Government turns its back on Science&rdquo; is a damning indictment of the level of commitment to basic science in university?  Is there not a lack of balance when one considers that from the EC alone 53 companies &mdash; one of which was C &amp; D petfoods in Longford &mdash; got £500,000 each for research and development, more than the entire university sector got for the funding of the basic sciences in UCC, UCD, UCG, Trinity College, University of Limerick and so on.  Is that fair and equitable?</P>

It would be pointless to have a debate after the strategy has been drawn up.  Will it be possible for those of us who have a great deal to say on the matter, to contribute before the finalisation of the national health strategy?</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of £13 million by the Irish Government to the Tenth Replenishment of the Resources of the International Development Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Development Association, or IDA, is an affiliate of the World Bank.  It was established in 1960 and complements the work of the bank by lending to the poorer developing <Col N="342" /> countries on much more favourable terms than are possible for the bank itself.  Like the World Bank, IDA provides assistance to high priority investment projects and general sectoral economic adjustment programmes in member countries.  Basically IDA is different from the World Bank in two ways &mdash; how it obtains its funds and how it lends out its funds.</P>
    <P>The World Bank operates more like a commercial bank.  It raises most of its funds by borrowing on the world's capital markets and on-lends these funds, with a small mark-up to cover expenses, to a wide range of developing countries. IDA, on the other hand, is mostly funded by regular replenishments, or grant contributions, from its richer member countries.  These resources need to be replenished from time to time, normally at three year intervals.  The IDA 10 negotiations were completed in late 1992 and this replenishment will cover the period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996. Since its inception in 1960, IDA has been a major source of highly concessional financing for the poorest countries.  Typically IDA loans are for 35 to 40 years duration.  They have a ten-year grace period before repayment begins.  IDA does not charge interest &mdash; only a service charge of less than 1 per cent of the outstanding balance.</P>
    <P>IDA's role is one which finds great support from Ireland.  Its focus of attention is firmly on the poorest developing countries.  This is directly in line with a general Irish overseas aid priority, namely to provide assistance to poorer developing countries.  IDA plays a key role in the economic and social development of these countries.  Its purpose is not to provide short term humanitarian aid, but to create the conditions in which the countries can permanently raise the living standards of their people.  Its lending programmes are primarily aimed at providing resources for investment projects that are not only essential for the economic and social development of the borrowing country, but also technically and economically sound.  IDA also lends for more comprehensive economic programmes <Col N="343" /> which facilitate the long term growth of the economy, or of a particular sector.  In recent years it has increasingly provided financial aid to enable poor countries to introduce and implement urgent economic policy reforms and structural adjustments.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, only the very poorest countries can benefit from IDA lending.  Generally, only countries which have a <i>per capita</i> income of $765 or less in 1991 dollars are eligible for IDA loans. Exceptions are maintained for small island economies and for temporary assistance to a category of countries which have <i>per capita</i> incomes about the cut-off level but are not creditworthy for World Bank lending.  As a result IDA lending is generally concentrated in the poorer, densely populated countries of Asia and the least developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa.  Today some 70 countries are eligible for IDA funding.  Each year, IDA finances about $6.5 billion in new lending to these countries.  Over IDA has supported over 1,100 projects which in turn support overall investments of some $83 billion.  IDA's activities span the globe from China to Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Egypt, most of sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in Central and South America.  Over 45 per cent of IDA's financial support goes to sub-Saharan Africa and the same percentage to Asia.</P>
    <P>The donor resources made available to IDA during the Ninth Replenishment were scheduled to be fully committed by June 1993.  In anticipation of this, the representatives of the donor Governments began substantive negotiations for the tenth replenishment, in January 1992. After five formal negotiating sessions, one of which was held in Dublin, the Deputies reached agreement in December 1992 on a replenishment of SDR 13 billion.  However, IDA's lending power during the three-year period is now estimated at about SDR 16 billion or $22 billion eqivalent.  This is higher than the earlier estimate of 15.5 billion SDR.  The full extra 3 billion SDR is made up of repayment commitments from earlier <Col N="344" /> IDA loans and the recent approved transfer of $375 million equivalent from the World Bank's surplus account.  This amount could be added to by further transfers from the net income or profit of the World Bank.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations it was agreed that IDA should continue to focus on three main objectives in order to support economic development in the poorest countries: poverty reduction, economic adjustment and growth and environmental protection and improvement. These objectives remain an accurate reflection of the key development challenges facing the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>We expressed satisfaction with the recent sharpening of IDA's poverty-reduction focus, including provision to bank staff of comprehensive operational guidance on poverty issues and increases in the shares of IDA lending for poverty-targeted investments and social sector projects.</P>
    <P>IDA attaches great importance to the completion of country poverty assessments for all major IDA recipients by the end of 1994 and IDA continues to emphasise social sector lending and poverty-targeted investments, that is, investments that disproportionately benefit the poor in particular or have specific mechanisms for identifying and reaching the poor.  We expect that the higher shares of poverty-targeted investments and social sector lending which were achieved during IDA 9 would increase steadily during the IDA 10 period.  IDA was asked to attach special importance to its efforts in two areas&mdash;women in development and family planning.  IDA was also urged to expand its support for social services for women, including in particular education of girls.</P>
    <P>As far as economic adjustment and growth were concerned, IDA's support for adjustment had been strengthened in a number of ways during the IDA 9 period.  For example, social safety nets are increasingly being built into adjustment operations to help protect the poor and enhance the sustainability of the adjustment effort and lending allocations <Col N="345" /> are increasingly being influenced by a country's economic performance.</P>
    <P>The participating countries cited a number of aspects of adjustment to which particular attention might be given in the years ahead.  IDA's executive directors were asked to keep track of how closely public expenditures reflected development priorities and of efforts that were being made to reduce non-development expenditures, including military expenditures, to the maximum extent feasible.</P>
    <P>The continuing constraint to development prospects imposed by high levels of outstanding debt in many countries was noted.  I spoke of this problem at the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Washington last week, when I called for a special debt relief package to be formulated for sub-Saharan Africa and the other poorest regions.  What I asked for was a substantial write-off of debt at least in line with the so-called Trinidad terms.  Deputies may be aware that these terms call for, among other things, the write-off of two-thirds of the debt of low-income developing countries. Without some new initiative to reduce debt, these countries have really no prospect of developing on the lines we demand of them.</P>
    <P>In this context I acknowledge the contribution of the non-governmental organisations, in highlighting the impact of excessive debt.  Several of these agencies have an impressive track record in working to ease the lot of the poorest.  We should respect their considered opinion which is based on experience in the field.</P>
    <P>In the area of environmental protection and improvement, the rapid evolution of IDA's role in supporting environmental sustainability was noted. This is an objective close to us in Ireland and in this context I welcome, in particular, the IDA's intention to increase involvement by non-governmental organisations in the design and implementation of projects.  I know this will be particularly welcomed by our non-governmental organisations such as Concern, Trócaire, Goal, the Irish Red Cross and Gorta.  We are extremely proud of the efforts of these groups and the people <Col N="346" /> working for them in the developing world.  I am certain that greater consultation between IDA personnel and these groups will enhance the effectiveness of the IDA's projects and programmes.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations the representatives of donor states reviewed three criteria for allocating funds, namely, <i>per capita</i> income, performance and creditworthiness.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the operational cutoff of <i>per capita</i> income be left at the same real level as in IDA 9 &mdash; $765 or less, in 1991 dollars.  In addition, the IDA was asked to reduce its allocations to more creditworthy countries and we recommended that assistance to these countries be directed primarily to poverty-focused activities or those that promote environmental sustainability.  It was also agreed that resources allocated to sub-Saharan Africa would, subject to performance, be maintained at between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of the total. We also attach great weight to the timely completion and high quality of national environmental action plans that are prepared, with IDA assistance, by all active borrowers.</P>
    <P>The ways in which the IDA allocates its resources by country and by sector is a key determinant of the effective implementation of its policies.  The negotiators reaffirmed that the IDA should focus its efforts on those countries that have demonstrated their commitment to the IDA's three main objectives, that access to IDA resources should be based on annual assessments of performance, with allocations related to the strength of countries' commitments to the three main objectives, and that in countries where performance is lax, lending should be limited to the minimum needed to maintain the policy dialogue.</P>
    <P>I want to return now to the funding of IDA 10 and Ireland's share of that funding.  The size of the tenth replenishment was the subject of extensive discussions during the negotiations, as were the relative contributions of the different member countries.  I had the pleasure of meeting many of the negotiators and <Col N="347" /> World Bank or IDA personnel when Ireland hosted one of the negotiating sessions in Dublin Castle in July 1992.  I was struck by the great support for IDA among almost all the richer nations. Nevertheless the negotiations took place against a backdrop of widespread recessionary conditions.  As a result and after protracted discussions, it was decided to recommend a replenishment of 13 billion SDRs &mdash; somewhat less than I would have hoped for.  Agreeing the equitable distribution of this total among the donors again proved no easy task and the determination of relative shares is becoming increasingly difficult. However, this sum of almost 13 billion SDRs was only reached when a number of countries, including Ireland, pledged supplementary contributions, over and above their agreed share.  Ireland's basic share of 0.11 per cent called for a contribution of 14.3 million SDRs.  Subject to Dáil and Seanad approval I agreed to make a supplementary contribution of 1.1 million SDRs.  This brings our total contribution to IDA 10 to 15.4 million SDRs.  This amount translates into IR£13 million at an exchange rate already agreed.  This is the amount for which I seek the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of IDA was authorised by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  Our contributions to the various replenishments have each been authorised by amendments to that Act.  This Bill will enable us to make our contribution to IDA 10.</P>
    <P>In recommending the Bill to the House I suggest that after the Second Stage debate we proceed with the other Stages as this would be helpful in the overall negotiations.  This is a very short Bill but I will understand if it is not possible to do as I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have any great problem with this Bill.  We have always accepted that we must live up to our responsibilities in terms of overseas aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> While this Bill does not come under overseas development assistance as operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is an essential part of what we do to contribute towards development in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome much of what the Minister told us in his speech.  Every effort is being made to make the IDA more accountable and more recipient friendly.  I am referring, for instance to small communities in Africa, Asia or perhaps Latin America. Although the Minister did not mention it, it was perhaps implied that the IDA in the distribution of its funds has not been too sensitive to the needs of small communities and to the real needs in third world countries.  Incidentally, the leader or the Government in the recipient country has a full veto over IDA funding. Often IDA funds went towards prestige projects in the poorest countries where impoverishment is a way of life for 90 per cent of the population.  Much IDA spending has been on inappropriate development.  It would be far better to have spent money on community projects through the work of NGOs in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Assistance coming through the IDA never reaches many well deserving community projects and obviously that criticism was getting through in the negotiations.  I sincerely hope that it will have an effect.  From the information I have been given, I cannot be very hopeful. The bank said that it was setting up an inspection panel to hear complaints about the bank's projects but I doubt the capacity of that new panel to investigate complaints.  I note that it will have a very small budget and only one permanent member of staff.  There is also a procedure whereby the bank's management will first receive the panel's report and then recommend it to the bank's board along with the action to be taken.  It would be far better if reports went directly to the board rather than to the managers who would have an interest in getting rid of comments critical of them.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty is that the leader of the recipient country will have a full veto.  A country like Zaire might be an <Col N="349" /> applicant for funding under IDA and it will be up to President Mobuto to decide whether a project needs to be aided. President Mobuto seems to represent the worst type of despotism on that continent at present.  I do not wish to be particularly critical of him as there are many like him in Africa.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that in the IDA 10 negotiations it was decided governments should have a veto.  This brings me back to the point I made earlier, that an effort should be made to empower local communities. These funds will be directed at the poorest of the poor who in this case are the communities who live in awful conditions in African countries such as Uganda, Mozambique and Angola.</P>
    <P>I tried to develop this theme &mdash; the appalling problems in Africa today &mdash; when we discussed the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs last July prior to the summer recess.  I do not think it has dawned on us just how bad things are.  Are we aware of the the extent to which the position has deteriorated during the past decade?  According to the best statistics, ten years ago approximately 100 millon people in Africa where living in poverty.  In 1993 this figure has risen to 200 million.  Because of disease these people survive half their natural life span.  Indeed, 50 per cent of children in some areas die before they reach the age of one.  The figures are frightening.</P>
    <P>If one reads the report, &ldquo;The State of the World's Children&rdquo;, published annually by UNICEF, one will see that the key indicators are infant mortality rates and access to water, education and vaccinations for diseases such as polio and leprosy.  If one compares recent reports with those published ten years ago one will find that, instead of the position improving, it is deteriorating.  Infant mortality rates in Africa are now the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>It has been predicted that by the end of this century if present trends continue, the number of people in Africa living in poverty will increase to 300 million.  It is up to the developed world to stretch out a hand and offer assistance to this underdeveloped part of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> The decline in economic conditions in African countries can be traced back to their relationship with the developed world.  The trade terms offered to these countries are not fair.  While IDA lending accounts for only a small fraction of overall lending and is directed at very poor countries, the conditions attached to IMF and World Bank lending place a heavy burden on many countries.  The IDA insisted that Zambia, which is trying to rebuild a true democracy having had a benevolent dictatorship for 20 years, provide social services, including the provision of milk for primary school children in a country where possibly 50 per cent of people receive an education and where 60 per cent of girls receive none.  This is one of the poorest countries in the world, yet this is the way it is being treated by a world institution which is supposed to be trying to secure development in poor countries.</P>
    <P>I understand that all developed countries are represented at the World Bank.  I often wonder what is said on our behalf.  I welcome what the Minister had to say about the recent meeting of the World Bank.  He confirmed that, in line with the request I made at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, this country would support the Trinidad Terms rather than the so-called Enhanced Toronto Terms.  It is a pity that he did not indicate the response.  Perhaps no decision was made.  The Minister might indicate when replying to the debate what he thinks the response will be.  What support did he receive from his fellow directors or members of the World Bank?  I do not know if Ministers for Finance consider themselves to be directors of the World Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  I sincerely hope that his representations were accompanied by representations from the more powerful governors of the World Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking at figures which indicate that the amount spent on debt servicing by the African Continent is four times <Col N="351" /> greater than the amount spent on health and education.  That is the reason the Trinidad Terms are so important.  In determining the approach they should adopt to lending to poor countries the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have to take into account the fact that economic conditions in Africa are getting worse.  There has been some economic growth in Asia, particularly in the Far East and the Pacific ring, but there is crushing poverty in the Philippines, for example.</P>
    <P>In Africa the figures are appalling. Someone said to me recently that gross output in Africa, excluding South Africa, is lower than in the Benelux countries. Six hundred million people are living in Africa as compared with 25 million or fewer in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  This gives some idea of how bad the position is.  It has been deteriorating during the past decade.  Political upheavel and the actions of despots have led to economic decline.  In addition there was Cold War rivalry.  The great powers fought a war by proxy in Angola and Mozambique.  The Cuban forces fought on the side of the MPLA Government in Angola while millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in American aid were filtered through to UNITA through South Africa.  This did not do the Soviet Union or the United States of America any good but it had an appalling effect on that unfortunate country.  Consider the total dismemberment of Mozambique. Thankfully there is now a ceasefire in that poor country and I hope elections will be held there.  However, the problems they face are absolutely mind-boggling.  The first question a Government coming to office in any of those countries has to ask is where it should start.  So much of the destruction of their economy and their physical assets is directly related to the actions of the great powers fighting their Cold War rivalries in the last 20 years.  We, as an ex-colonial country with a nightmare past, have a voice to be listened to in this area because we can speak with great moral <Col N="352" /> authority.  We often do not take advantage of that influence.</P>
    <P>There was never a better opportunity for doing something for poor countries. The Cold War is over.  The exploitation by the great powers and various factions that happened to fall out with each other in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola, Uganda and elsewhere has stopped.  Millions of dollars were given in military assistance to despots by all sides.  If we could only pour in similar sums to fund basic humanitarian needs like health, education and all the other things rather than supplying them with funds for their own destruction, we could achieve something. If one goes to some of these African countries like Liberia, Angola or Mozambique one is very likely to meet a youngster on the street carrying an AK47 or its American equivalent.  That is part of the legacy that we have left those people.  They have no legacy of development, no legacy worth talking about of greater education, better sanitation, better health, etc.  We should be doing everything in our power to raise our voice on these matters.</P>
    <P>The recently published World Bank report said: &ldquo;In relation to IDA10, IDA funds will be stretched because nine extra countries became recipients during IDA9&rdquo;.  It illustrates the point I am making.  There were nine more countries than there were under IDA8 which is the trend I have been talking about, that impoverishment is like the desert; it is spreading.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The IDA10 donors therefore agreed that the more creditworthy recipients that were also able to borrow from the World Bank (&ldquo;blend countries&rdquo;) should rely more on the Bank.  IDA funds for these countries will be directed primarily to reducing poverty or promoting environmental sustainability. While funding from the Bank and IDA taken together will be more expensive for these countries, the agreement will conserve IDA resources.  This will accommodate new recipients without seriously jeopardising funding for countries without <Col N="353" /> alternative financing.  The share of IDA funding for blend countries is being reduced, therefore, from 40 per cent in IDA9 to 30-35 per cent in IDA10.  The regional pattern of IDA10 blending is expected to be broadly similar to IDA9.</P>
    <P>This is important and it is a pity that the Minister did not mention it.  It is a fund that has grown no larger but which has to be divided between many more countries. It is a great pity that we could not have found a little more money to improve our overseas development assistance, which is little more than one third of the target allocated for overseas development assistance.  We have the unenviable distinction of being second from the bottom of the league, the USA being at the bottom.  It is not a very creditable position in which to find ourselves. I know resources are scarce but it would have been more satisfactory if we could have found more resources to make available through this mechanism of the IDA.  While it is not generally regarded as overseas development aid this particular fund-loan, if it were called just that, might make our figures in terms of what we give and what we have to achieve look a good deal more respectable.</P>
    <P>Many more countries are being thrown back on the World Bank and the IMF because there is less money to go around from IDA funds.  There is no point in telling the Zambians, the Ugandans and the Liberians to go to the IMF for their funds, to be ready to pay their rate of interest and to take on board the economic adjustments upon which the IMF will insist.  Last week I was in South Africa and the papers were writing welcomingly about the fact that the World Bank and the IMF have decided to lend to South Africa.  That was welcomed by ANC representatives as well as the representatives of the Government.  All shades of political opinion welcomed it. However, South Africa is quite different because it enjoys a level of development far above anywhere else in Africa and if there were to be an even distribution of the wealth in South Africa, the average <Col N="354" /> black South African would be much better off than most of his counterparts in any other country.  In fact, he would reach a level of wealth that would, no doubt, be very close to our own.  I condemn the apartheid regime which is effectively dead, thank God.  Nevertheless, the black population of South Africa is, relatively speaking, a lot better off than the populations of so many other countries surrounding them.  A country like South Africa would be in a better position to undertake the economic policy adjustments insisted upon by the IDA or the World Bank when they lend.</P>
    <P>This is something about which we should raise our voices more forcefully and I congratulate the Minister on foot of the Trinidad Terms worked out in Washington a week ago.  However, they do not go far enough.  We must bear in mind what is happening on the continent of Africa.  Until we see a turnaround in the economic conditions, we cannot be satisfied with our own actions.  So many countries are doing what we are asking them to do, taking on board what is essentially western thought and instituting parliamentary democracies.  It is not always easy for African countries where there are different traditions and different cultures.  We insist on telling them how good these things are &mdash; I would certainly tell them that &mdash; but we must be careful when we do so.  If we tell them that they should become full democratic societies we should remember that it has a price and, if this is important to us, we should be willing to pay part of that price.  We cannot simply lecture these countries about the quality of their democratic system.  We all want to see the end of people like Mobutu and others who still stalk so much of Africa and other parts of the world.  However, there is no point in telling a government that it should stop giving free milk to children in primary schools, stop subsidies to schools, cut back on primary health care&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nothing could be more inimical to the desire that these countries should become democratic.  One cannot expect democracy to flourish in such circumstances. When a government tries to make adjustments which impose hardship on the general population naturally the voice of the demagogue will say that the government is bowing to the western powers with their banking systems, loans, etc., and that that is what is increasing poverty.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes this Bill, which is a small gesture, and we will not do anything to impede its progress through the House.  I hope that some of the points I made will be borne in mind by the Minister.  We have a moral authority on these issues and we should use it.

      <P>This legislation is straightforward and will not take up an excessive amount of my time.  Nevertheless, I wish to raise some points.  This is essentially technical legislation which requires our approval to enable us to continue with our public policy and to meet our international obligations.  In that context my party supports the Bill and will facilitate its early and easy passage through this House.</P>
      <P>Some people may quibble about Ireland's record in overseas development aid.  Indeed there is much one could say in that regard.  I accept the technical point that this Bill does not really deal with that domain.  However, it deals with an area closely related to it.  This Bill reminds me of the curious remark by the Taoiseach this afternoon during Quesion Time when he asked anyone in the House who did not want peace to say so.  The logical equivalent to that is: &ldquo;let anyone who does not want truth, youth, beauty, motherhood, apple pie and money for the International Development Association say so now&rdquo;.  Of course we are for all these things, which are good, right, proper, ethical and moral.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why we agree with this legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer specifically to a point made by Deputy Connor about the reference in the Minister's speech to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the indebtedness of various countries.  I am sure my colleagues will be aware &mdash; the Minister must be &mdash; of a fairly substantial survey on Third World finance published in <i>The Economist</i> of 25 September.  That survey contains some good news and some extremely disturbing news.  The good news is that some of the countries which were locked into a terrible cycle of debt &mdash; the survey describes it as a &ldquo;debtors prison&rdquo;&mdash; have, through relatively sound and conventional economic management techniques, found the key to getting out of that prison.  I am referring in particular to some of the larger Latin American countries which appear to be turning the corner in this respect.  However, there remains a hard core, particularly but not exclusively, of sub-Saharan African countries whose debt problem is so profound that I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us what other countries said about his suggestion at the recent meeting of the World Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put some of the figures given in the survey on the record of the House. For example, in 1991 the level of debt, expressed as a proportion of exports, for Burundi was 758.9 per cent.  This meant that in 1991 the amount of debt redemption being sent out of that country was eight times the value of its exports.  The figures given in the list are disturbing &mdash; for example, the ratio for Ethiopia is 635 per cent; the ratio for Guinea-Bissau is an extraordinary 3,086 per cent and the ratio for Mozambique is 1,287 per cent. A debt problem of that magnitude in terms of inability to pay is so profound that it should be treated with the utmost urgency by the international community. The scale of that debt is so deep and great that those economies do not have the ability to follow the more conventional <Col N="357" /> road which has been trodden with success by many Latin American countries.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the process being set in motion to deal with this problem? No one presumes that one swallow makes a summer or that one speech or one intervention creates a policy on the spot but I should like to know the process now engaging the mind of the World Bank and the IMF in terms of dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>Another point which needs to be made when one is talking about aid &mdash; this point has been well made &mdash; is that much development aid has gone into flagship projects and others which may well do a lot for the ego of some of those promoting them but which do much less for the areas in which they are located.  In that regard it is important in any debate on aid to look at its quantity and quality in terms of spending and its ultimate effect on growth.  A lesson must be learned from the debt crisis of the 1980s, particularly its impact on the Latin American countries. The ability of those countries to attract private capital flows has been a profoundly important qualitative turning point in terms of their capacity to sustain improvements in their economies.</P>
    <P>The three conditions for giving IDA aid are poverty reduction, economic adjustment leading to economic growth and environment protection.  There are layers of potential meaning within those conditions.  Policies which can induce a greater level of private capital inflow are, having surveyed what happened during the past decade, extremely important.  A related issue arises in that context.  I cited some of the statistics of the debt to export ratio of a number of countries as elucidated in a survey on Third World finance in <i>The Economist.</i></P>
    <P>There is also a question to be raised about exports and terms of trade and the degree of market access which the developed world affords, in terms of its ability to trade its way out of trouble, to underdeveloped countries.  In respect of the present GATT Round, which is receiving so much attention, the muscle <Col N="358" /> flexing between the European Community and the United States, the general blocs that operate as between the Cairns group, the United States and the EC, and the Japanese and Eastern interests generally defined in trade bloc terms, the missing partners are some of the very countries we are talking about.  They do not fit into that equation.  It is not that they do not necessarily belong to GATT but they are simply the missing part of the equation in terms of concerns.  We are now, I hope, about to have a successful conclusion to the GATT round but its essential concerns are the concerns of the developed countries.  The missing partners are the poorest of the poor in terms of the trade debate and those missing partners, to use the phrase of <i>The Economist</i> survey, are the ones who remain locked in the debtors' prison.</P>
    <P>This is technical, enabling legislation. My party supports it but it represents merely a drop in the ocean in terms of the nature of the contribution that can be made.  In respect of Ireland's official development assistance record, which is a parallel process, the Minister will be aware that this was an issue that was dear to my heart on more than one occasion when we sought to negotiate improvements and none came about.  I welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to a progressive improvement in the GNP share which we give to overseas development aid.  It is consistent with the medium term multi-annual approach which we had advocated when in Government.  In our engagement with poorer countries, notwithstanding the depth of our unemployment crisis, the problems of recession and the constraints on public expenditure, we need to recognise that we have a profound obligation to set more funds aside over time.  We have a particular contribution to make in the area of people skills because many of the administrations in the recipient countries have deficiencies in that area. In that context, we should be investing much more in administrative terms to increase the level of skills and make people more capable when they draw down the Special Drawing Rights from <Col N="359" /> agencies such as the IDA.  They must obtain the best value for the money they are investing.</P>
    <P>I signalled earlier that we will support this Bill and acknowledge it simply as enabling legislation.  It signals an interest in this House in a more profound discussion on overseas aid policy in general, of which this multilateralism is a related but separate part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and have no objection to the request that all stages should be taken today.</P>
      <P>As we approach the end of the twentieth century one in every five people on this planet &mdash; almost 1,000 million &mdash; continue to live in absolute poverty, while one million children under the age of five die every month in the developing world from hunger, malnutrition and preventable disease.  Approximately 20 children under five die every minute from causes which we in the developed world have developed means to deal with.</P>
      <P>In Africa alone, tens of millions of people face the threat of starvation. When famine is brought under control in one African country, it seems inevitably to strike another.  Disease in Latin America continues to take its terrible toll, largely due to a lack of basic hygiene, health and sanitary facilities.  The poor areas of the developing world bear the brunt of the globe's natural disasters &mdash; flooding in Bangladesh, earthquakes in India, hurricanes in Central America &mdash; and the impact is so catastrophic and remedial measures hampered precisely because of the lack of basic infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Developing countries are crippled also by international debt, the repayments of which divert money from investment in such vital areas as health and education. Tackling issues such as illiteracy and AIDS prevention is made almost impossible in these cases.  Recent figures show that in 95 of the poorest countries, 25 per cent more was spent on servicing international debt than on education and health services combined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Throughout much of the developing world scarce resources are being wasted on ethnic and regional conflicts with arms supplied by the developed world.  There are currently more than 50 civil wars being fought, most &mdash; but not all &mdash; in the developing world.  Undemocratic regimes enslave and exploit their populations while the developed countries turn a blind eye and make fortunes from supplying the weapons used to do just that.  Almost 50 years after the establishment of the United Nations it seems that the gap between the developed and the developing world is widening. Against this dismal background there is a greater need than ever for those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the developed world not only to work to increase the level of development aid but also to ensure that the money and the expertise is used in the most effective way possible.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left welcomes this Bill to provide for the next three-year contribution by this country to the International Development Association, although it must be said that the increased commitment at £13 million represents a very modest increase of just £260,000 over the Ninth Replenishment. It represents an increase of approximately 2 per cent &mdash; well below the current rate of inflation here and, more importantly, very much below the rate of inflation in the beneficiary countries.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association is the &ldquo;soft loan&rdquo; arm of the World Bank.  The mission of the IDA is to distribute to severly impoverised countries &ldquo;no interest&rdquo; loans with extended repayment periods of 30 to 40 years.  Typically, recipient countries have a <i>per capita</i> GNP not exceeding $700 and the focus has been on countries of sub-Saharan Africa and low income Asia. The fund was established to direct attention and provide funds for those countries which cannot afford to borrow from the World Bank's established programmes. The IDA is funded by grant contributions from its member countries and from repayments of past IDA credits.</P>
    <P>It is without doubt a useful source of <Col N="361" /> badly needed long term finance for the developing world, but there are a number of problems associated with the application of IDA funds.  Development agencies such as Trócaire have monitored the funding policies of the World Bank and have been critical of its reluctance to open itself up to independent scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The people living in areas affected by World Bank or IDA-financed projects have little idea in advance of what is being planned for them.  The World Bank has taken some steps to open up the decision-making process but a number of governments continue to exercise a veto over what information will be disseminated. Trocaire claims that governments use this veto to keep their populations uniformed and powerless. On the other hand, the World Bank claims that it engages in government to government activity and thus cannot impose restrictions.  Trócaire contends that this is a specious argument and that the World Bank imposes restrictions and requirements on funding of projects on a regular basis.  We strongly believe that public disclosure to citizens and monitoring groups should be a fundamental requirement of recipient countries. While money provided through the International Development Association is valuable in the longer term, the key to solving the economic problems of the developing countries lies in debt reduction.  As I pointed out earlier, current investment is being crowded out by the overwhelming burden of debt repayments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support for the Trinidad Terms expressed by the Minister of Finance at the recent annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  This matter was raised in advance of that meeting at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, which adopted a motion calling on the Minister to press for the adoption by the International Monetary Fund of the Trinidad terms seeking to write off two-thirds of outstanding debts, the reduction <i>in toto</i> to be applied with immediate effect, the cost of reduction to be additional to existing aid budgets, <Col N="362" /> repayment periods to be extended to 25 years, no interest payments over the first five years, such interest to be added to outstanding capital and, most importantly, that commercial banks be urged to make comparable reductions.  I welcome the fact that the Minister availed of the opportunity presented at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund to advance a strong case &mdash; that is from the reports I read in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; in support of those terms.</P>
    <P>Current negotiations between poor countries and their creditors generally involve writing off 50 per cent of the debt. Clearly that is inadequate, given the appalling debt on the part of many countries that entered into such debt in the seventies.  I urge the Minister to continue to support the call for the implementation of the Trinidad terms and to campaign strongly for this improvement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of the increase in our aid as a proportion of our GNP.  I am on record as warmly welcoming the Government decision to increase that aid on an incremental basis over a given period of years.  However, we remain slow in reaching the recommended UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I calculate that we shall reach approximately half that amount by 1997 on the basis of what the Government proposes.  I do not want that criticism to detract in any way from the fact that I welcome the Government decision to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is another element of this.  Concentration on the financial contribution of this country to developing countries &mdash; either by way of multilateral organisations or bilateral projects which we ourselves undertake through non-governmental organisations &mdash; is mistaken if we ignore the effects trade can have on the well-being of Third World countries.  There is very little connection between our foreign policy stances within the EC and the current GATT negotiations and the effect of those stances on the well-being of Third World countries. Trade is essential if those countries are to establish a worth-while living standard for their people.  Aid alone can be only a <Col N="363" /> means of assisting them over an initial period in establishing a viable economy and infrastructure services such as health, education and sanitary services.  If we do not take a more courageous stance with regard to trade &mdash; in particular opening up the EC in relation to trade &mdash; then no matter how much voluntary money or Government money is spent in aiding those countries, it will be merely like dropping it into a bottomless well.  I realise that adopting a more courageous stance on trade could have a bad effect on home industry.  However, studies have shown that, if the matter is dealt with honestly and assistance given, the net effect can be beneficial to Ireland given our links with the Third World and our record in assisting developments there.</P>
    <P>That is an area that has not yet been debated here to any significant extent.  It is my hope that the sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs will have deliberations on trade at an early date, since that constitutes the answer to many of the problems from which people in the Third World suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister's introductory remarks.  It is timely that this matter should be debated, particularly since Deputies Connor, Gallagher, Noonan and I returned last weekend from a visit to South Africa, where we saw the poverty problem and the need for aid.  The extent of the problem there is not as great as in other areas of Africa.</P>
      <P>With our historical background we are in a better position than most other western countries to understand the social and economic needs of many of these developing countries.  Colonisation and famine have led to many of the problems obtaining in the third world today. Our people have a certain affinity with those in poorer countries who are still experiencing poverty and hunger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who will benefit from the moneys about which we speak are located many thousands of miles from us, living in the most appalling conditions of poverty, hunger, disease and so on, many instances of which are portrayed regularly <Col N="364" /> on our television screens.  Television has been a very positive element in bringing these pictures into our homes each evening, but after some time, one may tend to become almost numb when one becomes used to viewing pictures from the third world and the appalling poverty and hunger that prevail there.  It becomes easy for us to forget, or not fully realise the extent of these problems.  It is only when one visits these countries and sees conditions first hand that one realises how real they are and how important it is for countries like ours and other richer countries to contribute regularly and properly to these third world countries.</P>
    <P>We as a country benefit enormously from EC Structural Funds.  Next week our Government will publish its national plan dealing with the Structural Funds allocated to us.  We all know how difficult it is to properly spend money.  The Government has put much work into ensuring the maximum benefits from that money.  We have the infrastructure and expertise, many good politicians and economists who will see how the money can best be spent, although I have no doubt some members of the Opposition and economists will not agree with the way the money is allocated.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with the way money from abroad is spent.  The money we are talking about today goes to the poorest countries in the world, many of them in sub-Saharan Africa.  In the last debate on this matter Deputy Owen said there was a hole in the bucket.  That sums up the position, and unfortunately the hole is getting bigger and bigger.  One only has to look at the Oxfam report received by members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to realise that this is so. That report refers to the debt crisis in Africa and states:</P>
    <P>Without economic recovery more than 300 million people, half the region's population, will be living in poverty by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Infant mortality rates in Africa are the highest in the world.  The region spends four times more on debt servicing than it does on the health of its <Col N="365" /> citizens.</P>
    <P>UNICEF estimates that economic recession now claims the lives of 10,000 African children per day.</P>
    <P>Between 1980 and 1992, sub-Saharan Africa's debt more than tripled to over $183 billion.</P>
    <P>Despite its abject poverty, desperate shortages of foreign exchange and low investment, Africa disbursed $81.6 billion in debt payments between 1985 and 1992 alone.</P>
    <P>This crushing debt burden now drains the region of over £10 billion annually.</P>
    <P>Repayment of debt and interest on debt is draining the region of almost a quarter of its income from exports which should be invested in recovery and meeting basic human needs. Investment in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by 9% for the last 10 years.</P>
    <P>Between 1983 and 1990, the IMF received a net transfer of over $3 billion from Africa as net repayments from the region outstripped new loans. In practice, this means that development aid provided by Western governments is being diverted from investment in recovery in Africa to repayment of IMF loans.</P>
    <P>A representative from Oxfam asked that the Minister, at the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF, support the Trinidad terms.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on doing that, as he clearly outlined in his speech. Though that was a small step, it was very important.  I have no doubt the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will discuss this matter and we will be glad of the Minister's contribution.</P>
    <P>We must get our priorities right.  We are using this money to try to eliminate much of the poverty and problems in these countries.  Unfortunately many of the conditions set down have led only to cutbacks in areas such as health and education.  There is a vicious circle of poverty and debt and the problem is not being tackled.  That is why the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs believes the Trinidad terms are very important.  There must be a major write-off of much of the <Col N="366" /> debt in order to get these countries back on an even keel.  The money they receive and the money they earn from exports should be put into basic essentials so that they can build up their economies.  As Deputy Cox said, it is important that they get private funding.  If private funding is not available, as is the case in a number of Latin American countries, it is pointless throwing money at these countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor mentioned the problem of children.  I will not repeat what he said but the report he mentioned makes very depressing reading.  The article in <i>The Economist</i> quoted by Deputy Cox states that many private agencies believe that only 10 per cent of aid goes directly to the poor, to areas such as health care, literacy, clean water and family planning. Earlier in the year when I visited Malawi to monitor the referendum there was great concern among many people there that some countries were considering linking compulsory family planning with overseas aid.  That would be a very dangerous step.  Though it may seem a logical thing to do, there would be great reaction to it by many countries.  If people wish to use family planning methods they should be educated to do so, but it should not be compulsory.</P>
    <P>Another area that should be considered is the environment.  In many countries there is a vicious circle whereby forests are cut down and used as firewood to cook food, thereby causing erosion and huge environmental problems.</P>
    <P>Everybody supports the commitment to give aid to the poor.  However, as stated in <i>The Economist</i> and the Oxfam Report, one recent World Bank loan to Mozambique, classed as poverty targeted, went to a foreign multinational for a project to grow cotton, for which it would be the monopoly buyer.  The price it pays, say local Oxfam staff, is half that paid elsewhere.  That is the wrong way to go about granting aid because it does not benefit the local economy.  Unfortunately most aid is linked to purchases.  An Oxfam report states that only five of the top donors link less than 50 per cent of their aid to purchases &mdash; in France the figure is 60 per cent; in Britain, 75 per <Col N="367" /> cent and in Italy, 90 per cent.  Virtually all of the food aid from America comes from the American farm surplus.  This limits the buyer's choice and hampers local skills, rendering the operation inefficient. In the long term it makes no impact on the problem of these countries.</P>
    <P>When I visited Malawi many people commented on the fact that there are so many consultants from rich countries &mdash; about 100,000 in all &mdash; carrying out work, much of which could be easily done by Africans themselves.  That is a matter that should be considered.</P>
    <P>The problems in these countries will not go away.  If the Trinidad terms are implemented it will be a step towards breaking the vicious circle, but it will be only a start.  When the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is set up and the chairperson appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My vote is vital.  We should consider our overseas development programme to ensure more efficient spending of our money and that of other countries.  Other Deputies who visited South Africa recently will agree that it has experienced huge problems and is at a crossroads.  We are cautiously optimistic that the right decisions will be made and that South Africa will be a multi-racial democracy in the not too distant future. It is very important that they get help from outside to ensure that it works properly because the economic spin-off to other countries &mdash; Angola, Mozambique etc. &mdash; near South Africa would be enormous. If South Africa can work, many of the problems in that region can be tackled on a sound footing.  It is very important that South Africa gets off to a good start and that the economy is moving, thus creating an enormous spin-off in the rest of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Obviously, like everybody else, I am sure the Minister and members of the Government would <Col N="368" /> like to see an even greater contribution being made.  However, it is an increased contribution and in excess of what was requested.  It will be welcomed by people living in atrocious conditions in many parts of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members of the House, Sir, I welcome this Bill.  I am glad we are making provision of this kind.  I had the pleasure of introducing a similar Bill but on that occasion I worried &mdash; and again today I worry &mdash; that we do not ask ourselves what lies behind this Bill. Deputy Connor and, indeed, others made the point that it is regrettable that our overall contribution to the international development effort is so small. There is more than that, I wonder if contributions of this kind &mdash; valuable as they are &mdash; do not represent conscience money on our part and if the making of provisions such as this is not a convenient way for us to overlook the deeper problems that lie behind what Deputies have been talking about.  I do not think we give enough consideration to what lies behind all this.  Do we ever ask ourselves what we want the IDA to do with this money?  Do we ever ask ourselves if what the IDA is doing with it is appropriate for the purposes we have in mind?  Deputy Ryan raised the question as to whether we are sure the money is spent properly. That is a perfectly fair question in the frame-work in which the IDA carries out its activities, but we should ask ourselves if the framework in which this money is spent is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go back to what the Minister said to see if there is some guide for his thinking.  The Minister pointed out that the IDA's lending programmes are, primarily, aimed at providing resources for investment projects that are not only essential for the economic and social development of the borrowing country, but also technically and economically sound.  That is a perfectly sensible, sane and orthodox approach to the problem but should we not ask ourselves more often, Sir, if we are not imposing or sustaining a model of economic development or even a model of social <Col N="369" /> development that is totally unsuitable for the countries to which we are directing this aid?  In a real sense are we helping them to make the same mistakes in the economic, social and environment spheres that we made?  Surely we should realise that the western world made a great many mistakes in the models of development chosen.  We should ask ourselves occasionally whether it is just or proper to impose these on the rest of the world.  Before any Members of the House take comfort from hearing me criticise the record of capitalist governments in how they approach aid, the record of what used to pass for socialism is ten times worse.</P>
    <P>I was looking for an illustration of the worry I have and I remembered coming across a very neat illustration in a very worrying and extremely well written book entitled <i>The End of Nature</i> by Bill McKibben, of whom Members of the House may have heard.  He made this reflection &mdash; I quote from page 186 of the book:</P>
    <P>On the one hand, it is inconceivable &mdash; at least, this side of some genetically engineering cornucopia &mdash; that the peoples of the developing world can ever enjoy a standard of living like ours; there is simply not enough plastic and copper and so on to go round.  If, by 2025, energy consumption in every country reached the current levels in the industrialised countries, it would mean a load five and a half times as big as the present one, which is already environmentally unsupportable.  On the other hand, it is politically &mdash; and humanly &mdash; impossible to say that the poor should be condemned to live without while we live with.</P>
    <P>In that simple thought there is a whole problem of the model of development we are pursuing.  There are abundant examples of it.  We talk about the successful economies of South East Asia to which some Members of this House have travelled fairly widely, and I regret to say more widely than I have.</P>
    <P>Singapore is an extremely good example, in a very small area which is <Col N="370" /> densely populated, of a rapidly rising standard of living.  All those people want to attain the same kind of living standards and style that we in the western world have put up as their model.  They want more cars, television sets, washing machines, air conditioning systems and so on.  The same is happening in Taiwan and throughout Malasia.  This model has been well established in Japan and in the People's Republic of China it is becoming the objective.  They want to start doing the kinds of things we have been doing. They want to pollute their environment in the same way we pollute our environment. They want to ruin existing social structures in the same way that we have ruined so many here and so on.  They want to put the same kind of pressures &mdash; demographically, socially and physically &mdash; on their populations as we have put on the western world.  We have some impossible romantics who want to go away from that.  They do not want to hear of moving away from it until they have seen and experienced the problems for themselves.  We are imposing that kind of model of development on other parts of the world when we do not have the slightest doubt that we ourselves have gone too far and have done the wrong thing.  Should we not think more often not about the amount of aid we give but about the systems we expect this aid to encourage and develop?  The Minister went on to say that IDA lending is generally concentrated in the poorer, densely populated, countries of Asia and the least developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa.  That is true.  I wonder if we should congratulate ourselves on what we have done there or warn ourselves of the consequences of carrying on with the model we have adopted.  The Minister gave a list of the beneficiary countries of aid such as China and India.  I do not know if Deputies in the House read much of what is produced by the Chinese Government and sent to some of us here by the Chinese Embassy.  In both China and India there are major investment projects &mdash; some of which, for all I know, may be helped by the IDA &mdash; designed not simply to build dams to harness major <Col N="371" /> rivers but to rechannel major rivers, to change their course very substantially over a huge part of their length, to make a major change in the topography and the basic water engineering of whole river systems without any guarantee of the results either in physical terms or in terms of the fertility of the land around them, without reckoning the costs of social disruption and without looking at the costs imposed on society in those areas.  A fight-back is beginning in some areas. They are doing those things because they see major projects of that kind as being the flagship projects of other countries that they should imitate or the kind of projects in which international development agencies encourage them to become involved.</P>
    <P>In Bangladesh we see the causes of one of the major problems.  The forests in that country are being removed, causing soil erosion.  There is major flooding which gives rise to poverty.  Poverty gives rise to people wanting more and more logging to take place so that they can be employed.  The whole cycle starts again. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people are killed in periodic flash floods. Hundreds of thousands of others live in poverty and suffer from disease.  One very much fears that the same pattern will be repeated over huge parts of the South American continent where this habit is very well rooted.</P>
    <P>In sub-Saharan Africa, another area to which IDA money goes, the raising of staple foods in many countries is replaced by a mono culture cash crop in order to provide the funds needed for the kinds of developments in our countries which they wish to imitate, as well as to pay the interest on the debt they have already incurred in the development process. Mono culture gives rise to poverty, to unemployment and to the disappearance of the traditional ways of growing the staple food crops.  This gives rise to the vicious circle of unemployment and dependence on mono cultures.  The rest of the world gaily carries on with a GATT <Col N="372" /> agreement which, if it pays any attention at all to the interests of the developing countries, does so only in terms of footnotes and pious aspirations.  In the current GATT agreement there is not a single feature that will have any real benefit for the people who live in poverty and deprivation in sub-Saharan Africa, except an argument, as yet unresolved, about textiles.  That is the only part of that agreement that could have any direct bearing on the interests of development, by which I mean proper social and economic development of the indigenous peoples of the countries we are supposed to be helping by passing this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not ask ourselves often enough what effects our development models will have.  Neither do we ask ourselves if it is just on our part to impose the same prejudices and the same models, with which we are becoming disenchanted, on the people of those countries.  Quite apart from the destruction of the rain forests, the other main problem in South America is that every so often somebody finds a new deposit of valuable minerals in the interior of Brazil.  That is another turn of the screw for the destruction of populations and the replication of the problems that we spend much of our parliamentary time talking about: how to deal with poverty, with unemployment and emigration.  I have to say that even when Governments get around to thinking about these problems there is not a great deal at evidence that they give them serious thought.</P>
    <P>In June of last year, we debated the Estimate for the Department of the Environment and I took the opportunity to peruse what had emerged from the UN conference in Rio de Janeiro on the environment and development where surely the interests of developing countries should have been taken into account.  Some of the resolution passed at that conference look very nice and fit in with some of the objectives the Minister mentioned in his speech today, but I wonder about the reality of it.  The Minister referred to the three main objectives that the IDA would focus on.  The first was poverty reduction; but as I see it <Col N="373" /> there is not very much in the system that will do a great deal for poverty reduction.  There is a great deal in the system that will widen poverty.  The second was economic adjustment and growth, but the Rio conference failed to say anything meaningful about the democratic dimension of economic adjustment and growth and I am very much afraid that in this country, if nowhere else, we will be treated to treatises on the &ldquo;Splendour of the Truth&rdquo;, oblivious of the fact that in very many countries of the world the splendour of the truth is very much dimmed by the horror of poverty.  We failed to address this issue at Rio.  However, an item in the Declaration states:</P>
    <P>States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more about demography but there will be plenty of opportunities for Members to discuss it.  I do not see the IDA doing anything in a concerted way to reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of production.  I am not saying that to criticise in any way the Minister or the efforts that are being made but simply to point out the poverty of thought on the real needs of developing countries.  I do not think we should impose our mistakes on them.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Declaration states:</P>
    <P>States shall co-operate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earth's ECO system.  Developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  It is the interests of companies from developed countries participating in the process of development that lead to the worst excesses and effects on the environment and eco systems of the developing countries.  Which technologies place the greatest pressure on the resources of those countries?  The <Col N="374" /> answer is technologies that come from the donor countries of the IDA.  Where do the financial resources come from which give rise to that kind of exploitation of the environment and of resources of those countries?  They come from the same countries that are now contributing to the replenishment of the IDA.  I do not see any consistency in policy.</P>
    <P>From time to time we should ask ourselves sharply what we are doing through IDA systems.  I am delighted to see the Trinidad principles being applied to the repayment of debt and the effort being made to ensure that the burden is not too heavy in the short term on these countries, but all of that is partly beside the point and some of it is a direct result of the fact that we have not given enough consideration to model of development we are pursuing in those countries.  I do not know how it will be done but I would like to see at some stage &mdash; perhaps at the next annual general meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund &mdash; some proper consideration being given to how those financial instruments which we clearly need to help in the development effort can be squared with the kinds of ambitions set out in the the Declarations, empty as they have been proved to be, of the Rio conference. I hope we will see some real consideration given to the kind of development effort which will maintain the integrity of societies and populations in developing countries while giving them the opportunity to develop in accordance with a model that is sustainable for the whole world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i>: The debate has been useful not only in addressing the Bill before us but in opening up the area of development co-operation to scrutiny.  When we get the subcommittees off the ground, we hope to be able to address in more detail many of the issues that have been quite correctly raised this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that we examine the model of development proposed &mdash; and imposed at times &mdash; for developing <Col N="375" /> countries through the various agencies. Development is about growth plus change.  Growth may be quantitative but change is about values and we must be clear about the values we hold in supporting such agencies.  There is a risk that we could end up saying to developing countries that they should do as we say, but not as we do.  We may be well aware of the shortcomings of our own model of development, but we run the risk of becoming colonialist or imperialist in another sense if we say to developing countries that they cannot follow the path of development we followed.  We need to provide a means by which developing countries can clarify what they want to achieve through the development process and use agencies, such as the World Bank and the International Development Association, to facilitate them in that regard rather than imposing on them a model of development we consider correct.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and the further evidence of this Government's determination to improve Ireland's contribution to overseas development by working in a planned way towards achieving the United Nations targets.  I welcome the fact that previous speakers drew the Minister's attention to the continuing role of the international banking and finance agencies, especially the IMF, in perpetuating the debt crisis in developing countries, particularly in Africa.  We have seen the damage that such structural adjustment programmes have done in many African countries.  Indeed, the econmomic orthodoxy which dictated that shock therapy needed to be applied to developing economies caused serious social, economic and political casualties not only in the so-called Third World but also, as we have seen more recently, in the countries which are in transition from the former Soviet block.  I noted with interest the reluctant admission by Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday last that the policies which we in the Western World are expecting the former Soviet bloc countries to implement so quickly may be <Col N="376" /> causing and contributing to the erosion of what little democracy was starting to emerge in those countries.  It is interesting to note that there was tacit agreement that the transition needed to be carried out in a much more gradual way, taking account of the position from which people in those countries are starting rather than looking, in the first instance, at the end or object of development.  I welcome the Government's support of the Trinidad terms and ask the Minister to continue to use the voice of Ireland in the international arena to oppose any reinforcement of the debt crisis and to promote a form of development suitable to the conditions, resources and potential of each country.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association, as an affiliate of the World Bank, is subject to the overall criticisms of that bank expressed by non-governmental agencies both here and elsewhere. It has been stated that the World Bank is not willing to open up sufficiently to independent scrutiny and I urge the Minister to press for greater accountability and transparency in its operations. A more important issue which needs to be addressed is the fact that in many cases World Bank activities in developing countries reinforce anti-democratic forces within those countries.  In many cases they have assisted in keeping despots in power.  Lending by the World Bank to Third World countries for infrastructural projects such as dams, roadways, electricity and water supply and so on must be infused also by a valued approach with the condition that measures towards democratisation and the creation of a civil society are implemented.  In many instances we have seen the Government's of recipient countries continuing to exercise a veto on projects, not allowing citizens to have a say in the planning, implementation or evaluation of the projects imposed through World Bank operations.  The sad fact is that a large number of unrepresentative Third World governments continue to use their veto to keep their populations uninformed and not empowered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> It is necessary that agencies such as the World Bank take greater account of the role of non-governmental agencies, not alone in creating economic development but in promoting social and democratic development.  Deputies Connor and Ryan referred to the visit by Members of this House to South Africa last week where we discovered the EC is contributing to many non-governmental organisations in helping to bring about democracy in those countries.  People in those countries fear that when a legitimate government is put in place the aid which has come from non-governmental organisations and contributed towards the democratisation of the country may be switched to governmental agencies, with the result that many of the agents of development and democratisation may be taken out of the picture.</P>
    <P>Many non-governmental organisations have acknowledged that the IDA in recent years has used its funding to support democratisation and a civil society in, for example, Central America.  It has also shown a greater willingness to work through the auspices of non-governmental organisations.  However, I would ask the Minister to continue to keep a close eye on a number of issues in our dealings with, and participation in, the International Development Association which relate to the policy objectives of intervention.  The World Bank should ensure that there is clear public participation in the use of IDA resources involving local communities so that the people of those communities can have a say in decisions and ivestments which affect their areas, their interests and the interests of their children.  I am not satisfied that the overt decision by the IDA to include poverty reduction as one of its objectives in its next round of operations is sufficiently strong.  We will be aware that is happening only if there is a shift in the pattern of lending to governments committed to and active in reducing policy.  The area of environmental protection and avoiding environmental degradation needs to be examined closely.  I am not talking about high level schemes, but about basics such as protecting <Col N="378" /> the water supply which is the foundation of development in many underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>We have an important role to play.  We understand at first hand the results of colonial exploitation.  We know the difficulties involved in trying to build and develop a country.  We remain underdeveloped in EC terms, as is evident by the massive support given to us in the form of EC Structural And Cohesion Funds.  Because of that experience we should have a greater understanding of the difficulties encountered by developing countries and we should use all our efforts in international fora to support such countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill, in particular because it will provide money to alleviate the burden of debt with which many developed countries are struggling. Money is badly needed to alleviate the debt problem in those countries.  The resources which should be used to sustain development have been drained to repay loans.  However, we should not get carried away by the significance of Ireland's contribution, a potential £13 million.  We should reflect on the fact that in 1990 the extent of the debt in poor countries amounted to $1.3 trillion.  That puts the matter in clear perspective; what we are contributing is a mere drop in the ocean. Nonetheless, a figure of £13 million is significant when one considers the use it could be put to here.</P>
      <P>The significance of the problems in the developing countries was outlined by a number of previous speakers. Approximately 1.2 billion or a quarter of the population of the developing countries live in absolute poverty on incomes of less than $370.  It is expected that this dreadful figure will increase.  Approximately 13 to 18 million people, mainly children, die of hunger or hunger related conditions.  There are approximately 0.5 billion people chronically undernourished in the world at present and that figure is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the policy which underlined most of the aid contributed by western <Col N="379" /> countries was clearly influenced by considerations which related to the sustaining and boosting of the interests of those countries involved in the cold war. The cold war is over and that has clear implications in relation to the development of new policies relating to the post-cold war conditions which now pertain. It is very important that Ireland should try to contribute to the development of these new policies because it offers a considerable level of new opportunities for us to develop and influence concepts in a way which would not have been possible if the cold war had continued.</P>
    <P>I recently had the honour and privilege, with Deputy Connor and a number of other Members of this House, to attend a conference in Bonn where some of these issues were discussed.  The conference concluded with the Bonn declaration which spoke in terms of conflicts relating to human security.  It spoke in terms of relating these problems to a global level and put forward the idea that it is no longer possible or feasible to look at problems which now face the world in the context of a developed segment of the globe and an underdeveloped segment. Problems such as environmental degradation, ethnic conflicts, population growth, AIDS and other diseases, will not be limited or mainly centred in underdeveloped countries.  They are global problems; they develop in one place and then spread to developed countries.  For example, AIDS is believed to have originated in Africa, although some microbiologists and medical people might put forward arguments about that.  It is now a major problem in western society.  This is clearly related to the fact that its development in Africa was totally without control for a long time.  Western society remained indifferent to the problems of Africa and it is now experiencing its own terrible problems as a result.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should try as a country to contribute to the formulation of new concepts which are relevant to the realities of the post-cold war situation.  It is also very important that we begin to broaden our attitudes to development <Col N="380" /> and consider matters which relate to trade and the sharing and transfer of technology. That has happened to some extent but, as some of the earlier speakers said, there will also be serious considerations regarding sacrifices which will be necessary if we are to broaden those concepts to allow the Third World to develop.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned that many of the programmes in the past were not very successful.  We just gave money which went into the system and we had very little say in how that money should be used.  It is appropriate that we should have more strings attached to the aid that we give and become much more vigorous in the extent to which we question the uses to which the aid is put.  It is important that we have our say in the various international agencies in which we take part in relation to looking for far greater control of the way the money is spent.  It is also necessary to recognise that there are limits to the control we can exercise on the use of the money because when we are dealing with tinpot dictators, juntas and despots we face terrible dilemmas. On the one hand we can adopt a stance of giving them nothing which, in many ways, would make the position of the unfortunate people even worse.  Alternatively we give them money and they abuse it to boost their own egos or to build up military machines which have no function whatsoever in relation to development.  They use it to build up status projects &mdash; big dams, high technology which is totally inappropriate and unsuitable and only relevant to a very small number of people there.  The money would be used much better if it was spend on low grade technology and getting the basics right.  Nonetheless when one tries to address the difficulties when giving money, the answers are perhaps not as easy as many of us would like to feel.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I refer to the amount of aid given by this country.  In many ways Ireland is in a curious position in that regard.  Many European countries are puzzled by the attitudes we took over the years.  They are puzzled by the fact that <Col N="381" /> we have given such a small proportion of our gross domestic product to aid while at the same time the Irish public are very generous.  They are puzzled by the fact that we are, as Deputy Connor said, second last on the OECD league table and yet a very large number of Irish aid workers are in Third World countries.  In recent times, as far as the European and the developed countries are concerned, we have become even more puzzling because we took a decision, which we all welcomed, to increase our contribution to aid.  We are doing that in the context of a world where most developing countries are either stalling on the amount of money they give or decreasing it.  We have laid down a programme whereby the amount we given will continue to increase for a considerable period.  In this matter at least this country is truly counter cyclical.  The position which has been agreed by all sides of the House is to be very much welcomed.  We are setting a good example in this regard to our international colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is immensely important although it seems a very minor piece of legislation.  Its implications are considerable.  Members who have spoken have been extremely concerned and pertinent. It is an area which should concern every Deputy and the public.  We are a more concerned race than any other race in the world regarding aid for underdeveloped countries.  We have that missionary zeal, the willingness to help the less fortunate.  I presume that is because of our historical background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very sad when I travel abroad to see the deprivation and poverty in what should be relatively wealthy countries. I reflect on how well off we are in this country in comparison, although from our day to day experiences with the public one might not think so.  We are one of the top 30 countries in the world as far as standards of living are concerned. The figure of £6.5 billion per year which the Minister mentioned in his statement today may sound quite significant <Col N="382" /> but it entails spending in 70 countries.</P>
    <P>If £6.5 billion is divided among 70 countries, each country receives an amount somewhat less than £100 million. Some of these countries are quite large with far greater populations than Ireland. The Minister mentioned China, which has a population in the region of 1,100 million people.  Over a four year period, we will receive £8 billion from the European Community in Structural Funds which is approximately $12 billion dollars. The comparison is stark as our assistance from the EC is significantly greater than the small amount which these people are getting.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago, when the Iron Curtain came down and there was a programme of democratisation in central and eastern Europe, we assumed there would be extra money available for aid of this kind because the nuclear race and the arms programmes would be scaled down, if not abandoned.  Unfortunately, we have not seen the effects of the additional money which should have accrued to the economies of all the countries concerned, particularly the principal countries.</P>
    <P>If the arms and nuclear programmes have been dismantled and there is extra money, where has it gone?  Why have these underdeveloped, poverty stricken countries not benefited to a significant degree?  If the money has been available &mdash; and I doubt if it is &mdash; we have seen no evidence of it.  The arms programmes have been scaled down to some degree. Why have we not seen any material benefit as a result?</P>
    <P>I noticed a most disturbing development during the last week.  Not only are some of the countries included in the 70 supported by the International Development Association not spending money to help the underprivileged and the poor, they are enlarging their arsenals and increasing armament activities.  I refer specifically to the nuclear testing carried out this week in China, one of the countries listed here as being eligible for assistance.</P>
    <P>Despite the fall of the Iron Curtain, <Col N="383" /> North Korea has a proliferation of armaments and has continued developing the atomic bomb.  How can these people be allowed do this without action on the part of the United Nations?  The United Nations acts in conjunction with the World Bank to which this association is affiliated.  There should be co-ordination but it does not seem to exist.  There seems to be a rollover year after year.  In the current year we are rolling over the contribution of £13 million from last year, as we did in previous years.  I do not know how far back this goes.</P>
    <P>There should be a co-ordinated programme to ensure that every country is doing its best to assist starving and underprivileged people.  Assistance cannot be given in isolation.  It must be ensured that spending money on nuclear programmes and the developments of last week do not take place side by side as one defeats the purpose of the other.  I hope the Minister takes this on board.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced the Bill but the Minister for Foreign Affairs should also be involved because the two areas cannot be separated.  I do not intend any offence to the Minister; I think he understands the point I am making.  We are talking about international co-operation and action by the United Nations to deal with people who are spending money on mechanisms of destruction and death.  These people are promoting destruction and causing untold misery, they spend money on developing weapons while people in their country are starving.  This is taking place in a considerable number of countries.</P>
    <P>Currently 70 countries are aided under the scheme and the number will increase; more and more countries will be seeking aid from the International Development Association.  The collapse of communism, while it filled people with joy, resulted in a serious drop in living standards in those countries in central and eastern Europe.  In future we will not just be concerned with Asian and African countries, we will also be speaking of countries in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>I visited some of these countries <Col N="384" /> recently and saw incredible poverty; living standards have dropped considerably. I wonder if we have fully considered the impact of the collapse of communism.  It has not led to a rise in living standards as we thought it would; it has resulted in a serious drop in living standards.  Countries which could have been classified as Second World countries &mdash; for want of a better description&mdash; have now very definitely become Third World countries.  This is a need for an expansion in the number of countries deserving aid. It is a sad story.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an analysis of the problem.  As I said at the outset, if the Irish do not do it, other countries will not do it because we give the lead in the area of humanitarian activities.  If we cannot carry out a study to find out why there has been a collapse in living standards, nobody else will do it.  We should be one of the countries most involved in doing that study.</P>
    <P>I travelled to Romania twice recently and I was appalled to see the poverty in a country which is potentially very rich. It has the finest land in Europe and significant oil resources.  Since Ceausescu was deposed, the collapse of the communist system and the replacement of it by a democratic system of sorts, the standard of living in that country has decreased and the situation is much worse than it was four or five years ago. This is also the case in Hungary.  They say they are glad to have democracy but that they are far worse off than under communism.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that the list of 70 countries in need of aid from the International Development Association will increase.  I would like to see a study carried out as to the underlying reasons standards of living have droppped so much.  A debate such as this should not take place in isolation year in, year out. We are entitled to a deeper study resulting in a greater understanding of the problems involved because nobody &mdash; and I have asked a number of highly placed individuals in Europe and at home &mdash; has been able to give me a logical explanation as to why living standards <Col N="385" /> collapsed when democracy took over from communism.  I, more than most Members of this House, berated the communist system for many years.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem and it is no longer confined to Africa, Asia and parts of the Middle East: it is in places much nearer to home.  There is a strong possibility that the terrible war in Yugoslavia will be repeated in other countries in central and eastern Europe because people are poverty stricken, they will look for scapegoats and there will be strife.  Such an occurrence will cause pain and will probably affect us considerably as time goes on.  The problem is not confined to the three continents of the Americas, Africa and Asia; Europe itself has a major problem which is growing daily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs made a proposal to increase, over a committed period, our official contribution towards development needs in the poorer regions of the world.  No matter what our constraints are, the amount of money we officially contribute to alleviate world hunger is relatively small and we should work towards the agreed UN target over a fixed period and stick to that.  Regardless of what cuts are made in the future this is one area &mdash; world hunger and world development &mdash; where we should try to meet the commitment and pursue the target relentlessly.  I am at one with the Government in that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In various agencies, particularly in the United Nations, much money is spent on administration.  This gives rise to the conviction on the part of many observers that it is spent lavishly and unnecessarily on a bureaucracy which flatters itself by the salaries it awards its members.  We regularly refer to the salaries the EC Commissioners receive but in the higher echelons of some of these organisations the salaries officials pay themselves are quite extraordinary.  In United Nations' organisations in particular, there does not appear to be a structure on the part of Governments &mdash; let alone Parliaments <Col N="386" />&mdash; to oversee the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of the administration of these funds.</P>
    <P>Somehow that issue must be put on the agenda.  We must say to the people who have become fat cats in these organisations &mdash; which are supposed to be humanitarian &mdash; that the organisations were not created to provide them with large salaries, pensions and first class travel around the world.  I read with shock recently that some officials in UN offices had been paid very large salaries although they did no work.  Some people had not even gone to their desks for periods of time.  I do not know whether this was due to people competing with each other for job status or for some other reason but it is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the money we vote for organisations like this is used by them to benefit the people for whom it was intended and not used in administration. Now that can happen in any administration &mdash; it does not matter who is in Government &mdash; unless Parliament constantly prods the Government of the day who in turn, constantly prods the bureaucracy.  We must be constantly vigilant in that regard.  When such prodding takes place at one, two or three removes through the United Nations and other such organisations, I do not believe for one minute that there is a value for money audit, based on efficiency, economy and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>What is a value for money audit?  Take a polio vaccination scheme and apply the three Es: economy is buying the unit of vaccine at the lowest price consistent with quality; there is efficiency if that unit contains three shots and effectiveness is achieved when the incidence of polio is reduced.  Similarly in relation to these development funds we should ask whether we get economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  Do we provide the structures to reduce poverty or for people to develop or to feed themselves?  Does the money get through to the people who need it?  There is a conviction among many people that much of this money is <Col N="387" /> consumed in overheads and administration.</P>
    <P>We are voting an amount of £13 million &mdash; a relatively small amount of money given the annual budget but we will vote other moneys under other headings &mdash; and we have given a commitment, which I welcome, to increase our contribution. I strongly support the Government's policy on this and there is a proposal to draw up a plan to increase our contribution. My concern is not just about our contribution, it also relates to the contributions of other governments, that the contributions get through to their intended recipients.  In that regard some of the larger organisations are out of control and somehow the Minister, at meetings of the World Bank or other international agencies, must put that on the agenda.  You may say that ours is a small country and that making this point will not have an effect but it will because if other Ministers hear our Minister saying it, they may say that the same comment was made in their parliaments and something may be done to redress the problem.</P>
    <P>If we vote £13 million for international development associations we want it to get to its intended destination.  I hope the Minister finds an opportunity to raise this point to ensure that the moneys do not go to financing expense accounts for overpaid bureaucrats in the United Nations or other major organisations.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation for the constructive debate this afternoon.  It reflects the view of the House that we must continue to contribute to developing countries.  A number of Deputies made comments or asked questions which I will endeavour to answer in the time allotted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Connor, Cox and Ryan raised questions about the Third World debt crisis and I share many of their concerns. I am particularly concerned about the most recent statement by Oxfam that the burden of debt carried by the poorest countries is a major impediment to <Col N="388" /> growth and prevents them undertaking programmes of policy initiatives to sustain their development.  I am also conscious that the structural adjustment programmes which many developing countries have undertaken often entail severe hardship.  We have constantly argued, as a member of international financial institutions, that the poorest sectors of society must be protected from the harsh economic and social impact of adjustment programmes.  We made that point strongly in Washington at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF last week when we called for a debt relief package for the poorest regions in line with the Trinidad terms. This proposal calls for the write-off of debt of low income developing countries.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions raised by Deputies Connor and Cox, my view was shared by other governors, particularly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer who, with the UK Government, has taken an interest in this matter.  The World Bank is a large institution involving 200 countries. We followed the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are in line with views expressed by Deputies earlier, and put forward a strong case at the annual meetings.  We are in a good position to make such a strong case because of our historical position and, in spite of Ireland being a small country, a large number of Irish people are involved in frontline relief agencies in all parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor spoke at length of his recent visit to and knowledge of Africa. I had an opportunity recently to meet some of the people involved in relief work in Kenya, the number of Irish people involved in so many centres is impressive.  However, the problem remains that much of the debt is outside the remit of the World Bank.  Much of the money is owed to governments and commercial banks and I hope this issue will be addressed this year given the dire straits in which these countries find themselves. I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking to the managing director of the IMF, Mr. Camdessus at some length at the annual meeting and I know he shares <Col N="389" /> the view that the debt relief, in some cases, must be up to 75 per cent.  As a number of Deputies stated a successful Uruguay Round is essential to the developing world.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the appalling conditions in the Third World, I share their concerns as the statistics are staggering. Sometimes, the cruel human daily reality facing those living in the poorest countries of the world is premature death, ill health, illiteracy, hunger and living in a degraded environment.  Last week the briefing notes I studied before attending the World Bank sessions revealed how appalling those conditions are.  Deputy Deasy gave us an insight into the position in Romania.  When one reads of such appalling conditions in so many countries one would almost believe that we live in Utopia.  Given the reality and the growing population in the world, the fight against poverty is a global responsibility. To help achieve this goal a suitable vehicle is needed in which to channel assistance to the poor.  The International Development Association of the World Bank is such a vehicle, it mobilises support from the richer countries and uses the financial contributions, including our own, to alleviate the plight of the poor. In regard to IDA Ten, IDA can lend £18 billion to the poorest countries to deal with some of their problems.  I agree it is not enough, but it is a significant sum and the provision of such funds is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputies Eoin Ryan and Connor raised concerns about the plight of people living in the areas of sub-Saharan Africa about which I spoke at some length at the World Bank annual meeting.  Those concerns are well founded and reflect our traditional strong ties with this area.  It should be noted that in the course of negotiations for the replenishment of the IDA's funds, it was agreed that resources allocated to areas of sub-Saharan Africa would be maintained at approximately 45 per cent to 50 per cent of the total.  I will continue to voice our national concern as expressed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs about the <Col N="390" /> plight of those living in that region of Africa.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked about Ireland's ODA proposals, this is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government, our ODA target of 0.2 per cent of GNP for 1993 was achieved, which represents a significant real increase on the 1992 figure of 0.16 per cent of GNP, which is approximately £28 million.  It is our intention to maintain steady progress in the years ahead towards the UN goal of contributing 0.7 per cent of GNP to ODA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor asked about the proposed contribution to the IDA, it will be regarded as part of the ODA contribution. The increased resources made available to Ireland's aid programme will enable us to launch new programmes in the poor countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Such programmes will be targeted at the poorest districts and regions, including urban areas.  High priority will be given to meeting the basic needs of providing education, health, water and sanitation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Connor and De Rossa referred to the closed nature of the bank and its failure to make various documents public.  I am aware that the bank's current directive on disclosure of information stated that there is a presumption in favour of disclosure outside and within the bank in the absence of a compelling reason not to disclose information.  I am aware the bank recognises and supports the fundamental importance of accountability and transparency in the development process.  Deputy Gay Mitchell made this point about organisations generally, but it is a point we will take up in the future.  The bank should be more open, release bank documents and encourage borrower governments to release as much information as possible on bank projects and programmes to facilitate increased local participation in decision making.  The bank has sought external comments on its work in the belief that outside views help to improve the quality of the bank's products.</P>
    <P>The directive on disclosure of information was endorsed by the board of <Col N="391" /> directors in 1989.  It states that it is the bank's policy to be open about its activities and to seek opportunities to explain its work to the widest possible audience. We must also bear in mind that the bank's relationship of trust with its borrowers rests on the institution's ability to maintain the confidentiality of certain types of information and I am sure Deputies respect that position.  There are also practical reasons access to the bank's documents cannot be unlimited.  The bank put forward the argument that no institution could conduct its business if every draft and document are released, but it favours as much openness as possible and I will relay the views of this House on that matter at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Connor and Dukes that local participation should be increased and Deputy Eoin Ryan referred to employing local consultants instead of not always relying on experts from industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made an interesting contribution about development and the model followed by the World Bank. Deputy Gallagher also made a similar point.  No matter what model one subscribes to, primary education and primary health care, including nutrition have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also voiced concern about environmental matters.  In the developing world the poorest people tend to suffer most from environmental problems. I am aware of problems in the past with certain World Bank/IDA projects. Now the World Bank shares our objective of sustainable development and not a form of development which is environmentally unsound and which sometimes threatens the future of the world.</P>
    <P>The IDA's role is to achieve a balanced sustainable development.  It has moved to integrate environmental considerations into its work whether in carrying forward traditional project lending, designing special environmental projects or discussing national policies with borrowing countries.  I am informed that in the past three years the IDA has provided $2.5 billion for environmental projects <Col N="392" /> and these have helped to protect crucial natural resources such as forests, fish, water, wildlife and soil in the poorest countries.  Other projects are helping to improve urban environments by providing clear water and sanitation services and helping to reduce air pollution.  In addition the IDA is working to see that the NGOs and the local groups are given a role in the design and implementation of projects.  These actions represent a commitment to the environment and to sustainable development.  I look forward to tangible results.  Like Deputy Dukes, I will monitor how the world bank achieves these aims.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to World Bank lending being linked to democracy and I understand the point he was making.  The IDA's articles of association approved by this House in 1960 state that the IDA shall not be influenced in its decisions by the political character of the member and that only economic considerations shall be relevant.  I am sure many donor countries will have differing opinions on the merits of lending to some countries.  I like to know that the IDA funds are helping poor people irrespective of political concerns.  A suffering hungry child does not have any political responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton talked about health care and the problems of Africa.  I am happy that health issues, especially women's health issues, are a priority for the IDA.  Studies show that cultural factors are loaded against women.  The IDA closely monitors non-development expenditure, especially military spending. Deputy Deasy also talked about military expenditure and I agree that it is wasteful.  I operate in close co-operation with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and I agree that this matter should be of concern to both of us.  The Minister of State intended to take part in this debate but unfortunately he is indisposed.</P>
    <P>Some of the poorer countries in Eastern Europe have already become eligible for IDA funding and more will follow.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Gay Mitchell's point about administrative costs.  This is a difficult <Col N="393" /> area which also involves administrative costs in the banks involved in setting up the organisation.  I admit that there are problems and I have voiced my concern about rising payrolls in the international financial institutions.  I will continue to make the point.  Travel expenses in these agencies are always a major source of contention.</P>
    <P>This has been a supportive debate on the role of the IDA and its funds.  To finish on a positive note, we have a very proud record in the developing bank and we will continue to be firm supporters of the Bretton Woods institutions.  They are not perfect but they are a major positive force in the developing world in helping to alleviate poverty.  The IDA is a firm favourite of the Irish Government and it has been favoured by successive governments over 30 years.  It helps the poorest countries.  In our aid programme we are conscious of the need to create conditions for sustainable development.  We pay particular attention to the role of women as well as to environmental matters.</P>
    <P>All of these aspects are part of the IDA development plans.  Its mandate has always been to channel assistance to low income countries for development.  The IDA is the largest single source of multilateral concessional funds.  Its annual disbursement of around $4 billion is about 30 per cent of non-concessional multilateral disbursements or 12 per cent of official development assistance.  The association also helps to mobilise and coordinate aid for other multilateral organisations and donor countries.  Its involvement is a catalyst for other bilateral aid donors and regional development banks to participate in improving assistance. Over the years it has provided capital for investment in all sectors of economic activity.  In the sixties it financed mainly infrastructural projects.  It helped to finance irrigation and drainage projects in India and Pakistan where greater agricultural output was needed to keep pace with the growing population.  The association also supported the construction of highways and roads in Latin America.  It financed municipal water supply schemes in Amman and helped build power plants <Col N="394" /> and ports in other developing countries. During the eighties it placed far greater emphasis on economic and institutional reform.  We are confident that in the nineties it will sharpen its focus on reducing poverty and in increasing its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I will bear in mind the points made and I thank Deputies for their co-operation in allowing this Bill to pass speedily.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point about the whole question of seeking efficiency, administrative costs and so on. Within the various organisations receiving this aid, in this case the International Development Association, what provisions are made for audit and do those audit requirements include value for money audits, efficiency, effectiveness and economy?  Have we been pro-active in pushing for audits of that kind for the funds we are providing?</P>

      <P>In my reply I outlined the ambit of the organisation.  Vast sums of money are involved and no country, not even the wealthiest, can afford to provide large sums without first making sure that the procedures are followed. Earlier this year governments took strong action against some banks.  We have raised this point and I am confident, even if the procedures are not as strict as we would like them to be, that it is understood that this is public money and that <Col N="395" /> there is control.  In some cases money is provided by the commercial banks.</P>

      <P>The Minister has assured us that under the IDA 10 regime there will be greater openness, that they will be committed to eliminating poverty in consultation with the local populations and that funds will be targeted at certain projects, especially those that will allow the poor greater access to productive assets.  What guarantees were sought in the IDA 10 negotiations to ensure that this will happen?  We fear that this is more aspirational than real.  Can the Minister assure us that it will happen.  It did not happen under IDA 8 or 9.</P>

      <P>The point was well made during the course of the debate that it is important that these resources are targeted at people in need, that the highest priority is given to water and sanitation and education projects and that efforts are made to eliminate problems in urban areas and to relieve the difficulties caused for women which have been highlighted in successive reports.  At the meetings last week and during the negotiations in 1992 and earlier this year people were determined to ensure that whatever resources were made available would be targeted at those in need, not at the administrative area.  I have no doubt that this is the wish not only of the association itself but also of those who provide the resources.</P>
      <P>Earlier I replied to the points raised by Deputy Dukes about the environment. Last week at the meeting of the World Bank speaker after speaker emphasised its importance and mentioned that the resources allocated for this purpose benefit not only the people in those regions but the rest of us as well.  Greater emphasis is being put on the environment than in the past.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide remedies in cases where it is alleged that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and the existing appeal procedures have been exhausted so that the aggrieved person cannot resort to the courts for relief, even where there is irrefutable new evidence. The provisions of the Bill arise in part from the recommendations of the committee &mdash; known as the Martin Committee after its chairman, Judge Frank Martin which was established in 1989 to enquire into certain aspects of criminal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our system at present is not of course devoid of a means by which miscarriages of justice can be remedied; there has always been the power provided by the Constitution under which the President, acting on the advice of the Government, can grant a pardon.  Pardons have been granted in rare cases that have arisen. While there is not statutory right to compensation in these cases, that has not prevented the Government of the day from awarding compensation in appropriate cases.  As I have said, it is clearly right that the procedure for dealing with these cases should be better regulated by statute.  In framing the Bill I have proceeded on the basis that the best agent for dealing with alleged miscarriages is a court and that it is only in rare cases <Col N="397" /> where a court cannot appropriately deal with the matter that other procedures should be resorted to.  The Bill, although short, will, I believe, be widely welcomed and I look forward to seeing it on the Statute Book in the near future.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill arise in part from recommendations made in Part I of the Report of the Committee to Enquire into Certain Aspects of Criminal Procedure, under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin, which was published in 1990.  I take this opportunity to thank Judge Martin and the members of the committe for their excellent report. Many eminent criminal lawyers made submissions to the committee, as did several present and past members of this House.  That the committee was able to complete its deliberations and submit its report very quickly is a credit to the dedication and commitment of its members. They deserve the sincere thanks of this House.</P>
    <P>The committee was also asked to examine whether additional safeguards were needed to ensure that uncorroborated confessions were properly obtained and recorded and they recommended that the questioning of suspects take place before an audio-visual recording device.  The Government has accepted that recommendation in principle.</P>
    <P>I have established a steering committee for the introduction of audio and audio-visual recording of Garda questioning of suspects on a pilot basis in selected Garda stations.  The committee is chaired by Judge Desmond Smyth.  I would stress that the committee is not concerned with whether or not to introduce recording devices into Garda stations &mdash; that has been accepted by the Government &mdash; but rather to make recommendations to me on the necessary features of a pilot scheme.  This is a significant development which will complement the legal changes I am proposing in this Bill.  It will, I hope, lead to an enhancement of public confidence in the integrity of criminal investigations by providing a verifiable record of statements made in Garda custody. This should greatly assist our criminal <Col N="398" /> courts in their difficult task of assessing evidence and should go a long way towards minimising actual or alleged miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, the proposals fulfil a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to provide for a review of alleged cases of miscarriage of justice and to provide a statutory right to compensation for any actual miscarriage.</P>
    <P>While there is an undoubted need for certainty and finality in the decisions of the criminal courts, the paramount objective is that justice must always be done and be seen to be done.  An accused person must have every opportunity to put forward his or her case and to challenge a decision or verdict which adversely affects him or her where there is good reason to suggest that the verdict may have been unjust.  The recognition of this led in 1924 to the establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal which for the first time gave to a convicted person a right of appeal against the verdict of a jury.  It was provided that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal would be final in every case, except where a point of law of exceptional public importance was involved, when an appeal could with leave be made to the Supreme Court. One of the important proposals in the Bill is that the court may re-examine a conviction or sentence where new evidence comes to light after a previous appeal has been dealt with.  One of the faults of our present system is that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no power to reopen an appeal already decided, even where clear evidence pointing to innocence comes to light.  I think everybody will agree that this needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the circumstances where it would become necessary to reopen cases would be exceptional, but we must face that possibility and provide for it.  It is possible, for example, to envisage an important witness coming forward after the hearing of an appeal who, for a genuine reason, was unavailable for the appeal or the original trial.  Another possibility <Col N="399" /> might be where a new development in forensic science enables evidence which led to the conviction and its affirmation in the Court of Criminal Appeal to be seen in a different light.</P>

      <P>The bridge to which I refer has been the site of a number of accidents in the last few years but, tragically, an accident not so long ago when four people, two adults and two children from one family, were literally wiped out by a lorry at this location.  This bridge has been the scene of a number of horrific accidents.  At this location two years ago another four people were killed in one incident.  For this reason, the three Deputies for the constituency have come together to raise it as an issue in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This bridge is at the end of two very long stretches of road leading to Greenore Port, at which there is quite a significant amount of live export cattle business.  On the occasion in question there was heavy traffic on this road which, unfortunately, led to the tragic death of a family.</P>
      <P>Just after the accident there was a mass meeting of residents in the area and over 500 people, including Dáil Deputies and other public representatives attended. The people, ordinary residents of the area, got together to show their concern at the level of accidents at this location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This road is a regional route and because of that the responsibility lies with the local authority to fund any improvements. We are raising it here to make the <Col N="400" /> Minister aware of this and to see if his Department will make sufficent funds available to the local authority to carry out those improvements.  I ask the Minister to look at this favourably because County Louth has the worst traffic accident record in the State.  That is because it acts as an access route for most of the traffic going northwards to Larne and Greenore from the South.  In future the Department should look at the possibility of funding local authorities, not on the basis of length of road in each county or constituency, but on the basis of usage. If that were done Louth would deserve a very high proportion of funding for its roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Ahern.  Unfortunately County Louth, the smallest county, heads the list of fatal statistics every year mainly because of its proximity to the Border and the fact that a national primary route bisects the length of the county.  That, allied to its use on occasions as a drinking oasis for cross-Border drinkers and the lack of Garda surveillance on our roads, has contributed to the unhappy statistic of being head of the list of fatal statistics year after year.</P>
      <P>It is a sad fact of life that eight young people had to die within a timescale of 22 months before this could become a priority within the system.  I do not wish to apportion blame or make recriminations but a new bridge must be built to replace a 17th century stone bridge built for ponies and traps.  We cannot continue to allow carnage of such magnitude &mdash; two multiple deaths, four people on each occasion, killed in 22 months.  Let the Minister, for God's sake, make money available to Louth County Council to build a proper bridge.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to join my two colleagues in the constituency in urging the Minister to provide finance to realign the road at the Ballymascanlon Bridge and to provide it as soon as possible.  They have outlined the appalling statistics in County Louth, a county which has two national primary <Col N="401" /> routes running through it.  This bridge is on a regional route and, in the normal course of events, maintenance and improvement works are the responsibility of the local authority.  However, because of the urgency and because Louth County Council is not in a position to provide the resources necessary to carry out the improvement works, we hope that the Minister for the Environment will be in a position to help the county council in the matter.  The accident rate at the bridge lends an even greater sense of urgency to the matter. The bridge is on the Greenore route, the road that leads off the N1 at the Ballymascanlon right turn to Greenore Port and it is a very busy and heavily used route.  I appeal to the Minister to help as soon as he possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concerns of Deputy Ahern and his colleagues, Deputies Kirk and McGahon.  I would like to take this opportunity to sympathise with the relatives of those killed in the recent tragic accident at Ballymascanlon. An event of that nature brings home to us all the very human consequences of road accidents.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to distance myself from the issues involved I have to put on record, as my colleagues have already done, the fact that the road involved does not form part of the network of national roads and, therefore, responsibility for improvements rests with Louth County Council.  The cost of such works normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by discretionary grants provided by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department asked the county council to initiate the design of a replacement bridge and approach roads and informed them that when proposals for this project are submitted they will be considered sympathetically in the context of the Estimates for 1994.  The council has also been requested to undertake safety measures at this location, including the provision of a more elaborate advance warning system on the approaches to the bridge and the provision of high quality <Col N="402" /> delineation through the section.  I understand that these works are in hand.  The cost of these measures will be met by the council's own resources or from grants for national roads which, this year, will amount to £996,000.</P>
    <P>Good roads play a crucial role in road safety.  Indeed the massive programme of road improvements undertaken in recent years has been carried out to the highest international safety standards and very considerable investment is being made in this regard in Louth.  However, non-national roads around the country were designed and built before motor transport reached today's sophisticated and congested levels with, in many cases, all the inherent dangers attached.  I urge all local authorities to bear in mind that there are immediate short term measures available which can do much to improve road safety at accident risk locations.  I have in mind cutting overgrown hedges, improving sight lines, improving advance warning signs, speed reducing measures on the approaches to bends and the provision of road studs, etc.  Such road safety measures are not massively expensive and will save lives, a very sobering thought.</P>
    <P>I know that my colleagues in this House, particularly those from Louth, are extremely anxious and have approached me personally as well as raising the matter here in this House.  I understand their concern and I hope, even though it is not within my general remit for national primary roads, to respond as positively and sympathetically as I can in the context of next year's Estimates to any proposals that I receive from the council in regard to the longer term solution. In the meantime the council is taking short term safety measures which are essential in such areas at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Members of the House are at one on this issue.  We must now decide the kind of urgent action to be taken to deal with this problem.  In 1986 all sides of the House accepted a motion which called for the closure of Sellafield.  Last year all parties supported in principle a motion put down by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, which called for decisive legal action to stop the contamination of THORP.</P>
      <P>The case for retaining Sellafield and THORP on economic, environmental and security grounds has collapsed.  The cost benefit analysis carried out on THORP estimates that the plant will mean an extra £2 billion for the British economy each year.  It is striking that the British Government refused to show any of the contracts for THORP at the recent Second Consultative Process and that no attempt has ever been made to privatise British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  The reason is that it would be valued in negative terms on the market.  The economic case for retaining this plant has collapsed. Other nuclear countries are carrying out reviews and revisions of their nuclear industries.  For example, President Clinton is carrying out a review of the nuclear industry in the United States.</P>
      <P>I do not have to reiterate the environmental reasons for closing Sellafield &mdash; these have been well stated by my colleagues over the past six or seven years. Suffice it to say that emissions of the chemical krypton 85 will lead to approximately 100 extra cancer cases a year at a minimum and approximately 1,300 extra cases a year at a maximum.  Available scientific evidence on emissions from Sellafield is very damning indeed.  For example, two Irish scientists have identified a conclusive link between emissions from Sellafield and the disturbing trend in the number of mental handicap cases in Ireland during the mid-fifties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that British Nuclear Fuels Limited has for 40 years pursued a policy of disinformation.  If the THORP plan goes ahead we will be faced with the horrible spectacle of an extra 70 ships a year carrying highly radio-active <Col N="404" /> plutonium waste on the Irish Sea.  As a public representative for a coastal constituency with an important sea fishing port, Howth, I find this prospect frightening. In addition we could be faced with the spectacle of Japanese warships guarding Japanese ships carrying waste on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet Minister Gummer immediately to discuss this issue and I call for a public inquiry.  If there is no public inquiry we should take legal action.  The British Government agreed to two consultative processes but they pre-judged these by allowing the contamination of THORP.  This would give us a strong basis for taking legal action in either British courts or European international courts.  It was recently recognised that Greenpeace had a legitimate interest in this matter.  If it has a legitimate interest, then surely the Irish Government has a legitimate interest.  In previous debates Members referred to Article 170 of the original EC Treaty and Article 142 of EURATOM.  We could make a strong legal case for the closure of this plant and I ask the Minister to take urgent action to deal with this issue before there are any disastrous consequences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that successive Governments have attempted to address with their UK counterparts the problems posed by the British nuclear industry. Sadly, the wish of the Irish public that this plant be closed has not been fulfilled. I do not know how best to explain to the Minister the genuine public concern which exists about Sellafield and THORP.  British Nucler Fuels Limited has been granted a temporary permit to carry out testing at the THORP plant. This represents a further disaster in terms of the well-being of the Irish public.  I know that the Minister and the Government have done their best in dealing with <Col N="405" /> this problem but we expect a little more at this stage.  The Minister should take whatever steps are necessary before the general public come knocking on his door asking him to deal with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Broughan and Callely for their very solid support for the efforts taken by the Government in dealing with Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Government policy on Sellafield has been and continues to be one of opposition to the commissioning of the plant. The Irish Government has consistently opposed the continuation and expansion of reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield because of the increase in risk to the health of the public and of environmental contamination arising from discharges of radioactive effluent; the risk of accidents, arising from the reprocessing activity and the storage and transport of nuclear fuel, plutonium and radioactive wastes; the accumulation of large amounts of radio-active waste on one site close to the Irish Sea and to Ireland; the risk of nuclear proliferation from increasing stocks of plutonium; and the so far unsolved problems of long term safe storage and disposal of radioactive waste arising from reprossessing.</P>
      <P>On many occasions the Government has requested the UK Government to close Sellafield and emphasised Ireland's total opposition to the plant.  Our concerns in relation to the plant have also been expressed at every available opportunity in the European Community and other international fora, including the June meeting of the Paris Commission on the Prevention of Marine Pollution and the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna last week.  We will continue to pursue this line of total opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that in January of this year the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, sent a detailed and wide-ranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK Inspectorate <Col N="406" /> of Pollution.  This submission conveyed in the strongest possible terms the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities.</P>
    <P>In particular the submission expressed the Government's grave concerns about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea and called for a full public inquiry to be held before any decision is taken to proceed.  On 28 June the UK Secretary of State for the Environment announced that after consideration by him and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the report of the Inspectorate of Pollution it has been concluded that no points of substance have been raised that should cause them to reconsider the terms of the draft authorisations. However, because a high volume of submissions, including ours, had raised questions as to the justification for the operation of THORP it was decided to delay the commissioning of the plant until a further round of consultations to deal with the wider issues had been held.</P>
    <P>On 4 August the UK authorities circulated the following documents which formed the basis of this further consultation: a report by the Inspectorate of Pollution on the results of the earlier consultation exercise; a paper by British Nuclear Fuels on the economic and commercial justification for THORP; a statement of UK Government policy on reprocessing and the operation of THORP and a document prepared by British Nuclear Fuels entitled <i>Further material on the Environmental aspects of the Operation of THORP.</i>  Following consideration of this further material, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made a second and more comprehensive submission on behalf of the Government to the UK authorities last week.</P>
    <P>In addition to detailing our previously stated opposition to the THORP plant this submission concludes that, as THORP will serve no overall useful purpose, <Col N="407" /> there is no justification for the increased risk of radiation exposure that the public will receive from the plant. There is also an increased risk of nuclear proliferation for military purposes by adding to the large existing stockpile of plutonium around the world.</P>
    <P>Minister Cowen also concluded, in a separate detailed examination of British Nuclear Fuels's economics of reprocessing at THORP, that there are no demonstrable overall economic or security benefits arising from THORP's operation which would justify it or balance possible and likely risks to public health and environmental damage.  I will be making copies of the full submission available to Members of the Oireachtas in the library tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In this submission we have renewed our call on the United Kingdom authorities to hold a full, open and independent public inquiry to deal with the basic justification for operating the THORP plant in the circumstances now prevailing as well as the technical aspects of the revised discharge authorisations.</P>
    <P>The UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who have statutory responsibility for considering whether to hold a hearing or inquiry, will not take a final decision on this question until they have considered all submissions.</P>
    <P>While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence. The Attorney General has advised that any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has examined the implications of THORP and issued an official opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from THORP is not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of an accident, to result in radioactive contamination <Col N="408" /> significant from the point of view of health, water, soil or airspace of another member state.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, evidence is not available to suggest that activities at the entire complex, including the proposed operation of the THORP plant, are or will be in breach of EC law and international conventions which would sustain a successful legal action.  The Government is open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding the closure of Sellafield.  It is not, however, prepared to proceed to legal action without a solid and sustainable case.</P>

      <P>I hope I will receive a more accommodating response than that given by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to Deputy Broughan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue I want to raise is causing great concern to many farm families.  In what has become a bureaucratically insane Common Agricultural Policy we now have a multiplicity of premium schemes to which people must have recourse for income.  There are nine premium schemes in operation under which applications have either been made or are outstanding.  In addition, we have the headage payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme and this year sees the commencement of the area aid scheme with its own plethora of systems and criteria, rules and regulations. It has reached the point where the IFA and FBD felt &mdash; rightly &mdash; that it was necessary to produce a guide to applicants for these various schemes.  If one did not have such a guide one would need a computer programme, a special calendar and a diary to remind <Col N="409" /> one when to apply for these various aids forced on us by the bureaucracy of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>All these payments assume a greater importance in the context of total farm income and, as CAP reform and the forthcoming GATT agreements are progressively put in place, these schemes will become even more important to the point where, in some farming systems and in some parts of the country, premium payments under these various schemes will account for almost the entire disposable income of a farm family.  This means that prompt payment of these premia is a matter of the greatest importance for farmers and the record of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this regard is extremely bad.  The deficiencies under these schemes are widespread and I will give some examples.</P>
    <P>There has been a delay so far of over four months in making payments of winter beef premium to 16,000 producers who are owed £14 million.  Those people applied in May of this year for that premium. A sum of £82 million is due and still unpaid in headage payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme for 1993. There have been lengthy delays in payments under the special beef premium, the suckler cow premium and the ewe premium schemes and I would like to mention some of the cases where payments remain outstanding.  They include the special beef premium scheme applied for in June 1992, the special beef premium scheme applications made in December 1992, the suckler cow premium scheme applications made in December 1992, the suckler cow premium scheme for small milk producers applications made in June 1992.  Now, in October 1993, under those four schemes alone, there are substantial amounts of money outstanding on foot of applications made during the course of last year.</P>
    <P>The situation is now so critical that the two organisations I mentioned a moment ago have drawn up a charter of farmers' rights and it is appalling that people have to campaign for prompt payment within <Col N="410" /> the calendar year of application and as soon as EC regulations permit.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the payments under the area aid scheme cannot begin before 16 October, according to EC regulations. I have been told also that it is hoped to have &ldquo;as many as possible paid by the end of November&rdquo;.  Judging from the record of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this regard I predict that a substantial number of farm families will still be awaiting payment of these area aid premiums next Christmas.  The Minister of State should listen to my predictions because I remember a previous occasion in this House I predicted to him that nobody would receive any payments under the review of the disadvantaged areas scheme before 1993.  I was right; they do not have any hope of obtaining payments under that scheme until 1994.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to take this matter in hand.  He has gone along with these crazy CAP reforms that have given us this multiplicity of premium schemes.  He has gone along with the systems that have made the cheque in the post such an important part of farm income and he now has a responsibility to make this work.  I call on the Minister now to make sure that all arrears are paid and all payments brought up to date by the end of November of this year at the very latest. If he does not do that he will be condemning a great many farm families around the country to the breadline this winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed by Deputy Dukes concerning the importance of the speedy payment of all livestock and other grants owed to farmers but I do not accept his criticism in relation to the manner in which these schemes are administered in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments to farmers under the various livestock headage and premium schemes over the first nine months of 1993 amount to £200 million, a figure which represents an increase of some 25 per cent on the £161 million paid during the comparable <Col N="411" /> period in 1992, a year in which record payments were also achieved.</P>
    <P>To date in 1993, over 70,000 farmers who applied for special beef and suckler cow premia in the November-December 1992 application period have been paid close to £36 million in aid.  Over £68 million has been paid to flock owners on foot of the first and second instalments of the 1992 ewe premium.  The remaining £96 million relates particularly to payments made in respect of June 1992 special beef and suckler cow premia, the final instalment of the 1992 ewe premium and various disadvantaged area headage grants.</P>
    <P>In so far as the 1993 beef and suckler cow premium schemes are concerned, the EC regulations preclude any payment before 1 November.  After that date an advance equal to 60 per cent of the premia can be paid subject to completion of the necessary administrative and on-the-spot checks.  The intention is that payment of these advances along with disadvantaged areas headage grants will commence after 1 November.  Payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium has now commenced and some 6,000 farmers should have received payment by the middle of the month.  The remaining cases will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the CAP reforms has increased the importance of headage and premium payments in farmers' overall incomes.  There has also been a considerable increase in the number of applications under the various measures and total applications are expected to exceed 600,000 in the case of 1993 livestock schemes alone.  The comparable figure in 1992 was 420,000.  In addition, area aid applications from farmers with livestock amount to 140,000.  Many schemes are highly complex both from the farmers' point of view and in their administration.  To meet the various additional demands, the administration of the special beef premium scheme has now been centralised in Portlaoise and some 80 additional staff are in place. Arrangements are being made to provide <Col N="412" /> additional resources in a number of local offices to deal with short term difficulties. Some other options are also being considered to facilitate speedier payments between now and the end of the year. The objective is to secure the maximum level of livestock premium payments for farmers in 1993.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy Dukes's criticism of the Common Agricultural Policy, farmers appreciate the value of the direct income support negotiated by this Government under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise this important matter on the Adjournment this evening, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter in question is the placing in receivership of the Larbaun plant in Westport, County Mayo, which manufactures a range of underwear products principally for the home market.  Larbaun and its predecessor have been in operation in Westport for over 30 years, during which time they played an important part in providing much needed employment and building up the local economy.  In the past 12 months a revision of work practices and a restructuring of the plant have taken place, resulting in a lowering of absenteeism to a level of less than 3 per cent, a doubling of productivity from 1,100 dozen to 2,400 dozen per week, a lowering of the production price and an ability to fulfil contractual obligations on time on each occasion.  No blame for the present work stoppage can be attributed to the Larbaun <Col N="413" /> workforce who are efficient, competitive, diligent and at all times professional in their work.</P>
    <P>The textile industry in the broader market has been experiencing difficulty for some time past.  The free trade concept allows importation from outside sources to EC countries subject to certain quota restrictions.  Obviously difficulties arise when the consumer, often in difficult financial circumstances, can purchase cheaper goods produced in the sweat shops of various countries abroad.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores has been the main purchaser of Larbaun products for over 20 years.  It has to be said that this major facility provided stability for Larbaun over many years.  However, the non-purchase of goods contracted for over a period of time caused cash flow problems for Larbaun resulting in the present receivership.  I understand that the non-purchase of goods by Dunnes Stores was because of the importation of a huge quantity of a particular type of underwear from an outside source.  The consequence was that, at one stage, in excess of £500,000 of finished products was held in the Larbaun stores.  When one considers that the turnover of the plant is in excess of £1 million per annum, one can readily appreciate the scale of this effect.  All goods held in the Larbaun stores were produced to meet specific contracts.</P>
    <P>In order to revive Larbaun as a going concern, with potential for growth, the following requirements should be met. There should be a clear, unequivocal statement by the receiver on the up-to-date position regarding ongoing talks, in particular in regard to the position about contractual obligations entered into by Dunnes Stores.  I understand from reliable sources in Dunnes Stores that any difficulties here, if not already sorted out, can be sorted out immediately. Obviously, Dunnes Stores, as a major Irish purchaser and consumer outlet, would not wish to destroy their good relations with Irish consumers arising from this happening.  I have been informed by sources in Larbaun that, despite stringent efforts by the receiver to contact Dunnes Stores with a view to <Col N="414" /> sorting out the problems of their contract with Larbaun, he failed to secure a favourable decision and had no option but to release the 65 workers there.  If the arrangements which are now being put in train between the receiver and Dunnes Stores had been in place three weeks ago the workforce would not now be out on the streets.  Larbaun have put their house in order.  This company can be sold as a going concern with potential for future growth.  The purchase of all the products in stock, of itself, will not sort out this problem as a new purchaser for this plant must be found.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to instruct the Industrial Development Authority to assist Larbaun in whatever arrangements may be decided to get it up and running again.  The increase in VAT from 16 per cent to 21 per cent has had a crippling effect on this trade.  I might remind Members that Fianna Fáil and Labour Members voted against a Fine Gael motion on this matter in the House some months ago.</P>
    <P>Larbaun has acquired new market outlets in Britain and should be rewarded for that initiative.  I trust the Minister will ensure that every facility necessary will be given to Larbaun by his Department to ensure that the contractual obligations are completed and that this company and its diligent and efficient workforce are put back to work in the shortest possible time.  I trust the Minister will ensure that is done forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enda Kenny for sharing his time with me.  This closure came as a great shock to the local community two weeks ago when Larbaun, which had been in existence for over 35 years, was put into receivership. While accepting that the textile industry has been the subject of enormous pressure in the past ten years, despite a change of ownership this company succeeded in increasing its efficiency rates by nearly 100 per cent in the past 12 months, during which time the workforce was never more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask what was the cause of the closure.  There would appear to have <Col N="415" /> been various reasons.  I shall not lay the blame totally on the role the large multiples play in this country, nor shall I use my precious time to appeal to Irish consumers to target their considerable purchasing power on quality Irish goods rather than on cheap imported ones dumped on our small economy.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to ensure that all State agencies, particularly the Industrial Development Authority, FÁS and the Irish Trade Board, play their part in assisting the receiver to save the 65 jobs in Larbaun, which to a town like Westport with a population of 3,500 is almost the equivalent of the loss of the Digital plant in Galway.  I would ask him to ensure that full support and advice under the whole range of State programmes is made available to the receiver and, more importantly, to any potential purchaser of the plant.  I understand a few potential purchasers are looking at this factory.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that our textile industry is under threat from low-cost producer countries.  This becomes obvious when one notes the job losses experienced in this trade over the past ten years.  The number of jobs is down from 24,000 to 15,000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the package of measures the Minister announced on 2 August last, particularly the research and development programmes to address competitiveness, the FÁS scheme to give grant assistance for training schemes and the new competitiveness and employment protection unit established.</P>
    <P>I call again for the immediate finalisation of the interdepartmental review of PRSI and the possible reduction of PRSI contributions by low paid manufacturing firms.  We must remember that there is a differential of 6 per cent in that rate between Britain and Ireland.  This was adequately spelled out in a television programme last week.  I fully support the call of IBEC, the representative body in the textile trade, for the establishment of a clothing industry task force to protect existing jobs.  There is much talk about new job creation.  We should look first to <Col N="416" /> the protection of existing jobs and their maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment Deputy Quinn, his departmental colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Rourke and Brennan, and indeed myself and my Government colleagues, are very concerned that Larbaun has been placed in receivership.  We have great sympathy for the workers and the families of those who have just been laid off and we are acutely aware of the effect of this latest closure on the Westport area generally.  I understand that the appointment of a receiver was due to ongoing cash flow difficulties which inhibited the company from meeting its financial commitments.  It is indeed most regrettable both for the owners and the workforce that Larbaun was not in a position to trade out of its difficulties without having to go into receivership.  I can well appreciate the disappointment and frustration of Larbaun management at the special circumstances which have led to the company's cash flow problems, particularly when the company had been performing so satisfactorily following its establishment some five years ago when it purchased the assets of Lastra Foundations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Larbaun Limited manufactured most of its output, under contract, for the principal Irish chain stores.  However, competition from lower priced imports from abroad and the general slowdown in demand on the Irish market, combined to reduce demand for its products.  I understand that Larbaun, over the past few years, has placed a large proportion of its production with one chain store. This arrangement had been working very satisfactorily and had the advantage of ensuring a secure market.  However, by concentrating mainly on one particular market outlet, the company ran the risk of becoming exposed in the event of unforeseen changes.  Larbaun, unfortunately encountered such a traumatic experience.  The company, for reasons outside its own control, was faced with the prospect of holding major stocks with <Col N="417" /> a consequent loss of revenue.  This, in turn, meant that Larbaun was not in a position to meet its financial commitments and this ultimately led to the appointment of the receiver.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the receiver is most anxious to do everything possible to sell the company as a going concern.  To this end my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has on behalf of the Government asked the IDA to co-operate fully with the receiver, and to leave no stone unturned to ensure that a suitable takeover company is found.  Our main objective, must be to safeguard the employment of the highly skilled and motivated Larbaun workforce.</P>
    <P>We accept that the receiver's task in endeavouring to sell the company as a going concern will not be an easy one. The current difficulties facing the clothing industry and the general international recession do not provide the most conducive climate for such a sale.  We fully recognise the problems facing the clothing industry and the need to secure the future of this vital sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Indeed earlier this week the Minister for Enterprise and Employment had a very fruitful meeting with the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation during which they examined in detail the problems, facing their industry and the best way of devising measures to resolve them.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment is continuing to liaise closely with the relevant State agencies in an effort to get clothing companies to adjust, reposition and upgrade their own competitive strategies and strengths.</P>
    <P>The House is also no doubt aware that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, recently announced two special initiatives aimed at improving the competitiveness of the clothing industry.  The advent of the Single Market and the gradual movement towards easing the quota restrictions under the multi-fibres arrangement has inevitably meant that increased volumes of imports would flow into the community from low-cost countries.  To compete in this environment the clothing industry must restructure in a significant way and take a new direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> The key to the successful future of the clothing industry is in the production of high quality, well designed products. Manufacturers must move away from the traditional production line facilities to modular production techniques such as world class manufacturing.  These fundamental changes would be a major step towards improving competitiveness as the need to hold large volumes of stock with the associated high costs would be virtually wiped out overnight.</P>
    <P>In addition clothing manufacturers would be able to respond quickly to changing trends which would give them a distinct edge over third country low-cost producers.  In addition to the need for installing new production facilities, it is also important for the industry to produce better quality and better designed garments.  This will of course require new technology and new design techniques.  The introduction of new technology will naturally require the appropriate retraining of staff so that they can operate the new technical systems.</P>
    <P>When announcing the two special initiatives referred to earlier for improving competitiveness in the clothing and footwear industry, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, took account of the special needs of the industry, including the necessary training requirements.  These initiatives provide for a special research and development scheme, which will operate under the research and development scheme run by the State development agencies and a special training support scheme operated by FÁS.  In tandem with the special initiatives for the clothing and footwear sectors, representatives of the Department of Employment and Enterprise, in conjunction with representatives of the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare, are at present reviewing the impact of employers' PRSI on low paid manufacturing industries.  We appreciate that the anticipated improvements in the industry as a result of these special initiatives will not bear fruit overnight.  The schemes are scheduled to run for a 12 month period which we think is necessary <Col N="419" /> to give companies time to identify their special requirements and embark on the appropriate restructuring programme. These various initiatives and the suggested way forward will, I hope, be the first step in an effort to stem the number of job losses in the industry.  It may also create a new vibrant sector which will not only be able to compete in the changing environment for the sector but which can take advantage of any new opportunities that may arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank Deputies Kenny and Huges for raising this matter.  I share the concern they expressed on behalf of their <Col N="420" /> constituents pertaining to the difficulties of Larbaun in Westport.  I know that Deputies Hughes and Kenny have made trojan efforts to have this matter resolved in consultation with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the IDA and other State agencies.  I hope the consumer chains involved will ensure that the maximum co-operation is given so that this company can be brought back to a trading environment as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 October 1993.</P>

      <P>As I already stated in my reply to Dáil Question No. 148 on 6 July 1993, intake policy is essentially a matter for each second level school management subject to the application of acceptable criteria.  The primary responsibility of my Department is to ensure that overall, sufficient places exist at second level to cater for demand in a given area.</P>
      <P>I accept that the demand for places in the second level school in question exceeds the number of places available in the school at present.  This school is one of the schools attended by pupils from the Dunboyne and Castleknock area.  A decision has been taken to provide a new school at Dunboyne and the necessary planning process has been initiated.  A study by an independent consultant into the post-primary education needs of the Castleknock area is at an advantaged stage and a report and recommendation will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department is in touch with the Management Authorities of the school with a view to ensuring that more facilities will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am pleased to say that from <Col N="57" /> enquiries made it has been confirmed in my Department that the girls referred to by the Deputy have been placed in other second level schools in the area.</P>

      <P>The children of the area in question are eligible for transport to schools in the Bray/Greystones catchment area. I am satisfied that there is sufficient accommodation in these schools to provide for these 11 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, some parents from the locality wish to send their children to Wicklow post-primary centre outside their catchment area.  While they are entitled to make such a choice, they are not eligible for transport to this centre, which is in another catchment area. Consequently, the most they can be offered by my Department is concessionary transport from within the catchment boundary of their chosen school.  This may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated and that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of using an extra or larger bus or re-routing the service. The County Wicklow Transport Liaison Officer has informed my Department that no seats for catchment boundary pupils remain.</P>

    <P>As the House is aware I have recently made available the three reports commissioned by the Department on the School Transport Service.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 56 and 105 together.  The total number of applicants to the CAO-CAS in 1993 was 57,325.  To date a total of 41,483 applicants have received offers between rounds one, two, three and four. The process is ongoing and offers will continue to be made up to the end of this month.  Therefore it is not possible at this stage, to give a definitive answer as to how many students will be offered places eventually this year.  However it is worth noting that the number of applicants who have received offers so far this year, i.e. 41,483, is significantly above the total number of applicants who received offers last year i.e. 38,165.</P>
      <P>It is also likely, based on patterns in previous years, that of the 57,325 applicants to the CAO-CAS some 7,000 will not have the minimum academic requirements for the courses for which they have applied.  The final figure in this regard will not be available until the offers process has been completed.  However, it does indicate that of a likely qualified pool of around 50,000 applicants, 41,483 have to date been offered places i.e. in excess of 80 per cent of eligible applicants have been offered third level places.</P>
      <P>In terms of the provision of third level places it is important to emphasise that almost 40 per cent of the relevant age cohort now transfer to third level education compared to approximately 20 per cent in 1980, i.e. a doubling over a decade.  In addition a further 20 per cent approximately go on to various post leaving certificate courses.  These figures compare well with international figures available.  This means that the vast majority of students are being offered the opportunity to proceed to further education, following the leaving certificate.</P>

      <P>Grants and Scholarships awarded under my Department's student support system are tenable only in approved institutions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The extension of the student support schemes to provide for the payment of maintenance grants to Irish students pursuing courses in third level institutions in Britain is likely to have significant financial implications.  I am obliged because of limited Exchequer resources to identify priorities in the targeting of student support.  In this context my priority has to be to give financial assistance to students ordinarily resident in Ireland who because of family circumstances might not other wise be in a position to proceed to third level education in Ireland.  I will however keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which I expect to receive in the very near future.  This committee was established in September, 1991 with the task of reporting and making recommendations on the wide range of issues which impact on educational provision for children with special needs.  I propose to circulate the detailed terms of reference of the committee and the list of membership in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>While it is certainly my policy to encourage the maximum possible integration of handicapped children into ordinary schools, the pace and extent of such development is ultimately dependent on the capacities of the individual children concerned.  For some children, integration in the ordinary classroom is possible, supported if necessary by a remedial teacher, a resource teacher or the Visiting Teacher Service.  In other cases, placement in a special class in an ordinary school is the most suitable solution. In more severe cases, placement in one of the dedicated special schools may be the most appropriate solution.</P>
      <P>It is important that this range of responses be available to meet the variety of needs which can arise and I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that this is the case.  At present, a total of 1,032 remedial teachers are in place, including 86 such posts which were created in September, 1993.  The Visiting Teacher Service has also been supplemented by the addition of a further eight posts in 1992, bringing the total number of teachers in the service to 38. A total of seven resource teacher have already been appointed and I am currently considering the possibility of some further appointments to selected schools which are groups of handicapped children on the ordinary roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key area of focus for the Special Education Review Committee is the question of integration in its variety of forms and the arrangements and support services which should be put in place for special needs children.  I am looking <Col N="68" /> forward to receiving the committee's recommendations in the very near future and I can assure the Deputy that I will be giving early and detailed consideration to the committee's views to ensure that our special needs children receive the best possible support of the education service.</P>
    <P>The following is the statement:</P>
    <P>Terms of Reference of Special</P>
    <P>Education Review Committee</P>
    <P>To report and make recommendations on the educational provision for children with special needs in respect of</P>

    <P>(b)  the arrangements which should be put in place in order to provide for the educational requirements of such children through complete or partial integration in ordinary schools, through special classes in ordinary schools or through special schools or other special arrangements, in accordance with the circumstances as assessed of each child;</P>

      <P>To qualify as a guidance counsellor in a second level school, one, usually, must have taken a post-graduate course in guidance, in addition to being qualified as a post-primary teacher.  In the main, the training here has been done by the universities.</P>
      <P>While these courses have many common subject areas, each college may have, with good reason, its own preferences and emphases in relation to parts of the course.  Each course is, therefore, different.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to lay out in detail the topics that make up such courses.  I can say, however, that they are put together in the light of the best academic thinking available and the views of the others involved in providing guidance services.  The content of the courses has evolved in conjunction with changes in society and the world of work.</P>
      <P>As to my being satisfied with the attention being given to any particular theme, the following information has been given to me: (1) the ratio of female to male lecturers is skewed in favour of female; (2) the ratio of female to male course participants is skewed in favour of female; (3) where possible, gender specific language is not used &mdash; guidelines for students have been provided on this topic; (4) some questions on the examination paper relate to equality issue; (5) where an equality issue emerges in any subject area, it is taken for discussion; (6) the practice of guidance is underpinned by a code of ethics &mdash; the concept of the equality of persons is a central part of this code; in one university, the course handbook invites the students, who are teachers, to note how they are treated in the pupil role while attending the courses; (7) the course organisers are active parties to overall university guidelines on a number of equality issues, e.g. policy on equal opportunity, guidelines on sexual harassment, advice on the giving of feedback by students to teachers-lecturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to basic training courses, a great number of inservice courses on guidance have been organised and delivered by officials in my Department.  In <Col N="71" /> all of them, the question of equality is attended to.  In addition, my Department has been involved in programmes which have dealt specifically with equality, e.g. the Futures programme, Career Vision videos.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above information, it is clear that those who are involved in the provision of basic training courses and in inservice education in career guidance are actively concerned about the equality issue.</P>

It would not be possible, however, to give an exact timescale for the completion of these building projects.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The term dyslexia is sometimes used to describe the problem experienced by certain children in learning to read and which cannot be accounted for by limited ability or by emotional or extraneous factors.  My Department, in conjunction with the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra, Dublin, conducted a survey of 11-year-old and fifth class pupils in May, 1993 to establish their reading attainment levels and to monitor trends in reading achievement over time.  Pupils with low levels of achievement in reading were a specific focus of the survey.  The data gathered is being analysed at present and I expect that the findings will be submitted to me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a survey aimed at identifying the extent of disability in ordinary national schools, including difficulties associated with reading, was undertaken <Col N="76" /> by the Special Education Review Committee in 1992.  This survey had the purpose of informing the committee in recommending what additional support services are required to meet the educational needs of the children in question. I expect that the review committee's report will be submitted to me in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Trinity House School, which was opened in 1983, operates under a board of management in accordance with policy guidelines and regulations laid down by the Minister for Education.  The board of management is comprised as follows: a chairman appointed by the Minister for Education; one member each nominated by the Ministers of Health, Justice and Education; one member nominated by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin; one staff representative and four members of the public appointed by the Minister for Education, including one representing the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Board members normally serve for a period of three years, after which time they are either asked to continue for a further term or are replaced by a new <Col N="79" /> member.  Other vacancies are filled as they arise on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Four new members have been appointed to the board in the past 18 months.  Three of these appointments were to fill vacancies created by the departure of existing members and the fourth related to the first time appointment of a staff representative to the board.  I am currently awaiting nominations from the local community council with a view to filling a further vacancy on the board.  Arrangements are also being made at present for the appointment of a replacement representative of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The remaining four board members were due for re-appointment or replacement this year.  However, because of the number of new appointments to the board in recent times, it was deemed necessary, in the interests of continuity and of retaining a degree of experience, to defer consideration of the remaining positions for the time being.  However, it is intended to review the membership of the board in the coming months in accordance with normal practice.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the management of a centre such as Trinity House is a demanding and complex task which requires sensitivity and commitment as well as competence across the range of areas with which such an establishment is required to deal.  It is therefore very important that the composition of the board of management reflect these requirements.  In this regard, I want to pay tribute to the work of present and past members of the board and I can assure the Deputy that the considerations I have mentioned will be to the fore in any future decisions regarding new appointments to the board.</P>

      <P>In relation to the State bodies which operate under the control of my Department I should point out that in March 1992 the Minister for Finance issued guidelines for State bodies which set down the principles which should govern relationships between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis.  The guidelines advise a written code of conduct for board members, including disclosure of interests, and provide for specific procedures to be followed in purchasing goods and services &mdash; in particular that competitive tendering should be the norm save in exceptional circumstances.

The scheme of assistance in question is being phased out on introduction of arrangements for the provision of caretaking and clerical services to schools under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Under these arrangments, which operate on the basis of a grant to schools, conditions of employment are a matter for the employing school authority.

      <P>In the case of secondary schools, increased capitation grants are payable under the <i>Programme of Economic and Social Progress</i> to enable the larger schools to employ caretakers.  Their rates of pay, conditions of service, tax and social welfare contributions are dealt with by the employing authority.  I have no plans at present to introduce a penson for this group.</P>
      <P>Full time caretakers in vocational schools can avail of the contributory superannuation schemes of the Department of the Environment for vocational education committee employees.  Community and comprehensive schools have a contributory superannuation scheme for permanent whole-time caretakers.</P>

      <P>A request has been received for grant aid towards the cost of extra classroom space and a modern gymnasium at Loughrea vocational school.  My Department is awaiting additional information from the vocational education committee in relation to the additional classroom space and a decision will be made when this information has been received.</P>
      <P>Due to demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  As a result, it is not possible to make funding available at this stage for the provision of physicial education facilities at the school in question. However, physical education facilities are provided in all major new school developments.</P>
      <P>The provision of indoor sports accommodation in existing schools, in the form of a general purpose area at primary level and a hall at secondary level will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.  In the meantime, additional emphasis is being placed on the adjacent siting and common use of school and community recreational facilities and schools should make maximum use of other sports facilities in their area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 110 and 374 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the book referred to in the questions and I welcome its publication as a positive contribution to the consideration of the problem of stress in the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>I believe that the improvements I am making in the education system at school level will have a beneficial effect in reducing stress in the teaching profession.  The following initiatives which will, I believe, help the teachers are in place:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the pupil/teacher ratios have been improved at both primary and post-primary levels;</P>
      <P>&mdash;I have introduced a scheme of job-sharing for all post-primary teachers;</P>
      <P>&mdash;under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> ex-quota vice-principals have been appointed and additional guidance services provided in the larger schools;</P>
      <P>&mdash;home/school/community liaison schemes have been introduced for primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash;my Department has issued comprehensive guidelines on a code of discipline for schools.</P>
      <P>The introduction of revised and alternative curricula at both junior and senior cycle of second-level education will give pupils a wider choice of programmes suitable to their needs and abilities and provide greater motivation for all students to take an active part in school life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I believe that these initiatives will help to reduce major causes of stress which have been identified by teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>My Department is considering various other options and strategies aimed at assisting teachers to cope with or to overcome the stresses associated with their particular profession including a very comprehensive inservice training programme beginning in the current school year and available to all teachers at primary and post-primary levels, the preparation of guidelines for teachers in coping with stress will also be of great assistance.</P>

      <P>I understand that some of the colleges operated the &ldquo;random selection&rdquo; procedure this year in allocating the final places.  This procedure applies where the number of candidates on the cut-off point (in this case 445 points) exceeds the number of remaining places.  While I appreciate that some candidates were disappointed not to receive a place because of this &ldquo;random selection&rdquo;, it would not be possible to allocate additional places for such cases.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in Butlersbridge national school at 30 of September 1992 was 92 which warrants a staffing of a Principal and two assistants.</P>
      <P>The post of third assistant has been suppressed with effect from 31 August 1993 as the enrolment at the 30 September 1992 did not warrant its retention. The third assistant teacher has been redeployed.</P>
      <P>I regret that, in view of the fact that there are over 3,200 national schools, it is necessary to adhere strictly to the rules governing the staffing of schools, and exceptions may not be made in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The Government have supported President Yeltsin's efforts to bring about political and economic reform in Russia, emphasising the importance of ensuring that the principles of democracy and human rights should remain central to these reforms.</P>
      <P>President Yeltsin is aware of this support. In the course of his stop-over visit on 29 August, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin briefed the Taoiseach on prospects for political reform.  On 29 September the Taoiseach conveyed to President Yeltsin his hopes that the efforts which he and his Government were making to implement political reforms, consolidate democracy and to create a market economy in the Russian Federation would be successful.  I had the opportunity of meeting Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in New York last week and I shall avail of future contacts with him to discuss the situation in Russia and how we can most effectively assist the reform process.</P>
      <P>At our meeting in Luxembourg on Monday last, EC Foreign Ministers issued a statement reiterating our support for President Yeltsin and the reform process. It is now more than ever necessary that the process towards democracy is carried through, and that this should be achieved through free elections which would allow the Russian people to pronounce themselves clearly on their future.</P>

    <P>They deplore the loss of human life in Moscow for which elements hostile to the democratisation process in Russia carry a heavy responsibility, for having deliberately provoked violence in the Russian Parliament and in different parts of the capital.</P>
    <P>The Community and its member states reiterate their support for President Yeltsin and the process of reform.  The Community and its member states stress the importance of early restoration of peaceful and democratic order.</P>
    <P>It is now more than ever necessary that the process towards democracy is carried through, and this should be achieved through free elections which will allow the Russian people to pronounce themselves clearly on their future.</P>

      <P>The unification of Germany has been welcomed from the beginning by Ireland and by the Community. I do not believe that it should be a reason for a slow-down or a halt to European integration.</P>
      <P>The successful incorporation into a new all-German economy of the damaged centralised economy of the former GDR is, of course, a major challenge. The task is all the more complicated because of the international recession and because of the major changes to the economies of many countries in Central and Eastern Europe which in the past provided a ready market for East German goods.  I believe, nevertheless, that the economy of the former Federal Republic which, for more than a generation has been the strongest in Europe, will be able to handle successfully the radical restructuring which is necessary within the territory of the former GDR, which, together with it, now forms part of a single German economy.</P>
      <P>The European Community has already indicated its willingness to help in the process of integrating the eastern parts of Germany.  Under the Structural Fund package agreed in July these areas have been classified as Objective 1 Regions. Other policies, such as those related to the construction of Trans-European Networks, will also contribute to the integration and development of these areas.</P>

      <P>Ireland is participating fully in the new arrangements being worked out to give effect to the consular provisions of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 8 (c) of the Treaty provides that <Col N="99" />&ldquo;every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the member state of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any member state, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State. Before 31 December 1993, member states shall establish the necessary rules among themselves and start the international negotiations required to secure this protection&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first stage in implementation of this Treaty provision was the elaboration of new guidelines, which came into effect on 1 July this year, for the protection of unrepresented EC nationals by EC missions in third countries.  These guidelines concern assistance in emergency situations such as death, serious accident or illness, arrest or detention, assistance to victims of violent crime and relief and repatriation of distressed EC nationals. The next step will be the introduction shortly of common format Emergency Travel Documents from EC nationals whose passports are lost or stolen.</P>
    <P>These new EC arrangements will not replace existing bilateral arrangements e.g. those between ourselves and the UK for the protection of Irish citizens in places where there is no Irish mission. However, I welcome the fact that the range of consular protection afforded to Irish citizens in countries where we do not have diplomatic representation will now be broadened and put on a more formal basis.</P>

      <P>The Special European Council of 16 October, 1992 held in Birmingham issued a declaration on &ldquo;A Community close to its citizens&rdquo;.  The Birmingham Declaration expressed the determination of Heads of State and Government to respond to the concerns that had been raised in public debate in the member states in the course of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>On foot of this declaration the Edinburgh European Council of 11-12 December, 1992 adopted a number of specific measures aimed at bridging the gap between the Community institutions and the citizen.  These measures include open debates in the Council of Ministers on work programmes and on major initiatives of public interest, better background information on Council decisions and greater efforts when drafting Council conclusions to make them comprehensible to the public.  Since the Edinburgh European Council, debates in the various Councils have been televised.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also opened up its decision-making processes through the publication of its work programme and the greater use of Green Papers.  Commissioner Pinheiro has been given overall responsibility for information policy in the Commission.  The role of the Commission is very important as it has the task both of proposing and executing Community legislation.</P>
      <P>At national level the Government are committed to making Community issues more comprehensible and to improving the level of public debate.  The establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is a major step in this direction.  In addition, following consideration of the experience gained during last year's Referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, a number of measures will be implemented to ensure greater understanding of the Community agenda.  These include a more systematic briefing of the media on EC issues, a new format for the Government's six-monthly reports on EC developments and greater participation by Ministers and officials in conferences and sessions on EC affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the Revenue Commissioners' practice in relation to the charging of stamp duty on immovable property which is subject to VAT. Stamp duty is levied on the total consideration paid by a purchaser to a vendor in respect of chargeable transactions.  Where VAT is payable on a property transaction that is subject to stamp duty, the amount of VAT payable forms part of the consideration on which duty is levied, just as, for example, any PAYE or PRSI costs included in the purchase price of the property would form part of the consideration for stamp duty purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Property transactions which give rise to a charge to VAT and stamp duty are generally those where the property is developed and sold in the course of the <Col N="106" /> vendor's business and the property does not qualify for an exemption from stamp duty (new houses or apartments with a floor area not exceeding 125 square metres are exempt from stamp duty).</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the practice followed by the Revenue Commissioners in this area is appropriate and in accordance with existing legislation.  However, there appears to be some uncertainty in the legal and accountancy professions as regards the interaction of stamp duty and VAT and I understand that the Commissioners are preparing a Statement of Practice which will clarify the issues and procedures involved.  It is hoped that this statement will be available in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of exchange controls by EC member states, including Ireland, in order to allow free movement of capital was related to the desire for a fully-functioning internal market in capital and investment and was not part of our obligations to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).  The ERM still exists and Ireland is still a member of it.</P>
      <P>I have seen the comments by the President of the European Commission to which Deputy Hogan refers.  I would point out that President Delors did not call directly for partial reintroduction of controls on the movement of capital, but rather said that he did not see why methods of limiting movements of capital should not be studied at international level or why there should not be some &ldquo;rules of the game&rdquo;; he gave as an example of a possible rule, a requirement for minimum amounts of cover in respect of movements of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic point being made by President <Col N="107" /> Delors was that the balance of power between the markets and Central Banks has changed significantly in favour of the markets over recent years.  It may be that some form of regulation might be of value to somewhat redress this balance, but any such action would need very careful study and would need to be decided upon, and applied, on a wide international basis if it were to be fully effective.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to reintroduce exchange controls, which Ireland abolished on a phased basis over the period 1988 to 1992, and I would point out that Article 73 of the Treaty on European Union will in any event prohibit their use with effect from 1 January 1994 except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <Quest>if he will allow the new tax treatment of redundancy sums to apply to people made redundant from the beginning of the new tax year 1993 as applies to all other tax matters; and if he will give the number of redundancies that have been drawn to his attention for the period 6 April to 6 May 1993.</Quest>

      <P>I would not be prepared to provide for retrospection in relation to the tax treatment of redundancy payments which has effect as and from 6 May 1993.  The new provisions apply to payments made on or after 6 May as this was the date on which I first announced changes in this area.  To provide for retrospection would set an unwelcome precedent for the introduction or alteration of reliefs in the future which would have major implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the question of redundancy statistics is one for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I have been advised by his Department that statistics under the Redundancy Payments Acts relate to proposed redundancies notified by employers to the Department of Enterprise and Employment. In the period referred to by the Deputy a total of 1,430 redundancies <Col N="109" /> were notified to the Department.  It is important to recognise that these figures relate to proposed redundancies and not to actual redundancies.</P>

      <P>The procurement of clothing for the Garda Síochána is the responsibility of the Government Supplies Agency.  All procurement of Supplies and Services undertaken by the Agency on behalf of Departments and Offices is done in accordance with the Government Contracts Procedures laid down by the Department of Finance and in compliance with all relevant EC Directives on procurement.</P>
      <P>Under the EC Services and Supplies Directives all requirements for goods and services of a certain limit (approx. £100,000) at present must be advertised in the EC Journal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A requirement for supply of 2,365 Garda patrol suits (weatherproof) in 1993 was placed with the Agency by the Department of Justice.  As the estimated value of the suits was in excess of <Col N="110" /> £100,000 the contract had to be advertised in the EC Journal.</P>
    <P>The patrol suit was first introduced in 1991 as a replacement for the ordinary weatherproof overcoat worn by the gardaí.  An open tender competition for that supply was advertised in the EC Journal.  The recent advertisement for the supply of suits in 1993 has been a follow on to that procedure.</P>
    <P>In the competition held a total of thirteen valid tenders were received (six Irish and seven UK).  A total of seven tenders were received for Goretex material which was the original fabric selected by the Department of Justice in the manufacture of the patrol suits in the years 1991 and 1992.  The Garda authorities decided that Goretex was the only suitable fabric on this occasion also.  The lowest tender was submitted by Blagden Annis Ltd., Glasgow, who were awarded the contract for a revised requirement of 1,100 suits.  In addition to price, this firm satisfied the other criteria set out in the conditions of contract.  The prices tendered for the Goretex material ranged up to 22.5 per cent over the lowest.</P>
    <P>A contract for 265 patrol suits in two alternative fabrics i.e. Cyclone and Aquatex was placed with Hydrophast Weatherwear Ltd., Dublin.  These suits will be test-worn over a period of twelve months to evaluate their suitability.</P>
    <P>The basic patrol suit is not an item in respect of which security considerations could be invoked for tender purposes. The accessories supplied for the patrol suit are made in Ireland.  The items issued to manufacturers are closely monitored and at the end of production reconciliation procedures are carried out to ensure that any surplus stock is returned to the Agency's stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Civil Service pension scheme, the rule which provides that allowances are pensionable only if they are paid during the final three years of service is contained in the Superannuation Acts which govern the scheme &mdash; the specific statutory provision from which the rule derives is section 28 of the Superannuation Act, 1834.</P>
      <P>I should add that this rule is not confined to the Civil Service but is a standard feature of pension schemes throughout the entire public sector.  Broadly similar arrangements apply in the case of private sector pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The total number of retired civil servants whose pensions are based on allowances in addition to basic salary is approximately 1,500.  This figure includes some 230 retired members of the prison service.</P>
      <P>A summary of the various rules governing Civil Service pensions, including the rules concerning the reckoning of allowances, is contained in a booklet produced by my Department entitled <i>Civil Service Superannuation: Your Questions Answered.</i>  This booklet is available to all civil servants, and any supplementary information which an individual officer may require can be obtained from the personnel section of his-her Department.</P>
      <P>As indicated above, the current rules governing the reckoning of allowances for pension purposes are of long standing and apply across the public sector as a whole.  In these circumstances, and bearing in mind the cost implications for the Exchequer and other public sector employers, I do not consider that a change in these rules would be warranted.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the subsistence expenses granted by the Revenue Commissioners to employees visiting abroad; the origin of such guidelines; and if his attention has been drawn to the dissatisfaction of employees with these guidelines, to their reluctance to travel and, in some cases to their refusal to travel which has a detrimental effect on the overall economy.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any significant dissatisfaction in regard to the taxation of subsistence expenses.  Strictly speaking expenses allowances are chargeable to tax under the ordinary rules of Schedule E and are liable to PAYE, PRSI and levies.  However, Rule 3, Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides a measure of relief for individuals incurring expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their office or employment.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid the need for deduction of PAYE and subsequent repayment claims in respect of expenses payments the Revenue Commissioners may, in certain circumstances, enter into an arrangement with an employer to allow such payments to be made tax-free to an employee.  The scale of subsistence allowances agreed for the purposes of this arrangement must no more than reimburse the employee for the actual costs incurred.  As a rule the rates of subsistence payable to civil servants are allowed in the absence of other agreed rates.  These rates are generally in line with the costs to the individual of eating-living away from home.  Where a Civil Service rate is not available for a particular country the United Kingdom Treasury rate for that country, which is calculated on the same basis, is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for approval of other agreed rates are considered on an individual basis.  The level of rates at which subsistence allowances may be made tax-free are examined by reference to the particular facts and circumstances prevailing <Col N="113" /> in each case.  Where no agreed rate applies or where an individual is seeking to be allowed an amount of subsistence over and above the agreed rate then he must submit a fully vouched claim.  Each such case is then examined and the appropriate amounts allowed. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that, having regard to the strict provisions of the legislation, applications for approval are dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>The Government announced in November last their decision not to proceed with the introduction of the new fringe benefits tax, to be levied on all employers, which was envisaged in the 1992 budget.  In arriving at this decision, the Government was influenced in particular by the undesirability of any action that might impact adversely on employment costs.  It also took into account that <Col N="114" /> the advantages of this approach in other countries derived mainly from bringing about effective taxation of certain benefits, such as company cars and preferential loans, for which current taxation arrangements here are basically satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective is to broaden the tax base so as to make possible improvements in income tax which benefit all taxpayers.  While effective taxation of fringe benefits is essential to prevent erosion of the tax base by the proliferation of this form of remuneration and to ensure the basic equity of the tax system, the Government concluded that the best approach was to reinforce the existing arrangements for taxing fringe benefits via income tax.</P>
      <P>The Government therefore asked the Revenue Commissioners to take the necessary steps, through wider recourse to their existing statutory powers and the application of staff resources becoming freed from other areas, to achieve more effective taxation of fringe benefits but within the basic parameters of the existing system.</P>

These excepted categories mainly comprise any children under 15 years of age and/or other people in the household who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon help in an emergency.</P>

    <P>The person concerned applied for a free telephone rental allowance in November 1992.  His household consists of himself and his spouse.  The spouse is currently in receipt of a carer's allowance as she is providing her husband with constant care and attention.

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kildare has been deemed 40 per cent incapable of work in respect of a claim for disablement benefit in view of the fact that his surgeon confirms that he is at least 90 per cent incapable of work and in fact cannot ever return to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme since 14 July 1989.  He is also in receipt of invalidity pension at the rate of £143.50 a week.</P>
      <P>Disablement benefit is payable in respect of the claimant's assessed loss of faculty, either physical and mental, resulting from an accident at work or a prescribed occupational disease.  Disablement benefit is assessed in accordance with detailed rules set out in legislation.  The rate of benefit in each case is determined following an examination by a medical referee.  In reaching a finding, the medical referee has regard to permanent loss of faculty or disfigurement by reference to the normal standard for a healthy person of the same age and sex.  A person could be deemed capable of work and still receive disablement benefit.  Conversely, a person might not be severely disabled in a permanent sense but could be unfit for work. For example, a broken arm might not result in any permanent disablement but would typically render the person incapable of work until it had healed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case in point, medical referees have established two separate issues. Firstly, the person is unfit for work and is likely to remain so.  Secondly, it has been found that he suffers from a disablement <Col N="124" /> directly connected with an accident at work in 1986.  The degree of disablement has been assessed at 35 per cent.  This has been rounded up to 40 per cent and results in a disablement pension of £32.40 a week at present.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision, it is open to him to submit an appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 155 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disablement pension since 1985.  Her rate of payment has varied over the years.  She is currently being paid at the rate appropriate to an assessment of 35 per cent, rounded to 40 per cent for payment purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 June last when the Deputy raised her case by way of Adjournment Motion, I told him that I was satisfied that the case had been dealt with properly and fairly.  However, I urged him to inform her to appeal the case if she was not satisfied with this level of assessment. The further representations which the Deputy made in the case in July were accepted as notice of intention to appeal against the decision and the case was referred to the independent social welfare appeals office for consideration.  The appeals officer proposes to hold an oral hearing of the appeal and this will be held on Wednesday, 20 October 1993.  The <Col N="125" /> person concerned will be notified within the next few days of the detailed arrangements for the appeal hearing.</P>

      <P>The Department regularly receives complaints from members of the public concerning fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  These complaints are always investigated and action taken accordingly.</P>
      <P>I should stress that some reports received are based on perceptions rather than actual abuse.  For example, a person could be working in a self-employed capacity and be entitled to a reduced rate of payment.  A neighbour might be aware that the person concerned was signing but would not know the rate of payment or the number of days being claimed for each week.</P>

      <P>People in receipt of social welfare or health board payments who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payment of a diet supplement is determined by the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board the payment of a diet supplement is based on standard costed diets which are approved by the Irish Nutritional Dietary Institute. The payment is not uniform but reflects the additional cost to the person of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet from their basic social welfare payment.  Diet supplements are reviewed regularly and may be adjusted to follow changes in a person's diet or increases in the persons's basic social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of diet supplements in the Eastern Health Board area is estimated at £1 million.  The Eastern Health Board has advised that there has been no reduction in the level of diet supplements in 1993.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of falling interest rates, the method of calculating interest on lumps sums will be altered in view of the fact that people with an income of £30 to £40 per week are currently being refused non-contributory schemes as interest is being calculated at 10 per cent which is far in excess of the interest rates available.</Quest>

      <P>Under social welfare legislation applicants for social assistance payments who have capital assets such as investments, savings or property other than their home are deemed, for the purposes of means assessment, to have an income from these assets.  In assessing the value of such assets income is calculated on a predetermined yield, with some variations across different schemes.  In most schemes the capital assets are only reckoned to yield income when they are worth more than certain threshold levels. In addition an initial portion of such <Col N="128" /> assets is assessed, in all schemes, at 5 per cent.  The 10 per cent notional rate referred to by the Deputy applies to assets over a certain level under the old age pension and unemployment assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the old age pension scheme a person can have means from all sources of up to £6 per week and still qualify for the maximum pension.  In the case of a married couple this would be £12 per week.  In relation to capital alone, the current regulations allow a married couple to have joint capital of £6,000 and still qualify for the maximum pension.  They could have joint capital of £64,200 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  The question of any changes in the present means-testing arrangements would be a matter to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The latest date for which unemployment figures are available is 24 September 1993, on which date there were 289,900 people on the unemployment register.  (Source: Central Statistics Office).  At present 15,700 people are in receipt of the pre-retirement allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions in section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, people in full-time education are no longer entitled to unemployment assistance during the summer months.  These arrangements do not apply to mature students or people participating in the third level allowance scheme for the long term unemployed. While accurate data is not available it is estimated that the number of students who would previously have applied for unemployment assistance during the summer months and who would no longer be eligible to apply would be up to 12,000.  In this connection I introduced a summer work scheme which allowed students to do community work, voluntary work or work provided by public sector bodies in return for a payment of £400 in respect of the ten week period from 1 July to the end of September. Six thousand students received approval from my Department to participate in the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the reason deductions have been made from the disability benefit of a person (details supplied) in County Meath who took part-time work over a five week period; and his views on whether this level of deduction is disproportionate and constitutes serious discouragement of those on disability benefit from seeking part-time work which might contribute towards their rehabilitation with a view to working on a full-time basis.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rule is that a person may not work while in receipt of disability benefit.  However, the legislation provides that a person may be permitted to work where the work is part-time and is part of a rehabilitation programme.</P>
      <P>Before starting such work, a person must apply in writing for approval from the Department and give details of the employment together with medical evidence on its rehabilitative nature.  There is no trace of any notification or request having been received from the person concerned in relation to the work in question. It has not been suggested by any medical evidence that the work was part of a rehabilitation programme.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed and was paid disability benefit from 26 April 1986 to 18 August 1986.  It subsequently came to light that he had worked on various days during this period as a tote clerk. The deciding officer accordingly disallowed payment for those days.  He was notified of this decision and of his right to appeal.</P>
      <P>The total amount of the overpayment assessed in this case was £373.74.  The amount outstanding and due to be repaid since 1986 was £354.24 when the person was awarded a retirement pension with effect from 8 October 1992.  The current rate of pension payable is £112.80 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that recovering sums irregularly received in a case such as this would discourage bona fide attempts at securing work of a rehabilitative nature. The special arrangements for persons undertaking rehabilitative work are <Col N="131" /> mainly intended for persons with long term disabilities or illness.  In this case the certified cause of incapacity was post operative debility and the period of incapacity was about 16 weeks.</P>
    <P>However, I have had this case reviewed by the recently appointed chief decisions advisory officer.  In the light of his provisional recommendation, deductions are now being suspended.  My Department will be in touch with the person concerned when the examination of the case has been completed.</P>
    <P>I would not like this concession to be viewed as a general signal that over-payments will be waived or reduced.  The new advisory function was recently established by me.  It is currently formulating guidelines on the limited sets of circumstances where leniency may be permissible.</P>

It is estimated that she would be entitled to receive the maximum rate of widow's pension, which is currently £62.60 per week.  She would continue to be entitled to a fuel allowance of £8 per week in the winter heating season.</P>
    <P>The rate of disability benefit payable to a person is determined by his or her earnings.  If the person has no earnings or earnings of less than £25 per week, she is deemed to have earnings of £25.  As the person concerned has no earnings, the lower limit of £25 would be applicable to her case.</P>
    <P>Normallly, a person would not be entitled to receive two social welfare payments simultaneously.  However, if the person concerned opted to transfer to widow's contributory pension, there is legislative provision for payment of half-rate disability benefit for a period of up to 15 months.  At current rates, she would be entitled to receive £12.50 per week disability benefit, subject to medical certification, in addition to a widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that if she opted to change her payment type, she would lose her entitlements to free electricity and free telephone rental allowances, free television licence and free travel pass, as these allowances are not applicable to recipients of widow's pension who are under age 66 years.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied originally for deserted wife's allowance in February 1993.  Her application had to be disallowed as she failed to satisfy the deciding officer that her husband had left her of his own volition.  She did not appeal against the disallowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She reapplied for this allowance in September 1993.  Her file is with the local <Col N="134" /> officer for further investigation.  On completion of inquiries her case will be submitted to a deciding officer.  She will be notified of the outcome without delay.  In the meantime, if the person concerned feels she may be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance, she should contact the community welfare officer at her nearest health board office.</P>

      <P>The person has received equal treatment arrears in respect of disability benefit payments paid between December 1984 and May 1986.</P>
      <P>The arrears paid are known as Phase 1 arrears and were based on the difference between the lower personal rates of benefit paid to certain married women and the rates generally paid during the period in question.  A cheque for £342 was issued to her on 5 March 1993.</P>
      <P>Additional arrears payments are being made to certain persons whose spouse was not also receiving a social welfare payment contemporaneously between December 1984 and November 1986. Arrears due in such cases are typically paid in two instalments and are called Phase 2 instalments.</P>
      <P>This person's late husband was in receipt of disability benefit, including increases for dependents, during the period in question.  Accordingly no arrears under Phase 2 will be payable in this case.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that a more favourable method of assessing the income was applied in this case.  The allowance is now being awarded.  The new decisions advisory office which I recently established has been set up to monitor and review the type of marginal situation which arose in this case.  While I am insisting on a firm line against persons who abuse the system, I am equally anxious that any element of doubt should be applied to the benefit of social welfare customers.</P>

      <P>The social services card introduced by my Department last year will replace various cards, including the signing cards, issued by my Department. These new plastic cards are being introduced on a phased basis.  At this stage, about 200,000 cards have been issued.</P>
      <P>The cards replace the registration cards that were previously issued to people entering the labour force for the first time.  In addition with the movement of cash out of social welfare offices the social services cards will replace the signing cards that are currently in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cards, which are designed to full banking standards, are also being used to assist with unemployment payments at post offices where the counter services have been modernised.  The new card will facilitate easier and quicker access to Social Welfare, Revenue and related <Col N="136" /> services and it is my intention to issue social services cards to every member of the population over the age of 16 over the next few years.</P>

I would of course share the Deputy's view that behaviour which offends standards of decency should be prohibited by law and would make the point that where, in the circumstances of a particular case, the behaviour to which he refers is such as to be contrary to public decency or offend modesty, the offender would still be liable to prosecution under various Statutes, including the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1871 and the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.  It would be for the Court to decide whether in such a case the behaviour complained of was, in the particular circumstances <Col N="144" /> before the Court, contrary to public decency or offended modesty.</P>

      <P>The project, &ldquo;Bridging the Gap&rdquo;, is being established at Everton House under the EC NOW Initiative (New Opportunities for Women) to provide a training and education centre for women in trouble with the law.  The facility will be non-residential and will not be a prison.  The project will be community-based with women participating during normal office hours in the courses provided.  The centre is intended for women aged 17 years and upwards who:</P>
      <P>&mdash;are on daily temporary release from prison;</P>
      <P>&mdash;are on full temporary release from prison and living at home;</P>
      <P>&mdash;who have been through the Prison System but are in need of preliminary pre-training, training and support in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> Women coming directly from prison will be carefully screened and evaluated to ensure that they are suitable and committed to the ideals of the project.  Foundation work will be done with them while in prison.</P>
    <P>Seven staff are being recruited to run the centre giving a high staff-participant ratio which will ensure quality supervision and efficient management of the centre.  It is envisaged that the centre will cater for 10-12 women.  A Management Committee has been set up comprising an official from my Department, Prison Staff, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Vocational Education Committee, the Council for the Status of Women and others.  The Committee are proposing, in consultation with Dublin Corporation, to refurbish the building such that there is minimal change to the external fabric of the house.  Representatives of the Management Committee have met with representatives of local residents' associations and have discussed and written to other interested residents and parties about the project.  I understand the community's concerns for their families, property and livelihood and I will be doing all in my power to ensure that the project is self-contained, that there continues to be consultation with the community and that the project will be so designed as to assuage any of their concerns.  As part of this process, the Management Committee has offered the residents places on the Management Committee so that they can have a say in the development of the project.  The Management Committee has also, subject to agreeing details, offered the residents use of the facility when it is established for evening meetings, group sessions and other activities, etc.  I feel this sort of joint approach is the best way forward.  The community can play a vital role in the very careful development of this project and, in this connection, I have arranged to meet with them next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 690 members of sergeant rank are qualified for promotion to the rank of inspector.  The most recent interviews for promotion to that rank were held in 1992 when a panel of 60 persons was formed.  The person in question (who passed the professional examination for promotion to inspector in 1981 and who has competed in all open interviews for promotion to that rank since then) was one of four female applicants &mdash; three of whom were successful.  Thirteen per cent of male applicants were placed on the panel.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, promotion to any rank in the Garda Síochána is extremely competitive because the number of members who are eligible to compete is far in excess of the number of vacancies.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 560 female members in the force out of a total strength of 10,860.  Their numbers by rank are as follows: garda, 535, sergeant, 22, inspector, 2, superintendent 1. Before 1989, women did not compete on equal terms with men to join the Garda Síochána.  However, approximately one in three candidates now offered a position (following successful interviews at the Civil Service Commission stage) is a woman.  This percentage success rate is roughly proportional to the number of women presenting at interview to join the Garda.  At the most recent competition for promotion to sergeant, 28.5 per cent of female candidates were successful as against 26.4 per cent male candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is an equal opportunities employer.  It is committed to and supports equality of opportunity in employment regardless of gender, creed, colour or marital status.  It is the policy of the Commissioner that the principles <Col N="148" /> and practices of equality of opportunity should apply to recruitment, placement, selection, career development and all other conditions of service to members of the Garda Síochána, and to ensure that no member or job applicant (actual or potential) received less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, creed, colour, or marital status or is disadvantaged by unjustifiable conditions or requirements.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, in addition to requiring compliance with specific legislation which makes discrimination illegal, takes all necessary steps to promote fairness and equal treatment.  All procedures and practices continue to be monitored and reviewed.</P>
    <P>There is no distinction in the duties performed by male and female members unless the interest of privacy and decency dictates otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are now equal opportunities for advancement within the Garda Síochána and I firmly expect to see women rising through the ranks in a significant way in the future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a Garda sub-station was opened in Leixlip in February, 1991.  This sub-station provides the full range of Garda services available at a Garda station.  The sub-station's opening hours are from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 7.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Friday and from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.  The Garda authorities have no proposals at present to alter these arrangements.  Four Gardaí are currently <Col N="149" /> assigned to full-time Community policing duties in Leixlip.</P>
      <P>Following a recent meeting with Leixlip Neighbourhood Watch, public representatives and the town commissioners, Garda management are providing all necessary additional patrols in the Leixlip area from Lucan station and from the Divisional Task Force.  This will ensure a more visible police presence during those periods when there is a likelihood of incidents of disorder or vandalism taking place especially late at night or in the early hours of the morning. Additional patrols will be provided if required and the position in that regard is being kept under constant review.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are strongly of the view that a reduction in outdoor patrolling in Leixlip in favour of an improved office service would amount to a disimprovement in local policing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I would reaffirm what I said in my reply to similar questions on 31 March and 18 May last, that the Government has not taken any decision to withdraw from the European Space Agency.  Such a move would require a formal renunciation of the ESA Convention by the Government and twelve months notice would have to be given. No such notice has been served.  What has been done is to defer payment of our 1993 ESA contribution for the moment in view of budgetary constraints.  The matter will be re examined in the context of the 1994 Estimates.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates assistance to voluntary organisations in Britain which provide advisory and welfare services for Irish emigrants there.  The allocation of this assistance is based on the recommendations of DÍON &mdash; the advisory committee on the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DÍON committee was set up, by the then Department of Labour, in 1984 to advise and report on emigrant welfare <Col N="154" /> services in Britain.  It makes recommendations on the provision of financial assistance to organizations to employ professional workers to assist with the welfare problems of Irish emigrants there.  In 1993 an amount of £500,000 was provided.</P>
    <P>For some years now, the grants made on the advice of DÍON have been confined to British-based organisations with one long-standing exception &mdash; the specific group referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>That group was advised last year that the then Minister had accepted the recommendation of the DÍON Committee that the monies available were more pressingly needed by the voluntary agencies in Britain and he did not propose providing further grant aid for voluntary agencies operating in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to depart from this policy position and therefore I will not be making funds available to the group in question in 1994.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to one of the provisions of the proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time.  The position in relation to this proposal is that the EC Council of Ministers adopted a Common Position on the draft Directive on 30 June, 1993.  The Commission has referred the Common Position to the European Parliament for consideration.  The Parliament, having considered the proposal, may agree that amendments should be <Col N="156" /> submitted to the Commission.  The Commission must then decide whether or not to accept such amendments and must resubmit the proposed Directive to the Council for final adoption.  This procedure is likely to take some months and may result in amendments to the existing text of the proposal.</P>
      <P>The specific point raised by the Deputy refers to a provision in the current text of the proposal which would allow any member State not to apply the proposed 48 hour maximum average weekly working time restrictions.  This proposed provision, which shall be reviewed by the Council not later than ten years after the date of final adoption of the Directive, is subject to the introduction of a number of measures by any member State wishing to avail of the provision.  These measures would have to ensure that an employer could not require an employee to work longer than 48 hours a week on average without his or her agreement to perform such work and that no worker would be subjected to any detriment because he or she was unwilling to agree to perform such work.</P>
      <P>The general implementation date proposed for his Directive is three years after the date on which the proposal is finally adopted.  Therefore, it would be premature to speculate on how any of the draft provisions will be implemented, either in this country or in the United Kingdom, particularly as provisions of the Directive may be changed prior to final adoption. Consequently, I am not in a position at this stage to say how implementation of the proposed provision on maximum average weekly working hours might compare with implementation of the provision in the United Kingdom.  I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that when the Directive is adopted in its final form, it is my intention to consult fully with all interested parties as regards the formulation of national legislation to implement its provisions.</P>

      <P>Consumer protection policy is based primarily on the following legislative measures:</P>
      <P>The Consumer Information Act, 1978 which established the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs and seeks to prevent false or misleading information to consumers about goods, services and prices.</P>
      <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 which governs the contractual relationship between consumers and suppliers of goods or services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991 implements in domestic law provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, requiring that competition in trade and commerce is not <Col N="158" /> distorted.</P>
    <P>The Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991 introduced into Irish Law for the first time, the principle of strict (no-fault) liability and switched the onus of proof, in claims of damages, from consumers to the manufacturers and suppliers.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of consumer legislation and the dissemination of advice/information on them are the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>The following consumer protection measures which are related to the development of the Single Market have been implemented: European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) (Amendment) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 228 of 1991); European Communities (Food Imitations) (Safety) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 265 of 1991), European Communities (Materials and Articles intended to come into Contact with Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 307 of 1991); European Communities (Indication of Prices of Foodstuffs and Non-Food Products) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 329 of 1991); European Communities (Safety of Toys) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 32 of 1990); European Communities (Identification of Foodstuffs Lot) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 110 of 1992); European Communities (Cancellation of Contracts Negotiated away from Business Premises) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 224 of 1989) and European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 134 of 1988).</P>
    <P>A Bill to give effect to Directives 87/102/EEC and 90/88/EEC on Consumer Credit will be introduced during the current Dáil Session.  The proposed Bill will update existing credit legislation relating to hire purchase, moneylending and mortgage loans and will also introduce measures to regulate new types of financing.</P>
    <P>Council Directives 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts and <Col N="159" /> 92/59/EEC on product safety will be implemented in 1994.</P>
    <P>The legislation which I have outlined represents major protection for the consumer and is kept under continuous review in the light of both domestic and European Community developments, including progress on completion of the Single Market.  As regards information, the Director of Consumer Affairs in the exercise of his functions under Section (9) of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, ensured that the consumers are kept informed of their rights.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation have sought funding under the remedial works scheme for 16 of their estates, including Swansnest Court.  The ten estates to which the local authority have given their highest priority have been designated for funding under the scheme, the latest two on the basis of the priority given to them by the Corporation last April.  Due to the financial commitments outstanding on approved projects and the high level of demand for assistance under the scheme from local authorities, it is not possible, at this stage, to designate further Corporation estates for funding under the remedial works scheme.</P>

      <P>Schedules listing the grants allocated under the Amenity/Recreational Facilities Grants Schemes for 1991 and previous years are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The preparation of a statement giving details of each of the 3,607 applications received under the 1991 scheme would absorb a disproportionate amount of staff time.  In any event, this information might more appropriately be obtained directly from the local authorities whose responsibility it was to process the applications.</P>
      <P>There was no provision in my Department's Vote for 1992 or 1993 for a new Amenities/Recreational Facilities Grants Scheme.  The 1993 provision of £1.671 million is to cover the payment of grants allocated under the 1990 and 1991 schemes.  Local authorities have been advised that certified claims for grant payments must be received in my Department by 3 December, 1993.  Payment of grants allocated in 1991 and earlier years will not be made after 31 December, 1993.</P>

        <i>Wexford)</i>: Many different operators and facilities are involved in the collection of waste paper for recycling purposes throughout the country; some of these have been assisted under my Department's recycling grants scheme.  However, my Department does not have details of all the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is substantial capacity in Ireland for the recycling of cardboard and office <Col N="185" /> white materials.  Most other paper forms, including newsprint, are largely exported for recycling.  The extent to which paper recovery for recycling can be further developed will depend to a large degree on the markets available for materials collected.</P>
    <P>These matters arise for consideration in the context of the national strategy which I am preparing to optimise recycling generally in this country.  I propose to hold a consultative seminar in the near future to consider the views and suggestions submitted by various interets on the major recycling study which was published earlier this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 270, 308, 309, 321 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is being asked to approve in the very near future the proposals for submission to the EC Commission regarding the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  Once approved, the submission will be sent to the EC Commission without delay.  Extensions which represent in excess of 1.5 per cent of the area of the country require the approval of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. As our submission will fall into that category, the procedure is, therefore, that, if the Commission accepts it, it will make a detailed proposal to the Council which must consult the European Parliament before making the final decision.  This procedure, which cannot be short-circuited, normally takes up to six months or more.  The question of a Supplementary Estimate in 1993 does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to reclassification of disadvantaged areas, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been reviewing the criteria to apply to More Severely Handicapped Areas, in line with a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment.  On the basis of a revised set of criteria, the Appeals Body will shortly begin work on reclassification of areas which have appealed their current status.  It is expected that the <Col N="200" /> Appeals Body should be able to complete its work on reclassification in a relatively brief period after which it can be submitted to the EC Commission at an early date.  The decision-making process in the case of reclassification does not involve a Council decision.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a scheme to divide this commonage was formulated in 1991.  The shareholders were notified of the details of the proposed scheme and informed of their rights to lodge formal objections.  Since then the Land Commission has been awaiting the final resolution of an appeal to the High Court against the compulsory division of another commonage in County Mayo before continuing with these types of division.  If the shareholders in the Aillemore commonage have reached agreement on the proposed scheme of division they should contact the Land Commission and arrangements will be made to complete this matter using voluntary procedures.</P>

The registered herd owner has, however, been paid all grants due to her under the 1992 cattle and equines headage scheme and December 1992 special beef premium scheme already.  She has been requested to submit documentation in connection with her application under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme and when she does so, her eligibility for grants under that scheme will be considered further.  The advance of the 1993 ewe premium scheme was paid on 25 July 1993.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) was established with a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Proposals for the extension of the gas grid are a matter for the board and are assessed by it in the light of that obligation.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that natural gas is currently available in a number of areas of Meath.  The board keeps the possibility of further extensions of the grid under continuous review and has met with Meath County Council to discuss this issue.  I understand, however, that BGE has no proposals for extending the grid in County Meath in the short term, as the capital cost involved could not be justified, at this time, on the basis of current and projected market opportunity.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility in the area of competition.  The operation of ESB's retailing activities was examined <Col N="228" /> by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, who reported in 1990 to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. In that report, the director concluded that the ESB were not operating unfairly to the detriment of its competitors in using the billing system as a means of collecting repayments on credit purchases of retail goods.  The director did recommend that steps be taken to allow customers to distinguish between debts due for electricity and debts due in respect of sale of appliances.</P>
      <P>In line with this recommendation a new format invoice was introduced in 1992 to distinguish clearly between payment due for supply and instalments due for credit purchases.  In addition, the promotion of electrical appliance sale was confined to three billing periods annually.</P>
      <P>I believe these changes represent a reasonable balance between the needs of the consumers, and other appliance retailers.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a transfer payment to the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme in respect of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta staff members who previously served in the Defence Forces and left prior to 9 September 1968, in view of the fact that several staff members currently considering early retirement under the Aer Lingus restructuring package are affected and there is a precedent from other Government Departments for such a payment.</Quest>

      <P>The Public Sector Transfer Scheme, of which Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are members, provides a mechanism whereby persons employed by member organisations can have prior service with other member bodies reckoned for superannuation purposes by their final employer.  Since the service referred to was given prior to the date on which Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta became members of the transfer scheme, those organisations have discretion as to whether it should be reckoned for benefit purposes under their Superannuation Scheme.  Subject to the agreement of reciprocal arrangements, the State &mdash; in its role as former employer &mdash; would be prepared to make the appropriate contributions provided for under the transfer scheme in respect of the transfer of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it should be noted that in some cases at least, the cost to Aer Lingus/Aer Rianta of providing the enhanced benefits accruing from the transferred service might be more than the contribution income which those bodies would receive under the transfer scheme.  In other words, the reckoning by Aer Lingus/Aer Rianta of pre-1968 Defence Force service could entail extra <Col N="230" /> costs for those organisations.  This is a factor which Aer Lingus/Aer Rianta would have to take into account in deciding whether or not the service in question should be reckoned by them for superannuation purposes.</P>

      <P>The Private Bog Development Grants Scheme which was introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981 was terminated in 1987.  The scheme achieved its main purpose which was to stimulate the development of private peat resources as a source of fuel.

    <P>The position in regard to implementation is:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Items 1, 6 and 9</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Commission have been informed that the enactment of legislation or the making of Statutory Regulations is not required to give effect to these Directives in Ireland.  A notice has been inserted in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in relation to each of the Directives.  The Commission have queried the Irish position and the advice of the Attorney General was sought as to whether the introduction of legislation is necessary to give effect to the Directives. This advice has been received and is being studied.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 2</i>
    </P>
    <P>The requirements of this Directive are being complied with.  Both the Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gáis Éireann are supplying the necessary information and statistics by way of administrative arrangements.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law via the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Items 3-4</i>
    </P>
    <P>The delay in transposing these Directives is due to the complex nature of the transposing regulations and the necessity to consult with a variety of interests.  Statutory provisions for implementation are expected to be made by 31 December, 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 5</i>
    </P>
    <P>A consultation process on this Directive is now at an advanced stage and it is hoped to have the implementation legislation in place in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 7</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Directive is the subject of ongoing correspondence between the Department and the Commission on whether it is necessary to take any special legal measures to implement the Directive in question as its provisions are incapable of practical application in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" />
      <i>Item 8</i>
    </P>
    <P>Statutory provisions for implementation are expected to be made by end December, 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 10</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the interpretation of this Directive has given rise to difficulties for member states, an EC working group consisting of representatives from all member states and under the chairmanship of the Commission is examining the question of its implementation.  The Irish authorities having examined the content of the Directive in considerable detail are of the view that its requirements are either already met by existing legislation or in respect of a small number of particular provisions can be met by administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 11</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the deadline for introducing legislation to comply with the provisions of this Directive is 1 January, 1993, its provisions need not be applied until 1 January, 1994.</P>
    <P>Regulations are currently being drawn up to give effect to the Directive by 1 January, 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 12</i>
    </P>
    <P>Statutory provisions for implementation are expected to be made by end March, 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 13</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the implementation date to introduce legislation to comply with this Directive is 1 July, 1993 the effective date of operation is 1 January, 1994.  The Directive is an enabling instrument and other implementing Directives on specific appliances such as fridges, washing machines and ovens are to follow.  It is not considered necessary to adopt the enabling Directive as a prerequisite to the adoption of the individual Directives dealing with specific appliances.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 14</i>
    </P>
    <P>The question of whether legislation is required to implement the provisions of this Directive is being considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" />
      <i>Item 15</i>
    </P>
    <P>Regulations to implement this Directive which have been cleared by the Parliamentary Draftsman were sent to the Commission for approval on 2 July, 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 16</i>
    </P>
    <P>Heads of Regulations to implement this Directive were sent to the Parliamentary Draftsman on 9 August, 1993 and were forwarded to the Commission for approval on 21 September 1993.</P>
    <P>It is expected that both of these Directives will be implemented by the required date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Item 17</i>
    </P>
    <P>In relation to this item the Council of Ministers passed a resolution on 16 June, 1993 inviting the Commission to propose to the Council before 1 October, 1993 a substantial revision of this Directive.  The Commission's revised proposal is still awaited.  This revision will be examined when received and further consideration will then be given to the implementation of the Directive.</P>

My Department has recently approved the appointment of an additional two speech therapists for the Southern Health Board region to meet priorities identified by the board.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the adequacy of speech and language therapy services in different parts of the country and I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  For this reason almost £200,000 of the £1.5 million provided this year for physical disability services will be devoted to improvements in speech and language therapy services.  I hope to build on these developments in the future. However, the Deputy will appreciate that in the light of competing demands for development of other services for the physically and sensory disabled, improvements in the speech and language therapy services can only come about on a phased basis.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that in disbursing these funds health boards must adhere to the guidelines laid down by my Department. The guidelines are as follows:&mdash; Grants may be allocated to community based projects under the headings: mental and physical handicap, the elderly, psychiatric services, child care services, personal social services (including information and counselling services); at least 70 per cent of the block grant should be allocated to voluntary groups; grants from the block allocation should not be used in substitution for section 65 grants. Particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period.  The health boards should take particular care to assess the ongoing revenue implications in determining the priority of schemes.</P>

      <P>The patient concerned is on the out-patient waiting list for assessment at University College Hospital, Galway.  The Western Health Board has indicated that the patient will be called for assessment in approximately three months time.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of appointments and admissions to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  However, should the patient feel that her condition has deteriorated she should return to her general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of her case directly to the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the £20 million major action programme which I launched early this year is now well underway, and this initiative is being targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  As the Deputy may know, the Western Health Board was allocated £2,192,600 from the <Col N="256" /> waiting list fund which was the largest allocation to any health board.</P>
    <P>Part of this allocation is being used by the board to perform an additional 250 cataract operations this year, which should impact significantly on the average waiting times for patients awaiting such procedures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 349, 351 and 368 together.  The general background to the remuneration of clinical psychologists employed by the health boards, and in the wider public health service, was described in the course of the Adjournment Debate on the motion <Col N="257" /> of Deputy Michael Creed on 24 June. The matter was also raised in the Parliamentary Questions of Deputies Tony Gregory and Richard Bruton on that same date.  The most recent position is that three meetings have been held between representatives of the management side and IMPACT, the trade union representing the clinical psychologists. Those meetings were held on 9 and 28 July and 6 September at the premises of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.</P>
      <P>The last claim which the clinical psychologists had lodged under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Local Government &mdash; Health Services was in 1985.  That claim was heard in July 1987 and an Arbitration Board report (Number 132) issued in July 1988, the findings of which were duly implemented.  This claim had arisen specifically from a previous award to psychologists in the Department of Education. Over the years which followed, psychologists in the Department of Education secured a number of further pay increases under their own specific links with other groups in the Civil Service. These increases were not applied to clinical psychologists under the health boards.  No claim for application of these increases was lodged until 1992 and it is that claim, seeking restoration of traditional relationships with the relevant Department of Education grades, which is now under discussion.</P>
      <P>The management side in the negotiations have already agreed in principle to full restoration of the traditional relationship with the Department of Education pay scales, without phasing, with effect from 1 January 1994.  This would translate into an instantaneous pay increase of approximately 24-27 per cent for health board clinical psychologists with effect from that date, depending on their grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently some 203 psychologists employed in the public health service.  These staff numbers refer to 183 whole time equivalent posts.  The cost of restoring this relationship from 1 January, <Col N="258" /> 1994 would be £1.3 million per annum.</P>

      <P>I understand the anxiety of persons wishing to adopt a child abroad to have an <Col N="271" /> early assessment of their suitability carried out by the health boards.  I am generally satisfied that the boards are responding as expeditiously as possible to requests for assessments, bearing in mind the competing demands for services, particularly in relation to the investigation of child abuse cases which, as the Deputies will appreciate, must take priority over all other work in the child care area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that prospective adopting parents living in the Eastern Health Board area are experiencing some delays in having their assessments commenced on account of the very large number of applications received by the health board.  I am currently in contact with the chief executive officer of the board to see what can be done to improve the position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 366 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a submission from the Heart Children Association requesting an automatic entitlement to medical cards for children with congenital heart problems and have given it careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, particularly given the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one, and I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to <Col N="274" /> applications made on the grounds of special medical needs.</P>

    <P>Comparable information is not available for 1990.</P>
    <P>What is not clear, however, from the information available to my Department is the proportion of those on waiting lists who require immediate placement and the level of care they require.  Nor does it indicate those who with the provision of other services such as day services or home support services may not immediately require residential placement or <Col N="275" /> those who at some stage in the future will require residential care.  At present my Department is involved in discussions with the health boards and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap concerning the establishment of a database.  This system will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the numbers of people with mental handicap in each region, the number in services and awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that an additional £8.5 million was made available in 1993 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap. Of the additional funding, £4 million was allocated to the health board regions from which £1.750 million was allocated to the eastern region.  This is in addition to the £2.650 million made available to the region last year for the development of services for people with mental handicap which is being repeated this year.</P>
    <P>The actual additional services being put in place in the Eastern region include ten emergency places, 30 residential places (including respite care), 65 day care places and extended home support services.  Provision was also made in respect of the commissioning of additional facilities in the Daughters of Charity Services, Navan Road and towards the improvement of services in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.</P>
    <P>A further £2 million was made available to strengthen the budgets of direct funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.  As many of these agencies provide services in more than one health board area, it is not possible to say how much of the <Col N="276" /> additional money is going to each area. A high percentage, however, would have been used in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Provision was also made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives being put in place this year. The allocation of the £2.500 million capital, of which £850,000 was allocated to the Eastern region, was directly related to the service developments agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Planning Committee and approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>The additional resources to be approved in 1994 for the development of services for people with mental handicap will be the subject of discussions with the Minister for Finance in the context of the budgetary arrangements for 1994.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Southern Health Board has decided not to fill the vacant position of general practitioner in the Castletownbere area owing to financial constraints; and in view of the effect this decision will have on the inhabitants of the Beara Peninsula, including Bere Island and Dursey Island, if he will issue a directive and appropriate finance to the board to fill this vacancy.</Quest>

      <P>The decision to fill a vacancy or to dissipate a general medical services panel on the retirement of a participating general practitioner is a management function of the chief executive officer of a health board.  In exercising this function a chief executive officer must ensure that patients have a proper level of access to general practitioner services and a reasonable degree of choice in selecting a general practitioner having due regard to the question of viability of practices in the area in question.</P>
      <P>I had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board and I am informed that the doctor referred to by the Deputy who retired from the GMS scheme in August, 1993 had her principal centre of practice at Castletownbere, County Cork.  Her GMS panel consisted of 115 patients, which was a particularly small panel relative to panel sizes in the board's area where the average panel size is approximately 650 patients.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are two other doctors participating in the scheme whose principal centre of practice is also Castletownbere.  Given the number of GMS patients in the Castletownbere area, including the islands referred to by the Deputy, the board is satisfied that these participating doctors will provide an effective general practitioner service for all GMS patients in line with the criteria set out above.  Accordingly, the board was satisfied that there was no necessity to appoint a replacement doctor.  Patients on the panel of the retired doctor are being transferred to one of the participating doctors of their choice in the area.  The Irish Medical Organisation was consulted prior to the decision of the board.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of funding, the Deputy will be aware that the principal system of remuneration of participating doctors under the GMS is by way of capitation payments per individual patient.  Accordingly, medical card patients who were on the panel of the retired doctor will continue to avail of general practitioner services under the scheme and in respect of which capitation payments will continue to be made.  In such circumstances, funding to support the general practitioner services for these patients was not relevant to the board's decision.</P>

      <P>I assume that the inquiry referred to by the Deputy, is the report I requested from my Department's inspectorate in May 1993.  The report, which was in the form of an internal report for the information of senior officials of my Department, was requested in order to assist in arriving at a decision on the teaching staff numbers warranted at the school.  Should the school develop and enrolments increase in the future, the question of the teaching staff numbers may be reviewed under the normal regulations applying.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Mary's national school, Saggart, County Dublin, there were 92 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30 September 1992.  This enrolment warrants a staff of principal plus two assistant teachers for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>

      <P>The ERASMUS programme, which is being funded by the EC, encourages third level students to pursue their studies for a period of up to one year in another member state.  While participating in the programme, students receive a grant from the EC Commission towards travel and maintenance costs. Irish students who avail of the programme pay tuition fees to their home institutions but incur no tuition fees to their host institutions in the other member state.  Thus Irish participants in the ERASMUS programme are being treated in the same way as all other Irish students in so far as the payment of fees is concerned.</P>
      <P>Similarly, students from other member states pay no fees to Irish institutions. Therefore there is no financial gain to the Irish institutions as they incur the costs associated with these students.</P>

      <P>During the Dáil and Seanad debate on the provision of a regional technical college in Castlebar and the general provision of higher education on a nation-wide basis I made a commitment to visit four centres which over a period of years have been seeking regional technical colleges.  These centres are Blanchardstown, <Col N="289" /> Dún Laoghaire, Castlebar and Thurles.  I honoured this commitment over a two-month period before the summer holdiays.  I met the local vocational education committees and other interested parties for each area and gave them an opportunity to put their case to me.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dún Laoghaire I met the local vocational education committee on 31 May 1993.  In the course of making their case for a regional technical college for Dún Laoghaire they referred to the existence of the College of Art and Design on the Carriglea site and made the case for the establishment of the regional technical college on this site.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have asked a Steering Committee, established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, to advise me on the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.  The Steering Committee will prepare projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education and the corresponding needs required by the sector to facilitate these enrolments.</P>
      <P>The committee will carry out a comprehensive needs analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations together with the needs of students and the world of work.  The committee will also focus on the appropriate provision for mature students as well as the need to provide access to third level education for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>As indicated by me in the Dáil, the work of the committee, will have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations. The committee will commence its work immediately and will report to me no later than 30 June 1994.</P>

Where a demand for such a school is demonstrated and there is no alternative within a reasonable distance, my Department, subject to certain conditions, will sanction a new Gaelscoil.

Furthermore, my Department provides 100 per cent of the cost of site aquisition and the provision of new buildings or extension-renovations to existing buildings for Gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the <i>Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> gave an undertaking to continue to promote and support Gaelscoileanna outside the Gaeltacht and to provide them with all the necessary back up support.</P>

      <P>The approval of remedial and resource teacher posts in a particular year is governed by the teaching resources available in that year.

      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint a substantial number of additional teachers in the coming years.

      <P>The ordinary fees payable by school candidates for entry to the 1994 Certificate Examinations are as folllows: Leaving Certificate, £44; Junior Certificate, £41.</P>
      <P>My Department implements a scheme to provide alleviation of fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  For this purpose a total of more than £374,000 has been allocated to recognised schools and vocational education committees in respect of the 1994 examinations.  The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under this scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deductions not exceeding the specified amount already notified to each school.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Repeat&rdquo; fee payable by candidates who are attending school with a view to repeating the Leaving Certificate is £120.</P>
      <P>Where, however, the parent or guardian of a school candidate repeating the examination is the holder of a current Medical Card only the ordinary fee payable, £44, by first-time candidates applies.</P>
      <P>I should add that a candidate attending school with a view to repeating the Leaving Certificate and who was already due to pay a reduced fee arising from possession of a Medical Card, could have the fee further reduced at the discretion of the school authority under the scheme already described above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The ordinary fees payable by external, (i.e. non-school), candidates for entry to the Leaving Certificate examination are as follows: £44 for one subject; £88 for two subjects; £132 for three or more subjects.</P>
    <P>The following reduced fees apply where an external candidate is the holder of a current Medical Card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current Medical Card: £18 for one subject; £33 for two subjects; £44 for three or more subjects.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grant for primary schools.  This enabled an increase of £5 to be provided in the standard rate of grant bringing it to a level of £33 per pupil with pro-rata increases for certain other categories of school.  It also enables certain additional funds, as referred to below, to be allocated to disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The Scheme of Assistance for Schools in designated areas of Disadvantage provides for concessionary teaching posts as well as additional financial assistance for the schools concerned.  The level of assistance currently stands at £17 per pupil which is comprised of (i) a supplementary capitation grant of £10 per pupil, (ii) a grant of £5 per pupil for books and materials and (ii) £2 per pupil towards home/school/community liaison initiatives.</P>
      <P>All the primary schools in the Ballymun area have been included in the Disadvantaged Scheme and have been allocated a total of 12 concessionary posts to date in addition to the extra grants outlined above.  Also, six of these schools have the services of full-time home/school/community liaison co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of my policy of targeting additional resources at schools serving children from disadvantaged areas, I am also making an additional £250,000 available this year to alleviate the burden on certain schools in disadvantaged areas who are in severe financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the allocation of this fund will be announced shortly.  I can assure the Deputy that the case for the schools in the Ballymun area will be fully considered in this process.</P>

This may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated and that no extra cost is incurred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's request for an extension to an existing service in order to link up with the Clane service cannot be allowed because it would be an encroachment into the neighbouring catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is satisfied that places are available in Clane.  I have also been informed that the pick-up point for transport <Col N="304" /> to Clane is 2.9 miles from Ardclough.</P>

      <P>Clane Community School has sufficient accommodation to cater for the demand for pupil places in the area. Accordingly, it is not proposed to provide an extension to the school.</P>
      <P>Due to the demand on capital resources available and the necessity to give priority to the provision of essential school places it has not been possible to make funding available for the provision of physical education facilities at this school.  The provision of indoor sports accommodation in existing schools, such as Clane Community School will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

      <P>In that light, my Department considers that a new post-primary school for girls, to cater for 700 in the short term and 550 in the long term, is required and that the school should be located as near to the existing Salesian Boys College as possible to facilitate co-operation, in view of the likely long term fall in pupil numbers.  My Department is in communication with the Salesian Order with a view to purchasing a suitable site for the proposed new school.</P>
      <P>The proposed project will be considered in due course for inclusion in the capital programme for 1994 in the light of objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.</P>

      <P>My Department informed post-primary school authorities on 7 July 1993 of the interim arrangements for pupils entering senior cycle in September, 1994. These arrangements include provision for the transition year programme. Material on the curriculum for that programme and the senior certificate programme will be issued to all post-primary schools during this school term.</P>
      <P>Schools will then be invited to indicate what senior cycle structure they wish to make available to pupils in the school year 1994-95.</P>
      <P>In the case of Maynooth post-primary school it has been agreed with County Kildare Vocational Education Committee to provide an additional seven classrooms, including specialist accommodation, at this school.  The planning arrangements for the proposed extension are under discussion with the vocational educational committee at present.  On completion of architectural planning the project will be considered for inclusion in the 1994 capital programme, in the light of the resources available and the demands on these resources.</P>

The question of retrospective grant for the sports hall at St. Mary's Secondary School has been considered and having regard to all the circumstances I am satisfied that payment of a grant is not warranted.</P>
      <P>As my Department had no involvement in the provision of the sports hall, other than at the preliminary stage of planning, it is not possible to comment as to whether the project was carried out in a satisfactory manner or whether it represents good value for money.</P>
      <P>When the requirements of the college were established in 1985 it was agreed that there was a need for a sports hall. Subsequently, however, as with all similar proposals, the provision of the sports hall had to be deferred as all available financial resources were needed to provide essential teaching spaces.</P>

      <P>I very much regret the delay in responding to the Deputy's earlier representations. This arose because my Department is engaged in ongoing efforts to arrive at a resolution of the problem. The Deputy will appreciate that the special transport needs of such children, coupled with their wide dispersal throughout the country, present particular difficulties.</P>
      <P>A very large investment in specially adapted vehicles would be required to give the children the sort of service one might wish, and, added to that, the running costs would be extremely high.

Similarly, private contractors are not prepared to invest in these vehicles because of their limited use.</P>

In the case in question, grant support for private transport arrangement is being paid in respect of one of the children involved, while the other two are availing of special school <Col N="313" /> transport services.  However, I know that this arrangement is not entirely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the possibility for alternative arrangements based on increased grant support to meet the special needs of this case and I will advise the Deputy of the outcome as soon as possible.  I should also mention that the Special Education Review Committee, whose report I expect very shortly, has been considering the question of school transport for handicapped children.  I will be giving the committee's recommendations early consideration, in order to ensure that the needs of such children are responded to in the most positive way possible.</P>

      <P>The children from the Moycullen area are eligible for transport to post-primary centres within their respective catchment areas.  However, some parents chose to send their children to school in Galway city which is not their catchment area.  Consequently, the most they can be offered by my Department is concessionary transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended.</P>
      <P>Catchment boundary transport may be allowed, provided seats are available on an existing service after all eligible pupils have been accommodated.  The other proviso is that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of using a larger or extra bus, or by rerouting an existing service. Children from the Moycullen area have been availing of transport under these conditions.</P>
      <P>However, at the start of the school-year, it emerged that it would not be possible to accommodate all the applicants for catchment boundary tickets.  I have been advised that the 42 pupils concerned did not apply for tickets until August, even though the closing date, of which they had been notified, was 23 July 1993.  All pupils who applied before or by the closing date were issued with tickets before the term commenced.  It has since become possible to issue tickets to 18 of the 42 late applicants.  When this was being done, priority was given to students who would be sitting examinations at the end of the school year.</P>
