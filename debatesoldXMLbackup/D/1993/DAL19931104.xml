      <P>I am tone deaf, as the House knows, unlike the Taoiseach who is very musical.  There is a provision in the Order of Business for the Minister to be called upon to make a statement in reply.  The last time we had a procedure of statements in regard to the national plan the Tánaiste replied with a statement that had clearly been written before the debate took place and contained no reply to any of the speakers who spoke in the debate.  I ask that the Minister, or Minister of State, who is replying be here for the debate and endeavour to reply to any points made that require a reply rather than reading a prepared script.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Friday last, 29 October, accompanied by <Col N="1037" /> the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt.</P>
      <P>The special meeting of the European Council took place on the eve of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union and the Council adopted a declaration to mark the occasion. The Government also issued a statement on the treaty's entry into force.  I have had both laid before each House of the Oireachtas, together with the conclusions of the European Council.</P>
      <P>The declaration adopted by the European Council on the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union restates in clear language the vision of the treaty and draws the lessons from the intense debate which its ratification occasioned.</P>
      <P>The declaration notes that the import of the treaty consists of four simple ideas. First, greater economic prosperity &mdash; that the progressive implementation of economic and monetary union in an extension of the Single Market must provide a stable framework for healthy, durable economic growth that creates jobs. Second, greater external influence &mdash; that the implementation of a common foreign and security policy will enable the union to assume its responsibilities in the service of peace and international co-operation.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputy O'Keeffe for the entertainment he is providing while we are waiting for the script.</P>
      <P>Third, greater effectiveness &mdash; provided by a more structured and unified institutional framework, so that in particular greater control can be achieved over those of society's problems that run across frontiers, such as drugs, organised crime and illegal immigration.  Fourth, greater democracy in every form and at every level, whether it involves the internal interplay of the union's own institutions or relations between the union, the member states and citizens. These are concepts and principles that I suggest all of us in this House can enthusiastically support.  The task now facing the Community is to make them a reality, to get ahead with making the treaty work for all our peoples.</P>
      <P>Overall, last Friday's meeting was a very businesslike one, which has given the necessary impetus to the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.  The summit confirmed the objective of creating economic and monetary union according to the calendar set out in the Maastricht Treaty and that the second stage will commence on 1 January next. We also decided that Frankfurt will be the seat of the European Monetary Institute and that Baron Lamfalussy, the managing director of the Bank for International Settlements, will be the president designate of the institute.  Finally, in the context of European Monetary Union we re-emphasised the importance of convergence of economic policies and confirmed that respect for all Maastricht criteria is a key element in the process. The clear message of these decisions is that European Monetary Union remains on course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to implementation of the common foreign and security policy, we <Col N="1039" /> decided on a number of areas in which we will implement joint actions.  The areas in question are: promotion of stability and peace in Europe, as envisaged in the plan put forward by Prime Minister Balladur; support for the peace process in the Middle East by mobilising the political, economic and financial means of the European Union; support for the process of democratic and multiracial transition in South Africa through a programme of assistance for the preparation of the elections and through sending observers to them and by putting in place a co-operation framework to consolidate the economic and social underpinnings of the transition; the search for a negotiated and durable solution to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, a substantial contribution to the implementation of a peace plan and support for humanitarian action; support for the democratic process begun in Russia, including despatch of a mission of observers to the parliamentary elections on 12 December. This commitment to joint action across a whole range of issues affirms the determination of the member states to the meaningful implementation of a common foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Turning to the area of co-operation in justice and home affairs, the summit asked the council to prepare and submit to our December meeting a precise plan of action, including: the arrangements needed for the speedy establishment of Europol; the Europol Convention must be concluded and the drug unit must be in operation by October 1994; effective measures in the fight against drugs, including steps to combat the laundering of profits from illegal activities; joint action in the area of asylum law and drawing up of the list of third countries, whose citizens will require visas to enter the European Union.  All would agree that this represents a comprehensive agenda under a key heading of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>The special European Council also agreed a package on the seats of a range of community agencies and services. Ireland achieved a very solid result in <Col N="1040" /> securing the Veterinary Inspection and Plant Health Office and, in addition, agreement on the expansion of the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in Loughlinstown, County Dublin, by assigning additional functions to it.  The Veterinary Inspection and Plant Health Office will employ upwards of 100 people, a number that will grow over time.  The work of the agency will be directed at ensuring that both in the Community and in third countries exporting to it the high standards of animal and plant health set by the Community are uniformly met, in the interests of both producers and consumers. Ireland, with its healthy natural environment and freedom from many of the more serious animal and plant diseases and with its important agricultural industry, is an obvious location.</P>
    <P>The decisions on the locations had to be unanimous.  This gave a powerful lever to the UK which made securing the Medicines Agency the price of its agreement to drop its objection to Frankfurt.  As the House knows, the Government had mounted a vigorous campaign to secure the Medicines Agency for Dublin as our number one choice, and I wrote the week before last to all Community heads of state or Government pressing our case. However, given the importance of monetary stability and of European Monetary Union for Ireland and the risk to Community integration and, ultimately, to common policies, of a failure to agree, we and the other partners ultimately acquiesced in the Medicines Agency going to London.</P>
    <P>The Presidency Conclusions as regards the adjustments necessary to institutional arrangements consequent on the current EFTA enlargement were fully satisfactory from Ireland's viewpoint.  The European Council requested the Presidency and Council Secretariat to prepare a proposal for these on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen Conclusions. That is the basis that has been upheld by Ireland and the other smaller member states.  The Government has taken the lead in resisting ideas floated in various quarters that would have involved unacceptable <Col N="1041" /> changes in the balance, within the institutional arrangements of the Community, between smaller and larger member states.  I welcome the fact that the European Council agreed on the need to accelerate the EFTA accession negotiations in order to complete them by 1 March 1994 and that we confirmed the objective of accession by 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>The meeting last Friday needs to be viewed in conjunction with our next meeting in December, which will be devoted to the encouragement of economic growth, the enhancement of competitiveness and the promotion of employment in the European Union on the basis of the White Paper on these subjects to be presented by the Commission in December.  In my intervention in Brussels I said that the work of the European Council will be judged on what is done on these issues.  Commission President Delors gave us a progress report on the preparation of the White Paper and we had a useful discussion, which led to a number of specific decisions to further reinforce the Edinburgh Growth Initiative and thus to support the signs of recovery that have begun to show.</P>
    <P>Looking to our December meeting, we were at one that a situation in which there are 17 million people unemployed in the Community and where a significant section of the population are cut off from employment for a lengthy period is intolerable and that, as a priority, every effort must be made to remedy this situation. We accordingly requested the Commission and the Council to put us in a position to take concrete decisions on this front at our December meeting.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of encouraging developments recently affecting the overall Community economy, such as the recent half per cent cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank.  But it is clear that what is needed is a major injection of confidence.  A successful conclusion to the GATT Uruguay Round has major positive potential here.  I made this point in Brussels, while also stressing that an agreement must be equitable and must not place an unfair burden on any one sector or country.  It is therefore <Col N="1042" /> gratifying that the European Council, in declaring that it is more essential than ever to reach a successful outcome within the envisaged deadline, agreed that this must be comprehensive, durable and balanced and in line with the conclusions and guidelines defined by the Council meetings on 20 September and 4 October.</P>
    <P>This was not a summit where grand new initiatives were launched.  It was nevertheless a most encouraging meeting, which took a wide range of necessary and useful decisions, strongly consolidating the successful efforts of the Belgian Presidency to date in rebuilding confidence in the European Union as an entity working purposefully towards realisation of a clear vision of its role in the next millennium.</P>
    <P>Finally, the House will wish to note that on the margins of the meeting I briefly discussed with President Jacques Delors the recent developments in regard to the allocations of Structural Funds. The President confirmed his continuing goodwill to Ireland and the Commission's initial assessment of the high quality of the Development Plan submitted by the Government which should enable us to draw down additional funds.  We now go forward to settle, with the Commission, the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  This is in line with our standard approach to get the best possible decision for Ireland in any particular area and then to move on to the next business.</P>
    <P>I also held a very productive and successful meeting in the margins of the European Council with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  I was joined for the latter part of the meeting by the Tánaiste.  The meeting, which lasted nearly one hour and a quarter and followed on several shorter discussions in the course of the day, was the most substantial ever conducted at a European Council and reflected the gravity with which the two Governments regard the current situation in Northern Ireland. The communiqué reflected the importance of the discussions.  They took place <Col N="1043" /> against the horrific background of the Shankill bombing and sectarian murders, such as the Greysteel massacre and others which occurred in the days that followed and which have created great tension.  We condemned these outrages and expressed deep sympathy for the innocent victims and those who had been injured and bereaved.  We called for restraint from all sides of the community and expressed support for the security forces in their fight against terrorism, noting the recent successes of cross-Border co-operation.  We reiterated our determination to ensure that those who adopted or supported the use of violence for political ends should never succeed.</P>
    <P>I gave the Prime Minister an account of the outcome of the Hume-Adams dialogue in the light of the Government's own assessment of these and other related matters.  We both paid tribute to John Hume's courageous and imaginative efforts.  Indeed, only last week in this House I acknowledged the crucial part he has played in advancing the acceptance of principles which, carried to their logical conclusion, should help bring about peace.  We also affirmed on behalf of both Governments points which I had previously made at Bodenstown and in my Dáil statement last week. Recognising the need for a peace process to be more widely based, we said in Brussels that such a process has to involve the two Governments, conscious of both their international obligations and their wider responsibilities to both communities. We also stated that the two Governments must work together to reach a common understanding in their own terms towards a framework for peace.  Any initiative can only be taken by the two Governments.  This simply reflects the reality of the situation and it of course places an onerous responsibility on both Governments, who have to take a broad view of vital concerns on all sides.</P>
    <P>As I stated last week in the Dáil, the Irish Government has been working for some time past on the elaboration of a formula for peace and our view is that both Governments must work together <Col N="1044" /> to provide a framework.  It is ultimately for the Governments to decide what in their best judgment is likely to produce lasting peace on all sides.</P>
    <P>We set out in the communiqué certain parameters or ground rules, many of them previously stated elsewhere, for instance that: the situation in Northern Ireland should never be changed by violence or the threat of violence; any political settlement must depend on consent freely given.  I would like to make it very clear that what we are talking about here is the consent of a majority to constitutional change, as precisely defined in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Government has in no way departed from that position.</P>
    <P>Other ground rules were: negotiations on a political settlement can only take place between democratic governments and constitutional parties; there could be no secret agreements or understanding with paramilitary organisations; those claiming an interest in peace should renounce violence for good.  The most important point however was the statement that if and when such renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated, new doors could open and both Governments would wish to respond imaginatively.</P>
    <P>We also expressed our support for the talks process and urged the Northern Ireland parties to intensify their efforts to find a basis for new talks.  Both Governments are continuing their discussions to provide a framework to carry the process forward.  It is our intention to hold a further meeting, one of our scheduled biannual summits, in the next four to five weeks prior to the next European Council.  By then it should be clear whether a breakthrough is likely to be possible.  Nobody should underestimate the difficulties and the obstacles that have yet to be overcome.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the support expressed the following day by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, in a statement issued on 30 October, in which he welcomed the efforts of the Irish and British Prime Ministers to reinvigorate the negotiations for peace, <Col N="1045" /> and &ldquo;our common resolve to work for peace, justice and reconciliation in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  He added that &ldquo;the United States stand ready to support this process in any appropriate way.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will prove to be an important step towards peace on this island.  By &ldquo;peace&rdquo; I mean a complete acceptance of one another by the two traditions on this island, not just the absence of violence.</P>
      <P>Mr. John Hume has made a unique contribution towards this goal by devising the concept of dual referenda on an agreed settlement in both parts of this island which reconcile the principle of consent with the common determination of their future by all the people of Ireland.  He has worked this through as a means of removing the claimed, if entirely unjustified, argument for republican violence.  Peace, as I have defined it, cannot of course be brought about solely by any process that is confined to one tradition.</P>
      <P>We have now reached the point where the process must be advanced by dialogue between both traditions on the island. That has been greatly assisted by the six principles enunciated by the Government. These principles should be included in our Constitution.  Unionists should see in this a more durable guarantee of their position than anything they might get from a temporary parliamentary conjuncture at Westminster. They should not engage at this stage in the time-worn minuet, practised from time to time by all sides in the Northern conflict, of moving back a few steps just when the other side is willing to move forward a few steps.  Rather should they seize on what is offered, thereby solidifying it, securing their own position and creating a basis for peace and prosperity for all of us who live on these islands.</P>

    <P>As I have said, I hope that the Reynolds-Major statement provides a basis for a comprehensive peace process. The participants have not assisted the <Col N="1046" /> matters themselves by confusing and apparently conflicting public interpretations of their joint approach.  In the wake of their less than glorious experience interpreting what happened at meetings in Edinburgh and Brussels on another matter, I would have thought that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, in particular, would have been exceptionally careful to ensure that all participants in meetings agree on the interpretation to be placed on the supposed common position afterwards.  That was very carefully done by the then Government at the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and it is just as important now.  The recent meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister was planned long in advance, so there really is no excuse for conflicting interpretations.  It is not possible to speak separately to different audiences.  All audiences must, in the modern television age, get the same meaning from all participants in a meeting.  Otherwise, life is made immeasurably difficult for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The main business of the Summit concerned the future of Europe.  I do not think the Prime Ministers fully understand why Europe has lost such momentum in public opinion during the last two years.  The reason is quite simple. There are two issues about which public opinion in Europe expects the European Community to act &mdash; unemployment and the war in Bosnia, which is on Europe's boundary.  I emphasise that public opinion expects Europe to deal with these two issues, and not merely issue the sort of repetitive hand-wringing declarations that have been tagged on at the back of the conclusions of every European Summit for years, and which have brought these Summits and the Prime Ministers into such disrepute.  Europe is not currently dealing &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;dealing&rdquo;&mdash; either with unemployment or the war in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>Instead, Europe is using its efficient decision-making procedures, based on expert proposals from a well-staffed Commission in a federal context, to deal <Col N="1047" /> with second order problems, for example, the Internal Market, the Common Agricultural Policy and regional issues.  Yet it still tries to deal with first order problems like unemployment and the major war on its boundaries using the old fashioned, amateur, techniques of exhortation and voluntary intergovernmental co-operation. These techniques will not solve the problems of unemployment and the war in Bosnia.  The participants know that these techniques will not work, just as the participants in the non-intervention committee set up in the 1930s to deal with the Spanish Civil War knew that that committee, based on inter-governmentalism, would not &mdash; and did not &mdash; work.  We all know where that failure indirectly led to.</P>
    <P>This is why young people are beginning to lose faith in Europe.  The December Summit can make progress if it is willing to make a political decision to use modern federal decision-making procedures, in other words, the Treaty of Rome and not the intergovernmental pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, to deal with first order problems like unemployment and the war in Bosnia.  This will require a willingness to go well beyond the Maastricht Treaty which is mainly based on intergovernmentalism.  That is the political signal needed from Europe.  Europe did not give this necessary signal at the Brussels Summit.</P>
    <P>Having made those general introductory remarks about the two elements of the Taoiseach's statement, I wish to make a few other comments.  I wish first to refer to Northern Ireland and the historical approach my party has adopted to this matter.  Fine Gael sees the resolution of this problem as a succession of stages, working towards a reconciliation of the people living on this island rather than any territorial concept.  In the light of what happened under so many years of Stormont rule, the first stage was clearly to give the Nationalist community assurances and a sense of security.  This was done by Fine Gael in Government, in coalition with the Labour Party, through <Col N="1048" /> the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I regret that the Fianna Fáil Party at that time opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement. This is a markedly different approach from the one I am now adopting on these benches to the initiatives taken by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Perhaps this, more than anything else, outlines the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in their approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>The next stage is to give the Unionists an equal sense of trust and assurance. This is why Fine Gael, particularly since 1990, has been urging the Government to say clearly that it is willing to amend Articles 2 and 3 because they have been interpreted in a way which the Unionists see as threatening.  It has also been urging the Government to say that it regards both communities in Northern Ireland of equal importance, it does not hold a brief for one community against the other but is concerned with both their interests.  As Leader of this party I have gone out of my way &mdash; no doubt I have sometimes courted unpopularity &mdash; in making sure the Unionist concerns were heard on this side of the Border.  I did this deliberately because I believe there will never be reconciliation between the two peoples on this island until Unionists see that there are people in this House willing to express their concerns.  This is the second stage of the process.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government did not take the advice given to it from these benches.  If it had taken our advice last October in regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and said it would be willing to change them as part of an overall settlement, the talks process between the parties in Northern Ireland would not have broken down.  At that time I was described by the Taoiseach as a crypto-Unionist. I am glad that the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to say &mdash; this is too late in the day for those who have died since last October &mdash; the Government has now adopted the advice given by Fine Gael in regard to Articles 2 and 3 and the need to see both communities of equal concern.  I am glad it has also taken our advice in regard to discussions, direct or indirect, with organisations which continue to support violence.  As soon as the outcome of the Hume-Adams process became known, I made it clear that while I welcomed the concepts which emanated from that in so far as they were a contribution to peace I would not agree to either direct or indirect discussions with Sinn Féin until it gave up its support for violence.  I made that statement within hours of the declaration being published.  Three days later the Government eventually took Fine Gael's advice.  I am glad that that constructive approach from the Opposition has influenced events on this issue, perhaps more than any other Opposition Party in the past has influenced any issue. That was the second stage, and it has been achieved &mdash; the Government has responded quite generously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third stage is for the Unionists to make a move.  I have spoken in the past in a way which ensured that Unionism and Unionist concerns were understood on this side of the Border.  I now say to Unionists it is their turn to make a move; they should not continue to engage in the time-honoured minuet of taking a few <Col N="1050" /> steps backwards merely because somebody else has taken a few steps forward. Unionists should realise that there is greater security for them in an accommodation with Dublin and their Nationalist neighbours than in any agreements they may reach with Britain.  We all know the political policies of some of the other parties in Britain who could well be in office in the not too distant future.  I say to Northern Ireland Nationalists, just as the Unionists have greater security in building a good relationship with Dublin, they perhaps have greater security in building a good relationship with their Unionist neighbours than in relying exclusively on their links with Dublin.  Both communities need to change their perspectives if we are to help them achieve security, peace, reconciliation and a sense of self-worth.</P>
    <P>Of course it would be wrong to assume that a cessation of Provisional IRA violence would automatically lead to a cessation of all violence, if it were purchased by an agreement which is seen by the Unionist community as fundamentally unjust to them, as pushing them into a process from which they could not escape or representing an abandonment of their position which they did not understand and could not accept.  We must come back to the real peace process, the peace process involving both communities on this island.  This is why I welcome the initiative by the Government.  I regret the slowness with which the Government has come to these views.  I question the omission from the Taoiseach's speech of one of the principles contained in the speech of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on a system of Government within Northern Ireland.  This principle, which is part of the overall picture, seems to have disappeared from the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the situation in Europe.  As I said, one of the reasons Europe is failing is that it is not relying on Community action through the Commission which has direct application in member states' law but is relying increasingly on intergovernmental agreements where Governments agree that they will <Col N="1051" /> take action later.  We could have no better example of the failure of inter-governmentalism and its uselessness in dealing with crucial problems like unemployment or Bosnia than in the record of the Irish Government in regard to implementing various declarations made at summits.</P>
    <P>For example, the Lisbon Summit called on member states to ratify the Dublin Convention on Asylum.  That convention was in June of 1992 where it was agreed to protect refugees.  The Irish Government has not yet introduced the legislation to ratify that convention.  In the Conclusions the Brussels Summit referred to the need for intergovernmental co-operation on money laundering and extradition.  The Irish Government has been dragging its feet on introducing legislation on extradition for the last three years.  In regard to money laundering, the Irish Government has been breaking EC law since the beginning of this year by failing to introduce legislation to deal with that question. That proves to this and other Governments that relying on member states to act is not the way forward for Europe.  There must be a capacity for direct European action to be taken and we could have no better examples of that than those I have just illustrated about the Irish Government's failure to respond.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in regard to the problem of drugs, it is essential that Europe is willing to say clearly that it will not give further aid of any kind to those countries, principally in Latin America and in Asia, which continue to derive substantial profits from the production of drugs.  A much more aggressive diplomatic stance is needed from Europe on that matter and that is not evident in the communiqué. Indeed, it has been said that now that the Cold War is over, the war against drugs in the world is the major struggle facing mankind.</P>
    <P>I wish to revert to another point that was made.  The Copenhagen summit called for lower taxes on labour as an assistance towards the problem of unemployment. <Col N="1052" /> How did our Government respond to that declaration to which it put its name?  It introduced a 1 per cent levy to ensure that fewer people would be employed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In December of this year, Europe will approve a White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment.  I was in Brussels yesterday and I discussed this with the Commissioners responsible. That White Paper will be based on exhorting Governments to take action.  There will be little or no direct Community initiatives involved in it.  Again, it will be a reliance on the failed formula of intergovernmentalism, the formula that failed to deliver extradition and asylum law in this country, that has failed to deal with the war in Bosnia and that has failed to deal with almost every problem referred to it.  Voluntary intergovernmental co-operation does not work in Europe.  The European Community was established because it had not worked between the last two wars, as evidenced in Europe's response to the Spanish Civil War which contributed directly to the Second World War.</P>
    <P>We must have a strong federal approach to this matter, particularly in regard to the two issues which are most engaging European public opinion at the present time (1) the internal cancer of unemployment and (2) the external cancer of internecine and inter-ethnic strife in the Balkans.  Europe has failed to act on those two issues and it will not regain the momentum that it so obviously lost.  That can be seen in the results of the Maastricht referenda in Denmark and France.  Europe is not popular at the present time because it has failed to act on the problem of unemployment and failed to act on Bosnia.  The problem is not that Europe is going too far in a federal direction, it is not going far enough in a federal direction in those issues that really matter to people, namely, unemployment and peace.</P>
    <P>The communiqué of this summit is yet another tepid, tired statement from people who really do not quite know where they are going.  I hope that at the December summit there will be a <Col N="1053" /> changed attitude and that there will be a recognition that action must now be taken on a federal basis in regard to the two subjects I have mentioned, unemployment and Bosnia.  If that is done, if European leaders have the courage to lead, then I believe there will be a substantial rekindling of the latent public support that exists for the European Community.  Rather than be cautious. Prime Ministers in December should be daring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the past two years has witnessed a painful collapse of confidence in the dream of European Union.  That dream is most embodied, idealistically and comprehensively, in the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.  How many people in this country or indeed in Europe generally even noticed that the Treaty came into effect last Monday?</P>
      <P>From the initial rejection of that Treaty last year by the Danes to the wobbly &ldquo;oui&rdquo; by the French, right through to the spectacular falling apart of the exchange rate mechanism last August, which was to be the foundry in which a European single currency would be minted, we have witnessed, unfortunately, a depressing array of shortcomings in the realisation of the grand design.</P>
      <P>Of course, here at home the mishandling of the Structural Funds issue by this Government, and its sheer duplicity and deception in not levelling with the Irish people along the way, has played its part in obliterating some of the gloss from the European dream.  The Taoiseach's reference in his statement this morning to President Delors reiterating his goodwill towards Ireland, which we welcome, is not sufficient for what took place last week.  If President Delors, as President of the Community, could not deliver on a promise made, the Taoiseach should not continue to tell us here this morning that more money will be available on foot of the goodwill of Mr. Delors many years after he ceases to be President of the Commission or, indeed, have any involvement in the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe this shattering of the European dream to a large extent more in <Col N="1054" /> sorrow than in anger, since as an ardent European and the Leader of a party fully committed to and inspired by the European Union ideal, I want to see every effort made to reconstruct the process of European unity.</P>
    <P>The ultimate creation of a United States of Europe would undoubtedly have much to offer Ireland, as a small, peripheral economy, highly dependent on secure and growing export markets, through the full realisation and achievement of a tariff-free European market, and a single currency.  That is why I endorse, for instance, the statement of the Presidency Conclusions from last Fri-day's Brussels meeting that the European Council &ldquo;confirm the aim of establishing an Economic and Monetary Union within the period laid down in the Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely the Taoiseach, and indeed his Community colleagues, must realise there is a decided air of unreality about this statement in the absence from their Conclusions of how precisely they hope to realise this early target date of 1997, or the later date of 1999, for the achievement of a single currency in the light of the convulsions and disarray within the ERM that imploded finally last August. The Progressive Democrats have no problem with the restatement of this objective, but clearly the Brussels Summit completely dodged the realities flowing from the events of last August. The narrow 2.25 per cent plus and minus band of fluctuation has disappeared and sterling and the lira are now outside the ERM.  Yet there is simply no indication from the Brussels Conclusions on how the European Community proposes to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.</P>
    <P>This unreality is further underlined by the Brussels decision to propose the establishment of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt.  This is a commitment to build an institution to run an organisation that has effectively collapsed. We need to see evidence from the Community leaders that they are tackling the substantive issues that underpin the process of building monetary union and creating a single currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The second Conclusion of the Presidency last Friday on the common foreign and security policy states that this is to be achieved &ldquo;gradually and pragmatically&rdquo;. I note that the European Council has asked the Council of Foreign Ministers to define the conditions and procedures for &ldquo;joint action&rdquo; in areas like development and co-operation with the States of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa and so on.  I welcome the fact that we are beginning to define what &ldquo;joint action&rdquo; will mean, but again the Summit Conclusions have about them all the vigour of a wish list.  If the building of a common foreign and security policy is a journey of 1,000 miles then we have now merely taken the first few centi-metres.</P>
    <P>Turning to justice and home affairs, there are a number of commitments of immense interest to this country, including the establishment of EUROPOL and the commitment to effective measures to combat drugs, including measures to counter the laundering of profits from illegal activities.  Given that we in Ireland have such a serious drugs problem, that apparently we are now in the era of contract drug-related killings, it is essential that everything possible be done to optimise the level of police co-operation across Europe to seek to stem the deadly drugs traffic to this and other countries and between Community member states.</P>
    <P>In a debate in this House on 16 June last on the EUROPOL motion the Minister for Justice told us that the Minister for Finance was seeking £12 million from our European partners to help to improve our customs infrastructure in relation to drugs.  What was the response and, if we were successful, to what use is the money being put?  EUROPOL is fine to an extent but, essentially, it involves an information-gathering exercise, the exchange of information and the development of research in relation to drugs.  Europe urgently needs to devise common laws in relation to criminal activities generally that are enforceable across the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> In this section on justice and home affairs also I note a commitment to formulating an agreed position on asylum policy, obviously in line with the Dublin Convention.  This is an area in which Ireland's record is seriously deficient. The Progressive Democrats in this House a few months ago supported the efforts of Fine Gael to update our law in the area of human rights in which sadly we have been lacking.  For example, we do not provide access to lawyers for those seeking asylum here; we do not give them a right to go before a court and have their case heard; on many occasions we do not even provide interpreters.  The Programme for Government speaks in lofty tones about ensuring that our policy on asylum seekers will meet the highest international standards and that &ldquo;procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts&rdquo;.  The Programme for Government went on to state that the Government will implement these and I appeal to the Government to implement those procedures without delay.  When the Convention is ratified by the 12 member states apparently we will not have common procedures but will have to accept the decision of any member state; if one member state gives the green light or the red light that will be binding on all member states.  Therefore, we need to get our procedures in order very urgently in this important area of human rights.</P>
    <P>The Brussels Summit Conclusions rightly devote a special section to the growing problem of unemployment across the Community, now standing at 17 million, which is the equivalent of the combined populations of three member states, say, those of Ireland, Belgium and Holland.  In Ireland we are well aware of the intolerable economic and social scandal of mass, long term unemployment. It will be particularly interesting to see what proposals the Community White Paper on Unemployment will propose at the end of the year.  A critical issue that must be addressed is why economic growth within the European Community has failed totally to convert into <Col N="1057" /> jobs on the scale witnessed both in Japan and in the United States.  Arising from this will be the need to explore the balance of rights between those at work, and those out of work.  Indeed, the fundamental labour market factors arising in that respect are as pertinent to us as they are anywhere else in Europe.  The Progressive Democrats have long championed the need to totally reform our anti-work tax system which gives a married person, working, in receipt of a gross income of £8,000 per annum, with a dependent spouse and four dependent children, £231 more than if they earned £15,000 gross income.  That scandal needs to be urgently addressed by the Government. We need to integrate our tax and social welfare systems.  We need to tackle the various poverty and unemployment traps.  We must all look to the balance of rights in our labour law between people at work and the right of the long term unemployed to work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred this morning to the decision taken in Brussels in relation to the location of European Community institutions.  While expressing disappointment that we will get merely the Veterinary Inspection and Plant Health Office and an expansion of the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in Loughlinstown, County Dublin, I am disappointed that once again we have failed to get a substantial European institution located here, the most peripheral country of Europe, that is with the exception of the United Kingdom which is not as peripheral, and which obtained the location in London of the Medicines Agency. After all we must remember we are a small, open economy on the periphery of Europe with enormous social and economic problems.  However, I hasten to add that I consider the Government took the right decision.  It was important that a decision was taken in relation to the location of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt.  In that respect I do not in any way fault the Government; I know how difficult are negotiations in relation to these matters, the difficulties encountered in deciding the balance and <Col N="1058" /> in which direction to move.  I consider the Taoiseach and Government took the right decision but nevertheless I cannot but express my disappointment that, once again, we failed to get the location of a substantial European institution.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Presidency's conclusions on transparency and democracy, I am pleased that the European Parliament will have additional powers but far too many of the decisions taken in Europe are taken behind closed doors, without any transparency or accountability. I note the committee of the regions which will take up office will meet for the first time on 15 January next.  The Taoiseach did not tell us how the Irish group of eight will be elected, whether by the regions, nominated, whether they will be officials, politicians and whether they will broadly represent the political balance in this country.  The Taoiseach should have told us about that because it is important.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the issue of Northern Ireland and the Joint Communiqué issued by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister after the discussions they had which the Taoiseach told us lasted for an hour and a quarter.  I reiterate on my behalf, and that of the Progressive Democrats, our profound sorrow at the appalling stream of death and suffering in Northern Ireland, especially over the past couple of weeks, 23 deaths in just eight days.  This infliction of so much human misery must stop.  There have been more than 3,000 people killed in 25 years.  We have all had enough.  Both communities in Northern Ireland have suffered dreadfully.  The men of violence, on the Loyalist and Republican sides alike, are people of evil and warped minds who must be brought to justice. The daily sight of more and more funerals and coffins, the never-ending flood of broken-hearted tears. must draw a response from even the most stone-hearted.</P>
    <P>That is why I welcome the renewed political dialogue and activity of the past week.  I would also plead with the two Governments, and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, not to drop the <Col N="1059" /> present momentum.  Even if the violence ceases &mdash; certainly I want to see it ended completely &mdash; there must be no let-up in the search for a lasting peace.  Peace will not emerge magically no matter how often certain politicians recite the desire for peace in some mantra-like style. Peace will come only if there is reached in Northern Ireland a comprehensive, balanced and just settlement between the two communities and, reaching out from that, an equitable and balanced Irish and British dimension to reflect the legitimate but equal aspirations of both Nationalists and Unionists within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend warmly the principles enunciated in this House by the Tánaiste last week and also to praise the Taoiseach on his Joint Communiqué with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major.  I might also add that I welcome the clarification yesterday that we are talking about the majority in Northern Ireland and not necessarily the Unionists.  There appeared to be some confusion but I think all of us understood the message. In particular, I endorse the statement in the Taoiseach's communiqué that &ldquo;negotiations on a political settlement can only take place between democratic Governments and parties committed exclusively to constitutional methods&rdquo;.  That communiqué went on to say, &ldquo;consequently there can be no talks or negotiations between their Governments and those who use, threaten or support violence for political ends&rdquo;.  For instance, when we heard Mr. Adams state recently that, in his view, peace was not a pre-condition for involvement in dialogue, followed by the Shankill atrocity and Mr. Adams' role at the funeral of one of the Shankill bombers we must realise the appalling, dangerous vista that some elements were only too eager to conjure up and exploit. Surely we can see the damage which would be done to any possible relations or dialogue with moderate Unionists if they had any reason to believe that the Irish Government was willing to have any truck whatever with the IRA, via Mr. Adams, arising from the report given to them of the Hume/Adams dialogue?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> That is why constitutional politicians have to be careful and consistent.  We must stand firm on fundamental principles. One of those fundamental principles must surely be that there can be no place in any political talks process for people who have not renounced violence and all that that means in the fullest and most unequivocal sense.  In my view it means not just announcing a cessation of violence but that all the weaponry at the disposal of the men of violence is handed up.</P>
    <P>I believe therefore that the Tánaiste's principles and the Taoiseach's joint communiqué were not only positive and correct in what they state but also that they came at a crucial time to arrest what could have otherwise been a slide into even greater anarchy in Northern Ireland.  I believe this is something that will become clearer as time goes by, and hopefully we will get comprehensive talks on a political settlement in Northern Ireland underway at last.  Those talks between the parties may initially have to be carried out on a bilateral basis.  I accept that comprehensive round table talks, such as we had underway last year, may not happen in the first instance and it may be preferable that they take the form of bilateral talks as between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I realise too that the traumatic political developments of the past fortnight have left many Nationalists in Northern Ireland confused and uncertain due to the response in the Republic to the Hume-Adams dialogue.  This underlines genuine Nationalist concerns that have to be taken into account, but they must not deflect us from our fundamental principles.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the construction of a political settlement in Northern Ireland the Nationalist community there must be accorded total equality of participation and recognition in whatever institutional arrangements emerge.  They must be accorded a real power-sharing role and their identity and aspirations as Irish Nationalists must be accorded just as much institutional legitimacy as the British <Col N="1061" /> Loyalism of the Unionist community. That is the only way forward and the only way that lasting peace will emerge.  It will only succeed if both communities feel they are getting a fair deal and that has to be the litmus test of any settlement proposals.</P>
    <P>That too is why I commend my party's proposal that a very valuable and effective way to create a political society in Northern Ireland, which is open to both aspirations and belongs to both traditions, is to enact a Constitution for Northern Ireland which would be intended to put into effect whatever decision is made by the people there from time to time as to whether they should be part of the United Kingdom or part of an all-Ireland community.</P>
    <P>I envisage that such a Constitution would include, and acknowledge, the majoritarian principle laid down in article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement; accord factual and legal equality of esteem to both Unionism and Nationalism; provide for a devolved assembly of 70 or 80 members; provide for an effective sharing by the two communities of executive power; create a Bill of Rights in conformity with those guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights; create a constitutional jurisdiction to vindicate those rights and the superiority of the Constitution over legislative and executive acts; and, finally, would provide for the participation by the Northern Ireland executive institutions in permanent North-South institutions.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks on the outcome of the Brussels Summit I should say that from this country's point of view the most significant development politically was the decision and the joint communiqué issued by the leaders of the two Governments, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.  I should like to say as forcefully as I can that I salute everything in that communiqué and I welcome the fact that I can say that here today.  We have not always had a common approach to Northern Ireland in this House.  Sometimes some people feel that is essential, it is important to have it only when people agree on the approach.  I am happy to <Col N="1062" /> say here today that I fully endorse the comments and the principles spelled out by the Tánaiste here last week and which were reiterated in the communiqué issued by the heads of Government.  I hope that plays some small part in showing people in Northern Ireland that we do care, that we are prepared to accept whatever is acceptable to moderate opinion in Northern Ireland to their constitutional and political parties there, because we want to see peace prevail at last on this small island.  We have witnessed the resolution of problems which seemed to be beyond resolution in many parts of the world.  We must all look forward to the day when we can have peace at last on our small island.</P>

      <P>Clearly, the most significant feature of a European summit that was otherwise very much a nonevent was the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and the subsequent joint statement issued by the two leaders.  It may prove to be a very important development and the vast majority of people on this island will hope that it will come to be seen as a turning point in the search for peace and political progress in Northern Ireland.  Coming only 48 hours after the Tánaiste's constructive speech in which he set out the principles on which he believed progress could be based, it has provided some cautious grounds for optimism in an otherwise very bleak scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the worst week for casualties in Northern Ireland for more than 17 years and after a period of months in which it seemed that the paramilitaries were dictating not only who would live and who would die but also setting the political agenda, the joint statement issued in Brussels on Friday, with its emphasis on the rejection of violence, the principle of consent and the repudiation of any secret agreement with those supporting violence, has helped to seize the initiative back from the paramilitaries and their supporters.  I do not believe that the Reynolds-Major statement in itself offers any formula or instant solution to the problem of Northern Ireland, but it does <Col N="1063" /> provide a basis or a framework on which the search for a political settlement and the peace for which people are craving can be built.</P>
    <P>Of course the success or failure of the initiative will be determined by the extent to which the democratic parties in Northern Ireland can be mobilised in support. We have always emphasised that a solution cannot be imposed by Dublin or London, acting separately or jointly, over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland.  The involvement of the people of Northern Ireland and their democratic representatives is absolutely crucial.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that the initial reaction to the Brussels statement from most of the democratic parties in Northern Ireland has been disappointing.  Mr. Hume seemed peeved that the process he had initiated with Mr. Adams had been effectively sidelined.  The initial reaction from the Unionist parties was negative and begrudging, but the latest comments by Mr. Molyneaux have been more positive.  I hope that on reflection they will all recognise that the developments of the past week now offer the best prospect of breaking the political logjam and smashing the terrible cycle of death and destruction.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hume will have to accept that he and Mr. Adams do not have any exclusive proprietorial rights to the search for peace and progress.  The Unionist parties will have to accept that they cannot simply continue to say no to every initiative proposed.  Here, I reiterate the exhortation of Deputy Bruton earlier to the Unionist parties.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister properly emphasised the need for the involvement of the democratic parties in Northern Ireland. Immediate steps must be taken to secure their involvement in the process.  Against the background of the current mayhem, time is a luxury that the people of Northern Ireland cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The horrific events of the past few weeks have made the case for new political initiatives more compelling than ever.  At times the paramilitaries have <Col N="1064" /> seemed to be engaged in a depraved competition to see who can inflict the worst suffering, as outrage has followed atrocity on almost a daily basis.  All those who have died &mdash; in the Shankill slaughter and the sectarian murders which preceded and followed it and the Greysteel massacre on Saturday &mdash; must be foremost in our thoughts.  Their families deserve our support and solidarity and indeed our admiration for the dignity with which they have borne their ordeal. The almost universal rejection by the relatives of the dead of any calls for revenge or counter killings reminds us once again that the paramilitaries, orange or green, represent only a tiny proportion of opinion in Northern Ireland and must not be allowed by ruthlessness and viciousness to inflict their will on the people of the North.</P>
    <P>Also in our thoughts should be the family of one of the lesser publicised victims of the recent violence.  A young RUC reserve constable, Brain Woods, died in hospital on Tuesday having been shot by an IRA sniper in Newry on Sunday evening as he directed traffic after an interdenominational peace service in the town.  Like many of the other recent victims, he leaves a wife and young child.</P>
    <P>What does this murder and the finding of a 150 pound Prove bomb in County Tyrone on the same day say about the validity of the public statements of Mr. Gerry Adams and the supposed endorsement of the Army Council for the peace process?  How can these statements be regarded as anything other than a very sick joke when the same organisation continues to regard the blowing to pieces of innocent people and the calculated murder of a traffic policeman to be a legitimate means for furthering their cause?</P>
    <P>When the Hume-Adams talks commenced my party strongly expressed the apprehension that far from leading to peace, there was a real danger the talks would lead to even greater violence.  That fear, unfortunately, has been borne out by subsequent events.  The Loyalist gangs reacted with predictable viciousness and <Col N="1065" /> all the time the talks were going on, the IRA showed no willingness to even scale down &mdash; never mind abandon &mdash; its campaign of murder and destruction.</P>
    <P>Various Nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland and many commentators have told us that the Provisionals had changed, that there is now a new political realism in the organisation. Unfortunately, we have yet to see any signs of it.  We have seen no evidence of it in its actions in Northern Ireland, and there is certainly no evidence of any new political thinking in the leaflet it was distributing on the streets of Dublin last weekend, headed &ldquo;Towards a lasting peace in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a leaflet produced by people trapped in a time warp, couched in the language of the 1930s.  There is hardly a token nod in the direction of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.  The solution as Sinn Féín sees it in this leaflet is simply one of &ldquo;decolonisation&rdquo; and it states &ldquo;the Dublin Government should assume its responsibility to gain the reunification of the country either in co-operation with the British Government or, if necessary, independently&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>John Hume is a politician whose personal courage and integrity have been widely acknowledged at home and abroad.  However, the evidence to date is that he has failed to convince Sinn Féín and the IRA to reject violence and take the democratic road.  I would like him to put his considerable authority behind the new efforts of the two Governments to find a solution.</P>
    <P>He continues to insist that the agreement he made with Mr. Adams is a viable runner, but we still do not know what is in it.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have been briefed by Mr. Hume and various US politicians.  We read that the IRA Army Council, Provo prisoners in the Maze and Sinn Féin councillors, North and South, have all been briefed, but Members of this House and the majority of people on this island are unaware of the proposals.  Various media reports claiming to be accounts of the agreement have been published, but <Col N="1066" /> these have been challenged, largely by Mr. Adams.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Hume believes, as he said in Westminster on Monday, that his agreement with Mr. Adams is the best opportunity he has seen in 20 years, then surely he should make it public and allow the public to be the judge.  Any rational assessment must lead to the conclusion that proposals from the two Governments, capable of winning the support of all democratic parties in Northern Ireland, offers far better hope for progress than a secret deal negotiated solely between the constitutional and armed wings of nationalism.</P>
    <P>There is a need, as Deputy De Rossa said last week, for much more plain speaking on the North.  We have to stop speaking in riddles and spell out exactly what we mean.  In this context the Tánaiste needs to spell out much more explicitly what he meant in his six principles.</P>
    <P>For instance, where he said that &ldquo;no agreement can be reached in respect of any change in the present status of Northern Ireland without the freely expressed consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland...&rdquo;, does he mean, as Deputy De Rossa urged in the Democratic Agenda for Peace, &ldquo;recognition that Northern Ireland has a right to continue to exist within the United Kingdom&rdquo;?  If this is the case why does he not say so?</P>
    <P>Where the Tánaiste talked about the need to recognise in our fundamental law the principle of consent in regard to Northern Ireland, is he promising to hold a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  If he is, why will he not say so and go one step further by spelling out what sort of amendment the Government has in mind?</P>
    <P>A prerequisite for political progress must be a willingness from all sides, North and South, to compromise, to set aside cherished aspirations in the pursuit of the greater objective of peace.  Despite the awful events of the past few weeks, many of the elements required for a move forward now seem to be falling in place. If this effort fails the people of Northern <Col N="1067" /> Ireland may be condemned to countless more years of violence.  It is an opportunity that cannot be missed.</P>
    <P>The EC Extraordinary Summit was a damp squib and I am sure if the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was on this side of the House that is the way he would describe it.  Even in the share-out of agencies Ireland came bottom of the pile with the office for veterinary and plant health inspection and control, accepting the failure to secure the medicines agency.  The European Environmental Agency, for example, which went to Copenhagen would have been a logical expansion of an existing European institution dealing with living and working conditions at Loughlinstown.</P>
    <P>Given that this Extraordinary Summit was the culmination of years of work to achieve a European Union, and was held on the eve of our all becoming citizens of the European union, it was far from being a great jamboree or a joyous occasion as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>As we face up to the problems of rising unemployment, growing poverty, homelessness and increased emigration, I hope we will heed the words of Jacques Delors, &ldquo;that we will draw lessons from the public debate on the Maastricht Treaty,&rdquo; and recognise that &ldquo;it is no miracle remedy, but could help in resolving a certain number of problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope we will now adjust the figures in the national plan to equate more to the reality of European funding, and find ways to ensure that the profit-takers in the private sector who have benefited so much from the neo-liberal market regime of the EC make a larger contribution to economic development between now and 1999.</P>
    <P>We urgently need more reality and less mythology about that plan.  I would suggest some serious thinking on the question of Economic and Monetary Union and the convergence criteria which have contributed in no small measure to the downward spiral throughout the European economy, with simultaneous downward <Col N="1068" /> pressure on public spending as the dole queues grow.</P>
    <P>Our uncritical acceptance of that whole baggage has left us with no scope for individual action, and little credibility in the wider European context.  The débácle of the EMS should by now have alerted us to the tyranny of the capital markets which are no respecters of national policy or monetary stability.  That cannot be allowed to continue, and a small country like Ireland needs action in that area more than most.</P>
    <P>The proposed European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt, due to come into operation on 1 January, has neither the power nor the policy to address the fundamental problem of who will control our economy, the capital markets or democratically elected and accountable institutions in the European Community and the member states.  It is clearly an inadequate structure for the task of dealing with the monetary crisis.  Democratic Left rejects the view that we should have the politics of non-Government in such a critical area as the capital markets.  We believe that a minimum regulatory mechanism would be a transaction tax applied in all member states and used to discourage blatant speculative currency transactions and to slow down the pace of such capital movements which are not related to normal trade, commerce and industry.  We also believe that the EC requires regulatory mechanisms at least as powerful as the combined financial regulatory mechanisms of the member states.</P>
    <P>The revenue from a transaction tax could also be used to build up the currency reserves of the central banks, helping them to become more of a match for the speculative financial institutions and trans-national corporations engaged in market manipulations.  But, most importantly, it would require accountability and transparency in money dealings.</P>
    <P>I believe we must become much more actively involved in the full and frank reappraisal of the whole European Monetary Union proposal and avoid the sterile, no-questions-asked approach adopted by this country when we were in <Col N="1069" /> Minister Bertie Ahern's &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; to nowhere during the EMS débácle.  I believe that a bit more of the Euro-sceptic role might serve this country a lot better in future than the role of the pliant mendicant.</P>
    <P>I note also that &ldquo;our ties with the Western European Union&rdquo; were confirmed in a report from the General Affairs Council which set out five common actions on the Middle East, South East, South Africa, the former Yugoslavia, elections in Russia and peace and security in Europe.  Given that the ties of Ireland with the Western European Union are supposed to be very tentative indeed, I would welcome some clarification on that question from the Taoiseach.  Where are we going in European defence and common actions with the members of the Western European Union?</P>
    <P>There were other important issues dealt with at the summit, such as the plan of action for the December Summit on EUROPOL and the fight against drugs, which is an urgent problem in this city, in particular, and other cities.  In that regard I would like to hear, in addition to the Taoiseach's formal report this morning, our proposals for combating the growth in the drug tracfficking area and what measures Ireland is proposing for EUROPOL to achieve some more effective police action at European level. I hope that action is more effective than the more local responses which appear increasingly impotent in dealing with the drug barons.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Committee of the Regions will have its first constituent meeting on 1 January 1994.  The Taoiseach might now inform the House how we are going to achieve democratic legitimacy for that body and how accountable its representatives will be to the people of their region.  I hope that the Dublin region is acknowledged as being part of the Irish region and not some poor relation as hitherto.  Given that we are one of the last countries to actually name our representatives to this committee, we must have had a lot of time to engage in consultation and partnership in respect of this decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> The most important subject of the summit for us here in Ireland is, of course, the EC initiative on growth and employment.  If the press releases of Commissioner Flynn are to be taken as the distilled wisdom of the Commission's proposals for tackling the unemployment problem, I am afraid we will have mass unemployment for a long time.  They do not even match the innovative approach of Jacques Delors, nor the aspirations and approach behind most EC handouts. Commissioner Flynn's constant harping on reducing wage costs, on job-sharing and reduced working time are OK for after dinner speeches but mean very little for people out of work with no money or for those at work with no money struggling to meet their family commitments in tough economic circumstances.  We need less of the &ldquo;share-it-among-the-poor&rdquo; approach and more of the &ldquo;share-it-among-all&rdquo; strategy.</P>
    <P>We need far more radical proposals than regurgitation of the old employer arguments for suppressing wage increases while massively increasing labour productivity, profit margins and increasing repatriation of profits to third countries.  We need to look at new concepts of growth, income redistribution and a sustainable economy if we are to make progress.  Money paid in wages in this economy at least has the merit of stimulating demand and of course attracting enhanced Government revenues from PAYE and PRSI payments.  Profits left with individual employers under the present regime rarely result, as we have seen, in increased employment here.</P>
    <P>I await publication of the EC White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.  I would suggest that we seek the development of a common industrial strategy for the EC, which would redistribute industrial investment, decentralise European industry from the European centre to the periphery and act as a powerful counterweight to the tendency of capital to concentrate in the most developed regions of the Community. Such a common industrial strategy in our era is as vital as the Common Agricultural Policy was in earlier days <Col N="1071" /> and should be funded and developed accordingly.  But that of course would require a departure also from the Irish approach to the EC and the development of a more pro-active and innovative approach to future economic development.</P>
    <P>However, such a radical departure is now clearly necessary if we are seriously to deal with outflows of capital in repatriated profits, huge profit-taking by financial institutions and the growing concentration of capital, technology and investment in the golden triangle of the EC.  It is also a vital mechanism for a single currency area, if that is ever to become a reality, because we would then need automatic capital transfers to compensate for our own concentration in the centre of Europe.  To date our recommendations in that area have been particularly lacking in either vision or urgency. It is vital that at the December summit such proposals be urgently formulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members in expressing sympathy to those bereaved by the atrocities that have taken place in the past number of weeks. I join with Deputy John Bruton, as this is the first time I have had the opportunity in the House to do so, in praising Mr. John Hume for his courage in undertaking talks to advance the peace process. I think this has been an important contribution to the peace process and I want to acknowledge Mr. Hume's role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty acknowledging that Deputy John Bruton has made very responsible and well thought out speeches on Northern Ireland in the past couple of weeks, but it appears that he has forgotten the basis from which the Government's Northern Ireland policy is coming.  In the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government there is a section on Northern Ireland which is entitled &ldquo;Working for Peace&rdquo; and I now take the liberty of quoting from it so that people will be under no illusions about the Government's position.  By doing so I will be <Col N="1072" /> responding to most of the points made not only by Deputy Bruton but by other party spokespersons.  The opening paragraphs state:</P>
    <P>The future welfare of all the people of Ireland is overshadowed by the conflict in Northern Ireland, which causes a heavy toll of human suffering and imposes a pointless and unwanted burden in terms of wasted resources and lost economic opportunity.  A key element in the Government's programme will be the search for an end to this conflict.  We will mobilise all the resources of the Government which can contribute to this process.</P>
    <P>In particular:</P>
    <P>we will seek an urgent resumption of political dialogue to address comprehensively all of the relationships involved in an open and innovative spirit, ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes;</P>
    <P>we will use this process to work towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland, based on the principle that both must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable, political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection, as set out in the Forum report;</P>
    <P>since the final outcome of such negotiations we will need to be acceptable to the people North and South, we will seek any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package; which achieves a balanced accommodation of the differing positions of the two main traditions on constitutional issues, and creates structures which will bridge divisions and promote reconciliation between the unionist and nationalist tradition and ensure enhanced co-operation between both parts of Ireland;</P>
    <P>unless or until it is transcended by new agreed arrangements, we will continue to operate fully the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in close co-operation with the British Government, to deal with <Col N="1073" /> issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with relations between the two parts of Ireland;</P>
    <P>That sets out concisely from where the Government is coming in working towards peace for Northern Ireland. From what I heard in the House over the last few weeks most Members backed this route and fully endorsed the Government's approach.  It was important to restate that and to show that the previous Government &mdash; and this Government since it came to power &mdash; continued to work towards peace in Northern Ireland and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that the Reynolds-Major statement should provide a basis for a resolution of the conflict but went on to suggest that there were conflicting interpretations of the statement. How can there be different conflicting interpretations of a statement which sets out six fundamental ground rules for the achievement of a settlement in Northern Ireland and which builds on the principles set out here by the Tánaiste on 27 October which were rightly praised by all sides of the House?  Those principles have received widespread support and endorsement across the political spectrum.  If the Deputy reflects on his suggestion that they should perhaps be incorporated in the Constitution he will realise that that might not be a very good idea because they are wide-ranging principles which would not be easily accommodated in the Constitution.  Any agreement reached will be put to the people North and South.</P>
    <P>On the conclusions of the European Council, every Deputy has, rightly, pointed to the importance of the unemployment question in Europe.  The point has been reiterated time and time again that the Irish Government and the Taoiseach highlighted this problem and sought to put it at the top of the agenda as long ago as the Council meeting in Birmingham.  The problem is now at the top of the agenda and the European Community is addressing the issues.  I agree with Deputy Bruton's point that <Col N="1074" /> perhaps intergovernmental conferences are not the best way of trying to reach agreement on tackling the unemployment problem, but equally the European Community cannot solve all the unemployment problems and neither can the Treaties.  However, the conclusions of the Council meeting emphasise the important place of the question of unemployment in European politics and in the European Commission.  The Council meeting emphasised that it is necessary to take European action and also coordinated action by the Governments of the member states.  The provision to put unemployment on the top of the agenda in the next Council meeting in December emphasises the important part which will be played by the Community in trying to reduce the unacceptably high level of the 17 million people unemployed in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I do not totally disagree with Deputy Harney's point that Europe has lost its impetus.  The Government raised that point on a number of occasions and the people can claim credit for increasing the impetus for a united Europe, with our result in the Maastricht referendum. With the fact that Maastricht is now a reality this Council meeting was a very workmanlike one which showed that the Community was prepared to address the problems outlined by many Deputies.  A firm agenda has been set for tackling those problems and will go a long way towards restoring faith in the European Community.  People on all sides of the House agree the impetus was lost and that the move towards union seemed to be petering out, but over the last few months that gloomy view is being replaced by a more optimistic one.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the delay in transposing EC law into national legislation and a number of Bills were mentioned, they are on the list of those to be published this session.  The Government has been concerned about the general delays in transposing EC directives into national law and, under the aegis of the Departmental European Co-ordinating Committee under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach's Department, set up a working <Col N="1075" /> group to ensure that transposition is expedited.  I am sure improvements will take place.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Harney's acknowledgement that the Government made the right decision in relation to the European agencies.  The Deputy said she would have been happy to get a bigger or better agency but accepted that the Government had made the right tactical decision in accepting what we have.  I do not accept that we have failed in this.</P>

      <P>We all know about Luxembourg and Belgium.  I note that the conclusions of the European Council refer to the European Parliament elections which will take place between 9 and 12 June 1994.  As the conclusions point out, the elections will be a particularly important moment for the democratic life of the European union.  They will allow citizens to give their verdict on the achievements of the European union. The extent to which member states working together succeed in dealing with problems such as unemployment will be a very important consideration for the voters. It is up to the European Council at its meeting in December to ensure that voters' expectations on this issue are met. The Council has laid the foundations for a successful summit meeting in December.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1990 the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for signature, subject to ratification, of the International Convention on Salvage, 1989.  This required that new domestic legislation be enacted to give effect to the Convention.  This offered an ideal opportunity to carry out a thoroughgoing review of existing legislation in respect of salvage and wreck and to address in particular the question of the removal of wrecks which constitute an obstruction to navigation or a blight on the environment.  It was also decided to avail of the opportunity to strengthen <Col N="1077" /> and formalise the powers and duties of persons authorised to take charge of attempts to rescue vessels in distress.</P>
    <P>Marine casualties in Community waters in recent years, culminating in the <i>Braer</i> incident last January, provided the impetus for the European Community to identify and act on measures to minimise the risk of further such catastrophies and resultant ecological damage.  The Commission document <i>A Common Policy on Safe Seas</i> lays down the policy objectives for the elimination of substandard vessels, operators and crew from Community waters.  A number of measures were targeted for priority action when the Council of Transport Ministers endorsed these objectives last June.  In this regard I wish to express my appreciation of the input made by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, to these measures.  He made a very important contribution.</P>
    <P>The priority measures include: (1) the setting up of a ship traffic control system at Community and national level; (2) the creation of environmentally-sensitive areas from which high-risk shipping must be excluded; (3) the need for shipowners to contribute to the costs of management, prevention and intervention where accidents occur; (4) more intensive port state control inspections of foreign ships entering Community ports; (5) comprehensive reporting systems for ships carrying dangerous or polluting goods into or out of Community ports as well as transiting along European coasts.  Each of these measures is important in protecting our coastline.  Ireland is actively involved in the Community work programmes to translate these measures as quickly as possible into concrete action.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Community action to minimise the risks of marine pollution and to improve safety.  Ireland must, however, be ready and equipped to deal with maritime casualties and pollution incidents which can and inevitably will continue to occur.  We have already taken steps to improve our capability in this regard.  Slanu, the Irish Marine Emergency Service, was established by the Government as a division of the Department <Col N="1078" /> in May 1991 in line with the recommendations of the Review Group on Air-Sea Rescue Services.  IMES is responsible for the operational control and co-ordiantion aspects of all types of marine emergency response, including search and rescue, sea and coastal pollution, shipwreck and casualty response.</P>
    <P>IMES is equipped with state of the art communications and computer equipment to enable it to respond immediately to the needs of seafarers in distress.  The provision earlier this year of a new headquarters for IMES has considerably enhanced the support provided to our search and rescue and pollution prevention and response facilities.  IMES has its own Sikorsky helicopter based at Shannon on a 24 hour basis.  Since its acquisition the helicopter service has been responsible for the saving of 197 lives.</P>
    <P>The establishment of IMES reflects the Government's commitment to provide the necessary resources to ensure, in so far as it is possible, the safety of life at sea.  The creation of IMES is a major achievement of which we should be proud and puts our service on a par with the best in other European maritime jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to those other agencies which do such marvellous work in the area of search and rescue such as the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the Garda, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the National Safety Council and the many voluntary inshore lifeboat organisations. I would like also to express my gratitude to the many organisations who make their officials available to IMES to serve as members of the Marine Emergency Advisory Group, the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee and the Marine Pollution Response Team.  Their work with IMES is very much appreciated and not taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Bill provides a new statutory framework for dealing with marine emergencies and their aftermath.  Marine casualties can have three phases: a ship can be in danger or distress due to a technical failure or heavy <Col N="1079" /> weather; the ship is subsequently wrecked, abandoned or stranded; and the ensuing wreck may pose a threat to navigation, public health or the environment.  The Bill fundamentally strengthens the powers of relevant authorities in each of these situations.</P>
    <P>A number of the provisions in this Bill are designed to enable IMES to discharge its functions even more effectively.  Part II enables the Minister for the Marine to appoint authorised officers, who will normally be drawn from IMES, to save lives and to assist vessels in distress.  The Bill assigns to authorised officers a number of important new powers to enable them to discharge their functions effectively in the course of rescue operations. The authorised officer is given a general power to take such steps as he thinks fit to save the lives of persons on board the vessel at risk, the vessel itself and its cargo.  The generality of the powers proposed will ensure flexibility and prompt response in order to deal with the specific circumstances of unpredictable emergencies as they arise.</P>
    <P>An authorised officer may enlist assistance in the context of rescue efforts from any relevant persons.  These include the master of the vessel in distress, the master of any other ship in the area, the crew of any vehicle or aircraft and any other person in the vicinity whom the authorised officer considers could be in a position to help.  An authorised officer may demand the use of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft close by and which is suitably equipped for the rescue operation.</P>
    <P>An authorised officer and others involved in the rescue operation will also be empowered to cross adjoining lands, should this be necessary, and a landowner is obliged to co-operate in this regard.  Failure to comply with an authorised officer's requests in these matters is an offence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also permits an authorised officer to requisition all relevant information from anybody on board or any other person in relation to a vessel in distress.  Such information includes, for example, details of the owner of the <Col N="1080" /> vessel, the master and crew, the cargo and its owner, the damage done, lives lost.</P>
    <P>If the vessel in distress is located in a harbour the Bill provides for the harbour master to assume the functions of the authorised officer.  The Bill also gives the Garda powers to search and detain persons suspected of plundering a vessel in distress or its cargo.  I regret to say that experience has shown that unfortunately unscrupulous individuals may try to take advantage of an emergency by looting a stricken ship.  The State must protect as far as possible shipowners and crew against such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>This enhanced ability of the rescue services and other agencies to intervene will help to ensure that most incidents do not progress beyond the distress stage.  In the event, however, that the vessel becomes stranded, abandoned or wrecked, a salvage operation may be attempted.  The existing law on salvage &mdash; contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 &mdash; requires to be updated to ensure that salvage operations are encouraged and undertaken in a responsible manner.  The Bill will, therefore, give effect in Irish law to the provisions of the International Convention on Salvage, concluded in London in 1989.  This Convention prescribes the internationally accepted duties of shipowners, shipmasters and salvors during and after salvage operations. It also places on all concerned a clear responsibility to prevent or minimise damage to the environment. Criteria are also laid down for determining the amount of reward to be paid to salvors with a view to encouraging responsible and bona fide salvage operations.</P>
    <P>Before going into more detail on this part of the Bill, I would like to address Deputies briefly on the underlying approach to salvage.  Salvors have traditionally worked in a high-risk business, with large rewards for those who conclude successful salvage operations but nothing for those who fail.  There is a great deal to be said for this approach as it would be unreasonable for an owner of a stranded vessel or its cargo to pay a <Col N="1081" /> salvor who fails to rescue any of the endangered property.  However, the International Convention on Salvage makes one critically important change to the traditional principle of &ldquo;no cure no pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under existing law there is no incentive for a salvor to protect the environment when undertaking a salvage operation. The salvor's reward comes purely from saving the ship, crew and its cargo.  Under the provisions of the Bill owners will be required to compensate salvors who have taken steps to minimise damage to the environment, even where the salvage operation itself has been unsuccessful.  In view of the number of serious marine pollution incidents and threats to which Ireland has been exposed in the past and our increased awareness of the need to protect the marine environment this represents a timely and vital change in the law of salvage.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down the various duties owed by a salvor to the owners and masters of ships and, conversely, the duties of owners and masters to the salvor.  It provides for the making of contracts to undertake salvage operations and lays down the criteria for deciding the amount of reward to be paid for the successful undertaking of a salvage operation. These criteria will also apply to compensation to be made for minimising or preventing damage to the environment. The duty to protect the environment is, therefore, placed centre stage under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In all maritime casualties the saving of the lives of the crew and others on board is the paramount concern.  It is only when a rescue has been effected that salvage operations may commence.  At that stage the vessel is usually stranded or wrecked. However, lest lives be still in danger, for whatever reason, when a salvage operation gets under way, the Bill provides that payment to the salvor by the owner for the saving of life will take priority over claims for payment in respect of property.  While not specifically provided for in the International Salvage Convention, this is a principle in our law which, I am sure, Deputies agree must <Col N="1082" /> be retained.  The Bill also reiterates the general duty of a master of a ship to come to the assistance of any person in danger of being lost at sea provided that, in doing so, he is not seriously endangering his own vessel, crew or passengers.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses the question of salvage services rendered to or undertaken by State owned vessels; the criteria for fixing a salvage reward; the apportionment of rewards between salvors when two or more are involved in salvage operations; the need for co-operation between salvor, public authorities and other interested parties to ensure the successful performance of a salvage operation and the rights of salvors to payment.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill comprehensively addresses the question of wreck removal. The existing law on wreck, in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, is being updated, strengthened, improved and consolidated.  Receivers of wreck appointed by the Minister for the Marine have usually been officers of the Customs and Excise Service.  Other persons may also be so appointed where necessary. Receivers of wreck have undertaken a necessary and valuable function over many years in protecting the interests of owners and salvors of wrecks.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their work which does not often come to public notice.  They carry out their work without fuss and often do not get credit for it.  Under the Bill, receivers of wrecks will retain their function as &ldquo;honest broker&rdquo; between the owner and the salvor or finder of wreck.</P>
    <P>The first duty of a receiver is to take possession of a &ldquo;wreck&rdquo; the ownership of which has not been established.  The Bill provides that anybody, other than the owner, finding or recovering a wreck must deliver it into the possession of the receiver.  The receiver must then give notice of taking possession of the wreck. with a view to establishing ownership and ultimately handing it over to its rightly owner, provided of course security for any salvage fees has been forthcoming from the said owner.  In the event of an owner not being found, the Bill provides <Col N="1083" /> that the Director of the National Museum, on behalf of the State, may claim the wreck if it is of archaeological, historical or artistic merit.  While the National Monuments Act, 1987, is the principal legislation covering the safeguard of wrecks of historic importance, I am proposing this provision to further strengthen our powers to protect our national heritage.  In the event that the director is not so disposed, the receiver may sell the wreck.</P>
    <P>New powers are also proposed for the Garda Síochána to deal with those who conceal or wrongfully take possession of a wreck.  These powers tie in with the powers to be given to the gardaí to prevent looting of a vessel at the &ldquo;vessel in distress&rdquo; stage.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill will firmly place the onus on the owner to remove the wreck if it constitutes a hindrance to navigation, a threat to coastal communities or the marine environment.  As matters stand, wrecks can be and indeed have been abandoned by their owners over the years with impunity.  We are all familiar with the phenomenon of unsightly wrecks around the coastline. I am sure this is a matter that Deputy Sheehan will address as he raised it at a committee recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will help to ensure that this does not happen in future, it will take account of the Deputy's fears and those expressed by other Deputies at committees.</P>
      <P>Provision is also being made to deal with circumstances where an owner refuses to remove such wreck within a reasonable timescale.  In such circumstances, harbour authorities, local authorities of the Commissioners of Irish Lights are empowered to remove vessels or otherwise render them harmless and, most importantly, to recover the expenditure incurred by them from the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity also to safeguard property on board a wrecked or stranded vessel by making it an offence for an unauthorised person to board such <Col N="1084" /> vessel without the permission of the master.  The provision will not, of course, apply to the emergency services of the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, the burial of human remains at sea is addressed in Part V of the Bill. Unauthorised burials at sea can pose a risk to public health or cause a navigational hazard, and can also give rise to personal distress in the event of a body being washed ashore.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for an enabling power to make regulations for a suitable regime under which burials at sea may take place.</P>
    <P>I am sure my introductory remarks in relation to the burial of human remains at sea will raise some eyebrows.  Burial on land is governed by the Local Government Sanitary Services Act, 1948.  Under section 47 of that Act the Minister for the Environment may make regulations in relation to the disposal of human remains other than by burial.  However, those powers do not cover the general regulations for disposal of remains at sea. Power is granted under this Bill to address that deficiency in view of a steady trickle of requests, approximately six annually, for guidance in relation to burial at sea.  At present cremation is recommended and the scattering of ashes at sea is the preferred option.  Unapproved burials do take place at sea.  It has been known that bodies, coffined or otherwise, have been disposed of at sea without meeting weighting and depth of water requirements.  In those circumstances, much to the grief of family, relatives and friends, some of those bodies may come ashore, posing a risk to public health or a navigational hazard.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill I am providing for a maximum level of fine of up to £10 million, five years' imprisonment or both, for conviction on indictment.  People may wonder about a fine of £10 million but that fine is covered under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and is being carried over to this Bill.  This concept has been carried over from the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, where offences with potential catastrophic environmental consequences are similarly dealt with.  In that <Col N="1085" /> context Deputies will see the wisdom of retaining that section.  That fine would be a maximum one and imposed on indictment. The financial penalty for such offences must be commensurate with the enormity of the environmental threat which they can pose.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this Bill provides a comprehensive legal framework to deal with the various critical phases of a marine emergency by assigning concrete intervention powers where vessels are in distress; by putting in place the internationally accepted regime on salvage operations and by strengthening the law on removal of wrecks which constitute a threat to the marine environment or a hazard to navigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill underlines my commitment and that of the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, to protect our vulnerable coastline and marine environment.  The national response capability to marine casualties and pollution emergencies has, as I said, been greatly enhanced with the establishment of the Irish Marine Emergency Service as the overall co-ordinating agency.  Further practical improvements will be put in place as necessary to ensure that the human and technical resources at our disposal in such emergencies are sufficient for the task.  This Bill will enable us to put in place and to enforce a comprehensive legal framework to underpin those practical contingency arrangements.</P>
    <P>If Deputies consider they can improve the Bill by way of technical or other amendments on Committee Stage, my mind is open to such proposals.  This is my first opportunity, as Minister for the Marine, to introduce legislation.  I thank the officials in my Department for the work that went into the preparation of very important legislation and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little in this Bill that one could disagree with.  However, in this legislation which enables Ireland to give effect to the International Convention on Salvage, I would have thought we could have used the occasion to tidy <Col N="1086" /> up a number of other issues that should be dealt with in this type of legislation. During Question Time recently the Minister of State, Mr. O'Sullivan, was questioned about the <i>Havelet</i> report which was published recently.  I accept that the inspector involved acted in accordance with existing legislation which clearly outlined that he had not the authority to apportion blame or liability.  However, it is time we looked at this legislation and gave additional powers to such inspectors to suggest new rules and regulations to deal with the ongoing changes particularly in the car ferry business.  I would like to have seen an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Acts 1894 to 1992 used to introduce new measures in that area.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister is making recommendations to the National Ferry Safety Committee in regard to some very important measures but, nowadays, that is not sufficient.  The Minister should take powers to instruct that various changes take place particularly in regard to the safety of passengers, the safety of our seas and protection of the environment. I am disappointed that the Minister has not used this occasion to add to existing legislation.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister is making provision for burial at sea.  I did not hear him say anything about marriage at sea.  I wonder if there is a need for change in that legisaltion in the light of ongoing events.  I am sure we will deal with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing legislation does not address the real problems which lead to the sort of situation this Bill is endeavouring to cover.  It would be better to prevent disasters rather than having to deal with them afterwards.  Ireland should press the European Community to introduce legislation which would have the effect of eliminating substandard vessels which create a serious problem.  We all remember the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster. <Col N="1087" /> In that regard I looked at some old papers in the Library and I was appalled to read that that ship had spent four days in Bantry Bay during which cracks to its superstructure were examined by Lloyd's and officials of the Department of Transport in Britain.  Despite the fact that stormy winds had been forecast, that ship left Bantry Bay and, shortly thereafter, got into serious difficulties and was eventually abandoned with 900 tonnes of fuel on board.  The resulting damage cost a considerable amount and great difficulty. The fact that a substandard vessel can be allowed go to sea, endangering the lives of people and damaging the environment should be tackled urgently. We have road traffic regulations and laws in relation to the use of vehicles and we are trying to keep bangers off the road. We pay a great deal of attention to road traffic legislation, and rightly.  We pay a great deal of attention to aviation legislation and take measures to prevent accidents. However, in regard to the seas, legislation is very woolly, yet we are talking about making recommendations to committees.  If we can have legislation to cover safety on our roads and safety in the air, it is time the European Community addressed the need to deal, in particular, with substandard vessels at sea.</P>
      <P>We should also seek measures to improve the effectiveness of State port control and introduce preventive measures <i>vis-a-vis</i> routing of ships, reception facilities, vessel traffic services and training of seafarers.  In recognising the need for and seeking to implement improved standards, very often the problems we face are caused by the non-implementation of existing rules.  Many accidents at sea are caused not as a result of a lack of existing rules but rather by inadequate compliance with existing measures.  It is in the area of enforcement that there is a great deal of weakness.  As a country we cannot singularly enforce rules and regulations in relation to safety and pollution prevention.  We need the assistance of EC member states and international organisations in bringing about the necessary changes to ensure safety at sea and avoid pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> It is an established fact that it is the proper operation and maintenance of ships which is the key factor for safety and pollution prevention.  It is vitally important therefore to eliminate substandard vessels.  We must also seek improved data interchange on vessels on a worldwide basis and the provision of resources to ensure that sufficient numbers of inspectors are trained to a similarly high standard throughout Europe. The EC must use its economic and political strength to encourage those Third World countries with inadequate arrangements to rectify that position. Many of the problems that arise as a result of disasters at sea unfortunately originate in countries who do not seek to apply the same standards as are applied here and in Europe as a whole.  Ireland should support the European Community Shipowners Association's suggestion that vessel traffic services should have an enhanced role in avoiding accidents in congested waters and that action in the areas of policy planning and promoting standards for qualifications of personnel should be taken in the context of such vessel traffic service systems.</P>
    <P>Directly related to protection of the marine environment is the need to provide adequate waste reception facilities in ports.  Regrettably, this is a matter that has been totally neglected in many circumstances.  It is important that member states fulfil their obligations in this regard.  As a result of the lack of proper facilities at ports, a lot of dumping is taking place in our seas.  This can be seen from pollution of our beaches. There is regular pollution of the beaches of north County Dublin and it has been established that much of this pollution results from indiscriminate dumping at sea due to the lack of proper facilities at ports to deal with this problem.  The problem will not go away.  If facilities are not provided at ports the rubbish will continue to be dumped at sea.  Every opportunity must be taken to strengthen legislation to encourage and promote greater environmental awareness and protection of our seas.  It is time we called a halt to the obvious acts of vandalism leading to pollution at sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> As I said at the outset, the purpose of this legislation is to give effect to the International Convention on Salvage and to strengthen the law on the removal of wrecks which constitute a threat of harm to the marine environment or a hazard to navigation.  Nobody could disagree with that.  It is important that authorised officers have the necessary powers to deal with cases of vessels in distress.  I welcome the provision in the legislation which extends the protection to wrecks of historical, archaeological or artistic importance.  That is a measure that I and my party support.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to support the Minister's remarks of congratulations to those who engage in search and rescue operations.  Many people put their own lives at risk when assisting vessels in distress at sea.  All those engaged in the rescue service are to be congratulated and respected for the work they do, whether it be the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the RNLI, the Naval Service or the Air Corps.  All these people and many others who give assistance do a tremendous humanitarian job to save other people's lives and all of us fully recognise the valuable contribution they make.</P>
    <P>Another notable fact is that countries are always ready to assist each other. Prior to the setting up of our helicopter rescue service it was a great source of encouragement to see the co-operation between Britain and Ireland in terms of assisting each other in dealing with a vessel in distress at sea.  Such co-operation is necessary in these circumstances. I welcome the provision in the legislation which renders the owner of a vessel liable for expenses incurred in a rescue service. Presumably this will be part and parcel of the insurance cover on the vessel.  Those who incur expense in helping vessels in distress should recoup the expenses incurred.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, it is unfortunate that legislation is necessary to give the Garda Síochána powers to search persons suspected of plundering a vessel in distress. Unfortunately, people will use any occasion to get what they can for themselves <Col N="1090" /> and it is necessary to extend these powers to the Garda Síochána.  On the question of salvage, I will be dealing with some of the provisions in this regard on Committee Stage.  The legislation tidies up affairs in this area and provides that costs incurred in dealing with salvage be recouped.  I hope that if amendments are put down on these matters on Committee Stage, the Minister will favourably consider them.</P>
    <P>In respect of wrecks, local authorities are empowered under this legislation to remove a wreck if there are reasonable grounds for believing that it constitutes a threat of harm to the marine environment or to related interests.  This is a wise decision.  I hope that, once again, in circumstances where power is given to local authorities we do not find that they have not adequate resources to carry out the functions given to them.</P>
    <P>It is important that local authorities be given the power to remove wrecks if they pose a threat to the marine environment, endanger life or affect our tourism industry. Local authorities have the power to move crashed vehicles from our roads and I do not see why they should not have the power to remove ship wrecks from the waters around our coast if they are causing damage or are likely to do so.  I sincerely hope local authorities will be given the resources to enable them to carry out the functions given to them under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the provisions of the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage. The one criticism I have is that when we are amending legislation we do not avail of all the opportunities afforded to us to deal with issues which are a problem. I am referring in particular to marine pollution, damage to the environment and the safety of vessels, particularly ferries.  In view of the number of people which can now be carried on board new super-ferries, it is vitally important that the legislation in this area is looked at. Referring a matter to a committee with a recommendation is not adequate.  There are ongoing problems in regard to ferries, for example, the employment of staff who do not speak the same language as <Col N="1091" /> the passengers.  As the Minister is aware this was a problem in the case of the <i>mv Havelet</i>.  There were also problems in regard to the <i>Celtic Pride</i> where two children lost their lives.</P>
    <P>Many ferries, including ferries from other countries, are unsuitable to carry large numbers of passengers.  Very often one would not be too sure of the number of people on board a ferry, especially during peak periods.  A number of questions in regard to the <i>mv Havelet</i> incident, which was not a disaster, still remain unanswered.  Many trucks can overturn while on ferries, thus causing major problems.  Consideration needs to be given to the number of vehicles which can be carried by ferries and also to safety precautions and the language used by ferry companies.  I am sure very few people understand the term, &ldquo;muster station&rdquo;.  Passengers on board planes are given detailed advice in regard to safety precautions, for example, the location of the exits and life jackets.  I accept that most ferries make an announcement about safety precautions but I suggest that very few people pay any attention to it, mainly because of the size of the vessel.</P>
    <P>Ferries are getting bigger and are carrying more passengers.  I was never one to suggest the introduction of legislation merely for the sake of it &mdash; sometimes Governments tend to interfere too much in people's lives and we should not have so much legislation &mdash; but when it comes to the safety of individuals, obvious neglect by some ship and ferry owners and a lack of respect for our environment legislation is necessary.  Unfortunately, little Ireland cannot solve all the problems in this area on its own, but we can play a major part in encouraging the European Community to lead the way in insisting on standards of safety and the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Many of the large tankers which use the seas on a regular basis have very few personnel on board.  It should be remembered that machines and technology can only do so much and such large tankers could cause a major disaster <Col N="1092" /> if they are not properly manned.  I do not know if it would be possible &mdash; it may be possible in some instances &mdash; to use this legislation to provide additional protective measures in this area.  I ask the Minister between now and Committee Stage to look at the position in regard to ferries and consider the introduction of amendments which would strengthen existing legislation and give more powers to inspectors, such as the inspector who reviewed the <i>mv Havelet</i> incident.  The inspector in that case reported on the incident and made recommendations. The Minister should consider whether some of those recommendations could be made into regulations.  It is more important to have regulations in this area than regulations governing burials at sea &mdash; very few people are buried at sea.  While I accept the Minister's point that more people are being buried at sea, there are more major problems, for example, damage to the environment and pollution of the sea, which require to be regulated.</P>
    <P>We could do much more in terms of tightening-up legislation and recognising that times have changed and the legislation enacted many years ago never dealt with the sort of problems we now face &mdash; the size of ferries, the frequency and distance they travel, the hiring of ships with crews who do not speak the same language as the passengers, etc. These major problems need to be addressed. Likewise, consideration needs to be given to the provision of facilities at ports for taking waste from ships.  If these facilities are not provided then waste will be dumped at sea.  Very few ports have the recommended facilities for the taking of waste from ships.  As a result more waste is dumped a sea, thus giving rise to pollution of our beaches.  It is frightening to think what has been dumped at sea, particularly having regard to the reports which have been issued since the fall of the Soviet Union about the continuous dumping of nuclear waste at sea.  We have closed our eyes to this issue up to now; it is time we opened them.  As a member of the European Community we have an opportunity to use our influence to ensure that change is brought about in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Barrett about the state of many ships which sail the seas.  Some of these ships, which are registered in ports many thousands of miles away from here and which transport cargoes of ore, etc., can often find themselves in difficulties in mid-Atlantic and have to off load their poisonous cargoes.  I have a friend in Cork, P.J. Lawless, who sailed the Atlantic on a number of occassions and he told me he was frightened by what he encountered at sea with regard to waste.  There is often a large number of barrels floating on the surface and, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, many ships are not sufficiently structurally sound to transport substances across the Atlantic and other seas.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of my party.  For too long we as an island nation have taken a somewhat indifferent attitude to merchant shipping and marine affairs.  As an island off Europe we must take a special interest in the current international developments in our marine sector.</P>
      <P>The fact that this Bill will give effect to the International Convention on Salvage is to be welcomed.  We must become part of the international community when matters of merchant shipping and marine affairs are debated.  For too long our laws have not been clear-cut in relation to salvage and marine distress at sea in general. The fact that most of our current legislation has a basis in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, is an indication that we need to update our approach to take into account developments of recent decades.</P>
      <P>We have all seen the tragic consequences of accidents at sea and I welcome this Bill because it puts in place a streamlined package to ensure that rescue and salvage is carried out in a structured and legal manner under clear guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The updating of merchant and marine legislation is a vitally important task for this House.  In the past few years we have seen dramatic changes in sea transportation as larger and larger ships are <Col N="1094" /> introduced to achieve economics of scale for their owners.  The busy shipping lanes ferry millions of tons of cargo every year. While most of the large shipping companies operate within the industry safety guidelines, there are always exceptions and in recent times we have seen dreadful accidents where ships carrying sensitive cargoes have run around and caused massive pollution.</P>
    <P>One of the worrying aspects of the international shipping sector is the number of oil spillages where vast areas of natural beauty and valuable fish stocks have been damaged by pollution as a result of shipwrecks.  It is only fair and proper that the owners of such ships shall be obliged to pay for the clean up costs. I welcome the provision whereby those engaged in salvage operations, who pay special attention in their work to preventing pollution, will be rewarded.  We are all aware of the huge ship that ran aground in Ballyvaughan Bay and the subsequent lengthy operation to salvage it.  While the threat of pollution was dispersed in that instance I see no reason for not carrying out follow-up surveys to ensure that no long term damage has been done to vital shellfish grounds.</P>
    <P>Looking more closely at this Bill, there are some areas of concern.  For example, in relation to vessels in distress, the new provision states:</P>
    <P>... any person may, for the purpose of rendering assistance to the vessel, saving the lives of the shipwrecked persons or saving the cargo or apparel of the vessel, pass and repass, either with or without vehicles, over any adjoining lands... without being subject to interruption by the owner or occupier,...</P>
    <P>In the heat of rescue or in the rush to attend a vessel in distress, this is a reasonable and straightforward action by the designated officer acting on behalf of the Minister.  However, let us pause for a moment and consider the implications of the new provision.  We are all aware of the current debate in farming circles about the high cost of insurance and in particular of public liability in some cases.  Will the Minister state the possible <Col N="1095" /> or probable repercussions of a landowner raising this insurance issue in relation to such a rescue?</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that under this Bill any damage sustained by the owner or occupier as a consequence of the new right of pass being exercised, shall be a charge on the vessel, there may be the further question of an extension of insurance cover.  I would like the Minister to respond to this point.</P>
    <P>It was more acceptable in olden days, when pirates and smugglers roamed the clifftops of our coastline seeking vessels in distress, to clamber down a cliff face and steal whatever cargo had been washed ashore.  Landowners perhaps even connived in this terrible trade. Today, because of the extension of our laws to protect the rights of offenders, it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the smuggler to sue the landowner if he fell down the cliff face.</P>
    <P>However, I am also somewhat alarmed that the landowner or occupier may be held guilty of an offence if he or she impedes or hinders any person engaged in the exercise of these rights as now outlined in the Bill.  The Minister should clarify that aspect of this section and ensure that the landowner is made fully aware of the powers being given to designated officers under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in relation to giving the Garda increased powers of detention without warrant where a person is suspected, with reasonable cause, of plundering a vessel in distress. There is no greater maritime crime than to steal the cargo of a ship in distress; it is akin to grave robbing and the fact that the Garda are being given powers to search suspects is a step forward.</P>
    <P>In Part III of this Bill I welcome the guidelines under the new salvage procedure and I particularly welcome the defining of damage to the environment to include substantial physical damage to human health or to marine life in coastal or inland waters caused by pollution, contamination, fire, explosion or similar major incidents.  However, I would like to bring it to the Minister's attention that <Col N="1096" /> under the salvage guidelines certain platforms and drilling units are exempted. This part of the Bill shall not apply to floating platforms or to mobile offshore drilling units when they are engaged in the exploration, exploitation or production of sea-bed mineral resources.</P>
    <P>While I fully understand and accept that a fixed or floating platform or mobile units could not be classified as suitable for salvage, I am still concerned about the potential for pollution.  It is not long since the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea and the appalling loss of life incurred in that dreadful accident.  We must remember also that considerable pollution was caused to the sea-bed and marine life.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider this exemption, especially in relation to the damage to the environment clause.  We all want to see exploration off our coasts in a bid to develop the potential of our natural gas or oil resources, but it should not be at the expense of any possible damage to our marine or sea-bed world.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Bill for the Minister to appoint receivers of wrecks is welcome as is the guideline that the Garda and the Director of the National Museum must be notified of the taking possession of a wreck.  We are all aware of the wrecks now lying in waters off our coastline which have attracted a long line of treasure hunters in recent years.</P>
    <P>Our maritime history is charted by these old wrecks and stories of Spanish galleons lying in deep waters in various locations along the west coast still hold a certain sense of awe and romance.  The lure of buried gold is a powerful one and no doubt some of the legends are true but we must balance our sense of deep sea adventure with a concern for valuable items recovered from sunken wrecks.</P>
    <P>This is why the proposal providing for the retention of a wreck of historical, archaeological or artistic importance by the director of the National Museum is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are also updated fines for offences committed in respect of the provisions outlined in the Bill and one area I must refer to is where people board <Col N="1097" /> wrecks without permission.  In the past, this unacceptable activity has been a source of major concern not only to the owners of a stranded vessel but to the rescue services.</P>
    <P>The tradition of a person boarding a vessel in distress and claiming salvage has its roots in long gone traditions of seafaring when no law was observed and merchant shipping was subject to the unlawful activities of vagabonds.  Today, in more enlightened times, we are bringing structure and order to what in the past was a grey and disputed area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am glad that the provisions of the Bill propose to make it an offence for an unauthorised person to board a wrecked or stranded vessel without permission or to impede the saving of a wreck.  This is an area in which some clarification on the part of the Minister may be necessary.  For example, in what circumstances would a person impede a rescue?  If a landowner raises questions of insurance or compensation with the designated officer could it be held that he did impede, or intended to impede, the saving of a wreck?  Overall I welcome the increased penalties proposed for restricting or obstructing an inspector appointed to carry out an investigation into a marine accident.  The fine of £15,000 or two year's imprisonment or both indicates how seriously we view such offences.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other aspects of merchant shipping and the marine sector which will be included under the provisions of this Bill.  Here I might mention the current controversy about super-tankers and the series of accidents in international waters, the cause of ongoing debate in maritime circles.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we are dependent on transport links with our nearest trading partners.  Since our national resources are limited and, while we have an efficient seagoing passenger and cargo ferry service, we shall be dependent largely on international companies for improved surface transportation in the post-Maastricht era.  While the funds and development plans for our transport infrastructure appear impressive, unless our ports are upgraded we will fall further <Col N="1098" /> behind our European colleagues in the development of our surface transport links.  We must get our produce to export markets quickly and cost effectively.  For that reason I am sure that the provisions of the Bill will add enormously to our influence in merchant and marine affairs in the years ahead.  Since we will be part of a wider European Community we must face the reality that we are dependent on resources outside our control to compete in international markets.  I am glad that the provisions of this Bill will bring our legislation into line with current merchant shipping developments and give effect to the International Convention on Salvage, 1989.</P>
    <P>Since very little information has been furnished to us I must refer to section 66 (1) of the Bill which states that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the burial of human remains at sea.  At best it is a vague subsection.  I take it the Minister is considering the conditions which would apply to the burial of human remains at sea.  While the regulations have not been spelled out section 66 (2) states:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes any regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary convention, to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that £500 is a reasonable cost for a funeral and that, in fact, it would be an advantage to be buried at sea and lead to greater competition in the undertaking business.  Nonetheless, I should like to hear exactly what the Minister has in mind with regard to his regulations governing burial at sea.</P>
    <P>Having outlined my views, I acknowledge the international dimensions of the provisions of this Bill since only through recognising the worth of international agreements and becoming involved in their full implementation, that we can benefit by belonging to the international community.</P>
    <P>Finally will the Minister clarify information <Col N="1099" /> I received some time ago?  For example, if there is a mutiny on board a ship whose port is within the boundary of a local authority I understand that the relevant local authority would be responsible for any malicious damage to the ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtúis ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabhaíl leis an Aire as an mBille seo a thabhairt ós ár gcomhair. I understand that although some legislative provisions obtain already under the National Monuments Act, 1987, for dealing with wrecks and salvage, the provisions of this Bill certainly go much further in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>In the title of the Bill, I am slightly puzzled that merchant shipping only is mentioned particularly since, in the case of Ireland, since World War II, I am informed that apart from the many casualties of war, human and material shipping with very dangerous substances on board was scuttled around our coasts. There was a short report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22 October of chemicals having been dumped at sea 80 miles north west of Ireland over a 13 year period &mdash; between 1945 and 1957 &mdash; which had been confirmed the previous day by the British Ministry of Defence, when ships were sealed before being scuttled in waters more than one thousand metres deep to prevent their toxic contents escaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill appear to fall short of dealing with what would appear to be a very real danger in the future.  Anyone familiar with the sea knows that sea water is a very corrosive element.  I fear that our coastline is a veritable time bomb of toxic cocktails, lying in wait, the legacies of wars in which we were not even directly involved.  To deal effectively with these maritime and coastal hazards will necessitate the involvement of other authorities, British, American and perhaps German.  In that respect I appeal to the Minister to bring his experience gleaned in the Department of Foreign Affairs to bear on the problem, as he has done in his Defence <Col N="1100" /> portfolio to date.  Indeed it might also be worth reminding the Minister that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be aware of the dumping at sea off the south west coast as it was within his political bailiwick in the 1970s and early 1980s when a sizeable amount of nuclear waste was dumped some distance off the south west coast.  However, that is academic when talking about nuclear waste.  That dumping was stopped through international pressure, which is also warranted in regard to other substances dumped in the past.</P>
    <P>I regret that the provisions of the Bill do not deal specifically with wreckage and-or disused military hardware.  Since the end of the Cold War and the shift from land based to sea-based missiles, we must recognise that quite an amount of submarine traffic as well as surface sea traffic plies the waters off our coasts which raises the question of why the provisions of this Bill are confirmed to merchant shipping.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the motivating force behind the introduction of this Bill &mdash; which I should like to have clarified by the Minister &mdash; was the interests of salvage workers or people interested in salvage, amateurs or professionals, seeking to explore and, on occasions, in the past, plundering various wrecks off our shores. Of course, another motivating factor could be the tragedy of the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> in Dublin Bay which highlighted a number of shortcomings in our legislation and procedures for dealing with wreckage particularly close to our shores.  I gather that one can gather some of the flotsam and jetsam deposited from that wreck in Dublin Bay right along the coast in my constituency in Dublin North.</P>
    <P>How can a salvor be cited for negligence and dishonesty, as stated in section 31?  Is this matter to be left entirely to the Judiciary?</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides for notification to the gardaí and the National Museum of various wrecks and details pertaining to them.  Should the Maritime Museum, in the Minister's constituency in Dún Laoghaire, be fully involved in the documenting of wrecks, particularly those of <Col N="1101" /> historical merit?  I wish to pay tribute to the Maritime Museum for the work done on a voluntary basis over the years despite the lack of State involvement in our maritime heritage.  One of the most poignant aspects of this Bill is that it highlights just how late Ireland has been in coming to recognise our maritime heritage.  I regret that but at least we are beginning to wake up to what our coast has to offer and what it has meant down through our history.</P>
    <P>Coming from the constituency of Dún Laoghaire the Minister is in a very good position to appreciate the importance of getting the Bill right.  No doubt he will be anxious to ensure the legislation is as cost effective as possible.  In that regard perhaps he will avail of the opportunity to spell out who will foot the bill for the removal of the obstructions referred to in section 54.  In my opinion the person responsible or the owner of the boat should pay for the removal of the obstruction. This is not simply a question of saving the taxpayer money.  The fact that a <i>laissez faire</i> approach has been adopted in regard to obstructions in the past has meant that wrecks have been allowed remain for very long periods and I speak from experience in north County Dublin. The fact that wrecks are left <i>in situ</i> makes it very difficult to understand how section 56 (4) can be applied without exceptions being allowed.  Perhaps we need some indication in legislation as to how the two might be complemented.  I will give two examples: section 56 deals with interfering with wrecks or obstructions.  When one goes to a harbour or a waterway one frequently sees boats tied to other boats. Sometimes people board vessels to reach their own when they are coming from or going to land.  Will the Minister explain whether that will be a problem for people in future?  Second, on a visit to Gweedore I recall seeing an old fishing boat firmly embedded in the expanse of sand which serves as a landmark for a local hotel. Naturally people are curious about it, look at it and often board it.  Will this legislation mean a change in that practice because to date no notice was taken of anybody interested in exploring that old fishing boat?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> Regarding the financial aspects of the Bill, it is difficult to understand how it can be said there will be no Exchequer or staff implications when it states that the Minister can appoint &mdash; not one &mdash; any number of receivers of wreck.  Will they be paid from another source?  It would seem that if the Minister is appointing them it should have some bearing on the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I represent the maritime constituency of Dublin North, or, as we like to call it, Fingal.  The Fingal coast has witnessed a large number of shipwrecks, many of which are still there. For example the <i>Tayleur</i> off Lambay Island was well documented and tragically cost many lives; the <i>Belle Hill</i> and the <i>Sarah of Runcorn,</i> in my town of Balbriggan, are enmeshed in the local history.  To this day the people of Balbriggan are affectionately referred to in Skerries as the <i>Belle Hill</i> robbers because in the middle of the last century this large ship, bound for Argentina, foundered off the coast.  Times have changed but at that time any fuel, delph or tea which was carried would not have been widely available to many of the poorer people living in the region.  To this day one can find various items of such delph in houses which, I presume, will not be confiscated following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be viewed with great interest in some quarters given the practices that have evolved down through the years of taking whatever was washed up. Taking such items was very similar to gathering stones off the shore.  Many Fingal homes have on display items from various shipwrecks and in Rush the anchor of the <i>Tayleur</i> is a sad testament to the huge loss of life from that wreck.</P>
    <P>Our respect for the sea has not been consistent in recent times.  When we see &ldquo;merchant shipping&rdquo; as part of the title of this Bill the demise of Irish shipping is brought to mind.  Our involvement in merchant shipping has been a very sad experience for many people who were employed in that area and our practice of allowing the sea to be used as a dumping ground not only through raw sewage being piped directly in the sea but also <Col N="1103" /> using estuaries as landfill sites is deplorable. In my area, Rogerstown estuary &mdash; a very precious wildlife reserve &mdash; is used as the repository for all waste in north County Dublin.  To that end we have much catching up to do when it comes to respecting the sea and ensuring that we make the best use of it, bearing in mind its sensitivities.</P>
    <P>We are a unique country in terms of our position in the European Community. The sea makes us unique because we are the last country in Europe not to have a direct link with the other member states.  If it is worthwhile to be a member of the EC the use we make of our maritime environment is vital.  This Bill is a positive step towards ensuring that that use is not harmful.  Unfortunately, our uniqueness also extends to the fact that we do not have skips available at ports.</P>
    <P>We do not have official procedures for dealing with much of the waste dumped at sea whether by fishing boats, merchant ships or ferries.  As Deputy Clohessy said, when one is out in a boat one sees everything from barrels, plastic bags and beer can rings, basically anything that can float.  Fishermen, and certainly those in Dublin North, will testify that fish are landed with the rings from beer cans and pieces of plastic around their necks.  We have neglected to provide facilities for merchant ships to get rid of waste, have it processed on land and the sea has suffered.</P>
    <P>When we talk about salvage and wrecks I hope we are talking not only about major news stories such as wrecks from the Spanish Armada and oil spillages but small scale pollution because from the wildlife point of view this is equally as deadly.  Items floating in the sea are mistaken as food so that marine life from fish to turtles eat plastic and are not able to digest it.  That aspect is not dealt with in this Bill but I hope it will be accommodated in the Bill on Committee Stage.  I expect it will be improved on Committee Stage but, nevertheless, this long overdue legislation is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As a former member of the Naval Service I know about the dangers and hazards around our coast which is one of the most rugged in the world.  For far too long we have neglected the sea.  We are an island nation and we should have more interest in what is happening in the sea off our coast.  I will not dwell on the tragedies that occurred but I had practical experience of trying to save lives at sea such as on the occasion of the still unexplained crash of the Viscount St. Phelim on Sunday, 24 March 1968 into the sea off Tuskar Rock with the loss of all on board.  I was on board the corvette L.E. <i>Clionna</i> which caught fire off the Cork coast and, thanks to the quick and efficient action of the crew, a very serious tragedy was averted.  We have seen tragedies at sea down through the years in Cobh such as the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> which changed the course of World War 1.  The survivors landed in Cobh. The bodies of those who lost their lives are buried in the old churchyard in Cobh which I visit occasionally.  This really brings home how angry the sea can be. We have a fine heritage centre and I recommend that every Member visit it because it is a mine of information on ships wrecked off our coast.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which gives permission for wrecks to be taken over by the local authority when they are a danger to shipping and navigation. At present nobody can claim a wreck in case the original owner turns up to claim it.  I welcome also the provisions in section 7 (2) which provide that:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (5), an authorised officer may, for the purposes of saving shipwrecked persons, a vessel in distress or the cargo or apparel of the vessel&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) requires assistance from such relevant persons as that officer thinks necessary;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person took a craft to save a shipwrecked person he could be charged with <Col N="1105" /> taking the craft without the owner's consent and I am glad to see that this will change.</P>
    <P>As a member of the coastal management committee of Cork County Council I welcome in particular, section 52 which empowers the local authority to remove and sell wrecks.  The example that comes to mind &mdash; I am sure Deputy Sheehan knows all about it &mdash; is the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> which is a danger to shipping in Castletownbere.  I wish to quote the following from a letter addressed to Cork County Council by the Department of the Marine:</P>
    <P>The cost of removal of the wreck estimated at £500,000 is not a firm figure.  It is in fact a low estimate.  The actual cost could be a good deal higher.</P>
    <P>The extra revenue generated by the factory ships calling to Castletownbere would be of little assistance in covering the cost of the wreck removal.  In any event, this additional revenue is required towards reducing the current deficit incurred in operation and maintenance of the fishery harbour centre.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at this because it is causing a great deal of concern in the area.  Close by there is a visible wreck of another fishing trawler which went on the rocks some years ago. Two naval personnel were lost trying to save the lives of the shipwrecked persons.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will lead to the modernisation of Ireland's maritime laws.  I take this opportunity to thank the British authorities, especially the rescue organisation, who have co-operated with the Irish emergency service during maritime tragedies off our coast.  This has saved a number of lives.  I acknowledge the work that the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, and his Department have put into this Bill.  I know the Minister has a special interest in safety at sea and in our harbours.  He is committed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institute which has rescued many people.</P>
    <P>Has the number of those wishing to be buried at sea increased?  Is it cheaper to be buried at sea than on land?  Will this Bill have the effect of increasing the <Col N="1106" /> number of those wishing to be buried at sea?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy contemplating that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet, Deputy.  Will there be provisions in legislation that must be complied with by those who wish to be buried at sea?  Maritime people may wish to be buried at sea.  I would prefer that there would be such a provision rather than having people opting to be buried at sea for financial reasons. Recruitment to the Defence Forces, and to the Naval Services in particular, was raised recently.  I appeal to the Minister when he is recruiting to the Defence Forces to give special consideration to the Naval Service because it renders an invaluable service around our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's offer to take on board amendments on Committee Stage.  As an island nation it is absolutely essential that this House puts in place the necessary legislation to ensure the orderly movement of shipping to and from our ports and harbours.  This is probably the most substantial maritime Bill since the Harbours Act, 1946, which was quite significant.</P>
      <P>Every child knows about the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> the <i>mv Kilkenny,</i> the <i>Havelet</i> and the <i>Ranga</i> which sank off the Dingle coast many years ago.  The disaster of the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> was off our shores and before that the older generation will recall the heroic deeds of Captain Carlson in trying to save the <i>Flying Enterprise</i>.  The ship was not flying an Irish flag, nonetheless, that was one of the greatest deeds of bravery in maritime history.  All those disaster at sea have been the subject of discussion in almost every home and it is significant that they should affect an island nation such as ours to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider some of the provisions of the legislation on Committee Stage?  The Bill states that a period of seven days must be given when serving notice on the owner of a ship.  That may present difficulties in some cases having regard to the fact that many ships fly flags of convenience.  It may not be possible a <Col N="1107" /> short notice to ensure that lives are not put at risk, that environmental damage is not caused or that inconvenience is not caused to other ships using our ports. Those matters are fundamental.  Deputy Barrett mentioned the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the irresponsible action which resulted in the ship leaving the port, crashing into rocks a few miles down the coast and polluting the seas around west Cork.  If this legislation had been in place at that time, there would not have been a débâcle.  That demonstrates the need for decisive action as soon as a disaster is threatened, there is a risk of pollution or loss of life.</P>
    <P>The <i>Ranga,</i> a newly built ship went aground off the coast of Kerry along one of our most scenic tourist routes, the Dingle Peninsula, which did not add to the attractiveness of the route.  We must have the ability to deal effectively with such problems and I hope the penalties imposed under this legislation will be a disincentive to all shipowners acting irresponsibly within our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>The demanning of our lighthouses has not received a great welcome and in the long term will prove a false economy. The people who manned those lighthouses also acted as look-outs and at times were responsible for saving lives but, unfortunately, modern technology has made them redundant.  I hope that by way of legislation we will do everything possible to ensure the safety of our coastline.</P>
    <P>I welcome the involvement of the director of the National Museum in maritime affairs.  For far too long we have not been conscious of our maritime history. Because we are an island nation we tend to take things for granted.  Many wrecks around our coast need the protection of proper legislation.  Modern technology has enabled people to salvage ships of tremendous historical interest which, in the past, was thought to be impossible. An impressive salvage operation involving a Dutch ship that had been submerged for hundreds of years was carried out off the coast of Great Britain.  By the use of modern technology it was possible to raise that vessel and transport it back <Col N="1108" /> to Holland.  Regardless of whether we subscribe to violence, the <i>Aud</i> which sank off the Cork coast during the War of Independence while bringing vital armaments to this country to assist the insurrection may contain artefacts of importance to the National Museum.  I have no doubt that salvage operations are carried out within the law, but it is possible that some people might not be scrupulous and desecrate monuments even though they are at the bottom of the sea.  I hope the director of the National Museum will inform the Minister of the necessary steps that should be taken to ensure that important historical vessels are preserved and that at some future date it might be possible to salvage some of the artefacts on those vessels which might be important to future generations.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the functions of a harbour master where a vessel is in distress in a harbour.  There is no provision in the Harbours Act, 1946, for such an appointment, but some harbour boards have the power to appoint a deputy harbour master.  There are three or four deputy harbour masters in Dublin, two in Limerick and one in Cork, but the busy port of Waterford does not have one.  In the absence of a harbour master a person authorised by the Minister may make a decision about whether a ship should leave port, but the legislation must be more specific.  A specific person should be identified to carry out that duty.  There are harbour masters in Galway, Dundalk, Drogheda, Wicklow, Arklow and New Ross, but there are no deputy harbour masters in those ports.  It may not be possible for the authorised person to get to a certain location at short notice should that be necessary. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider nominating a person to act on behalf of the harbour master.  I understand that in Galway the secretary of the port acts as the deputy harbour master.  In certain cases it is necessary for somebody to make a decision on the spot.  In the case of the <i>Havelet,</i> despite the findings there is still doubt in some people's minds that it was not listing when it was leaving the port and I understand that may be the <Col N="1109" /> subject of legal proceedings in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the summer I visited the port of Howth on which a great deal of money has been spent.  A person was scrapping a ship which was tied up in the port.  I accept that is an important commercial activity for the people in the area but a specific part of the port should be designated for it.  The ship should not be tied up along the amenity part of the port to carry out such work.  Likewise, small craft are scuppered in the confines of small harbours and ports and left to rot.  There appears to be a convention among seagoing people not to scrap small craft, but to leave them to rot as if they will add to the appearance of the port.  That is not acceptable.  We must ensure that the environment is protected despite hangups about scrapping these smaller craft. It is common to allow small craft to rot rather than to destroy or dismantle them.</P>
    <P>As a member of a port authority I am conscious of the importance of this legislation and I welcome the Bill which, I hope, will ensure we do not have a repetition of the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> the <i>Ranga,</i> or the <i>Betelgeuse</i>.  I accept that the accident involving the <i>Betelgeuse</i> could not have been prevented.  This Bill will enable the Minister and the local authorities to take the necessary action to ensure that ships are not allowed to rot and disfigure harbour areas.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to the points I raised.</P>
    <P>Another point relates to the ability of the shipowner to pay the salvor.  The shipowner can be charged if the money accruing from the salvage is not sufficient. It will be difficult to get this money from the owner, indeed it is often difficult to identify the owner.  Is it possible to strengthen this section?  This issue will have to be addressed.  The owner of a tug which answers a distress call will weigh up its economic potential for him.  Is it possible that such a person may scupper the ship before it comes to port, thereby damaging the environment? I would like the Minister to consider making a fund available to cover that type of contingency.  With regard to <Col N="1110" /> the seven days' notice, could we contact Lloyds of London who give the ships the rating to find out if a machanism is available to ensure that notice is served in the shortest possible time?  The serving of a notice will cause difficulties.  I know that modern communications systems make it possible for us to serve notice on the owner of a ship in a foreign port but I ask the Minister to keep these points in mind for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this long overdue Bill.  I am sorry he is not here to hear me compliment him on how well he looked this morning after his sojourn on the ocean wave on board a west Cork trawler to assess the difficulties and hazards appeartaining to the high seas for the people trying to eke out a living there.  I hope the Minister will have many more similar trips in the near future, perhaps he will take the junior Minister with him on the next occasion.</P>
      <P>Ireland has 5,800 kilometers of coastline and is the third largest maritime country in the EC, in fact it is now the only island nation in the EC.  Our geographical location and proximity to busy shipping lanes means that the risk of major incidents is very real and we must prepare accordingly.  The Bill does not refer in detail to the recruitment and training of personnel although that is a very important matter.  As everybody knows, a drifting vessel can endanger strategic resources such as offshore gas production platforms, something we did not consider when we talked about the danger of abandoned and helpless ships drifting to our coastline.  So far nobody has alluded to the danger that would follow if one of those tankers or memmoth vessels went adrift and hit a gas producing platform.  If that happened, the consequences for our coastline would be horrific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sunken or stranded vessels can block the approaches to ports and fishery harbours with obvious implications for the economic viability of the area.  I fail to see why successive Ministers for the Marine during the past 12 years have allowed <Col N="1111" /> the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> to lodge on the main shipping entrance to Castletownbere Harbour. It should not be tolerated.  Will the Department was until there is a major collision with the wreck on a dark wintry night?  Will it take the loss of life and limb to get the Department to remove this sunken debris from that trading lane? This wreck is causing great difficulty for the vessels operating in and out of Castletownbere, our second major fishery port.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulvihill quoted a letter to Cork County Council of which I am proud to be a member, stating that the cost of removing this wreck would be astronomical, between £15,000 and £500,000. The harbour dues collected from the Russian factory ships by the harbour master would pay to clear the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> from Castletownbere Harbour and could also upgrade the harbour facilities.  I call on the Minister to act before it is too late, to remove the danger to trade and resources in that major fishing port.  I appeal to him to provide the money to remove this wreck immediately without waiting for the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Department of the Marine cannot deal with that small problem I would hate to think of what might happen if there is a major emergency before the winter is out.  Coming as I do from an area on the south west coast which is exposed to the ravages of Atlantic storms I am only too well aware of the dangers in the major shipping lanes off that coastline.</P>

      <P>Following a recent storm three major vessels, the <i>Cristos Bitas,</i> the <i>Capo Emma</i> and the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> were disabled in Bantry Bay.  By some miracle an experienced, first class international welder was able to bridge the <Col N="1112" /> gap on the hull of the <i>Capo Emma,</i> which was carrying a large cargo of crude oil. The damage was caused by a freak Atlantic wave and the ship was towed to safety. The Minister would be wise to designate Bantry Bay as the never centre of a major search and rescue service to cover the south and south west coastline.  It is well known that if a vessel is crippled within 50 to 100 miles off the south west coast it will be towed to the one and only bay in western Europe where it can be accommodated without causing any interference to shipping lanes.  I urge the Minister to designate Bantry Bay as the nerve centre of a search and rescue service.  This would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>It is also well known that vessels transporting oil, gas and chemicals pose a major threat in the sense that there is a risk of fires and explosions.  Moves are afoot in the European Community to established exclusion zones around our coast.  I urge the Minister at the next EC Council of Ministers to emphasise that our south and west coasts are very vulnerable and seek the establishment of a 20-mile exclusion zone to keep all tankers carrying dangerous and explosive materials away from our coast.  If we are to protect the livelihoods of people living near the south and south west coasts we need clean beaches.  Our tourisim industry is of major importance and we must ensure that we protect those who have invested heavily in the industry.  The Minister should act immediately and ensure that a 20-mile exclusion zone is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the fact &mdash; this presents a grave threat &mdash; that Japan is now transporting its nuclear waste to Sellafield for disposal.  The Minister will be aware that the ships transporting this dangerous cargo pass perilously close to our south east coast and on up the Irish Sea.  Why did the European Community grant Japan the prerogative to send its nuclear waste to Europe given that it could dump this waste in the vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean?  Instead, the nuclear waste will be encased in concrete and dumped 400 miles from my <Col N="1113" /> nearest beach in Barleycove in west Cork.  This is a disgrace and it should not be tolerated any longer.  I urge the Minister at the next meeting of the EC Council of Ministers to emphasise that there is a necessity to ban this dumping in the seas off our coastline.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Royal Air Force helicopter service at Brawdy in Wales for the invaluable service it is providing to this nation.  Each time it is summoned when there is an emergency off our south west coast it arrives promptly. The crew always brave the elements, even in 100 miles per hour hurricane winds, to help in emergencies.  We should upgrade our helicopter service so that it will be able to respond in a similar fashion from bases located at Shannon and, indeed, Castletownbere.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to outlaw the indiscriminate dumping of ballast within our territorial waters.  This has caused pollution with tar from these vessels being washed up on our beaches. The Minister must do everything to prevent this happening.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on producing this Bill which contains 66 sections but there is one omission.  If a ship flying a flag of convenience of a Third World nation is scuttled, burned or sunk in our waters and the owner cannot be traced or the company has gone into liquidation it will not be possible to recover the costs of the salvage operation.  I would like the Minister to include a new section in the Bill on Committee Stage to ensure that in cases where the owner of a vessel cannot be traced or where the company has gone into liquidation the costs of salvaging the wreck will be borne by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidents like that involving the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> cannot be allowed to continue on any part of our coastline.  The <i>Bardini Reefer</i> is having a damnable effect on the minds of the inhabitants of our area who have to watch, at low tide, the top deck of that sunken vessel at the entrance to Castletownbere Harbour and, at full tide, <Col N="1114" /> the top of its masts.  The Minister might say that mammoth conger eels and fish are bred in the hull of that vessel.  I fail to see why successive Ministers have sat idly by and allowed this wreck to remain in Castletownbere.  Until such time as the Minister takes action to remove that obstacle from Castletownbere Harbour, I will not have much faith in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The low standard of maintenance, operation and crewing on the world's tanker fleet is of major concern.  At one time tankers were operated by the giants of the oil industry but this is no longer the case.  The fleets of traditional maritime nations have dwindled and most ships operate with low standards under a flag of convenience and crews recruited from Third World countries where qualifications are more easily come by than in the traditional maritime nations.  We in Europe should not tolerate slipshod methods with tankers and ships being slapped together in the shortest possible time, resulting in them cracking up in severe storms off our coastline.  Why not introduce an international test to make sure these vessels are seaworthy so that these bangers of vessels which are a menace to our natural resources can be removed?  I call on the Minister to do something about that.  He is looking well after the sojourn on the ocean wave on a good west Cork trawler.  I hope he will take similar trips in the not too distant future, bring his junior Minister with him and get an up-to-date account of the dangers for the fishermen operating off our coasts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill, for many reasons.  The Minister referred to the thanks the State owes to the various organisations which assisted in emergencies, accidents and marine safety over the years.  My late grandfather was a member of Irish Lights for a number of years.  He served on lighthouses from the north west coast to the south west coast.  I recall his many descriptions of sea rescues and the bravery and courage of people in the lifeboat service, Irish Lights, the agencies that assisted and ordinary people.  Deputy <Col N="1115" /> Sheehan referred to the courage of the RAF pilots and personnel in times of severe storm and inclement weather conditions. RAF helicopters carried out a substantial number of air sea rescues in the last 20 years around our coast at no cost to this State.  That fact is often lost sight of although it is a very good example of international relations between two countries.  In the light of what is going on now in the North, it should not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister set in train some very important developments in regard to the air-sea marine rescue service based on the west coast and I trust that with the Structural Funds and part of the £8 billion from Europe the service will continue to be developed.</P>
      <P>One of the first sea wrecks I recall seeing was the <i>Plassey</i> which went aground off Inisheer in the Aran Islands about 40 years ago.  It still remains on the coast as a rusting and derelict wreck. One of the more famous wrecks in recent times was the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> off the south coast of England.  There was another off the north west coast of France and the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, again in recent times.  These call into question the necessity to do whatever can be done to protect environmentally sensitive areas. The west coast from Inishowen down to Mizen Head is wide open to the reach of the Atlantic, the awesome power generated by nature in the throes of a storm is frightening.  There was an example a number of years ago when a huge tanker, 300 miles off the west coast, was in danger of breaking up.  Even the RAF pilots were unable to get to it and the American Air Force had to be called into service with its jolly green giant helicopters to attempt to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of a major oil spillage off the south or west coast, I doubt if the major accident and emergency plans which county councils and local authorities are supposed to implement would be capable of dealing with the amount of oil or chemical spillage that would invade the beaches off the west coast.  If we are serious about developing tourism in areas <Col N="1116" /> that have been very much left on the sidelines because of their peripherality, where many of the counties have eight, nine and ten blue flags under the European system of grading of beaches, the Minister must crack the whip and see that the most stringent safety precautions are put in train to eliminate the possibility of accidents that would destroy a potentially important part of economic life on the west and south west coast.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I wish the Minister well in his office.  It is said that if he was still in the Department of Foreign Affairs we would not have had the difficulties of a number of weeks ago.  I have no doubt that his personal love of the west will be seen to great effect in what he implements in the Department of the Marine and Defence.  I wish his Minister of State well also because he has undertaken particularly difficult tasks which I hope he will conclude in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Kenny for his remarks and I will certainly take note of what he says.  I will deal with contributions to the debate, but not necessarily in the order in which they were made.  I am pleased the Bill evoked such interest.  Its title, Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Bill, 1993, is somewhat intimidating.  It amends past merchant shipping Acts.  The Bill, which evoked interest in many areas, particularly that of maritime retrieval, is worth studying.  It brings about fundamental changes to marine legislation which has not been amended for many years.  It up-dates the legislation to enable us address maritime problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased Deputy Sheehan mentioned Castletownbere.  I stayed on board a vessel there overnight, compliments of the captain of the <i>Resplendent</i>, which is an appropriate name of a vessel for Members of the Dáil.  I would like to express my deep appreciation to the captain of the vessel, Captain Ted Harrington, who was in a pairing arrangement with Captain Sean O'Sullivan of the <i>Cisemair</i>.  I saw the position in Castletownbere and I was most impressed <Col N="1117" /> by the professionalism and attention to detail of the fishermen in landing fish.  They brought aboard a substantial herring catch, a species of fish that is more common in the Celtic Sea.  The herring fishing season extends from October to February.  I wish to express my appreciation to those involved in the fishing industry in west Cork who looked after me extremely well.  I gained handson experience of the industry and increased my knowledge of my portfolio in the Department of the Marine.  I appreciate Deputy Sheehan's remarks and I will respond to other points raised by him in the strong presentation of his case.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Barrett's comments regarding the need to up-date legislation following the publication of the report on the <i>Havelet</i> accident.  The Deputy acknowledged that in the company of the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, I referred a number of matters relating to safe practices on passenger ferries to the Department's expert body, the National Safety Ferry Committee, for urgent consideration. I will be guided by the recommendations of that committee.  I will have no hesitation in amending existing legislation, even if such amendments breach recognised international standards.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to substandard vessels, rust-bucket vessels, and their elimination from our waters.  It is important that we do not allow those vessels which pose an environmental threat in our waters.  They are floating threats to the ecological wellbeing of our island.  In the memorandum of understanding on port State control, the monitoring of substandard vessels and their elimination from our waters is given priority.  Under that arrangement 14 member states, including EC member states, inspect vessels arriving at ports to ensure compliance with international conventions and standards.  If a vessel is found to be defective it is detained until such time as the deficiencies are put right. The port State control committee recently took the initiative of targeting flag States that are persistent offenders. I agree with Deputy Barrett that we must <Col N="1118" /> closely monitor this; it is being seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>Arising from the European Community's safe seas policy document a ministerial conference on port State control will take place in Copenhagen next September and the Minister of State or I will represent this country and I will contribute to its deliberations.  I assure the House I will press for considerable strengthening of port State powers, as expressed by Deputy Barrett, and for measures to ensure greater effectiveness in inspection procedures.  We will continue to support efforts to encourage improved standards and compliance with international regulations among the fleets of developing countries.  The recent establishment of port State control regimes in Asia and South America is a promising development.  In the context of what we seek to achieve such developments should be considered.</P>
    <P>Regarding resources for local authorities to remove wrecks that are navigation hazards or threaten the marine environment, this Bill empowers such authorities to recoup the cost of such removals from the owner of the abandoned wreck.  I accept Deputy Barrett's contention that Ireland can play a significant role as an international regulatory forum and at international regulatory fora.  Through Ireland's initiative the IMO is now developing standards for design and construction of a proper sewerage system arising from the <i>Celtic Pride</i> tragedy.  Safety on board passenger ferries and cargo vessels is kept under constant review by the Department and international bodies.  I would welcome any suggestions from the Deputy in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised a number of matters relating to the prevention of accidents. Part III of the Bill deals with prevention and IMES are given powers to intervene before a vessel is wrecked or stranded.  The Safety of Life at Sea Convention, to which Ireland is a party, specifies more stringent construction standards for ships.  The International Maritime Organisation of which Ireland is an active member constantly up-dates <Col N="1119" /> requirements for the construction of ships and operational standards.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the concerns expressed by Deputy Clohessy in respect of the condition of ships carrying dangerous cargoes through our waters, Deputy Sargent also made that point.  The flag State is obliged to ensure that their ships are of international standard in relation to stability and construction.  The port State control mechanism should check the diligence of the flag States in this regard.  The creation of environmentally sensitive areas from which high risk shipping must be excluded, as proposed in the European safe sea document, goes some way towards alleviating our concerns in this regard.  Deputy Sheehan's point regarding an exclusion zone of 20 miles will be seriously addressed.  I will give further consideration to the points raised by Deputies Sheehan and Clohessy, particularly Deputy Clohessy's point regarding the treatment of offshore drilling platforms.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Clohessy's point on landowners' liability, section 9 (2) provides that any damage sustained by a landowner shall be a charge on the vessel in distress or its cargo.  The section offers protection to the landowner but if the Deputy wishes to table an amendment on Committee Stage I will consider it.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations governing burial at sea have not been finalised. They will relate to such matters as a suitable coffin, appropriately weighted, and disposal in an adequate depth of water at a suitable location.  I would welcome any further suggestions Deputies may have on this matter.  Deputy Clohessy raised the question of mutiny aboard vessels, particularly mutiny in Irish waters and I can assure him that local authorities will have no liability in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>While the figure quoted by the Deputy in respect of culture and heritage expenditure under the last plan &mdash; 26.3 per cent &mdash; broadly reflects the initial forecasts for such expenditure under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93, it is not possible at this stage to provide the Deputy with the initial forecast of total culture and heritage expenditure under the next National Development Plan covering the years 1994-99.  This is because the figure quoted by the Deputy for the last plan included expenditure by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo on culture and heritage, whereas no decisions have yet been taken on the budgets to be applied by those two agencies to these categories of expenditure under the next plan.  To compare like with like, therefore, it is necessary to deduct the Bord Fáilte and SFADCo expenditure from the initial forecast of the last plan and compare the balance with the sums assigned to my Department under the next plan.  This calculation shows that, whereas £42.6 million, or 14.2 per cent of the total operational programme expenditure, was initially forecasted for non-Bord Fáilte and SFADCo expenditure on culture and heritage under the last plan, the figures assigned to me under the next plan are £139 million or 21 per cent of total forecast operational programme expenditure. I think the Deputy will agree with my contention that these are historically high levels of expenditure, in real and percentage terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for my views on the economy for the arts under the next plan, I am pleased that the plan, for the first time, goes far <Col N="1122" /> beyond the provisions of the last plan in catering for the national cultural institutions, in facilitating a capital programme for the arts and in assigning responsibility to me for the funding of some elements of cultural tourism activities which would be promoted by local authorities.  As I already indicated to the Deputy, these figures do not take account of the budgets to be applied by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo to culture and heritage projects under the next plan.  For her information, however, I can say that this element of expenditure amounted to £36 million in the initial forecasted expenditure and some £68.5 million in the current forecasted outcome for the last plan.</P>
    <P>The significance of all this is that the £139 million assigned to me under the Tourism Operational Programme for arts, culture and heritage activities, with the £16 million assigned to me for the development of the film industry under the Industry Operational Programme, will place the activities of my Department squarely in the centre of this Government's overall economic and social strategies. Arts, culture and heritage activities will no longer be on the margin of Government priorities.  On the contrary, as envisaged in our Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997, these activities will now be part of the Government's job creation strategy, in recognition of the fact that the cost of creating a job in the arts is considerably less than in any other sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>I should add that also there will continue to be a significant element of expenditure under the Votes for my Department &mdash; mainly of a current nature &mdash; which will be additional to the provisions in the National Development Plan and will serve to contribute to the Government's job creation strategy.  I refer, in particular, to the sums allocated annually to the cultural institutions of the State &mdash; the National Museum, National Gallery, National Library, National Archives, Irish Museum of Modern Art, National Concert Hall, National Heritage Council and the Chester Beatty <Col N="1123" /> Library, as well as to An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  There is a significant amount of research analysis throughout Europe to demonstrate that cultural institutions constitute a major attraction to visitors. Ireland is no exception to this trend, which obviously has spin-off effects in terms of job creation and significant value added to the economy.  Moreover, an analysis carried out by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in 1992 indicated that, for every £1 of grant-aid it received in 1990, arts organisations managed to generate a further £1.80, which indicates that An Chomhairle's funding represents only some 35 per cent of the turnover of arts organisations.  Applying this indicator, it is reasonable to say that the £11.5 million which the Government allocated to An Chomhairle Ealaíon this year will have generated some £33 million of activity by arts organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I intend in the coming years to examine the possibilities for job creation in the cultural industries sector, that is the commercial as distinct from the subvented activities which have a strong cultural or artistic profile.  The music industry and the book publishing industry are instances where there are opportunities for job creation which will have to be explored.</P>
    <P>However, this country is very short of detailed information and statistics specific to the cultural industries in Ireland. A considerable amount of investigation will have to be undertaken, therefore, to identify the precise nature of long term sustainable jobs which might follow from expansion in these areas.  Where opportunities in the cultural industries arise in the short term, my Department intends to establish formal links with Forbairt to advance these proposals within the framework of indigenous industrial development in an integrated and cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>In the meantime this week saw the inauguration of a significant initiative for the film industry, with the establishment of a special committee consisting of my Department, the Film Board, RTE, the <Col N="1124" /> IDA, An Bord Tráchtála, FÁS, Údarás na Gaeltachta and An Comhairle Ealaíon.  This committee is charged with the promotion and co-ordination of the film sector in order to maximise the opportunities for job creation in this area also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I agree with the Minister in terms of the potential for employment and job creation in the area of arts and culture.  That has been well documented internationally and we should follow in that direction.  Has the Minister convinced his colleagues in Government of the importance of this sector?  In the National Development Plan job creation in arts and culture receives very little attention.  In the area of tourism the amount available is reduced by 2.5 per cent.  In terms of job creation in the industries associated with arts and culture, the plan is a dismal failure.  There is great potential in these areas and the plan does not address the matter in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's supplementary question, if it is a question, is based on a stubborn refusal to accept the facts I have given in my reply.  I would regard as extraordinary a person who insisted that an increase from £42.6 million, or 14.2 per cent, to £139 million, or 21 per cent, of total operational programme expenditure was a failure. However, there are those who will not listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with the Deputy's question, which I hope is serious &mdash; I think she is concerned about issues other than the abuse of statistics in relation to the arts &mdash; I have given a great deal of information in my reply to show it is now accepted that arts is an area in which there is considerable job creation.  We are not disagreeing about the report of the Arts Council to which I referred.  I wish to give another example to support what I am saying.  How could one regard as a dismal failure the allocation of £16 million to the film industry over a period of years from a zero starting point?  This is only one of <Col N="1125" /> six initiatives I have taken in regard to the film industry, £1 million spent on the film industry will generate 50 jobs in the documentaries area and 48 jobs in the features area.  I have announced further initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that I am operating under programmes which were put in place before my Department was founded.  I have maximised the drawdown of funding from these programmes and I intend to spend the money in an integrated way to ensure the greatest return in terms of job creation.  This is a very exciting time for those looking forward to job creation in practically all areas of the arts.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the importance of the money which has been allocated to, for example, the film industry. The point I am making is that I do not think the Minister can be satisfied that the National Development Plan goes far enough in terms of creating the infrastructure necessary for job creation and the other spin off benefits in a healthy arts and culture sector.  It is very disappointing, particularly as this is an exciting time in the film industry.  There is clearly a great deal of overlap between the Minister's brief and the brief of the Minister for Tourism and Trade. Developments in arts and culture will <Col N="1126" /> depend to a degree on some of the initiatives taken by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  What structures does the Minister intend to put in place to facilitate the development he outlined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will seek to co-operate with you, a Cheann Comhairle, in terms of brevity, while at the same time endeavouring not to compromise my commitment to give Opposition Deputies the maximum amount of information.</P>
      <P>I had consultations with the Minister for Tourism and Trade, and the system works as follows.  There are specified basic cultural institution expenditures which have an outturn in terms of income for tourism which, in turn, creates jobs. There are also mainline institutional developments of a cultural kind which are of general benefit.  There are projects which are a priority from a tourism point of view.  Therefore, there is is a degree of interaction between the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy McCreevy and me which led to discussions between us and our departmental officials on how the money can be best spent.  The word I used in my initial reply was &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;.  If one is to spend money wisely to ensure the best return in terms of jobs one must ensure that the overlaps are not wasteful but additional in terms of their job creation capacity.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceist Tosaíochta 2, 39 agus 71 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá na tuarascálacha a chuir na coistí comhairleacha ar Theilifís na Gaeilge scrúdaithe agam anois.  Tá súil agam moltaí maidir le bunú agus maoiniú na seirbhíse nua, mar aon le láthair na ceanncheathrú, atá bunaithe ar mo staidéar féin ar na tuarascálacha sin, a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais go luath.  Meastar go mbeadh costas caipitil £17.35 milliún ag baint le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá sé i gceist an tseirbhís a bhunú ar bhonn céimnithe ach go mbeadh sciar suntasach den daonra in ann í a ghlacadh ó thús craolta. Bheadh leath an chostais iomláin le caitheamh sa tréimhse go deireadh 1994 agus an chuid eile sa tréimhse 1995-97.  Meastar go dtógfadh sé suas le cúig mhí dhéag an chead chéim den obair thógála a chur i gcrích, tráth a bhféadfaí tús a chur le craolta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le costais reatha, meastar go gcosnódh trí uair a chloig de chláracha in aghaidh an lae tuairim £16 mhilliún sa bhliain.  Anuas ar sin bheadh costas £5 milliún breise in aghaidh na bliana i gceist i ndáil le costais eile reatha na seirbhíse.  Tá sé i gceist, áfach, go gcuirfeadh RTÉ, mar chuid dá sheirbhís <Col N="1128" /> phoiblí, uair a chloig de chláracha ar fáil in aghaidh an lae, gan chostas do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Chiallódh sin go mbeadh glanchostas reatha £16 mhilliún sa bhliain ag baint le Teilifís na Gaeilge i luachanna an lae inniu.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Coiste Teicniúil go dtogfaí an gréasán tarchuradóireachta ar bhonn céimnithe agus measadh go mbeadh fáil ag nócha faoin gcéad den daonra ar chraolta na seirbhíse taobh istigh de thrí bliana.</P>
    <P>Mar atá ráite agam thuas d'fhéadfaí tús a chur le craolta na seirbhíse i bhfad roimhe sin, nuair a bheadh an chéad chéim den obair thógála curtha i gcrích agus céadatán suntasach den daonra, sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di, in ann craolta Theilifís na Gaeilge a ghlacadh.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government envisages the start-up costs of the service will be met from the accumulated surplus in excess of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on RTE's advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>The programme also envisages national lottery, EC funds and the television licence fee as possible sources of funding for running costs.  I am investigating these possibilities and others at present.  I do not intend that RTE's budget will be so adversely affected by the introduction of Teilifís na Gaeilge as to diminish its capacity in any way.  One of the initial priorities of the station will be that the service can be received at the outset by a significant proportion of the population of the Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas and to provide a comprehensive range of Irish language programming for adults and children.</P>

Mhol coiste amháin go mbeadh seirbhís choimsitheach ar fáil don tír uilig ón tosach agus mhol an coiste eile go mbeadh sí céimnithe.  An bhféadfadh an tAire a rá ag an bpoinnte seo an bhfuil sé ag dul de réir moltaí an choiste bunaithe nó de reir moltaí an choiste teicniúil?  Agus maidir le airgeadú na seirbhíse, <Col N="1129" /> tá go leor ráflaí ag dul timpeall. De réir ceann i bpáipéar amháin ag an deireadh seachtaine, bheidh costas an cheadúnais teilifíse ag dul suas £20 in aghaidh na bliana agus de réir ceann eile i bpáipéar inné bheidh aeróga nua &mdash; new aerials &mdash; ag teastáil ó dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Is fíor go bhfuil béim leagtha ar phointí éagsúla nó ar straitéis áirithe i tuarascáil amháin agus is minic go dtagann an coiste eile ar an gceist ó thaobh eile.  Tá sin iontuigthe mar go raibh na téarmaí tagartha don dá choiste difriúil.</P>
      <P>Tá an ainilís déanta agam agus tá an meamram don Rialtas beagnach críochnaithe agam ag an bpointe seo.  Táim féin den tuairim go gcaithfidh an tseirbhís freastal ar an méid is mó den daonra agus is feidir on tús.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé ag freastal ar an méid is féidir den daonra, go mbeadh caighdeán ard aige agus go mbeadh an lucht féachana is mó gur féidir á bhaint amach aige.</P>
      <P>Maidir le árdú ar phraghas an cheadúnais, ní raibh bunús ar bith leis an méid a luaigh sé a bhí sa pháipéar an deireadh seachtaine seo caite.

Sin an méid a dúirt mé leis.</P>
      <P>Níl bunús ar bith leis an bhfigiúr de £20.  Mar adúirt mé tá mé ag féachaint ar fhoinsí éagsúla airgid ar nós Comhphobal na hEorpa, An Crannchur Náisiúnta, ceadúnais agus foinsí eile nár luadh go dtí seo.

Beidh an cruinniú sin againn taobh istigh de sheachtain nó deich lá nó mar sin.  Dar ndóigh, tógfidh mé an seans sin chun cúrsaí craolacháin a phlé leis ach ag an bpointe seo tá an meamram don Rialtas beagnach críochnaithe agam.

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 3, 15, 26, 43 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I cannot reply to these questions without first expressing, as I know Members have done already, my renewed horror and revulsion at recent atrocities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have made my views known to this House regarding the making of orders under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, on a number of occasions, for example, in my reply of 9 March 1993, columns 1008 to 1011 of the Official Report for that day.  I have indicated that I regard the question of the renewal or otherwise of the order as complex on a number of fronts and that it is a matter to which I was giving the most careful and complete attention.</P>
      <P>The examination of the operation of this section is still under consideration but now almost complete and ready for submission to Government.  The current order will expire on 19 January 1994 and I intend, as I said, to have my examination completed and my proposals with regard to the future operation of this section placed before Government for decision in good time before the expiry date of the current order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received submissions from a number of individuals and organisations, including the Let in the Light Campaign. I am meeting a number of organisations <Col N="1132" /> next week.  I am considering such submissions as I have while continuing my consultations with my Cabinet colleagues and meeting interested parties as part of my examination process, all of whose views will be considered seriously before I make my formal submission to Government.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the operation now and in the future of section 18 (A) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to which a question refers, as inserted by section 3 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1976, is but one part of my review. That section prohibits the RTE Authority from including in any of its broadcasts &ldquo;anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo;.  I am not giving any consideration to a relaxation of this obligation and, indeed, if one were to envisage circumstances where the order was not renewed, the RTE Authority would be expected to ensure that this statutory prohibition would be strictly observed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that nine months or more is a long time and surely within that period he reached his conclusions as to what measures will be taken in regard to the renewal or otherwise of section 31.  I asked the Minister the names of the people he has consulted.  Did the Minister consult with the Taoiseach and with the Cabinet as a whole in regard to this matter?  Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach said there is no place at the conference table for representatives of organisations that support violence?  Is the Minister now saying that it could be time for some of these people to be allowed on television screens and on radio?  The Minister must realise that these people are subverting the authority of the State and are supporting those who cause the death, maiming and mayhem we see on our television screens nightly. Are they to be given access to the national airwaves to explain, promote and justify the murderous acts they carry out or support against the wishes of the <Col N="1133" /> vast majority of people living in the Six Counties and in the Twenty-six Counties? The Minister must agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the prevarication in this matter has added greatly to the confusion in people's minds as to where this Government stands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to the Deputy's question by giving him as much information as I can.  I have said that I am preparing a memorandum for Government. The Deputy has much more Cabinet experience than I have, but he accuses me of delaying time.  I am sure that during his many years in Governments of different hue people said from time to time that he should consider section 31 but, perhaps, they were of such absolute clarity of mind that no complexity suggested it to them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second question, I said that I am preparing a memorandum for Government.  As the Deputy knows, that involves consultation.  Before the preparation of any such memorandum one must have consultations with one's Cabinet colleagues and the atmosphere in the Cabinet &mdash; perhaps unlike others &mdash; is most conducive to people having consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely unworthy to suggest to those who want to see how broadcasting legislation can meet difficult changing circumstances that if they go along the road of reviewing how that works, they are somehow in possession of some agenda of <Col N="1134" /> finding a space for the men of violence.  I have gone to great pains to point out that in any recommendations I might make I am not suggesting a relaxation of section 18.  I would point out also that Members must bear in mind that when cases were made for broadcasting legislation to function in a particular way, for example, the legislation against incitement to hatred, violence did not exist.  It now exists and that must be taken into account.  That casts its own light, for example, in relation to section 18 (A).  But I wish to emphasise that section 18 (A) comprises one element only of my review.  There are delicate balances to be struck which must be sensitive to all of the circumstances. For example one cannot, at once, say one should give a rapid decision and, at the same time, that one should take all of these consultations and considerations into account.  Let me put it more simply, there are matters that are the appropriate subject matter of public order legislation; there are matters that are appropriately ones for broadcasting legislation and there is an intersection in relation to the <i>modus operandi</i> of those two regimes function.  I have never justified violence.  Indeed, I have drawn the attention of this House not only to section 18 (A) of the broadcasting legislation in respect of which I have responsibility but also to the legislation against incitement to violence, hatred or whatever.  In the end, if one were to say, for example, to anyone who wants to amend broadcasting legislation, to draft legislation which is responsible, can withstand the test of time and within which people can practice, that because one will automatically and wrongly be accused of false motives one should not address the task, that will not deflect me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>My fundamental review of broadcasting structures is ongoing.  The Deputy will appreciate that broadcasting is an issue which affects virtually everyone on a daily basis.  My review is a major task which must strive to take into account the rapidly changing regulatory environment in Europe and the impact of foreseeable technological developments, including the rapid technological developments in the unregulated sector.  My aim is to devise a framework that will take us into the next century.  I am not yet in a position to give the Deputy a definite date for its completion.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to establish a statutory RTE Users' Council.  The RTE Authority is more than simply the board of a commercial broadcasting company.  It has been entrusted under legislation passed by our Legislature with the custody of the service in the national interest.  Under the legislation governing RTE, the Authority is required, <i>inter alia,</i> to:</P>
      <P>be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person's perception of the quality of broadcasting is subjective.  I am not convinced that a Users' Council would <Col N="1136" /> assist RTE in its observance of these statutory obligations or could meaningfully represent the wishes and concerns of viewers and listeners.  Therefore, I would not be prepared to propose the establishment of any body which would impinge on RTE's autonomy in programming or scheduling matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Primarily my question had to do with decisions relating to programming. Does the Minister recall the controversy which arose earlier this year when RTE decided to drop a number of specialist programmes resulting in considerable concern being expressed by members of the public who did not have any vehicle through which to express that concern in a meaningful way?</P>
      <P>Frankly, they were ignored by the RTE programme-makers and decision-makers simply because they were deemed to be a minority.  Is the Minister satisfied with the tendency that appears to be developing in RTE, that decisions on programming are being taken on a market basis, or on the basis of financial considerations rather than on the basis of public service and on the need to provide a range of programmes to satisfy all tastes irrespective of whether those tastes be general or minority tastes, as was the case in relation to the particular programmes to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to bear something in mind in regard to this.  I agree with the Deputy that there was much public concern at the change of programming to which he referred.  I share with him the need for public service broadcasting, particularly broadcasting to which the national broadcasting good has been entrusted, to be reflective of all the interests to which he and I referred. However, the issue arises as to how one does this.  For example, were I to interfere in any way, in my view, that would be improper.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that a distinguished former colleague and predecessor of mine with responsibility for broadcasting had the temerity to suggest in print that I had interfered to ensure the existence of my <Col N="1137" /> favourite soap which was a soap in Irish of all things.  Of course that was an outrageous suggestion which I shall leave aside.  The point of the matter is that I do not interfere.  The RTE Authority is there to do its business.</P>
      <P>From time to time the RTE Authority seek meetings with me to discuss a whole range of options, including job creation in RTE, matters which may challenge it and so forth.  On such occasions I have the opportunity of raising such matters as those to which the Deputy referred, but the Deputy would indeed find himself in difficulty attempting to construct a RTE Users' Council, on the basis of a consumers' model, which really speaks about commodity whereas broadcasting is different.  What is appropriate for us to do is to place our faith in the RTE Authority.  Indeed if there is a widespread opinion expressed in relation to such changes as are not acceptable I am sure the RTE Authority cannot ignore such opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises when the concern may not be so much widespread as confined to a specialist interest, as was the case here.  Would the Minister accept that the RTE Authority and its members who, in addition to their responsibilities as members of the RTE Authority in many cases also carry extensive responsibilities outside of RTE, cannot realistically be expected to be experts or critics of every programme broadcast on RTE's airwaves?  Would he agree that some method should be found to establish a panel of listeners and viewers who would provide an input in a way which would not necessarily undermine the role of the RTE Authority, but would prevent &mdash; as we got this summer &mdash; decisions being taken from the top storey in Montrose without, it would appear, any consideration having been given to the people who listen and watch the programmes concerned?  Surely it is possible to devise some mechanism whereby this can be done in a way that would not undermine the RTE Authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy suggests <Col N="1138" /> strikes me as being very reasonable. I am sure that, in a very large organisation, worth approximately £110 million, it would not be regarded as inappropriate management activity for people to seek to ascertain what are the reactions to changes.  Certainly the panel systems the Deputy suggests are ones which impress me.  Of course, the House will realise that I stand at a distance from RTE.  In relation to such a panel, it would not be healthy if directors, producers or programme-makers ever imagined that that which they produced did not have to be tested by those who heard it, saw it or whatever; that would be a very authoritarian version of broadcasting.  No one would want to go down that road and, whenever they have, it has been to the detriment of broadcasting.  These are matters to which the management of RTE may wish to respond and I am sure it will.  When I say, &ldquo;I am sure it will&rdquo;, I say that merely as somebody responding to the Deputy's question.  I repeat that I stand at a distance from RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Fitzgerald's first question, the reason the broadcasting review is a major task &mdash; and I am sure Members of this House will agree &mdash; is that the broadcasting environment has totally changed and is particularly influenced by the developments in cable and satellite.  The Deputy asked about the future of public service broadcasting.  This is a dilemma posed by those who rejected the values of public service broadcasting and who regarded broadcasting as a commodity and pressed for deregulation.  Deregulation has fragmented public service broadcasting in every country in Europe.  In North America and elsewhere it has fragmented audiences and has destroyed many fine norms of broadcasting.  Those who could not be restrained from the deregulation argument and from the market theories, having destroyed broadcasting, now come back and ask how we can protect public service broadcasting.  I go to the Council of Ministers in Europe as a Minister believing in public service broadcasting in the broadest sense.  As you will know, a Cheann Comhairle, there was a court decision recently in relation to TV3.  I read in the papers that those involved propose to discuss their future with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It is a matter entirely for them and the Independent Radio and Television Commission in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní hé seo an chéad uair nár glacadh le mo cheist Priority ach oiread.  I would like to ask the Minister in relation to his statement on standing apart from RTE if there is a change in his Department's policy.  Does he consider it better to be completely independent of RTE or are we following a line similar to that adopted in the past when there was definite Government intervention in the affairs of RTE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to comment on my predecessors.  I cannot accept the latter part of the Deputy's assertion.  I am following what I believe to be the spirit of the legislation and the relationship that should exist between a Minister, who is responsible for legislation, and an authority who enjoys autonomy within the legislation.  It is no more and no less than that.  People regularly write to Deputies who then write to me saying they find something on television or radio very upsetting.  The point is that if we establish bodies and give them autonomy under legislation then we must accept and expect that they will exercise that autonomy with responsibility. If it goes beyond that it comes back into the domain of the Legislature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting orderly for a chance to ask a supplementary.  Regarding the review of broadcasting structures, is it the Minister's intention to implement the provisions of the 1988 Act in regard to competition and the provision of television services or are we to take it from his comments that he is opposed to any competition in this area?  When is it proposed <Col N="1141" /> to appoint the members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, bearing in mind that he recently appointed a chairman?  It is unique to appoint a chairman and not to appoint the members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong to impute any narrowness of ideological intent to me in the review.  I simply said we have paid the price of those ideologues who wanted to go for deregulation and destroyed public service broadcasting. What the public wants and asks for is a choice.  We can have a competition between editorial options without necessarily destroying public service broadcasting, lowering the standard through fragmented responses and then asking how we can protect it.  That has been the conservative response to date.  Unlike that thinking I have an open mind.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the Skibbereen Famine Project, a very worthy project, which seems to be aimed at the tourist market.  As such this project is more appropriate for consideration <Col N="1142" /> by Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism and Trade rather than by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions but my first deals with the broad issue.  I am glad the Minister considers the project a worthy one.  Would he accept there is a dimension to it other than the tourist dimension?  Would he accept that it is appropriate to mark the 150th anniversary of the great Irish famine, one of the greatest tragedies in Europe in the 19th century?  Would he also agree that it is appropriate to develop means of interpreting the historical facts of that catastrophe for modern generations, including our own poeple?  In that context does he agree with the need to explore truthfully that dark and tragic period of our history in a way which does not debase the dignity of humanity or trivialise human suffering?  Can the Minister deal with that broad issue and consider whether in his own portfolio he would have a role in relation to this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the 150th anniversary of the famine.  An enormous number of people died, some emigrated and some were left behind.  It is appropriate that people are interested in a reconstruction of that period.  When such projects come before my Department I look at them sympathetically.  In the first instance this project is structured and tailored in such a way that its primary focus is on attracting visitors.  It seems that the people who can assist most rapidly are those in tourism and trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Skibbereen is an appropriate centre for such a project, not because it is my home town but because the people of Skibberreen suffered enormously during that period?  Would the Minister agree that there is a modern analogy with famines all over the world in Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola and Bangladesh and that remembering our own past would encourage us to contribute to an even greater degree to the resolution of those <Col N="1143" /> problems?  Taking all that into account, will the Minister accept that it is entirely appropriate that the Government should support, in the best way possible, the Skibbereen project?  Can I rely on the Minister to ensure that this project gets off the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not apologise for mentioning a matter relating to his own constituency.  Skibbereen is one of the better documented places regarding the experience of the famine.  The structure of moneylending during the period of the Famine has been studied in detail and is of immense scholarly interest.  I think Skibbereen will be energised as it has been one of the major beneficiaries of what I have done for the film industry.  A sum of £5.7 million has been spent during the summer and I am sure this has had some effect in the Skibbereen area.  I look at this project with sympathy and because I examined it with sympathy I pointed to where it can most immediately be addressed and I certainly will be generally supportive.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Mar adúirt mé sa fhreagra, duine ar bith atá ar tí teacht abhaile taobh istigh de thréimhse ceithre bliana, agus a fhaigheann na deontais a bhí ann go dtí seo, £2,000 ón Roinn Chomhshaoil agus anois £3,000, is féidir suas le £800 a fháil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta má thagann siad abhaile taobh istigh de thréimhase dhá bhlian.  Dá bhrí sin ní chailleann siad ach £200 má fhaigheann siad na deontais eile.</P>

      <P>Tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann an tAire Stáit é féin go maith na deacrachtaí móra a chothaíonn an coinníoll seo.  Is é an fáth go bhfuil an deacracht ann ná nach ionann na coinníollacha a théann le deontas na Roinne Comhshaoil agus deontas na Roinne Gaeltachta.  Mar shampla, sa Roinn Comhshaoil tá teora le achar tí.  Fágann sé seo go bhfuil go leor daoine a thóg tithe úra sa Ghaeltacht ag cur isteach ar dheontais Ghaeltachta ach teipeann orthu iad a fháil mar nach raibh buan-chónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht ag an am cé gur tháinig siad ar ais gan mhoill ina dhiaidh sin nó mar go raibh an <Col N="1146" /> teach ró-mhór i gcás na Roinne Comhshaoil. Tá roinnt daoine i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall ar tharla sé sin dóibh.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil a fhios sin ag an Aire Stáit agus mar adúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív tá an rud céanna amhlaidh i gConamara agus ní éiríonn leis na daoine sin deontas de chineál ar bith a fháil.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Maidir le coinníollacha na Roinne Comhshaoil a chur i gcomparáid le coinníollacha Roinn na Gaeltachta, b'fhéidir gur cheart dúinn a rá go ginearálta gur féidir £1,000 sa bhreis a fháil taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil ar fáil sna ceantair eile.</P>
      <P>Tá fhios agam faoin riail maidir le uasachar an tí &mdash; 1,346 troigh chearnach; má tá sé níos mó ná sin ní féidir an deontas a fháil ón Roinn Chomhshaoil.  Ach ar ndóigh nuair atá teach á thógaint sa Ghaeltacht níl teora ar bith maidir leis an achar sin.  Sin iad na rialacha atá ann i láthair na huaire.  Ar ndóigh tá rialacha ann maidir le caighdeán na Gaeilge agus ba mhaith liom pointe a dhéanamh maidir le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge a athraíodh le déanaí.  Páiste ar bith anois a bhfuil na cigirí sásta go mbeidh an tard-chaighdeán bainte amach acu taobh istigh de thrí bliana, beidh siad sásta 50 faoin gcéad den deontas a íoc leo.  Teaghlach ar bith a fhaigheann an deontas sin, beidh siad ábalta an deontas £4,000 a fháil freisin.  Chuireamar é sin san áireamh, go háirithe nuair a bhíomar ag smaoineamh ar na himirceoirí a thagann abhaile agus caighdeán na Gaeilge chomh hard agus is féidir acu, b'fhéidir. Tá súil agam go sásaíonn sé sin na Teachtaí.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gceist i dtaobh achar an tí i gcás daoine ag filleadh ar an tír seo, beidh mé féin agus an tAire sásta an cheist sin a chíoradh amach anseo.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the importance and potential of arts for community empowerment through job creation, he will give the number of artists, as defined by the Arts Act, 1951, who are members of the county enterprise partnership boards; the percentage this is of the total membership; the representations, if any, he made to ensure that artists and artists' concerns will be adequately represented on the county enterprise partnership boards; the contact, if any, he has had with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in relation to this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, is responsible for the county enterprise partnership boards and arranges the mechanism for the appointment of members.  Regarding the specific concerns of artists, I see those concerns being an intrinsic part of the agenda of this broad based community initiative, particularly where it refers to the participation of the social partners, who are aware of my views and policies which aim to place the arts at the centre of society rather than at its periphery.</P>
      <P>I confirm that I have been in personal contact with the Minister and his Department on this issue.  The Deputy will be aware, of course, of the contribution that the social employment schemes established by the Minister some ten years ago have made to arts in general and community arts in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the FÁS community initiative awards which highlight the huge contribution that heritage work is making to communities.  For far too long artists have been ignored in policy terms and I think it is important that artists should have an input when policy is being made. I consider that the county enterprise partnership boards will have that type of role. That was why I specifically requested the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to ensure that this was the case.  Will the <Col N="1148" /> Minister clarify what representations he made to his colleague on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I cannot make representations to another Minister.  I consult and discuss how mechanisms are to be implemented, but I could not dictate or seek to dictate to another Minister that one group had to be included to the exclusion of others.</P>
      <P>In my reply I said that I explained the centrality of arts and the Minister agreed with me.  In order to give the Deputy as much information as possible, let me say that I see the county enterprise partnership board as a body with an arts component.  There are many projects already approved which have an arts content. People from a community arts background are members of such boards, but I intend to take further initiatives in relation to community arts intervention programmes.  That will turn very good schemes in which there is activity into yet another specific and tightly structured intervention.  I am examining that matter at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister cannot dictate to other Ministers but he should consider some mechanisms which would ensure that job creation in the arts is high on the agenda of those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That point will not escape people.  The Deputy and I are at one on this, job creation in the arts and related areas is cheaper than elsewhere and it would be foolish of us to neglect this opportunity.  Consultations on this matter will continue.</P>
      <P>In relation to the possibility of community arts intervention stratgies, before it is possible to engage in the arts in an enterprising way, we must remember that some communities are demoralised and others are organising themselves and it is towards those groups and their potential to organise themselves that I am looking in regard to a possible new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the <Col N="1149" /> central point of Deputy Fitzgerald's question, namely, the membership of the county enterprise boards.  In view of the Minister's earlier assertion of his success to date in convincing his Cabinet colleagues of the importance, from a job creation point of view, of the arts area, is he not disappointed that his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who had the power to appoint members to all boards throughout the country, did not take advantage of his power and appoint members to specifically represent the arts and culture failed? Is the Minister not disappointed that his representations in that area have failed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The state of the Minister's feelings is never a matter for this House.  I am grateful for what has been done by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in respect of the arts. The Deputy will appreciate that if we took from community arts what has been done by FÁS and the social employment schemes there would be very little left. The Minister has been made aware of my views and he and I are of one mind in regard to maximising the job creation potential of community arts and arts in general.</P>

Cén fáth a bhfuil sé ag tógáil chomh fada sin ar an Aire cinneadh a dhéanamh sa cheist thábhachtach seo?  An nglacann sé leis gurb í an turasóireacht ceann de na tionscail is tábha chtaí sna ceantair Ghaeltachta? Tugann an turasóireacht a lán airgid isteach sna Gaeltachtaí agus cothaíonn sé a lán postanna iontu.  Más fíor go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag Údarás na Gaeltachta postanna a chothú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta nach cóir don Aire a chinntiú go mbeidh na cumhachtaí seo ag Údarás na Gaeltachta?  Leis an bhfírinne a rá ní fheictear domsa go bhfuil mórán céille le cumhachtaí chun turasóireacht a chur chun cinn ins na Gaeltachtaí a choimeád ón Údarás.  Tá sé in am é seo a dhéanamh.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Freagróidh mé deireadh na ceiste i dtosach. Glacaimse le tábhacht tionscal na turasóireachta in iarthar na hÉireann go ginearálta ach go háirithe sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Glacaim gur féidir anfhorbairt a dhéanamh ar an tionscal sin agus mar a dúirt an Teachta, postanna a chruthú.  Táimid go léir i bhfábhar sin.</P>
      <P>Tá an cheist seo á plé le fada an lá.  De réir Alt 9 de Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta is féidir leis an Údarás iarratas a chur chuig an Roinn agus ón Roinn go dtí an Rialtas chun cumhachtaí breise a fháil. Fuaireamar litir ón Roinn Údarás ar an 21ú lá Meán Fómhair, 1993.  Cé go raibh go leor cainte faoi go dtí seo, seo an chéad uair go bhfuarathas litir faoi.  Dúirt mé féin go minic é agus an chéad uair a chasfaidh mé le bord Údarás na Gaeltachta déarfaidh me leo go bhfuilim i bhfábhar seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a chas an tAire le Údarás na Gaeltachta i lár mí Aibreáin &mdash; an 16ú lá d'Aibreán measaim &mdash; dúirt sé leo go raibh sé i bhfábhar cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá an litir faigthe againn anois.  Ar ndóigh tá mé cinnte go mbeidh níos mó eolais de dhith orainn agus táimid ag déanamh teangbháil leis an <Col N="1151" /> Roinn Turasóireachta agus Trádála i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chas Aire na Gaeltachta le bord Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an 4ú lá d'Eanáir 1990, dúirt sé go mbeadh Aire ar bith sásta ceist ar bith faoi chumhachtaí breise a chíoradh ach an cás iomlán a leagadh amach ag an Údarás &mdash; na lochtanna sa chóras, na bealaí chun iad a leigheas, an costas a bheadh i gceist, agus mar sin de.  Ar ndóigh má thugtar cumhachtaí breise beidh airgead breise de dhíth chomh maith agus beidh orainn dul i dteangbháil leis an Roinn Airgeadais chomh maith.

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The ideal situation is that only researched excavation should take place.  In reality, if development of the medieval city is to take place, interference with its archaelogical remains is inevitable.  In this connection, the National Monuments Advisory Committee recommended in its urban archaeology guidelines that development should have minimal interference with archaeological layers, thereby conserving archaelogical deposits for future discovery and examination.</P>
      <P>A large number of excavations have taken place over the past 20 to 30 years and the results of these have not yet been fully assimilated.  Any future research should take account of knowledge obtained from earlier excavations &mdash; not only in terms of findings but in terms of methodology.  Large scale archaeological research is now a matter for the discovery programme, which has identified the late bronze age and early iron age as the priority areas for study.  No doubt in due course, they will turn their attention to medieval Dublin to work on the preserved archaeological deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which covers many matters about which I am not directly familiar. The Minister is aware how developer-driven development in Dublin ultimately leads to the discovery of substantial archaeological or other significant remains which it would be desirable to <Col N="1154" /> preserve.  However, because the project is development led rather than archaeologically or historically led, in the absence of an adequate budget for such work at local or national level, we find ourselves taking fire brigade action to preserve objects with the developer's gun to our heads, with the result that we have to run to the Minister seeking money. Indeed, the Minister recently gave us £300,000 to preserve the major find of Geneval's Tower near Dublin Castle. Would the Minister see any advantage in bringing local authorities together to try to prepare a programme?  Should there be a separate budget which would permit local authorities to investigate their substantial historical and archaeological resources in advance of a developer moving in, or as a tourist or educational activity in its own right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's points are very interesting.  The discovery programme has operated in such a way that two periods, the late bronze age and the early iron age have been picked out for concentration.  The terms of reference of the discovery programme do not stop it moving on to urban archaeology but it is a matter of resource and time.  This is a very serious question.  One is dividing attention between development and responsibility not just to this generation but to future generations in relation to the value of what is there.  In relation to Geneval's Tower, I took an initiative to preserve and restore it.  I am delighted the Deputy has seemed to indicate that local authorities would take responsibility in these areas.  I made the point that the walls of Dublin are the responsibility of Dublin City Council who may be assisted to exercise its responsibility.  I agree that in funding local authorities we should have a provision such as the Deputy advocated.  It is an aspect of good planning.  Temporary, short term and medium term strategies are not always acceptable.  When one comes across sensitives sites now, one seeks not to close off the possibilities for future archaeological research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what the Deputy said <Col N="1155" /> because I was put under great pressure to produce money quickly to save the tower and I was glad to do so.  From all the debate that took place, I have learned that the local authorities are crucial and I share the Deputy's view that they must be encouraged to take responsibility because they also have the planning function. One can imagine what would arise if the planning function was vested in local authorities and archaeological responsibility somewhere else.  We all have a responsibility to co-operate to make sure that our heritage is handed on.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear the Minister's view is that Dublin Corporation was not as anxious as he to preserve sites.  The members were certainly very concerned to preserve this major find and would have liked more of the surroundings to be preserved.  Would the Minister accept that given the current state of financing of local authorities, while they might have a strong desire to preserve sites, the only time they have money for excavation is in the context of a development?  I do not seek immediate solutions, but perhaps the Minister will initiate a series of discussions to ensure that we do not have too many crises. Since the last crisis another private developer has discovered Isolde's Tower and luckily he intends to preserve it because he sees its value, but that was just luck. This should be set on a more satisfactory plane for all involved.</P>

      <P>I appreciated the concern of the elected members of Dublin Corporation in the event about which we spoke.  I would like to see the discovery programme reach urban archaeology quicker than envisaged at present but it is a question of resources.  When one discovers something like the tower, which we referred to briefly, it is designated as a problem.  If we go from one problem to another we will never have a policy.  One gets rid of a problem, hands it over to someone else and says it is somebody else's problem but meanwhile <Col N="1156" /> the clock is ticking away in relation to the pressure the developer claims to be under and is in turn passing on.  I do not regard that as satisfactory and I will certainly co-operate with different authorities.  If the Department of the Environment want to discuss with my Department the mechanisms for approaching this in a more orderly way, I will be delighted to co-operate.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment of the debate I was dealing with how Dublin Corporation, as the housing authority for almost 8,000 rented houses in Dublin county, has functioned effectively as an absentee landlord.  That figure does not include the additional number of houses purchased under various tenant purchase schemes and so on. I was making the point to highlight the central importance of the measures of this Bill for the transfer of these dwellings, and other properties including lands, from Dublin Corporation to the appropriate new local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister ensures that the mechanisms envisaged by the Bill to cause these dwellings and lands to be vested in the new authorities cannot be obstructed by foot dragging by City Hall.  I acknowledge the validity of the arguments made by Deputies who are members of Dublin Corporation that regard must be had to their housing list <Col N="1198" /> and there is a lead in period envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am confident that a sensible negotiated accommodation on the housing list between the three new authorities and the City Council can be achieved. However, there must be no delay in the new authorities assuming managerial responsibility for the administration of housing.  The original planning errors, such as the enormous concentration of so many thousand local authority houses in certain areas, have been exacerbated by the effect of subsequent housing policies, such as the so-called £5,000 grant scheme in the mid-eighties which deprived these enormous estates of their usual community leadership and increased the concentration of unemployed in those estates.  Sensible tenant purchase schemes to encourage tenants to buy their houses encourage greater community stability and upkeep.  In this regard I welcome the current scheme.</P>
    <P>Tenant purchase schemes in very large local authority estates in places such as Tallaght and Clondalkin are necessary after the years of failure by Dublin Corporation to manage and maintain these estates and to pursue sensitive tenant policies, not least on casual vacancies. The Minister of State has dealt with this subject on a number of occasions and I support the thrust of his comments in the past.  I hope that with the impetus of this legislation we will be able to deal with this matter.  The years of no democratic accountability by Dublin Corporation to the people through their elected representatives have taken a terrible toll on those vast estates.  The legacy of neglect which the new authorities must now tackle as a matter of urgency must be taken into account by the Minister when the consideration, if any, for the transfer of the houses is being decided.  There will be an additional, severe net burden on the new authorities, especially on the inappropriately named South Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the House that these dwellings were built in the first instance from housing capital funds.  I accept that in the matter of the transfer <Col N="1199" /> of lands a somewhat different approach may be required in agreeing the consideration. However, it is important that the Minister's Department monitor very closely the transactions contemplated by Dublin Corporation in the months ahead in respect of property disposal and ensure that the spirit of the legislation is observed.</P>
    <P>Overall, the case has been well made that the Bill is about local government reorganisation as distinct from local government reform.  Not even in his introductory speech did the Minister betray any hint of his philosophical approach to local government reform nor did he advert to the critical question of local government financing.  I hope he will not be so reticent on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to deal with the question of local government financing as it relates to the question of reorganisation. The explanatory memorandum states &ldquo;that there will be some initial cost for the three new county councils in the start-up phase but this should be marginal in the context of overall expenditure&rdquo;.  I would like to think when we deal with the nitty gritty on Committee Stage that the Minister will be disposed to acknowledge that there will be and have been initial costs for the existing Dublin County Council in setting up the three new local authorities.  I should remind him &mdash; I think he accepts this &mdash; that spectacular progress has been made.  When people were told that the deadline was 1 January 1994 they did not believe that this could be done in view of staffing problems, the need to acquire new buildings and to negotiate agreements with the trade unions.  Yet this has been achieved with minimum disruption. In that respect a good job has been done. I hope the Minister acknowledges this in a practical fashion, given that the costs incurred have not been marginal; rather they have been significant in ensuring that the three new authorities will be up and running by 1 January 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which provides <Col N="1200" /> for the establishment of three new county councils in Dublin &mdash; Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash; must be welcomed.  Indeed, I welcome it wholeheartedly.  According to the 1991 Census &mdash; the Minister referred to this &mdash; the population of the area administered by the county council is 547,000, which represents a substantial increase on the figure for the previous ten years.</P>
      <P>This is an historic occasion and I would like to think that it marks a new beginning for local government in the greater Dublin area.  Nothing similar has happened in the history of the State.  Indeed, these are the first councils to be established since the local authority system was put in place in 1898.</P>
      <P>I should admit that I have a vested interest in this Bill.  I have been a member of Dublin County Council since 1983 and I would like to see a new structure put in place to ensure that local government, which impinges on the day to day lives of the general public, is held more accountable and becomes more relevant in meeting the needs of ordinary people. According to recent opinion polls the public believe that their opinions and views are not heeded by the council and they do not trust their councillors to take their views into account, particularly when it comes to the question of planning. This is a serious matter and it must be addressed.  Provision must be made for greater community participation and involvement in the process of local government.  That is the cry of people on the streets, not only of the residents' associations but also of those seeking improvements.  That is not to say, and I would be the first to admit this, that the Bill meets all these objectives.  However, it is a start and must be built on.</P>
      <P>At present I am the chairperson of the Fingal Area Committee.  If the Bill is not drastically altered during its passage through the Oireachtas I will be the first cathaoirleach of the first Fingal County Council.  That would be both an honour and a challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 phase I of the long overdue Dublin local government reorganisation commenced.  Provision was made in the <Col N="1201" /> legislation for changes in the existing boundaries and the establishment of three new area committees.  In addition, the membership of Dublin County Council was increased from 36 to 78 members.</P>
    <P>The headquarters of Dublin County Council is in Upper O'Connell Street. This location may have been convenient in the past, but for a population of 547,000 people in County Dublin it is of no relevance.  How could a farmer in the furthest part of my own constituency in Balscadden, a council tenant in Mulhuddart or a housewife in Ballybrack identify with a headquarters in O'Connell Street or, more important, the staff of the council?  I hope this aspect will be addressed with the move to the new locations in Swords, Tallaght and Dún Laoghaire and the provisions of the much needed sub-offices in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>Much media attention has been given of late to the performance of councillors but, in fairness, there has not been a proper balance.  Little account has been taken of the conditions in which they carry out their day to day business on behalf of the people.  In Dublin County Council, for example, 78 elected councillors have been obliged to transact their public business in a council chamber which is totally inadequate and really only big enough, for perhaps 40 members.  If the fire and safety officers were to inspect the chamber when a full county council meeting is in operation, they would close it down.  It is accepted that the general public should be able to see and hear the transaction of the business of the council.  There are two rows of seats in that building providing accommodation for ten.  It was totally unsatisfactory to witness the general public queuing outside the chamber waiting for someone to vacate a seat during the recent planning meetings of Dublin County Council.  Similar accommodation is available for members of the press, but those who work on a daily basis in the council also require proper facilities.  I hope this will be addressed in the new councils.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Local Government Act provided for the appointment of three area managers who took up their appointments <Col N="1202" /> in Dublin County Council in September 1991.  Since then major reorganisation has taken place in the council.  The staff of over 3,000 have been asked to accept changes in work practices including increased flexibility and, for the majority of the staff, major disturbance given that they will be obliged to change their work location.  The negotiations have been difficult in such a situation one would not have expected negotiations to be easy &mdash; but, hopefully, the outstanding issues will be resolved quickly.  In view of the unprecedented changes in Dublin County Council as a result of this Bill and the previous 1991 Bill, I wish to compliment all the staff from the management down.  Without their commitment we would not be where we are today.</P>
    <P>The last section of the Bill refers specifically to the financial implications. The State, the Department and the general public have done exceedingly well in that there has been little or no cost to the Exchequer to date.  However, there will now be initial once off costs and I want the Minister to acknowledge this and take on board what has been said here by Members of this House and by the management of Dublin County Council.  I refer specifically to the Fingal area where there will be additional costs for the setting up and staffing of a computer area to facilitate new computer developments, without which it would not have been possible to meet the Minister's target.  It is also true that outside assistance was required in the form of a consultant's report.</P>
    <P>There was much debate about the location of the new headquarters.  That has been decided upon and it is to be in Swords.  We in Fingal will not be as fortunate as our counterparts in south Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter have their own building and south Dublin people have the benefit of an urban renewal designation on their site which has been very helpful to the council.  The Minister refers to the release of office accommodation which the transfer of staff will bring about.  However, this may not be disposed of as quickly as we would like, given the system of leases and the state of the property market at <Col N="1203" /> present.  The cost of the Swords headquarters could come to anything up to £10 million, with repayments and interest amounting to £1.2 million a year.  That is a huge imposition on the new Fingal Council and there are major difficulties and problems in that area.  The commercial rate is vitally important for the day to day operations of the council. Based on 1992 figures or estimates, the commercial rate for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is £14.8 million, for Dublin south it is £16.5 million but for Fingal it is £11.4 million, the lowest commercial rate of the three.  I would ask the Minister to look favourably on these once off payments and leave the door open to facilitate the type of discussions and negotiations required between his Department and the new managers.  I ask the Minister also to give a commitment that in this first year of operation from 1 January onwards the new Fingal area council will not lose out as a result of difficulties with the commercial rate bases.  If it loses out in the first year that will cause major problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The general public will welcome the establishment of the new councils, particularly in relation to planning.  From 1 January next rezonings, section 4 motions, material contraventions and development plan decisions will be decided solely by councillors in the new council areas.  The Fingal Council comprises 24 councillors and they will have to answer to the public and live with the consequences of their decisions.  That is as it should be and that is the wish of the public.  Media reports highlighted that the County Dublin development plan process is nearing an end.  Major controversial rezonings were pushed through in many areas against the wishes of local councillors, planners, engineers, residents and community groups.  In my area of Fingal decisions on rezoning were made in respect of the areas of Donabate, Portrane, Swords, River Valley, Malahide, Portmarnock and Dublin Airport, which is such a sensitive area now.  In the Swords area decisions on rezoning were pushed through, but the road and sewerage infrastructure was inadequate to support development.  The green belt area <Col N="1204" /> between Swords and Malahide was decimated by 25 per cent.  There was further erosion of the green belt area between Portmarnock and Malahide against the expressed wishes of local residents. Against the wishes of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Aer Rianta and local residents, rezoning proposals to build a hotel in the way of a flight path were made.  Proposed rezoning for industrial purposes of the planned second terminal required for the future expansion of the airport and the taxi way for aircraft were also made.  Those examples highlight the scale of the proposed rezonings.  Regarding controversial rezonings, will the Minister for the Environment exercise his discretionary powers under section 22 (3) of the Planning Act to direct Dublin County Council not to pursue those proposed rezonings?  There are also planned rezonings of the areas of Rathingle delineated on map 6 and Brackenstown delineated on map 3.31 in the Swords area.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to local authority dwellings and land acquired for housing owned by Dublin Corporation but located in the area of a different authority.  The provisions of this Bill should not be cast aside because of financial, managerial or political considerations in Dublin Corporation.  If development of local authority estates &mdash; for example Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart &mdash; is to take place, those areas must be under the control of Dublin County Council. Difficulty in this area arose as a result of a decisions taken by Dublin Corporation a number of years ago to relocate inner city dwellers in a green belt area without developing necessary facilities &mdash; for example, roads and shops &mdash; and creating jobs.  Such developments represent bad planning by Dublin Corporation, but I hope those problems will be addressed.  I hope this Bill will allow people in the greater Dublin area, particularly the area under the responsibility of Dublin Councy Council, an opportunity to become involved in the planning process. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  By any standards the changes proposed in the Bill will make history.  If the Bill is <Col N="1205" /> passed, I, along with Deputy Ryan and other colleagues who had the honour to be members of Dublin County Council, will also have the honour of being members of the first Dublin County Councils, I as a member of the first Dublin South County Council.  The county councils served our people well for the past number of years.  It is inevitable that this type of transition must take place.  There has been great expansion in the County Dublin area during the past 20 to 30 years.  I remember when the Dublin area was effectively one constituency, which stretched from the area I now have the honour to represent &mdash; Walkinstown and Perrystown &mdash; to Deputy Ryan's constituency on the borders of County Louth.  The Dublin area is now represented by a large number of TDs.  I recall some of those people who represented the large population of approximately 0.5 million people who live in that large area &mdash; for example, the late Seán Dunne, Mr. Justin Keating, the late Paddy Burke, Mr. T. F. O'Higgins former Chief Justice and Larry McMahon.</P>
      <P>Dublin Country Council comprises 78 members; it is unwieldy and unsatisfactory. As Deputy Ryan said, the chamber in which it transacts its business is unsatisfactory.  There is a series of pillars in the middle of the chamber which blocks the view of members opposite. Some people might consider this an advantage, but it is useful to view the opposite side and note what their body language indicates.  To some degree meetings tend to be chaotic.  The chamber is much smaller than the Seanad Chamber, yet the number of members of Dublin Country Council exceeds that of Seanad Éireann by 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Broughan, made a fine speech yesterday which derives from his sense of place and what is best for Dublin.  I would not agree with all aspects of his speech, but it was a fine expression of a sense of place that relates to the old Dublin.  We are now dealing with the new Dublin.  Approximately one-third of my area of Dublin South Central is in the Dublin County Council area and will be part of the new South Dublin Council.  The remaining two-thirds <Col N="1206" /> of my constituency is in the Dublin Corporation area and I have the honour to represent areas as old as Rialto, Dolphins Barn and those as new as the Orwell Estate and St. Annes.</P>
    <P>When talking about these changes it is appropriate to put on record the fact that they were initiated in 1986 by my colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, when Minister for the Environment.  It was he who set the ball rolling and it has worked its way to this final proposition which is before us today.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to specific provisions in the Bill.  I welcome the changes relating to responsibility for water supply from the mains to the households in the Dublin County Council area.  This may seem a rather technical and obscure matter, but in the Dublin County Council area the household is responsible for repairing and maintaining the water supply.  In an area such as Whitehall Road in my constituency if the water supply is damaged by traffic responsibility for repairs, which may cost thousands of pounds, rests with the householder.  This arrangement proved very unsatisfactory.  It was difficult to explain these matters to the public, particularly since Dublin Corporation is empowered to deal with all such problems in its area.  The same applies in the Dún Laoghaire area.</P>
    <P>While this may seem a trivial point to some householders, in County Dublin, it represents a very important and worthwhile change.  I vividly recall receiving representations from a constituent who experienced problems when the road across from her house had to be dug up to replace a waterpipe.  This lady told me that in order to pay for the work she would have to cancel her holidays.  Such was the enormity of the problem for people unfortunate enough to live in these areas.  I welcome the change in the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of my colleagues on Dublin County Council referred to the difficulties that arise due to the fact that Dublin Corporation owns houses in the Dublin County Council area.  That represents an enormous democratic deficit because, as a number of speakers have said, people who reside in Dublin Corporation housing located in the county <Col N="1207" /> council area must exercise their votes for the county council.  They vote for members of Dublin County Council in the hope that they will exert pressure on Dublin Corporation on their behalf.  This is totally unsatisfactory and I welcome the provision dealing with this matter. Like Deputy Ryan, I hope it will not be put on the long finger and that real action will be taken in this regard.  I accept some of the points made by my colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, yesterday in relation to ownership of land purchased by Dublin Corporation.  That problem also must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the event of changes being made, staff concerns were bound to arise.  These concerns were inevitable and to a large extent they have been addressed.  I hope the matter is dealt with to everybody's satisfaction.  Bearing in mind that some people will be inconvenienced, I hope that they will be appropriately compensated.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24 deal with the appointment of the coroner and sheriff and these appointments remain unchanged.  In relation to the chief veterinary officer, it is proposed that this person, who previously covered an area with a population of 200,000, will cover an area with a population of more than half a million people.  The Minister should consider the implications of that change.  This office is being downgraded while the professional services provided by other officeholders such as the coroner and the sheriff remain unchanged.  I am puzzled why we are making fish of one and flesh of the other.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on this matter. It should be considered with a view to resolving the difficulties referred to in the initial report which laid the framework for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems experienced by Dublin County Council in latter times relate to security.  I constantly receive representations from people asking me to request Dublin County Council to build a wall, erect a fence or close lanes in an attempt to deal with the worsening security problem in Dublin.  These responses are totally inadequate because in many cases the problem is simply being pushed <Col N="1208" /> to some other area.  Householders are very concerned about this problem and the county council spends a large amount of money trying to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Problems recently arose as a result of Halloween festivities.  I accept that this matter is not directly relevant to the Bill, but the county council should be given greater powers and resources to deal with bonfires at this time of year.  I received a large number of representations, particularly from elderly people living alone, who were scared that as a result of bonfires their houses would be burned. Dublin County Council worked all day last Sunday trying to cope with this problem and in many cases, if they did not believe there was an immediate risk to overhead cable or houses, they simply let the fires burn.</P>
    <P>There are enormous problems in relation to traffic control in Dublin.  I am glad the Dublin Transportation Initiative is proceeding with its proposals, and I hope that results in a resolution of the problem.  There is still a lack of information on the availability and cost of installing ramps and bollards.  This is an ongoing problem for people who represent County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Public representatives constantly receive representations asking them to try to eliminate rat-running.  Of course, it should be remembered that the elimination of rat-running in one area merely leads to the problem being transferred to another area.  I am happy to say that this matter is being dealt with.  It is important that the public realises the cost of installing these ramps.  If I remember correctly, two sets of ramps have been installed in each electoral area in Dublin.  Having regard to the scale of the problem, this is a trival response.  I think the residents of 200-300 housing estates have requested the installation of ramps in their estates. These ramps cost in the region of £30,000.  This explains why so few ramps have been installed in housing estates.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to planning.  This is one of the very desirable aspects of the proposed changes.  I have no desire to be involved in making decisions on the zoning and rezoning of areas in County Dublin which are miles away from me.  In many ways these areas <Col N="1209" /> are like another world.  It may be Deputy Sargent's world, but it is not my world. As far as I can gather, Balbriggan and Bray are excellent areas, but I do not think public representatives from the Terenure electoral ward should be involved in making decisions on zoning and rezoning in those areas.  People who live miles away from these areas should not be concerned about such issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the criticisms recently levelled against councils.  I agree with him that this criticism is not merited. However, it is part of the wider criticism of politicians in general.  Politicians are easy meat nowadays &mdash; it is easy to pick on them and point out their flaws. Regardless of whether we are politicians, captains of industry or ordinary men and women, none of us is perfect.  It is possible for a society to become too engrossed in nit-picking and making petty criticisms of politicians.  I want to ask people who engage in this type of activity: with what do you propose to replace politicians? What will replace the political process when it has been downgraded and respect removed from it?  The democratic process has severe limitations but when it is compared with the other alternatives &mdash; for example, tinpot dictators &mdash; I think most people in a civilised world would be in favour of it.  I am not saying for one minute that there is no need for reform of the democratic process &mdash; there is a need for reform &mdash; but we need to be careful about becoming trapped in a destructive situation.  I was pleased to see articles on this subject by Dr. Garret FitzGerald in last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> and by Roy Jenkins in one of the British newspapers.  I am glad a debate has begun on this issue, which badly needs to be addressed.  If the case in favour of the democratic process if not put we may well fall down a slippery slope which will not be in anyone's long term interests.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed changes in terms of their implications for organisations such as the GAA.  Far be it from me to start telling the GAA what it should do, but I wonder if a case could be made for the organisation of future hurling and football matches around the concept of the four new counties &mdash; in <Col N="1210" /> other words, the Dublin Corporation area, the South Dublin area, the Fingal area and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  Consideration might be given to this suggestion.  It is very difficult to organise GAA matches on a County Dublin basis, where almost one-third of the population of the county resides. My suggestion would give the less skilled inter-county players and opportunity to play for their county, an opportunity they would not otherwise have under the present system.  As I said, that is merely a suggestion; I would not dream of telling the GAA what to do.</P>

      <P>The debate on this technical Bill gives us an opportunity to outline our views on the local government system, which is far from ideal.  Having worked on the Dublin County Council development plan, I believe there are many imperfections in the present local government system. Unfortunately, in many ways the Bill is a missed opportunity to afford greater powers to local authorities.  Under this Bill areas such as Dún Laoghaire, which have been autonomous for a long time, are to be subsumed into a greater authority.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of consistency in the Bill in terms of the division of power. While the organisation of the vocational education committee on a county basis is perhaps being done for good reasons, it seems to be different from the general thrust of the Bill which is to create three separate authorities.  Obviously, this Bill can only do a limited amount, but I should like it to do more.</P>

    <P>I am concerned that many powers will still be left in the hands of the Minister after the enactment of the Bill.  While the Bill may be regarded as dealing with the <Col N="1211" /> reorganisation of structures, to all intents and purposes it deals with the reorganisation of powers.  At the end of the day the Minister will still have the greatest power.  I question whether some of the Minister's responsibilities in the Bill could be transferred to another Minister. For example, I am not sure if court houses should come within the scope of the Bill and I hope the Department of Justice has its own public works section to deal with courthouses.  However, that is a different matter.</P>
    <P>I question whether consideration has been given in the Bill to the development of Dublin city, which is quite large even by European standards.  I recently read statistics of population which showed that Amsterdam, which has the name of being a major and integrated city, is much smaller than Dublin.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities are so weak that I am tempted to call this a Disneyland Bill.  Local government in Ireland is a misnomer in many ways.  The Minister holds so much power and this was brought home to me this morning when I accompanied a deputation from the Balbriggan Town Commissioners to Dublin County Council.  The repeated answer to many of the queries raised at that meeting was that the Minister has yet to decide.  In regard to whether a non-primary road can be build, it was stated that the Minister has to decide.  In regard to whether a sewerage treatment plant is to be built, it was stated that the Minister had to decide.  In regard to the allocation of funds for housing, we were told again, the Minister has to decide.  It would appear that all the areas of responsibility in local government rest solely with the Minister and that is far from what local government should be about.</P>
    <P>During discussions on the county development plan I have found myself at times being thankful that the Minister retains some power but there is a flaw in legislation in regard to local government when developers are allowed to dictate the pace at which an area is developed through rezoning proposals.  That has <Col N="1212" /> occurred throughout County Dublin and has been well documented and reported in the media.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about the development of County Dublin &mdash; I take his word for it that he is &mdash; his reference to intervention in the crucial county development plan is vital.  However, I fear the Minister's comments will go no further than mere reference, which has been very eloquent and passionate.  He said that public money will not be available for bad rezoning proposals but nonetheless such proposals are being voted through for the most precarious of reasons.  A stark example was an area called Robswall, a green belt between Portmarnock and Malahide, where the proposal was considered to be meritorious because of an offer of money and facilities to local sports clubs.  The decision was not taken on planning grounds and considering that it involves the county development plan, one would think that planning would have been the critical factor.  However, it has been admitted by those who support the proposal that they are doing so because it will benefit the individuals and the clubs concerned.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how on the one hand a Garda investigation is called for by the Minister to investigate allegations of individuals receiving payment of money to influence their decision when voting while, on the other hand, a group of individuals, albeit constituted as a club, can receive money which in turn influences the councillors because they feel they cannot overlook the needs of the club and that is considered to be legitimate.  This needs explanation because there is a great similarity in terms of money being paid over in both cases.</P>
    <P>Are lessons being learned from such cases?  The Minister must legislate to involve the officials and those who are qualified in this area and he should spend time examining the criteria.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.45 p.m. until 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 November 1993.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has provided me with a welcome opportunity to acknowledge the artistic achievements of the Abbey Theatre at home and abroad during the term of office of the current talented artistic director and to wish the artistic, technical and administrative people who together make up our National Theatre a vibrant and creative future under their new artistic director when he takes up office in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Abbey as Ireland's National Theatre is the primary cultural agency for the promotion of theatre and the work of Irish playwright.  Since 1976 the Abbey has been funded by An Comhairle Ealaíon.  Prior to this the theatre was funded directly by the State through the Vote of the Minister for Finance.  Having regard to the importance of the Abbey and its status as a national cultural institution I am considering whether it would be more appropriate in current circumstances to fund the theatre directly through my Department's Vote in the same way as other national institutions <Col N="1157" /> such as the National Museum or the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Under such an arrangement I would expect An Comhairle Ealaíon to remain involved in the ongoing appraisal of the Abbey's funding needs.  I am firmly committed to ensuring that the National Theatre Company receives the funding and support it needs to maintain and develop its important role in the cultural life of the nation.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the perceived imbalance between the major art institutions in Dublin compared to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question on 9 March, 1993 any capital city will attract to itself major institutions, administrative, political and cultural. However, when one considers a richly endowed city such as Dublin it is important to bear in mind that cultural institutions such as the National Museum and the Irish Museum of Modern Art are national assets rather than local or regional institutions.</P>
      <P>I believe that some imbalance exists in the arts infrastructure of the State and in this regard discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of the Environment so that both Departments can co-ordinate future planning in this area.  It is, however, important to realise that local authorities will have to play a significant part in addressing any imbalance which may exist in their own areas and I look forward to their co-operation and commitment in this regard.</P>

      <P>Under Statutory Instrument No. 421 of 1983, which was made under the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, statutory responsibility for the collection of television licence fees was transferred to An Post.

    <P>

      <P>I welcome the inclusion of a specific Article on Culture in the Maastricht Treaty, since this, for the first time, gives the Community a firm legal basis for action in the cultural sphere.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Maastricht Treaty only came into force in the Community on Monday last, 1 November.  Because of the delays experienced by some member states in acceding to the Treaty, attention has been deflected from the component parts of the Treaty for some time and the European Commission has yet to furnish member states with its Interpretation of Article 128 on Culture and the prospects it offers for future cross-Community initiatives in the cultural sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy, however, that I warmly subscribe to the sentiments expressed throughout Article 128 of the Maastricht Treaty, including paragraphs 1 and 2 of that Article.  Now that the Treaty has been adopted, I will be working closely with the other member states, through the Community's culture committee, to devise new policies reflecting the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 and, indeed, all aspects of the Article.  In this context, I <Col N="1163" /> regard the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Article &mdash; which states that &ldquo;the Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of this Treaty&rdquo;&mdash; as being particularly attractive, in that it will provide me with an opportunity to ensure that cultural policy considerations are integrated, where appropriate, with the wide range of Community interventions envisaged under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>Is eol dom go maith na deacrachtaí maidir le cúrsaí calaíochta idir Oileán Thoraí, Inis Bó Finne agus Machaire Rabhartaigh agus tá cúnamh áirithe curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinnse le tamaillín anuas d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar na saoráidí éagsúla ag na hionaid sin.</P>
      <P>Ceadaíodh deontas £12,000 i 1992 chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara oibreacha feabhsúcháin a chur i gcrích ag Cé Mhachaire Rabhartaigh agus ag tús na bliana seo ceadaíodh deontas £8,000 chun a chumasú do Chomhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall oibreacha feabhsúcháin riachtanacha a dhéanamh ar an bpiara agus ar an bhfánán ag Inis Bó Finne.  Tá an dá scéim sin críochnaithe anois.</P>

    <P>Maidir le Oileán Thoraí cuireadh deontas c. £43,000 ar fáil ó mo Roinnse le go bhféadfadh Roinn na Mara suirbhéanna éagsúla móide staidéar mionsamhail a dhéanamh chun na saoráidí calaíochta ab oiriúnaí do riachtanais mhuintir Thoraí a aithint agus chun meastachán ar an gcostas a bhainfeadh leo a dhéanamh amach.  De dhroim na suirbhéanna sin tá tuarascáil comhairleóirí ar fáil anois.  Is í an chéad chéim eile ná tástáil suímh agus dearadh cuimsitheach <Col N="1164" /> a dhéanamh.

      <P>Council Directive 89/552 of 3 October, 1989, which came into effect on 3 October, 1991, lays down certain requirements in relation to broadcasts transmitted across frontiers by various technologies, including satellites.

      <P>I have no firm proposals at this stage for the creation of a national film school, although I can inform the Deputy that I would very much favour the creation of such a school in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>As regards the location of such a project if it were to be established in the future, while I am happy to acknowledge the excellent standards and levels of professionalism which have been set by Ardmore Studios in Bray, I am already on record as announcing my intention to focus my policy on the creation of regional clusters of arts and cultural activities linked to specific themes.  I have identified the Galway region as the focus for the promotion of the film sector of the State and, to this end, I have already decided to locate Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, in Galway.</P>
      <P>I will, of course, when discussions in relation to the film industry at a national and local level are being taken bear the excellent standards at Ardmore Studios in mind as a resource with achievement and potential.</P>

      <P>My Department is interested not only in art and music in the educational system but also in dance, drama and media studies.  It also goes without saying that the role and status of the Irish language in our schools is also an important aspect of educational provision in which my Department takes a major interest.</P>
      <P>I have discussed these matters with the Minister for Education and my office has had a number of meetings with officers of the Department of Education to discuss the way in which the arts in their totality might be addressed in the White Paper.  Documents have also been exchanged, and the question of arts and music has received attention in this context and in the light of the proposals of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, published last March.</P>
      <P>I also attended the presentation by the Chairman of the Arts Council to the national Convention on Education and I believe that there will be a positive and constructive approach to all the arts in our schools in the coming years, and not just art and music.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the present 1 per cent scheme is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme local authorities may include in the capital cost of public works projects a sum not exceeding 1 per cent of cost or £20,000 whichever is the lower for an appropriate artistic embellishment. The scheme applies whether or not the project is financed from Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>, there is a commitment requiring local authorities to spend 1 per cent of their budget for capital projects on artistic embellishment. Officials of my Department have to date had a number of meetings with officials of the Department of the Environment regarding the operation of the scheme.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to pursue this important matter with the Department of the Environment.</P>

Maidir le fostaíocht a chruthú leanfar go dícheallach leis an obair chun tionscail fhiúntacha a aimsiú ó bhunadh na Gaeltachta féin agus ó lasmuigh di agus beidh an gnáthchúnamh le fáil ón Udarás chun tionscnaimh a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

Ar an gcéad dul síos agus iarratais ar chúnamh á scrúdú an chéad lá bainfear feidhm as dianchritéir mheasúnaithe d'fhonn a chinntiú, oiread agus is féidir, gur tograí inmharthana a roghnófar le haghaidh cabhrach.

Is é cuspóir na Scéime muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn sa teaghlach agus an pobal labhartha Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a láidriú.</P>

      <P>(d)  go raibh na daltaí i gceist ag freastal mar scoláirí lae ar bhunscoileanna agus/nó iarbhunscoileanna ar feadh formhór na scoilbhliana.</P>
      <P>Mura bhfuil an t-ardchaighdeán atá riachtanach don scéim ag teaghlach is féidir deontas laghdaithe (50 faoin gcéad) a íoc leis an teaghlach ach mo Roinnse a bheith sásta go bfuil ar a gcumas an t-ardchaighdeán cuí a bhaint amach laistigh den thréimhse trí bliana.</P>

The Programme for Government also guarantees that the main strategic utilities will remain in the ownership of the Irish people but will have the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private and co-operative sectors.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give precise figures for Ireland's contributions to or receipts from the EC budget over the period specified because of the number of variables involved in the calculation of the amounts.  In relation to our contributions to the EC, our annual payment is a function of a number of factors such as GNP, the size of our VAT base, the level of our trade with third countries and the quantum of Community expenditure itself while, on the receipts side, payments under the EAGGF, for example, are influenced by factors such as annual farm price agreements, world market prices, dollar/ecu exchange rates, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing these considerations in mind, <Col N="1180" /> it is tentatively estimated that our contributions to the EC budget over the period 1994 to 1999 will be of the order of some £3 billion while receipts over the same period will be of the order of some £14 billion in 1993 prices.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the particular application for relief from payment of vehicle registration tax under the provisions of the Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent <Col N="1181" /> Reliefs) Regulations, 1993 has been refused.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide that the person transferring residence to the State may be granted relief from payment of vehicle registration tax provided he had possession and use of the vehicle for at least six months prior to taking up residence in the State.</P>
      <P>The application in this case was made by the woman concerned in respect of a car registered and insured in her name. Her application stated that she had acquired her car on 26 January, 1993 and had transferred her residence to the State on 6 August, 1993.  However, the information available to the Revenue Commissioners is that the person concerned made a claim to unemployment assistance at Maynooth Employment Office on 10 March 1993 and was subsequently awarded unemployment benefit.  She continued to receive unemployment benefit up to 28 September, 1993, when she transferred to disability benefit.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that this indicates that the person concerned had transferred her residence to the State prior to 10 March, 1993, and not 6 August, 1993 as stated by her in her application for relief.  As she did not have possession and use of the car for the required six months prior to transferring her residence to the State, she cannot qualify for relief under the provisions of the Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the decision in this regard is being conveyed to the person concerned. If she feels that the basis of the decision is wrong, she may lodge an appeal with the Commissioners.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made to date in increasing the number of manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in the year 1990 in real terms which was set as an operational target for industrial development agencies in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress; and whether the assistance of the Central Statistics Office has been sought in establishing an independently verifiable way of measuring progress towards this target.</Quest>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the adoption by the industrial development agencies of an operational target to increase by 100 within ten years the number of Irish manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in real terms over the period.</P>
      <P>According to information received from the IDA, the number of Irish manufacturing firms having turnover in Ireland in excess of £5 million per annum in real terms increased by 22 during the period 1990 to end 1992.  The IDA estimate that a total of 175 Irish companies were in the £5 million plus turnover category at the end of 1992 as opposed to 153 such companies at the end of 1990 &mdash; both figures expressed in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is normally a condition of grant <Col N="1186" /> assistance from the agencies that grant-aided companies are required to submit audited annual accounts to them for each year of the grant agreement.  This enables the agencies to monitor the progress in terms of turnover of companies which they assist.  In the circumstances, the assistance of the CSO has not been sought in measuring progress towards this target.</P>

      <P>In the last two years the Department has carried out three investigations into incidents involving car ferries operating on Irish routes irrespective of whether the incidents occurred within or outside Irish waters.</P>
      <P>The report of the investigation into the cause of the deaths of two children on board the <i>Celtic Pride</i> in August 1992 was published in February 1993.  The report of the investigation into the incident involving the <i>Havelet</i>, which occurred in March 1992 outside Irish waters, was published last month.  In addition the Department's deputy chief surveyor reported to me on his first hand assessment of the incident involving the <i>Stena Hibernia</i> last January and which also occurred outside Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the <i>Celtic Pride</i> accident steps were taken immediately to ensure the safety of sewage systems on passenger ferries operating into this country.  The sewage systems of all such vessels are <Col N="1188" /> now inspected annually.  At Ireland's initiative, the International Maritime Organisation is working on the introduction of international standards for the design, construction and operation of sewage systems on ships.  In light of the <i>Stena Hibernia</i> and <i>Havelet</i> incidents a thorough going review is underway of a number of ferry practices and procedures including the loading and securing of vehicles and cargo units.  The national ferry safety committee, which is chaired by the Department's chief surveyor and represents all the ferry companies operating into Irish ports, will report to me shortly on ways in which current practices can be improved to enhance safety particularly in adverse weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The safe operation of car ferries operating on Irish routes is a matter of the highest priority.  It is in order to ensure that such vessels operate to the highest standards of safety, as well as to assuage public concerns about ferry safety in light of these recent incidents, that I have ordered this review.  I am satisfied that we can introduce any necessary improvements in practices within the existing legislative framework but where our assessment points to the need for a strengthening in the international legal framework the International Maritime Organisation will again be urged to expedite the necessary changes.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that the current uptake of the vaccine in their area is 70 per cent at two years of age with some areas reaching 80 per cent.  I have already stated a number of times that I consider that the uptake of MMR is unacceptably low and must be increased.  I have launched a number of initiatives this year to bring this about and would hope to launch further measures next year.</P>
    <P>I consider it vital that the common perception among parents that measles is a disease of little consequence be corrected. While the majority of children who contract measles recover quickly a small number however may suffer long term neurological damage and other consequences.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides a scheme for the inspection and supervision by health boards of pre-school services for children under six and for the making of regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government recently agreed to my proposals that the Act be brought into operation in its entirety by the end of 1996.  Towards this end, it has made available an additional £5 million this year, amounting to £10 million in a full year, to develop child care and family support services and to put in place the necessary staff and resources.  In the implementation of the Act priority is being given to the commencement of Parts III, VI, V and VI which deal with taking children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the ability of health boards and the Garda to intervene in cases of child abuse and to protect children otherwise at-risk.</P>
      <P>When these provision have been successfully implemented, I will then proceed with the commencement of Part VII and the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>Each script on which a review is sought is fully marked afresh by an experienced examiner other than the original examiner.  In the case in question the chemistry script was scrupulously reexamined by a second examiner but no change in the original grade awarded was found to be warranted.  There is no provision for a candidate's script to be marked by a third examiner and I am satisfied that the present procedures meet the needs of candidates.  Incidentally, the candidate in question sat the leaving certificate examination in 1992 not 1991.</P>
