      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing us the opportunity to pay our respects to the late Paddy Malone, former Fine Gael Deputy for Kildare, who was a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1965 to 1970 and a Member of this House from 1970 to 1977. Those who knew the late Paddy Malone knew him to have been a very quiet, unobstrusive man, whose special interests in the House by way of his representation were mainly the representation of farmers and small businesses.  In addition, he had a very direct interest in the development of eastern regional tourism.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and my party, of conveying to his sister, relatives and friends our sincere sympathy on his passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the <Col N="1530" /> relatives of the late Paddy Malone who had a very long and distinguished political career.  He was first elected to Kildare County Council in 1955 and first contested a Dáil election in the by-election of 1964 which followed the death of the late Billy Norton, a former Leader of the Labour Party.  Paddy Malone was not successful on that occasion.  I am sure, much to his own regret and sadness, the occasion on which he was successful in being elected to the Dáil was in the by-election in 1970 as a consequence of the tragic and sudden death of his closest political friend, the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman.  In many ways the late Gerard Sweetman and Paddy Malone were an ideal combination in terms of political alliance in that Gerard Sweetman had all the abrasive capacity to generate conflict in the interests of progress and Paddy Malone had the diplomatic quality to restore calm after that conflict had achieved its purpose.  Therefore, the two of them worked together as a very powerful political combination.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, the late Paddy Malone was particularly interested, as a Member of this and the other House, in agricultural matters.  He was his party's spokesman on agriculture in the Seanad. He had many tough political decisions to face during the 1970s when some of the policies which his Government was implementing were not entirely popular or acceptable to the farmers of County Kildare.  It was a tribute to his courage that he was able to deal with these issues in the way he did, never losing his composure, calm and quiet dignity.  Those of us who heard him speak in the House &mdash; and there are quite a number present who did &mdash; will remember him as having been very eloquent.  He had a very good command of English and when he spoke, which was not that often, he always had rapt attention.</P>
      <P>His loss will be felt particularly in his native county of Kildare but also by all his friends in the Fine Gael Party and members of the other parties in this House who came into contact with him during his very productive and fruitful life.</P>

      <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in extending my sympathy, and that of the Progressive Democrats, to the late Paddy Malone's sister and family.  Although he had been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 12 years I had not the pleasure of knowing him in that his time in this House preceded my entry to the Oireachtas.  Nonetheless I know of his reputation, living as he did in County Kildare close to my constituency.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my constituency colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, on my own behalf and that of the Fianna Fáil organisation in Kildare, I should like to extend sympathy to the sister and relatives of the late Paddy Malone.  He served Kildare very well over a long period, both as a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and as a member of Kildare County Council.</P>
      <P>He made many friends and would not have insulted many people during his lifetime, a feat very few of us can achieve in politics.  He had been unwell for a long time.  He will be sadly missed and leaves behind many friends.  Indeed, it must be said that he won a by-election against the tide, something which may be appreciated in the not too distant future.  He served his constituents well and we shall miss him.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael organisation in Kildare, all Paddy Malone's friends and supporters over the years, I too would like to be associated <Col N="1532" /> with the tributes to him.  I was reminiscing earlier today, that when I first met him, he was about the age I am now.  Paddy had many friends.  He was a great public representative and a fine public speaker who had the ability to raise the tempo and standard of debate when he saw fit. We shall miss him greatly.</P>

      <P>I would like to join my colleagues and others in paying tribute to the late Paddy Malone and to express my sympathy to his sister and to his family.  I knew Paddy Malone for many years.  It could be truly said that he was one of nature's gentlemen.  I never heard him say anything that offended anybody and at the same time he was very firm in his own political opinions. As others said, he certainly made no enemies.  He did much good in County Kildare for which he will be remembered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive together.  As Deputies will be aware, the Anglo-Irish working meeting, held in Dublin Castle on Friday last, was the first in a series of such meetings planned for this month. The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, was accompanied by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Douglas Hurd and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew.  I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign <Col N="1534" /> Affairs, Deputy Spring and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
      <P>The discussions last Friday focused principally on the development of an agreed joint statement which would constitute a formula for peace.  The prospects for the forthcoming European Council meeting in Brussels and for a successful conclusion to the GATT talks later this month were also discussed with the British side.</P>
      <P>A range of important issues relating to Northern Ireland were discussed, in particular the prospects of achieving a permanent end to violence.  In this regard, significant progress was made in the formulation of an agreed joint statement. Both Governments are committed to the objective of finding a formula for peace, which will command support from each of the two traditions on this island.</P>
      <P>A number of important outstanding issues remain, but both Governments are determined to reach a satisfactory outcome. The two Governments agreed, therefore, that senior officials from both sides should speedily work together with a view to resolving these.  This process of intensive consultation and discussion is already under way.  John Major and I undertook to review the position at the weekend when we meet on the occasion of the European Council meeting in Brussels.  In the light of this review, we will then decide how best to proceed in our work to develop a joint statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Keeffe's question as to whether I have ever met the Official Unionist Party leader, Mr. James Molyneaux, the Tánaiste and I have made clear on many occasions that we stand ready to meet the Unionist Leader or any other Unionist politician at any time and in any place.  Such a meeting would afford me a further opportunity to reassure him, his party, and indeed the wider Unionist community regarding their fears and suspicions of the peace process.  Our approach is guided by the principles of freely-given agreement and consent.  This reflects the reality that an eventual peace formula, will need to be generally seen by each tradition as fair and equitable. We recognise therefore that, to be successful, <Col N="1535" /> the peace process must take account of the need to safeguard the rights and identities of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  I repeat that we do not wish to predetermine, or prejudice in any way, the political future of either tradition.  That is a matter for negotiation and agreement in the context of a resumed process of dialogue.</P>
    <P>On the question of contact with Sinn Féin, there has been no change in the general policy or in the practice adopted by successive Governments in this regard.  However, as during the period of the Hunger Strikes, for example, it is essential at times of high tension, or as at present when there is a serious prospect of a permanent end to violence, that the Government stay in close touch with developments in the thinking, of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland through, for example, constitutional leaders, churchmen, community leaders, business people and housewives.</P>
    <P>Regarding the prospects for a meeting between President Clinton and myself, no definite plans currently exist.  As the House will be aware, the Tánaiste met President Clinton in Washington recently.  I wish to re-state here that the Government deeply appreciates the President's continuing interest in the Northern Ireland situation and his readiness to support in any appropriate way the efforts of the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to say that the prospects for progress will not be helped by speculation based on rumour or half-truths &mdash; either in this House or elsewhere.  I have pointed out to John Major that I regard it as his responsibility to keep James Molyneaux and the Unionist Party fully informed of developments, because of their continuing reluctance to meet the Irish Government.  I assure the House that as soon as I am in a position to do so, I will give them the full details of what is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned <Col N="1536" /> that there were a number of important issues outstanding following last Friday's meeting.  Will he accept it would be useful if the House had an outline of these outstanding issues?  I want to raise two issues with the Taoiseach the first of which relates to Articles 2 and 3.  Since the meeting last Friday the Taoiseach made it clear that he is prepared to put in writing his undertaking to hold a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 in the context of an overall settlement &mdash; I hope I am quoting him correctly.  Will he explain the difficulty in including such an undertaking in a joint declaration, if he is prepared to give it in writing, or, if not in the joint declaration, in an annex or codicil to it?  Would that approach overcome any difficulty that may arise in relation to the undertaking of the Government on that issue?  The second issue I want to raise concerns the position of the Unionists.  Am I to accept that the Taoiseach has openly issued invitations to the Unionist leadership?  Does he not accept it is absolutely vital that he has a full understanding of the Unionist position on the issues under discussion? Could I put it to him fairly bluntly &mdash; taking the words from the Opsahl report &mdash; and ask if there is an &ldquo;equality of esteem&rdquo; for both the Unionist and Nationalist communities as far as this Government is concerned?  If so, does the Taoiseach, in the context of his discussions with the UK Prime Minister, continue to bear in mind the need to have Unionist concerns taken on board in the context of the final declaration that will emerge from that discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions.  May I remind the Deputy that at all times.  I have said that I take into consideration, in working on this formula for peace, the fears and suspicions of the Unionist community and the equal rights of the two traditions that have to be enshrined in any approach.  It is no good recognising one to the exclusion of the other.  Nobody would make any progress in approaching the Northern problem in that regard.  If there is a problem in relation to the position I <Col N="1537" /> have stated here and outside on a number of occasions that, in the event of an overall balanced settlement, the Government will be prepared to put the appropriate question in a referendum to the people &mdash; I do not think there is &mdash; I do not have any difficulty in saying it will be put in writing.  Regarding the details of the outstanding issues the best I can do is read to the House the response of John Major which sums up both our views in relation to it.  I quote from his comments last Friday at the press conference when he said:</P>
      <P>Neither of us believes that airing those views publicly in advance of that agreement is going to make that agreement any easier to reach.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply the two Governments are committed to finding an agreement to the matters outstanding between us.  Senior officials from both sides are already engaged in discussions in London today and they will continue until they reach the end of the line as far as they are concerned.  In the light of the progress made by them I expect to have another meeting with the British Prime Minister, John Major, in Brussels at the weekend on the occasion of the summit.  I think I have dealt with all the questions raised by Deputy O'Keeffe but if I have omitted one please tell me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact the Taoiseach has stressed that the peace formula as well as the talks process must be such as to command the support of the two traditions.  That is important.  I wish to question the Taoiseach on an aspect of the communique issued following the meeting in Brussels in which both he and the British Prime Minister urged the Northern parties to intensify their efforts to find a new basis for inter-party talks between the constitutional parties.  What progress has been made since 29 October in getting talks going between the constitutional parties in parallel with his efforts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are available at all times to join the talks process.  The work <Col N="1538" /> in the background towards the resumption of the talks is being carried out by Sir Patrick Mayhew and Minister Michael Ancram and their report to the Anglo-Irish Conference on the last occasion it met was that not sufficient work had been done in the background to be able to invite all the parties to come back to the table.  It is a matter for them to report back to us as soon as they feel they have enough work done so that the talks process can resume.  We are ready to resume them at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he expressed the view to the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, that rumours and half-truths do not help the situation. In those circumstances, does he accept that it would be helpful to tell us the outstanding issues between himself and Mr. Major with regard to the peace process? Given that demagogues such as Mr. Paisley can thrive only in situations of fear and insecurity, would it not help to ease the fears and insecurities if, first, we knew precisely what was being discussed and negotiated and, second, if the people of Northern Ireland knew precisely our Government's intention with regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the latter part of the Deputy's question when I quoted what both Prime Ministers agreed.  I stated in the House that neither of us believe that it is going to be helpful to the resolution of the outstanding matters to have them debated in public.  That is our position and we are sticking to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help if people misrepresent what I say.  I try to express myself as clearly and simply as I can when speaking on the issues which are supposed to be causing fear to some of the Unionist people.  I have taken the opportunity on every occasion that people visited from both communities to explain that there is full respect for both traditions and there has to be full respect for the equal rights of both communities in any approach to the problem.  There is no need for fears and that is our approach to the preparation <Col N="1539" /> of the joint statement on the formula for peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that a number of important outstanding issues remain to be resolved. Is one of those issues the refusal of the British Government to acknowledge the legitimacy and value of the aspiration to Irish unity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of going into detail on any matter outstanding. However, I wish to tell the Deputy that the type of language she is using and the issue she is raising is taken from the leaked document that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> but that document refers not to the peace process but to the talks process.  A document, something along those lines, when it has been finalised by the Government, will be sent to the British Government, but that is a matter for the other process.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has put on the record of this House his willingness to put in writing his undertaking in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  Will he please explain in simple English why such an undertaking cannot be included in the joint declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it would not be included; I said that if there were difficulties over the understanding of the Government's position, we would be quite happy to put it in writing in any form in which it is requested if that can alleviate any of the problems.  I do not see any difficulty and I recall Mr. James Molyneaux, accepting the position as I explained it on the David Frost interview. Indeed, I saw the co-chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, the former Government Chief Whip and Mr. <Col N="1540" /> Michael Mates discuss on BBC's &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; a few days ago another misunderstanding that was supposed to be there but Mr. Mates accepted the Government's position.  Some of the difficulties that are being represented simply do not exist in my view.</P>

      <P>All parties in this House would be willing to be of assistance to the Taoiseach in seeking to ensure that direct face-to-face discussions take place between the Government and the Unionist community.  Does he accept it is extremely important for the avoidance of misunderstanding that such face-to-face discussions take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I go to great lengths every time I speak on this subject to try to explain every possible angle and to try to remove fears and suspicions in people's minds, regardless of the community they come from.  I am trying to signal clearly that both Prime Ministers and their Governments are engaged in a process of trying to put together a joint statement that we hope will commend support from both communities and from the paramilitaries on both sides.  We are trying to signal a new direction, a new beginning different from the past 25 years of armed conflict which has not brought results to anybody.  There will be no military victory on either side.  We want to signal clearly that the new starting point will be the cessation of violence, the objective, of course, being peace which should be the starting point of a new beginning in all our approaches to finding a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland.  We are trying to show the futility of violence in the 25 wasted years with its waste of effort, energies and lives which has been to the detriment of both communities so that everybody will see that a new beginning is necessary and that they should follow the new road ahead.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach stated in his reply that he does not believe it would be helpful to outline the outstanding issues in the House.  Does he accept that, in the light of the uncertainty and <Col N="1541" /> insecurity arising from people's fears that the issues being discussed and negotiated may have an adverse impact on either or both communities, it is important to make clear what the issues are so that the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic are treated as adults capable of making judgments and distinctions between what is good or bad for the North or the South?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach continue to stand by the six democratic principles enunciated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, the one that the people living in Ireland, North and South, without coercion and violence should be free to determine their future &mdash; which implies there could be a different future for Northern Ireland and for the Republic?</P>

      <P>I certainly hope there will be a different future for the two communities in Northern Ireland and that the starting point for the formulation of a new future will be a cessation of violence and an acceptance of the peace process.  We can then go on to the talks process.  I have sought at all times to keep this House fully informed and since this Dáil session began, I think there was only one week when I did not answer questions or make statements on Northern Ireland.  I have given extensive interviews in the print media and on radio and television and I had a significant response, particularly from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only yesterday a Unionist MP was saying quite clarly that he was quite happy to leave it to the two Prime Ministers to work it out so long as they bore in mind the equal rights and concerns of both communities.  I share that view and he can be assured of that.  It is the responsibility and duty of the British Prime Minister to inform the Unionist politicians, who have access to him at all times to ensure there is no misunderstanding and that their fears and suspicions are totally groundless.  The Deputy may recall that when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was prepared it was not <Col N="1542" /> thrown from one side of the House to the other.  A sensible person would not suggest that that is a better way of doing business between two Governments than the way we are doing it.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the formula required by the republican movement would not be acceptable to the majority community in Northern Ireland and that rather than delivering peace, moving along two separate processes could result in further violence from a different quarter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  It is not the intention of the Governments to lead the communities in that direction.  The vast majority of the people in the North would not even contemplate that.  My best information is that there is a strong move for peace and there is an opportunity for peace.  It is the responsibility of both Governments to grasp that opportunity and make sure that a different direction for the two communities is pointed out. We must first try to get a cessation of violence and then go on to the talks process where all constitutional parties and those who renounce violence will have an opportunity to have their views expressed on the best future for Northern Ireland. I am sure all parties accept that one cannot get stability or move forward in a political system which does not give equal recognition and equal rights to two communities who have been divided for too long by armed conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural aspects of the current GATT world trade proposals were the subject of a series of parliamentary questions on 27 October.  On that occasion, the Minister made a comprehensive statement on the proposed outline agreement on agriculture as it <Col N="1547" /> stood at that time and he detailed the Government's position and its negotiating strategy.  The Minister would refer the Deputies to the Official Report, Volume 435, No. 1. In addition, the Government's position on the round was outlined in the House on 16 and 17 November.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of developments in the negotiations since 27 October. The House is well aware that we have concerns with a number of aspects of the draft outline agreement based on the December 1991 proposals as modified by the Blair House accord.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, takes this opportunity again to indicate that he expressed those concerns from the beginning, as evidenced by the press statement that he issued on 20 November 1992, the day the Blair House agreement was concluded. This indicated that the Minister remained very concerned at the outcome in regard to volume limitations on subsidised exports, particularly in so far as they will affect the beef and dairy sectors, and that he will need to be clear that these can be accommodated within the CAP reform arrangements before there can be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the Agriculture Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other Ministers have since repeated our concerns about the draft agreement at a number of fora, including the Agriculture Council on 16 and 17 November and the special General Affairs Councils on 2, 6 and 7 December.  The Minister has also met bilaterally with Commissioner Steichen, the president of the Agriculture Council, the French and German ministers for agriculture and the US secretary for agriculture, Mr. Madigan.  In addition, officials of his Department have had discussions with the GATT Secretariat, with many member states and with representatives of the Australian and US administrations.  On each of those occasions, the problems which we had with the proposed agreement and the modifications which we are seeking in order to protect Irish agricultural producers <Col N="1548" /> and the Irish agri-food business were detailed.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of discussions between Commissioner Brittan and Mr. Kantor, US trade secretary, since 22 November with a view to securing the modifications to the draft agriculture agreement as set down by Council on 20 September.  The progress in those discussions was reported to the General Affairs Council today.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the discussions in a number of areas identified by Ireland.  For example, the front-loading and stocks issues have been addressed by allowing developments in 1991 and 1992 to be taken into account. Compared to the Blair House agreement, the revised arrangement, would allow the Community to export the following additional quantities over the period of the agreement:</P>

    </table>
    <P>In addition, the US have agreed to accept the Community's approaches on market access, including aggregation and to extend the peace clause to nine years. There are also agreed arrangements in relation to the Community's participation in future world trade growth and on imports of cereals substitutes. These developments represent progress. However, we made it clear at today's Council that they do not go far enough in a number of areas.  In addition, we indicated that we would insist that the Community must commit itself to maintaining producers' incomes and production levels at the same time as we accept a GATT deal and that the concession which prevents us from applying subsidies to beef exports to South East Asia should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Ireland will, of course, continue to seek to ensure that all of the issues and problems identified by the Council on 20 September in so far as they relate to the <Col N="1549" /> Irish agricultural and food economy are addressed in the ongoing discussions and that the modifications identified are secured.  The CAP compensation payments would be contained in the &ldquo;Green Box&rdquo; and are exempt from GATT commitments.</P>
    <P>Any GATT deal that may be agreed would apply for a period of six years from 1995.  The precise date of commencement has yet to be fixed.  The terms of the deal will apply on a multilateral basis with all parties being subject to the same international trading discipline rules and opportunities.  The timeframe for establishing a presence on any market will depend upon the efforts and expertise of traders and exporters.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the implementation of any GATT commitments will have to take into account the relative importance of agriculture and specific sectors in the different member states as agreed by the Council in November 1990 and as required by the economic and social cohesion obligations of the Treaty.  We have also insisted and will continue to insist that, in addition, there must be a clear understanding that the necessary Community resources will be put in place to finance any adjustments to support arrangements to maintain farmers' incomes at levels envisaged when the CAP was reformed.  Ireland's attitude to the final agreement will be decided in the light of the extent to which our concerns have been addressed by Council.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs some weeks ago that if we could not get the deal we wanted on agricultural trade we would be happy to be bought off by internal EC compensation, did not represent the final cave-in of the Irish delegation in the talks?  Will the Minister say what, if anything, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Tourism and Trade and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will do between now and 15 December to reverse the sell-out of European, and in particular Irish, agricultural interests? For once will they start fighting to get a balanced trade deal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 27, 34, 71 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of grant-aid for forestry development that all such proposals are compatible with the protection of the environment, and I am committed to ensuring that this remains the case.  A number of controls are already in place. These include an environmental impact assessment and planning permission for afforestation projects over a certain size, and as a condition in every case of grant <Col N="1554" /> assistance, compliance with guidelines covering compatibility with the landscape, fisheries and archaeology.</P>
    <P>On site pre-planting inspections by my Department's forestry inspectors and consultations with local authorities and other bodies, where there is environmental concern, are key features of our current procedures in seeking to ensure compatibility between forestry development and the environment.  Environmental considerations are playing an increasingly important role in our current policies and practices.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress the positive role of forestry in supplementing farming incomes, as an agent in rural development and as an economic sector which is growing in importance.  Strong support for forestry development is apparent in rural communities, as evidenced by the fact that farmers accounted for about 56 per cent of private sector planting last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State reminded us that certain considerations have to be taken into account, for example, an environmental impact assessment and planning permission for forestry developments over a certain size. Will he indicate the size and confirm that the majority of forestry development projects are under it?  Is he aware that people living in the western half of the country see the prospect of their farms being separated from those of their neighbours &mdash; not to speak of the view and roads &mdash; by small scale forestry developments over which they will have no control and about which they will not be consulted?  Is he further aware that these people fear they will be isolated from the rest of their community?  Does he have any plans to do anything about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked which projects will be subject to an environmental impact assessment and planning permission.  I can tell him that <Col N="1555" /> the amount of land involved is 200 hectares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is a sizeable figure.  On the question of environmental protection &mdash; this is one of the greatest safeguards &mdash; there has been a positive swing towards farm forestry developments as distinct from large scale blanket forestry developments with which we are all familiar.  To take last year as an example, it is worth noting that farm forestry developments accounted for 56 per cent of private sector planting.  I believe that farmers who plan forestry developments in their family farm holding will do so in a way that is environmentally friendly to ensure that they will not impinge on their neighbours.  There is sufficient understanding and goodwill within the broader farming community to ensure this.  In the new operational programme for forestry, for which I hope to receive approval in the near future, greater emphasis will be placed on farm forestry developments.  I would like to make one final point.  The greatest control is that all grant applications have to be approved by the Department.  It is my intention to ensure that the Department's inspectors, in visiting farms and approving forestry developments, will be aware of the effects of forestry on the environment. In this regard I do not share the Deputy's pessimism in relation to forestry in general.  I believe it has tremendous potential in terms of the contribution it can make to individual farmer's incomes having regard to the new premium scheme which has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate what percentage of total forestry activity is accounted for by family farm forestry developments in the 12 western counties and what proportion of planting in the 12 western counties is accounted for by family farm forestry developments? Has he any indication of the proportion of land planted in the 12 western <Col N="1556" /> counties during the past two years?  For example, how much has been leased by people who do not live in those counties but who are using this land to supplement their farming operations with a view to availing of the farmer retirement scheme?  Finally &mdash; this is the only positive point &mdash; will his inspectors in the course of approving projects for grants take account of the social effect of forestry development on neighbouring farmers who may find themselves isolated from the rest of their community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I do not have the statistics for the 12 western counties to which the Deputy referred but I will make them available to him.  However, I should remind him that it is a matter for individual farmers to decide if they wish to make land available for sale for the purposes of forestry and it is one over which we cannot exercise control.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that farmers in the east or west still have the right to decide what they should do with the land. It would be wrong of anybody in this House to suggest that we should exercise unnecessary control over the right of individual landowners or small farmers to do what they feel is right with their land.  On the question of the social effects to which the Deputy referred I accept that concern has been expressed.  All I can do is direct him to the ESRI report published in the current year on the social impact of forestry on communities in which it is clearly demonstrated that properly planned forestry developments make a significant contribution to economic development in rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20, 21, 40, 44 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that to date in 1993, some £340 million has been paid to farmers in respect of various headage and premium payments.  Total payments are at present £70 million ahead of the £270 million paid to farmers at the same date in 1992.</P>
      <P>Payments under cattle headage and premium schemes do not normally commence until November.  As well as that, EC rules now preclude any payments under special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit payments to 60 per cent advances.  Advances of 60 per cent are also being made under the cattle headage schemes.</P>
      <P>Excluding the November application period for special beef and suckler cow schemes which closed on 30 November and for which I do not yet have figures, over 350,000 applications have been received in my Department under 1993 cattle headage and premium schemes.  To date payments totalling £80 million have been made in respect of 160,000 applications.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to put a definite value on the outstanding payments, I estimate they are of the order of £50 million based on 60 per cent advances.</P>
      <P>Payments are continuing and I expect that the majority of outstanding cases where there are no problems with the applications will be paid their advances before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the record level of headage and premium payments achieved to date in 1993 &mdash; £340 million &mdash; is evidence of my commitment to delivering the various headage and premium grants to farmers at the earliest opportunity.  These payment levels are being achieved against the background of <Col N="1559" /> EC arrangements which, while extremely valuable to farmers, are complex for farmers and my own Department.  In this, the first year of the new CAP arrangements, I am satisfied that the Department is coming to terms with complexities and the extra administrative burden of CAP reform.  I will not, of course, be content until we have fully overcome all the problems involved and I am currently reviewing our arrangements in the light of this year's experience.  My aim is to ensure that we have the systems in place which will result in all payments being made at the earliest possible date.</P>

During the past few days I spoke to a number of Teagasc instructors who are trying to resolve the problems of farmers looking for maps; they are doing nothing else.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the EU will not allow him to make these payments before 1 November.  Why was the Department not ready to pay them on 1 November?  It is now 7 December and some small producers are owed between £6,000 and £12,000 which is their total profits.  In many cases they are owed more than that. Some are paying surcharges to the banks as a direct result of the non-payment of this money.  I have a list of excuses from the Department but excuses are no substitute for payment.  Possibly the setting up of the office in Portlaoise has meant a slowdown in making these payments.</P>

However, it is a huge operation to deal with the increased level of new applications coming on stream because of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I do not intend to paper over the cracks and say there are no difficulties. We have made a considerable effort to advance the payments, with £270 million more having been paid in 1993 than was paid in 1992.  I know that is no consolation to farmers still awaiting payment and I accept the sincerity of Deputy Crawford's concern about these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The statistical details for the years 1988 to 1992 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The categories being exported comprise mainly calves and weanlings to EC markets and stores and heavy forward stores to third country markets.  Exports have gone through the ports of Cork, Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Greenore, Rosslare and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, live exports amounted to 260,000 head as at 21 November 1993, compared with some 100,000 head in the same period in 1992.  A number of factors have contributed to the increase in live exports this year.  Firstly, some important third country markets which had been disrupted since 1989 owing to the BSE scare in the UK were re-opened.  Secondly, the substantial reduction in imports into the EC of calves from third <Col N="1562" /> countries in 1992 and 1993 created a scarcity of calves in the Community and this led to increased demand for Irish calves.</P>
    <P>There are greater benefits to the economy from exports of beef compared to live animals in terms of employment and value added and this is reflected in Government policy, notably by way of generous State grants for investment in beef processing.  I am fully aware of the concerns of employer and union representatives about the implications for employment of live exports and the Minister, with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, met them recently to discuss their concerns.  I should mention that the Beef Management Committee meeting in Brussels on 26 November 1993 decided to restore the relationship that existed between live cattle and beef under the export refund system up to last July.  This should assist the competitiveness of beef exports.  It is not open to me to take measures to prevent the export of live animals provided that they are exported in accordance with Community legislation but I will continue to press the European Commission to ensure that no element of Community policy is disadvantageous to the export of beef in processed form.  Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>The numbers of live cattle exported in the past five years were as follows:</P>

      <P>This is an important matter.  Many workers' jobs depend on the future supply of meat and cattle to <Col N="1563" /> their plants.  The Minister has not acknowledged the seriousness of the situation.  I raised this last February and I was told that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that this massive increase in live cattle exports is damaging our meat industry, is creating fear and threatening jobs and the future development of jobs, and is simply a luxury that we cannot afford?  It is stated that Government policy is to support processing at home. What precisely does the Minister intend to do to make that policy work?  He says he cannot get directly involved in ensuring that there is a supply.  However, if it is Government policy then it must have some effect.  There has been a massive increase in live cattle exports to the detriment of the existing meat industry and, in particular, to the detriment of any future development of the meat processing industry.  I have had no reply from the Minister as to what he intends to do other than simply plead with the EU to change the rules.  How does the Minister envisage the GATT, if concluded, impacting on the future of our meat processing industry?</P>

      <P>An expert group on the food industry has looked at the beef area. The Deputy would do well to bear in mind that as a market outlet intervention is diminishing and there is an operational programme in place and moneys committed to that.  We can have the funds for research and development, for market development and for various other areas so that we can add value to our beef and ensure wider markets.  The bottom line is that market forces obtain and the Commission has during this year made it more attractive in some instances to export cattle live than to slaughter them here. There will be a slaughter premium in place as of 1 January which will be paid to producers who make their animals available for slaughter on our processing plants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 35, 50 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The spring slaughter or deseasonalisation premium will be payable in Ireland in 1995 if steer slaughterings in the period 1 September to 30 November 1993 exceed 40 per cent of total steer slaughterings for the year.  The position is that the level of slaughterings in the September to November 1993 period should ensure the payment of the premium in 1995.  This will not, of course, be confirmed until the figure for slaughterings in the full year is known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of there being a premium, will the Minister give a guarantee that it will be paid promptly, bearing in mind that such a premium would fall to be paid in June and that a large proportion of the premiums which should have been paid in June and July this year have not yet been paid?  I ask the Minister to exert himself to ensure that a slaughter premium of that type will be a permanent feature of the EC beef system.</P>

      <P>When will the premiums be paid?  To say premiums will be paid during the year 1995 is not good enough.  People who held on to their cattle last year and did not opt for the slaughter premium got an increase in price that was greater than the premium. They received their premium payment at the time of the increase.  They received payment in respect of other stock in June and many have not received payment yet because of technicalities.  I know of a person who had cards returned on the basis of a technicality for another scheme.  He submitted his cards in June but they were returned to him recently when he had expected to receive a cheque.  These matters are all relevant. They are part and parcel of the MacSharry give away of intervention guarantees. These premiums replace those guarantees.  Farmers are entitled to know when their premiums will be paid.  Will they be paid in June, November or at a future date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 15, 39, 46 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>While it is too early yet to be certain in regard to this matter, I would expect our full quota allocation to be utilised. Certainly the allocation arrangements &mdash; including those relating to the reserve for priority categories &mdash; which I have made should facilitate a full utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the conditions he has applied to the allocation of quota from the reserve for both the suckler cow premium and the ewe premium have greatly held up the process of allocating those reserves and needlessly complicated applications for both those premiums to the point where there is now a long delay compared to what should have been the case?  People <Col N="1569" /> who applied for premiums under both those schemes from the reserve some months ago do not yet know what their quotas will be.  When will those applicants be told what their final allocation will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the ewe reserve, that matter has been disposed of and applicants will be informed very quickly in that regard.  In relation to the other reserve, we hope to finalise the criteria for qualification for that within the next few weeks, following which the applicants will be immediately notified of the position.  Every effort is being made to finalise that requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to whatever wonderful calculation is being carried out on the criteria for the suckler cow scheme, will it be designed to ensure that we use the full reserve that is available?  Will the Minister make sure that the criteria for qualification will be such as to ensure that there will be no unallocated suckler quota at the end of the exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that it is the intention of the Government, the Minister and the Department to ensure that the national allocation will be fully utilised by Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that when he considers the suckler cow allocation he will be sympathetic to applicants who may have been rejected last year because they did not meet the deadline for the 1992 suckler cow premium and were precluded under this year's scheme.  I know of cases where people have suffered hardship and may be pressurised into going out of business if the quota is not forthcoming.  Will the Minister give an assurance that those people will be given priority for allocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is a fair one.  As I indicated, the Department is in the process of finalising the criteria for qualification.  I will bring the Deputy's <Col N="1570" /> point to the Department's attention for consideration in the context of the new guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to create further bureaucracy.  It is my intention to utilise the human resources of the Department to speed up payments instead of sending circulars to farmers which would be of no benefit to them. At present our resources are directed towards speeding up the process of outstanding claims and the early payment of outstanding moneys.  We are doing our best to ensure in so far as we can that all those who qualify for grants will be paid before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not circularise this information will he avail of some other public medium to notify these people of the position, rather than have them going to Dáil Deputies and other people to seek information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies are delighted to get the information.  I have given a very detailed reply to Members who went to the trouble of tabling questions today.  That information will be taken up by the media and I do not know how better we can inform farmers about the position in relation to grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ecstatic about receiving information on grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, when drawing up guidelines, to consider young farm entrants and those on whose farms there may have been outbreaks of disease and who are penalised in terms of suckler cow quotas?  Will the Minister confirm that particular emphasis will be given in the guidelines to these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>A feature of all our <Col N="1571" /> schemes has been consideration of special hardship cases.  The cases referred to by the Deputy will be taken into consideration by officials in formulating the new scheme and I will ensure the Deputy's point is brought to their attention.</P>

It has nothing to do with whether Kerry is included in the Leader 2 programme; it has to do with the structure of the leader programme.  I object most strenuously to the inclusion of this question with a specific question about Kerry from my colleague, Deputy Deenihan.  The import of Question No. 72 is totally different from that of Deputy Deenihan's question and if the Minister seeks to include it he is evading answering the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The current Leader programme officially ends at the end of this month.  By that date, the groups must have decided on the allocation of the public funds to projects or activities. Under their formal agreement with the Department the groups have till 30 June 1994 to make all payments on foot of completion of projects.  However, the EC Commission is currently considering an extension of the 31 December deadline on the basis of submissions made by the Leader groups.  Subject to a favourable decision on this matter by the Commission, my Department is prepared to consider an extension of the 30 June deadline provided the groups can, among other things, demonstrate that they have sufficient funding within their approved financial plans to administer the programme. Alternatively, a group may of course continue without public funding if it can fund the costs of administration from its own resources.</P>
      <P>As Leader is one of the Community initiatives, funding for it is not expressly provided in the National Development Plan 1994-1999.  The EC Commission's Green Paper on the Future of Community Initiatives indicates its support for a Leader 2 programme but the amount of funding for this, both on a Community-wide and national basis, is a matter yet to be decided by the Commission.  I have already stated publicly that my wish is to see the present programme extended to all parts of the country and with increased funding in the next round, and this view is reflected in the National Development Plan.  At this stage, however, it is not possible to guarantee that any particular county or area will be included in Leader 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, in the light of responses to its Green Paper proposals, it will likely be early 1994 before the EC Commission formally adopts and publishes its Leader 2 programme.  Given the lead time to receive and assess proposals from member states, decision on the approval of groups and their funding allocation cannot be expected till late 1994. I am aware, as indeed is the EC Commission, of the concerns of the current <Col N="1574" /> Irish Leader groups to ensure continuity of Leader activities and for my part, I will be doing all I can to secure the earliest implementation of Leader 2.  In the interim the arrangements I indicated at the outset for the extension of operational time limits offer some scope for keeping to a minimum any gap between the completion of the current programme and the start of the next one.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the consultants evaluating the Leader Programme is generally favourable.  The consultants were impressed with the progress achieved to date and the commitment of the groups. A detailed final report, based on a comprehensive evaluation of the programme to be undertaken over the coming months, will be completed in March 1994.</P>
    <P>As regards the involvement of women in Leader groups, 20 women, representing 9 per cent of total, are members of boards while 47 women representing 63 per cent of total, are in management or administrative positions.  As the House is aware, under the new National Development Plan, the Government intends that all programmes and measures comply with the principle that there is no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender and will actively promote equal opportunities for both genders.  In the case of Leader, I expect that the degree to which these issues are addressed in the business plans of applicant groups will be a factor in their selection for funding.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Teagasc review group referred to by Deputy McManus. I understand that Teagasc invited the participating organisations to nominate the persons with functional responsibility for rural development to serve on the group. The Government's policy in relation to representation by women among its nominees to State boards was set out in the reply of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to Question No. 6 of 6 July 1993.  Representation by women in voluntary organisations is entirely a matter for those organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="1575" /> if it is the intention to exclude larger urban areas from the Leader 2 Programme? In view of the fact that a submission made by the North Kerry Economic and Social Council was not accepted although very high on the last list, would the Minister ensure that that submission gets priority in consideration of the areas for the Leader 2 Programme? Will the Minister give some advice as to the procedure to be followed by groups preparing to apply for the next Leader Programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of Deputy Deenihan's concern about the North Kerry group &mdash; he raised the matter with me on a number of occasions.  Unfortunately, I can give no committment in terms of prioritising that application in the next round.  The procedure is that following the announcement of Leader 2, groups throughout the country will be invited to submit business plans.  On the basis that the group to which the Deputy referred submitted a very objective plan on the last occasion, I am sure they will build on that plan and I hope they will be successful. I am of the view that there will be sufficient funding for a national leader programme on the next occasion. As Deputies will be aware, the present programme is a pilot programme covering 16 pilot areas.  Evaluation of the programme clearly indicates that it is successful.  I hope that groups such as that referred to by Deputy Deenihan will be considered in the context of the Leader 2 Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's question as to whether urban areas will be excluded, I do not envisage that that will be the case. I hold the view, which I have expressed on many occasions, that smaller urban areas are very dependent on a vibrant and expanding rural hinterland.  I see a great inter-relationship between small urban towns and villages and rural areas. The Leader programme should be compatible with that kind of rural-urban infrastructure.  To the extent that I can influence the shaping of the next Leader <Col N="1576" /> programme, I will certainly keep in mind the views expressed by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a final brief question?  In view of the Minister's statement that it will be a national programme, will all communities be free to make individual applications or will there be a population requirement which might prevent some communities from applying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which the programme can be applied nationally will obviously depend to a very large extent on the amount of funding available both from the EU and the Government.  Our submission to the EU will be on the basis of seeking sufficient funding for a national Leader programme for the entire country.  There are no fixed views in regard to a population requirement for catchment areas which apply for funding under the Leader programme.  The Deputy asked about the advice I would give to local communities.  My advice to them is that, through their county development teams and other rural structures, they should think seriously about formulating business plans which can be submitted for consideration in the context of the next Leader programme.  We want to avoid duplication and to have an organised co-ordinated approach so as to get the maximum funding.  On the basis of what is happening at present, the Deputy can take it that the Leader programme is emerging as a very worthwhile new concept in national development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister indicating in some way that the county enterprise development boards might be moving in on Leader territory?  If that is what he is indicating, I think there will be very serious worries about the entire Leader process.  All of the money under the current programme must be spent by June of next year.  The Leader groups have a certain amount of funding for their administration.  They do not like to use <Col N="1577" /> money they collect from local communities for administration &mdash; they want to use that money for development which is the whole purpose of the scheme. Between June of next year and January 1995 it will be necessary to continue work, as the Minister has suggested, on the preparation of programmes for inclusion in the Leader 2 programme. Most of the Leader groups, including the Wicklow Leader group who have been to see me specifically about this issue, do not have the funding to continue to carry out the work needed to prepare the programmes. What steps can the Minister take to ensure that funding, from whatever source, is made available to be channelled into those Leader groups so that they can continue work on the preparation of their plans for inclusion under the Leader 2 programme?  Will he give an undertaking to look at that specific problem so that the momentum is maintained right throughout the Leader 2 programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage any conflict between the county enterprise boards and the Leader programme.  In fact, they can be complementary to each other.  There is a need for an element of network development by all of the agencies &mdash; the county enterprise boards, Teagasc and other rural organisations &mdash; so as to maximise for the nation as a whole the value of these rural development programmes.  There is a vast different between the Leader concept and the county enterprise boards.  I hope there will never be any interference with the Leader concept under which communities identify in a voluntary way their potential for development, prepare business plans and apply for funding.  This new concept within the overall framework of national development is proving to be a success and should not be interfered with.  I have very strong views on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked a relevant question about the period between the ending of the current Leader programme and the commencement of the Leader 2 programme. As I indicated in my reply, the <Col N="1578" /> increased degree of flexibility we have negotiated will be of some help in bridging that gap.  I would be less than honest if I gave any kind of indication today that I would be able to negotiate some interim funding to bridge the gap between the two programmes.  I am discussing that proposal but I have to concede that I am not making much progress.  Nevertheless, it is a valid point which I will keep in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the very detailed and comprehensive replies he has been giving to questions, will the Minister elaborate further on what he means by a national Leader programme? Is he saying, on the one hand, that all rural areas which submit plans will qualify but, on the other hand, that there is only a limited amount of funds?  If there is only a limited amount of funds, will the situation which arose in regard to the Leader 1 programme arise again where more plans were prepared than there were funds available to support and somebody had to adjudicate on which plans would receive funding?  In the event of that happening will the Minister inform the House who will decide on which programmes will qualify for grants and which will be rejected?  Will the decision be made by the Commission or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Molloy is aware from his past involvement in this area, the present programme is a pilot programme which covers 16 areas.  On the basis of the programme being successful, it is our view that it should be extended nationally; in other words, we would have a scheme which would cover the entire country or which would at least enable individual communities to formulate business plans and submit them for funding.  I indicated that the extent to which the programme can be applied nationally will obviously depend on the amount of funding available.  In the event of the number of applications exceeding European and national allocations, there will have to be some kind of selection <Col N="1579" /> process.  The Deputy is facing the reality of the situation by raising that point.  I have not thought about how the new programme will be evaluated or assessed following the submission of individual development proposals to the Department. On the last occasion &mdash; I was not in the Department at that stage &mdash; the matter was initially dealt with by the Department and then by the Government before finally being forwarded to Brussels.  I have not thought through this important point but I will be glad to come back into the House to keep Deputies updated on how we will address that problem in the context of the Leader 2 programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister of State is not aware that on the previous occasion all the applicants were submitted to Brussels and that Brussels, and not the Department, decided which plans qualified.

      <P>The Deputy was correct in saying that on the last occasion the 32 national submissions were sent to Brussels and the decision was made at that level.  I have no hidden agenda.  I have not yet addressed the issue of how an assessment will be made in the event of sufficient funding not being available for all the national submissions.  I will address this matter and will be quite happy to answer questions in this House at a later date about how we propose to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is not realistic for the Leader 1 programme to continue beyond the June deadline without financial support?  One is talking about a large number of administrative <Col N="1580" /> staff, etc.  In relation to Leader 2, what kind of time span is involved before it will be established?  If the Minister is examining the assessment of Leader 2, would he accept that 9 per cent participation by women on these boards is derisory in view of the contribution women make to Irish rural life?  The Minister could impose a condition on all applications submitted to his Department that there would have to be full participation of women in any future projects. If the Minister does not include that as a condition he would be disregarding the Joint Programme for Government which contains a very clear commitment towards gender balance. Would the Minister ensure that women will be included on these boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my reply that in the assessment of future Leader applications the question of whether the applicant groups adhered to the gender balance in accordance with Government policy would be a factor in deciding eligibility, and that is still my position.  To put it more simply, in the context of Leader 2 and in our contacts with the various Leader groups, we will bring to their attention the importance of maintaining a gender balance when putting the management structures in place.  That would have an influence in terms of eventual decisions.  I hope that meets Deputy McManus' requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of and concerned about the time lag between the termination of Leader 1 and the commencement of Leader 2.  We have narrowed that gap in the context of being able to extend it at both ends.  However, a vacuum continues to exist which, from my point of view, cannot be financially addressed by the Department or the EU. This is a matter we have taken up with the Commission and we have indicated that bridging funding would be necessary to ensure continuity.  However, I do not wish to mislead the House and pretend <Col N="1581" /> that progress has been made in that regard because it has not.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that we have a very successful Leader project, Ballyhovra Failte, in Limerick and as a result of their activities, the West Limerick Resource Group has prepared a business plan.  While I understand the Minister cannot give a commitment at this stage as to what project will be considered, he will be very impressed when he receives the submission from this group and I trust it will be favourably considered.</P>
      <P>What impacts on many of these Leader projects, particularly if one is interested in the tourism aspect, is the urgent necessity for good clean water.  Not only is it important for tourism but it is important also for the farmers who have probably made additional investments.  With the dilution of funding in recent times for group water schemes, is there any possibility that within a Leader programme a group water scheme would be considered?  This would be extremely important.  If the scheme falls within the Leader area, I believe it would be worthy of consideration.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on the feasibility of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Leader is to create a community economic infrastructure geared towards the creation of jobs.  While I accept the Deputy's point that a piped water supply is an essential feature of any rural infrastructure, that kind of project does not fall within the overall Leader structure.  This matter was raised on a previous occasion.  I made inquiries in relation to its potential as far as the Leader programme is concerned, but it is not a qualified project under the broad framework of Leader funding.</P>

      <P>Coming from a county that has shown leadership in the Leader programme, the Minister cannot be <Col N="1582" /> seriously considering redundancies in any of these offices, regardless of how short the periods.  That would result in a loss of the experience these people have gained under the last Leader programme.  Can the Minister give a definite commitment to those people that their jobs are safe and that their work will continue into the next programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>If we needed any evidence of the success of the Leader programme, we would only have to consider the number of questions that have been raised here this evening.  There is nothing to prevent a local authority, or any other community structure, from submitting an application under either the current Leader programme or Leader 2.  It is a question of a group preparing a business plan with a clear focus on job creation. That is what it is all about.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the great personal interest the Minister of State is taking in the Leader programme and that is very important for its future.  From his knowledge of the programme, is he aware that one part of County Sligo is in <Col N="1583" /> the Arigna pilot scheme, another part is in the Moy Valley pilot scheme and a third part, with similar inferior social and economic conditions, is in neither scheme?  Would he regard that as being totally unsatisfactory and leading to great difficulties on the ground?</P>

The Minister is taking about extending the programme to the whole country, and he has not ruled out the possibility of Dublin city, for instance, which could require large amounts of money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that if the gender balance is not correct in the make-up of the board he may not consider the application.  Does this mean that a successful scheme, such as the Cavan-Monaghan Leader, would not be accepted for a future programme if the famous gender balance was not correct?</P>

I appreciate the Minister of State's effort in this regard, but surely we must have the full commitment of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that the jobs established as a result of Leader will be maintained.  We appreciate the Minister of State's commitment but the <Col N="1584" /> only way that can be proved beyond question is to ensure that these jobs will be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 23, after &ldquo;1967&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and in accordance with Article 8c of the Treaty on European Union 1993&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have resubmitted our three amendments which had been tabled on Committee Stage because the Minister said he would come back at Report Stage on all the issues we raised.  The purpose of this amendment is to include in the first section of the Bill our responsibilities under Article 8c of the Treaty on European Union 1993.  Article 8c of that Treaty states:</P>
      <P>Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the member state of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any member state, on the same conditions as the nationals of that state.  Before 31 December 1993, member states shall establish the necessary rules among themselves and start the international negotiations required to secure this protection.</P>
      <P>I understand that on 28 October a Commission document which raised this particular article was issued.  Part of Article 8c was implemented as far back as July 1993 whereby a letter issued to all the embassies of EU members in nonmember states instructing them to give certain help and assistance to members of other EU countries.  The agreement now is that by 31 January 1994 the regulations must be agreed among the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not accept this amendment I am afraid that regulations will be agreed by the member states before 1 January 1994 and that he will then have to bring in legislation to implement these regulations.  The purpose of including our responsibilities under the Treaty in this Bill is that it <Col N="1692" /> allows the Minister to implement regulations afterwards.  If the Minister has discussed this matter with his officials he will have found that it will not cause any great difficulty but it will ensure that the legislation we are now amending will not require further amendment in another two months.  I am very interested to hear what examination the Minister has carried out since Committee Stage on this issue.  This is the first diplomatic legislation I have handled since I came into this House.  It would be a shame to lose this opportunity to fulfil our obligations. Perhaps the Minister can say what part Ireland is playing in these discussions for the preparation of the regulations to implement Article 8c.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to dwell on the last point raised by my colleague, Deputy Owen.  Because legislation emanating from the Department of Foreign Affairs is almost as rare as snow in the middle of summer the Minister will not have the opportunity to deal with the points we have raised in other legislation in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of the amendment relates to the new situation arising from the Maastricht Treaty.  It is important that we discharge our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty and this is the first opportunity we have had to include the provision in question in legislation; more importantly, that part of the Maastricht Treaty will probably be of greater benefit to Irish citizens than to the citizens of other member states such as the United Kingdom, Germany or France.  The larger member states have diplomatic representation all over the world, indeed there is hardly a country where France or the UK do not have diplomatic representation whereas, because we have to cut our cloth according to our measure, the number of embassies we have is necessarily limited.  Obviously it suits us to ensure that our citizens have an entitlement to go to the embassy of another state regardless of where they are in the world but I do not think we can tell our citizens that they can avail of that facility unless we ensure that in our small way <Col N="1693" /> we reciprocate.  That is why we are pressing the Minister on this issue and I hope he will take the amendment on board in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough that Ireland dines <i>à la carte</i> in choosing what it should implement of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  If we are serious about implementing the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty, to which Ireland is a signatory, we should be seeking to do so at every possible opportunity as appropriate legislation arises.  As my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, has pointed out, it is seldom that the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets an opportunity to enact legislation.  Acceptance of this amendment gives Irish citizens an opportunity to be represented in third countries where we have no representation at present.  That is certainly an important step forward, particularly for citizens in countries where Ireland has no diplomatic or consular representation.  We are told there are financial reasons for not establishing embassies or consulates and we accept that we cannot be represented in all jurisdictions around the world. However, an opportunity exists whereby our citizens can have recourse to other embassies who will make representations on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael amendment is merely to implement the Treaty on European Union in its entirety by giving the Minister a unique opportunity to enshrine in legislation the provisions of that Treaty, to which we were glad to be a signatory. I regret the Minister has brought forward further amendments at very short notice as this did not give us enough time to consider their implications.  He, however, had sufficient notice of our amendment to ensure that Article 8 (c) of the Treaty of European Union is implemented as quickly as possible. There is no time like the present in order to ensure that Irish citizens abroad have recourse to consulates and embassies, even though it may not be Irish but a consulate or embassy of a member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had time to look at this amendment <Col N="1694" /> since we last met.  I very much appreciate the points made by the three Deputies.  However, I have to point out that we have to deal with the legislation from an Irish perspective.  We do not need new legislation to be part of the EC consular co-operation.  I will explain this further.  We have the guidelines, to which Deputy Owen refers, for protection of EC nationals by EC missions in third countries and we are actively and centrally involved in the discussions on this matter.</P>
      <P>In order to explain where we are coming from I will make a few points. The section, as it stands makes it clear that the terms, &ldquo;career consular officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;honorary consular officer&rdquo;, have the meaning given to them in the Vienna Convention on consular relations. Section 2 of the Bill states that it applies to certain civil servants and other officers appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, all obviously officers and representatives of this State.  What would it mean, if the amendment were accepted, that career consular officers and honorary consular officers were to be interpreted in accordance with Article 8 (c) of the Treaty on European Union?  The point I am making is that it could be conceivably interpreted as meaning that consular officers of other states in the European Union could have powers under the Act equal to those of Irish officers.  Whereas the intentions of the Members opposite are very honourable, the phraseology used in this amendment could be interpreted as meaning what I just stated.  That is the intention of neither this Bill nor Article 8 (c) of the Treaty.  It is not necessary for officers of other European Union states to have such powers in order to put Article 8 (c) into effect.  Each state applies its own laws and regulations concerning diplomatic and consular protection to all citizens of the European Union to countries outside the union without distinction. Article 8 (c) is about equality of treatment of citizens of the European Union, to whom certain diplomatic and consular services are rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about Irish officials' entitlement <Col N="1695" /> to provide diplomatic and consular services and these two different issues should not be confused.  The services, which are the subject of this Bill are available to people of all nationalities. The possible effect of amending section 1, as proposed, would be to restrict the application of the Act to citizens of the European Union only, and nobody wants that.  That is a point I made when we last discussed this matter.</P>
    <P>I very much appreciate that in proposing this amendment Deputy Owen was mainly concerned with acknowledging in the Bill the fact that European Union is now a reality with a diplomatic and consular dimension.  Much though we sympathise with that, we have found no way &mdash; though I did say that we would look at this in detail &mdash; of putting in a reference to Article 8 (c) to the Treaty on European Unity which would not adversely affect the substance of what is essentially a simple Bill to tidy up outdated legislation from the thirties.  Much as I appreciate what the Deputies are trying to do, it could adversely affect those outside the European Union.  This Bill deals specifically with legislation from the thirties that needs to be updated.  As I mentioned already the guidelines set the extent of the co-operation for the time being and there is no question of being up to date with our partners.</P>
    <P>While I very much appreciate the Deputies' intentions, there is no need for legislation to be a party to the EC consular co-operation.  That is an on-going process.  I will take the Deputies' points on board but we simply cannot incorporate the intent of the amendment in the manner it is presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  The debate has been very useful and I am glad that this amendment has come from Fine Gael.  It highlights the responsibilities we will have under Article 8 (c) of the Treaty.  However, I am prepared to accept in good faith the Minister's explanation that the amendment is not needed in this Bill.  I hope for <Col N="1696" /> his sake that we will not be back in a couple of months having to put through legislation to implement these new regulations.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 1 (a) in the name of the Minister.  I observe that amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and I am suggesting therefore that we discuss amendments Nos. 1 (a), 4 and 5 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 (a):</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 30, after &ldquo;1967&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and &lsquo;mission&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I too am concerned when things are brought to my attention as I come into the Chamber, but it would be irresponsible of us not to table amendments if we spot something.  This amendment covers a minor point which needs to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Section 1 concerns the powers of an officer abroad to exercise his or her functions and the amendment to it is a minor technical one.  Section 5 (2) as it stands indicates that when the person seals the document it would appear that the seal is the person's personal seal whereas officers do not have personal seals but have authority to use the official seal of the mission.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to make it clear that the seal which will be used can be either a personal seal or an official seal.  Because we are changing the personal seal to the official seal we must also adopt amendment No. 1 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are being proposed to bring the legislation up to date.  Official seals are used in missions abroad now <Col N="1697" /> although some personal seals may be still around.  I appreciate that this matter came to our attention just before we entered the Chamber, but I ask for Deputies' co-operation as this amendment is only a minor technical one.</P>

      <P>We should not let the occasion pass without hammering home the point about the slipshod manner in which this amendment was tabled although we do not have any problem with the technical nature of it.  This Bill was circulated on 20 October and we had a good Committee Stage debate on it in the Select Committee.  The Minister of State should bring to the attention of his Minister that we expect better from him. I spent five years in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I do not recall one Bill in that time, so this is a rare bird. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be able to handle the situation a little better.  Members of the Opposition tabled amendments last week and when we started Report Stage the Government had not tabled any amendments. It is not good enough to circulate a badly typed, virtually illegible amendment informing us for the first time that amendments are being tabled by the Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c)  Any officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister to whom sections 3 (other than subsection (2) thereof) and 4 but not sections 5 and 6 of this Act apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> We suggested this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister said he would consider it carefully before Report Stage.  This is a tidying up amendment essentially relating to section 2 which sets out specific persons under paragraphs (a) and (b), but for some reason although it describes another type of person it does not go on to (c).  Our amendment would make the Bill more user-friendly.  The Minister did not have time to consider the amendment at that time although he got advice that the meaning was the same.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies' points perhaps because this is updating 1930s legislation, but since our last discussion I have been advised that even though the inclusion of the Deputy's amendment would give a neater appearance the meaning of the third part of the section would be rendered less clear than it is now.  I am concerned about the legalities. If I accepted the amendment, it would need to be tidied up by the addition of the words &ldquo;to be a person to whom sections 3 (other than subsection (2) thereof) and 4 but not sections 5 and 6 of this Act apply&rdquo; after &ldquo;Any officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  where fees have been collected for a particular service (including applications for registration in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs, or in the Foreign Births Entry Book kept in missions abroad), the restriction on the delivery of such service arising from statutory time limits shall not apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage when there was a lively discussion on the reasoning behind this amendment, namely, that this country stands indicted because it has not yet given Irish passports to thousands of people who applied and are eligible for <Col N="1700" /> such passports under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.  Because of the requirement to make a small amendment to the legislation, which has been outstanding for seven years, those Irish citizens have still not been able to receive their passports.  It is important to highlight also that consuls in America, South Africa and Australia are holding in their bank accounts moneys paid by thousands of people who applied for those passports. That has been the case for seven years and one assumes the Department is receiving interest on the money and probably availing of the use of it.  The bottom line is that those who paid for the right to hold Irish passports have not received them and the next generation is being born to many of those involved. While in New York I met at least two people who fall into this category, one of whom has had a child since applying for the passport.  That person wanted to know the status of the newborn child and whether he or she would be entitled to a passport.  I would like the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister took on board the points made and promised to take up the issue with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice.  I subsequently tabled a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to copper-fasten the commitment given by the Minister on Committee Stage, but again the reply was that the matter was being pursued.  I hope the Minister will tell us today that he has received a commitment from the Minister for Justice that the one or two line amendment to the legislation is being framed and will be submitted to Government for approval before we go begging to the US for visas for those who wish to attend the World Cup next year. I will have an opportunity tomorrow to meet the Under Secretary of State, Mary Ryan, who is here to discuss the availability of visas for Irish citizens going to the World Cup next year.  We will make all sorts of cases for our citizens.  People who normally would not be eligible for such visas will be begging, cajoling and charming the Americans into giving them <Col N="1701" /> visas while this diplomatic courtesy to thousands of Americans has not been fulfilled.  I would remind the Minister that on 23 March 1993, in reply to a parliamentary question the Minister for Justice stated:</P>
    <P>..., it is my view that the situation needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency bearing in mind the case cited by the Deputy and the many other similar cases which have remained unresolved for some years.  It is my intention to submit proposals to the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Government defines the term &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;. On Question Time today the Taoiseach attempted to define the term &ldquo;in a few weeks&rdquo; which we now know is approximately nine months.  Does the term &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; have the same meaning? We are aproaching the ninth month following that commitment by the Minister for Justice.  I look forward to a reply from the Minister of State stating that this disgraceful position will no longer continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In all my time in this House I have not seen such a disgraceful example of bureaucratic inertia.  That, coupled with the lack of political will to resolve this problem, has disgraced us before the nations of the world.  At times one tends to use hyperbole in describing certain situations, but in this case the extent to which we have disgraced ourselves cannot be exaggerated.  A total of 4,000 people have had a moral claim against this country for almost eight years and we have ignored them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people have also a legal claim against us and if they took that case they would succeed.  Approximately 4,000 people lodged applications for Irish citizenship in good faith before the relevant closing date.  That did not take place yesterday, last week, last month or, indeed, last year; it took place in 1986.  They were given a deadline for lodging their applications, namely, midnight on 31 December 1986.  They were assured that provided their applications were in order <Col N="1702" /> and submitted before the deadline, the requisite entry would be made on the Register of Foreign Births.  What happened? The assurance given in good faith that their applications would be dealt with could not be adhered to because the Attorney General advised that 31 December 1986 was not only the closing date for receipt of applications but also the closing date for the completion of registration.  That was a reasonable point made by a reasonable Attorney General, who drew attention to a matter which needed a minor legislative correction. The Government of the day &mdash; not the Fine Gael Government who stipulated the deadline of 31 December 1986 &mdash; gave a commitment that the problem would be resolved but that has not happened and those people have been left high and dry.  It is a matter of honour that the matter should be put right at this stage.  That is why we tabled this amendment and Members from all sides of the House pressed the Minister strongly on this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Owen stated, money has been lodged in consular accounts around the world arising from those applications and is being held under false pretences. It is a disgrace that our name should be dragged into the mud in this fashion and that we have not made the minor legislative correction to resolve the matter. This has all the dimensions of a saga of bureaucratic inertia and, to some degree, a lack of political will.  Other emergencies have arisen where legislation was drafted overnight and passed the following day. I am not saying that should have been done in this case, but surely seven or eight years is stretching the longest day to its uttermost.</P>
    <P>We ventilated the problem in every way possible on Committee Stage and received support from our absent friends in the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  I think the Minister of State supported us also. At the conclusion of Committee Stage there was virtual all party agreement on this issue.  The Minister of State gave us a solemn assurance that he would take <Col N="1703" /> the matter up with the Minister for Justice. I indicated that what I wanted was action, not a letter.  For this reason I ask that we delay Report Stage for a couple of weeks to allow action to be taken and a little more than an acknowledgement by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will show that he can flex his muscles and will announce now that either our amendment will be accepted or, alternatively, that the necessary Bill to resolve the problem will be circulated during this session.  I rest my case.</P>

      <P>I repeat that the point at issue is the timing of the presentation of a Bill by the Minister for Justice to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.  Such new legislation is necessary to enable the registration of the births abroad of about 4,000 people whose applications for citizenship could not be processed by the deadline of 31 December 1986 set in the 1986 Act.  That is the point at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that it would be inappropriate to deal with this matter in the way suggested by the Deputies.  Therefore the problem has to be addressed directly in another nationality and citizenship Bill.  At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 11 November I gave a promise that I would write to the Minister for Justice to express the concern of the committee and to say that I shared its concern at the negative implications for our reputation abroad of the fact that this problem remains unresolved after nearly seven years.  The Minister has informed me that while she had hoped to address these issues in one comprehensive Bill, to avoid further delay she has instructed her officials to prepare a short Bill dealing solely with the applications for registration <Col N="1704" /> outstanding since 1986.  It will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that I was a strong supporter of the committee system and that I would make its views known to the Minister when I wrote to her.  As Deputies may recall, the intention at that time was to deal with the issue in a comprehensive Bill but the position now is that a short Bill to deal with this specific issue will be introduced. The Minister has instructed her officials to prepare this Bill.  I welcome this clear commitment from the Minister for Justice and in the circumstances I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</P>

I am glad we raised this issue and I hope it brings my efforts to an end.  As far back as 1982 or 1983 I received publicity in the <i>Irish Echo</i> and letters from US Congressmen and other people.  I will now be able to write back to them.  This will also save me publishing our own Bill which I have prepared since Committee Stage to provide a stimulus for the Government.  I am glad that the Minister of State, having listened to the debate on Committee Stage, has been able to convince the Minister for Justice that there is a need to make this change.  I will be happy to welcome that amending Bill in the House so that we will have the pleasure of ensuring that all these people will become Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for noting the points raised on Committee Stage. This is democracy in action.  Who would have thought that minor legislation from the Department of Foreign Affairs would have given rise to such a healthy debate and a good result at the end of it?  I welcome the Minister of State's announcement today.</P>

      <P>The Bill as initiated provided that share fishermen who opt into the new scheme would start paying contributions in the income tax year commencing 6 April 1994.  This would enable share fishermen to qualify for unemployment benefit and disability benefit from January 1996.  The amendment I am now proposing will enable share fishermen to start paying the new optional contributions in the current income tax year.  This means that they will be entitled to receive benefits a year sooner, that is, from January 1995 as compared to January 1996 under the Bill as initiated.  This improvement in the proposed new scheme will be welcomed by representatives of the fishing industry with whom I had discussions last week. The issue was also raised by a number of Deputies during the course of the debate on Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Despite the cost implications involved I undertook on Committee Stage to examine the possibility of amending the Bill on Report Stage to deal with this issue.  I am pleased to be able to put forward this amendment to provide share fishermen with the vital cover for unemployment benefit and disability benefit at the earliest possible date.

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with my colleague in welcoming the Minister's amendment. It goes a long way towards responding to our concerns about fishermen not coming into benefit until January 1996, having started to pay these new optional contributions in April 1994.  I had asked the Minister to make a special case and he expressed concern about creating a precedent if he shortened the contribution period before anyone could come into benefit.  I had hoped that those who started paying next April 1994 could come into benefit for unemployment benefit and disability benefit in January 1995. The Minister's handling of the matter will allow the option of making back payments from April 1993 to enable share fishermen to qualify for benefit in January 1995.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister consider my request last week that we treat the share fishermen somewhat differently?  The court judgment decided that they were self-employed or, at the very least, not employees.  They are really in a third category which we are now redefining in this class S social welfare code.  As they do not fit comfortably into the category of self-employed under the tax and social welfare codes as we now know them, I wonder could we make an exception in the case of the 2,500 fishermen involved and allow them to qualify next January. What consideration did the Minister give to that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is beneficial financially and it costs us money.  Bringing it back a further year would mean the State making further financial provision. We have allowed for an extra year which is what the fishermen asked for in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the more general question raised by Deputy Doyle in regard to the fishermen who might want to contribute at the full rate, we are examining the guidelines to see if we can bring forward new guidelines to deal with the question of a contract of service.  If we can find a solution it may be possible for the skipper, who by definition is not the employer, to make contributions at the full rate if he wishes <Col N="1708" /> to do so.  If it is possible, we would be quite happy with that.  It will be dealt with in the guidelines as a matter of urgency.  We were told by Mr. Joey Murren of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation that a considerable number of the skippers, about 50 per cent, who were previously regarded as employers, would be interested in paying the full employers' rate in any event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for looking at this issue.  Would that we could deal with it today, but the Minister has explained that we probably cannot incorporate this extension in this Social Welfare Bill.  Having considered the matter, could the Minister indicate when we may be able to put in place a new definition of &ldquo;optional contributor&rdquo;?  In this Bill an optional contributor is only the same fisherman.  The Minister is suggesting that the concept of an &ldquo;optional contributor&rdquo; could be extended to the skipper. We will be redefining &ldquo;optional contributor&rdquo; in the next year's social welfare Bill.  However, it is important that we signal what time-scale we have in mind so that there is no gap in contributions in the context of skippers who have been and are still paying the A1 rate because they feel that if they do not cover every eventuality they will lose good men and women &mdash; I am sure there are a few share fisherwomen around the country too. Can we legally keep skippers who are at the moment contributing the full A1 rate in the system from availing of full benefits? Can the Minister assure us that such share fishermen will be covered for the full benefits equivalent to the A1 rate, because there is some question that in the aftermath of the Griffith judgement, as January 1994 approaches, the 1993-94 contribution year will not be covered at the full class A1 rate even if contributions are made at that rate?  Even though we cannot incorporate it in the Bill, if it is on the record, stated by the Minister, it will assure skippers that they are in order in continuing to pay at the class A1 rate. Perhaps a contract of service is necessary to technically indicate that the fisherman is tied to the skipper and the boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position in regard to those paying at the A1 rate in the run up to January 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that anyone paying the class A1 contribution is covered for the A1 benefits and we have no intention to altering that.  It depends very much on the contract of service.  Following the passage of this Bill we will look at the guidelines for the contract of service to see if more people can come within those guidelines.  On preliminary examination it looks as if that could be done in the case of those who want to opt in.  That will be completed in time for the main Bill when we can look at the issue again.  If there is any default on that side we will consider what can be done in the main Social Welfare Bill. That should meet the Deputies' concerns.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in acknowledging the contribution which the Minister has made by bringing in this amendment.  The Minister undertook on Committee Stage last week to contact the people involved.  Although he was generous in his praise of the Deputies who raised this matter on behalf of the fishermen, there is a gap in communications to fishermen.  Deputies can get information to organisations like the IFO.  However, there are other fishermen who are not in the IFO and who will not have access to this information.  I ask the Minister, because of this important amendment, to ensure that his Department gives this information directly to fishermen through the regional offices which are in a position to contact share fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good and relevant point in these circumstances because things have been so complicated.  We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. However, I would like to give an assurance in the House that we will prepare comprehensive information and take special care to make sure that people in the areas that matter understand the <Col N="1710" /> benefits of this amendment.  That point was also made on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a case for those who have paid A1 contributions or on whose behalf such contributions have been paid.  My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, passed me a letter from a crewman in Castletownbere.  There has been great confusion about handling the payment of contributions.  Even where skippers wanted to continue paying the class A1 rate, in certain areas along the coast the Department of Social Welfare refused to accept it.  The Minister must clarify the position in this regard.  The crewman's letter reads:</P>
      <P>Quite a few trawlers have always paid A1 contibutions until quite recently and only stopped doing so as in our case because the Department of Social Welfare refused to accept our contributions.  I know that trawlers here in Castletownbere still pay A1 contibutions for their crews (I asked crewmen and it was deducted from their last pay cheque).  How is that the case.</P>
      <P>In some cases the Department of Social Welfare has refused to accept A1 contributions and in other cases skippers have continued to pay A1 contributions. The letter continued:</P>
      <P>I have appealed the Department of Social Welfare's decision 11/10/93 and am waiting to be called to an appeals board.  Therefore why was I not left on A1 contributions until this matter was resolved, unless of course the Department has already decided against me before my appeal is heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Bill should not concern fishing vessels who are already or were willing to start paying A1 contributions. It should not be needed at <Col N="1711" /> all as crewmen are not or cannot be self-employed.</P>
    <P>That is another point the crewman was making.  Total confusion exists in relation to the treatment of crewmen and the social welfare code.  In the Bill the Minister rationalises much of the confusion, but I fear that skippers who have been paying the class A1 rate may use this Bill to avoid continuing to pay it &mdash; and legally they might be correct in doing so.  I want the Minister to give me an assurance that those who wish to continue to pay the class A1 rate may do so next year until the Minister advises us as to his considerations on whether a contract of service will resolve the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should tell the crewman not to rush his appeal.  The matter may be resolved before his appeal is heard.  The scope section of the Department determines such appeals.  When dealing with cases it asseses if a case involves a contract of service.  It follows the current guidelines and decisions that have been handed down.  We are providing one scheme but in the operation of that scheme, it may emerge that skippers will have to pay the employer's contribution to satisfy their employees.  The question then arose, could we accommodate those people?  There are two ways to do this.  We can consider the guidelines which would issue to the scope section.</P>
      <P>There are complications in regard to how the scheme operates.  The matter could be dealt with by a simple approach but if that does not work, the timescale approach may be adopted.  However, if that is not workable, the matter can be addressed in next year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> In page 5, lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;disability benefit or unemployment benefit&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;disability benefit, unemployment benefit or treatment benefit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as initiated, provided that share fishermen who opt for the new scheme will be covered for disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  Disability benefit will be payable for up to 12 months in any continuous period of incapacity; unemployment benefit will be payable for up to 13 weeks in each calendar year.</P>
    <P>I have been most anxious to provide share fishermen with access to the treatment benefits scheme and I told representatives of the fishing industry that I was examining the possibility of extending the benefits of the new scheme to include treatment benefits.  I am pleased to bring forward amendment No. 2 to do this.  This is a very important scheme because the benefits are also available to dependent spouses.  Following on the resolution last year of the dispute with the Irish Dental Association, the number of spouses receiving benefit has almost doubled.  In the period January to October this year, more than 42,000 women working in the home have qualified for treatment benefit.</P>
    <P>The provision of treatment benefits to dependent spouses is vitally important. Over 160,000 dependent spouses have availed of treatment benefits since I extended the scheme in 1987.  The scheme now covers more than 1.3 million people.  Deputies will recognise the value of this scheme and the Minister for Finance accepted the value and importance of this scheme and supports my proposed amendment.  This is an important amendment to the scheme which, I am sure, will be welcomed by Deputies on all sides.</P>

      <P>It is nice when a Minister listens to requests from Members.  I note from the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of the proceedings on Committee Stage last week that my colleagues, Deputies Doyle and Ahern were loud in their demands for the inclusion of treatment benefit under the Bill.  As Deputies said last week, everyone pays <Col N="1713" /> lip service to the importance of the women working in the home and the exclusion of treatment benefit for spouses working in the home would have been a major defect in the Bill.  Obviously the Minister listened to the points made last week.  We welcome the inclusion of the treatment benefits in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his amendment.  It is obvious we were pushing an open door in terms of our concerns in this area and his response is welcome.  We should also thank the Minister for Finance for accepting a case that could stand alone.  As I said last week, the spouses of insured workers, usually wives, have been a forgotten sector for too long in terms of insurance cover under the social welfare code.  I welcome the extension not only in this area but generally, and the recognition of the sacrifice most mothers and wives, but particularly mothers, have made to ensure that their husbands and children have always had the dental and optical care the family could afford.  Usually the mother went without necessary optical and dental care if the money was not there.  The dental records of middle aged women who have had children testify to the neglect of their teeth &mdash; and I presume the same is due of their eyesight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is testimony to the unselfishness and generosity of Irish women and the wish of all of us to ensure that our children are given first preference.  We will sacrifice almost anything to give our children a good start in life.  Whether in terms of health, education or whatever, the Irish family puts the child first.  It is nice to be able to say to spouses, who in this case are in the main women, that they are not forgotten, that we recognise their contribution to ensuring that their husbands are in a position to provide for <Col N="1714" /> them and their families and that we are extending the treatment benefits to them.</P>
    <P>This is a very worthwhile provision.  It should go without saying that any worker's insurance should cover the spouse in terms of treatment benefits, particularly the spouse who perhaps gives up his or her career and stays at home to do the most important job of rearing the next generation, those who will take over the reins when we have passed through the system.  I thank the Minister for acceding to our request that treatment benefits be extended to spouses.  I know it is a matter close to his heart.  On Second Stage and Committee Stage the Minister indicated his support in this regard and he has followed through with this welcome amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  For the purposes of this section, the Minister shall, by regulation, provide for a method of assessing the reckonable income of each optional contributor.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a resubmitted amendment from Committee Stage.  I expressed concern last week, particularly about share fishermen and crewmen who have found themselves outside the tax and social welfare code since 1986 and particularly since the Griffith judgment of February 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of extending to share fishermen treatment benefits and unemployment and disability benefit, as that depends on the payment of an extra 5 per cent PRSI based on the previous year's income, the difficulty will be immediately apparent for those who are outside the system and have no certified income for the previous year.  Given the Government's support for the amnesty concept, I ask the Minister, in this genuine case where there is no certified income, to <Col N="1715" /> allow for the first year of operation of this scheme an assessed or reckonable income on which the extra 5 per cent will be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably recall my concerns expressed last week about this matter.  He indicated that the Department of Social Welfare would accept assessed or reckoned income of the individual share fishermen.  He can speak only in terms of social welfare.  I ask the Minister to provide for uniform application of reckonable income for those outside the tax code to ensure we get people into the system, particularly those who want to pay contributions but are afraid to get into the system as they have had no income for the last year or two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complicated matter.  The fact that these people were deemed to be outside the PAYE system did not mean they were outside the tax code &mdash; they were in the self-employed code.  Because of the confusion that exists, some people may have difficulty in establishing the position during that period.  On the one hand they would have thought the skipper was keeping the records, but they find that these records are no longer relevant to them.  We will certainly be as helpful as possible in resolving the difficulties faced by these people.  In most cases they will not be outside the tax code although they are outside the PAYE system.  In theory they should go straight into the other system but in practice there could be a hiatus and I will specifically consider that matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that optional contributions will be payable by share fishermen on the same income base as that on which self-employment contributions are payable.  The income base on which contributions are payable is an essential element of the scheme and should be provided for in the Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill inserts a new Chapter 4A into the Consolidation Act. Section 24B (1) of the new Chapter provides that people who opt into the scheme will be liable for a contribution of 5 per cent of their reckonable income in the <Col N="1716" /> preceding tax year.  Reckonable income is defined in section 2 (1) of the Consolidation Act.  Section 3 of the Bill extends this definition of reckonable income to include optional contributors. Reckonable income is estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  It covers income to which schedule D tax applies.  Therefore the income base on which the new optional contributions will be payable will be the same as that on which self-employment contributions are payable. This means that it will be relatively easy to establish the income of the share fishermen and therefore the scheme will operate efficiently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  There may be some instances in which the information will not be available, but I assured Deputy Doyle during Committee Stage that my Department will adopt a flexible approach in these circumstances.  Where it is not possible to verify the person's income at the time at which contributions are payable we will work on a self-assessment basis.  Share fishermen are required to make a return of income to the Revenue Commissioners.  The details of income provided by share fishermen can be verified after the event as the information works its way through the system. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.  I believe we will be able to deal in practice with the real issue raised by Deputy Doyle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have concerns about the Minister's response which indicates how the officials will implement the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill when enacted. Having had a brief sojourn on the other side as a Minister of State I know enough about how the system works to appreciate that what the Minister came in armed with as distinct from what he added is the thinking of the officials in his Department on this issue.  That concerns me because it leaves no room for assessed income where a fisherman is not inside the tax code as self-employed.  That is where the Minister and I would have difficulties. The spirit of what he said meets some of my concerns but the letter of the official brief which the Minister put on the record greatly concerns me.</P>
      <P>We need a guarantee that share fishermen, like other self-employed persons, will be able to operate on the basis of self-assessment for the last year or two and that they will be able to pay the extra 5 per cent provided for in the Bill, thus qualifying them to be included in the new system and to be eligible for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and the treatment benefits proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be major difficulties in getting the system up and running if we do not allow for self-assessment by those fishermen who are not up-to-date in terms of their tax contributions.  I accept that the Minister can only do so much in this regard &mdash; there is a certain line beyond which he cannot go as a member of the Cabinet &mdash; but I need an assurance from him in regard to the large numbers of fishermen who are now outside the tax and social welfare codes through no fault of their own, but because of the confusion which has existed since the 1986 judgment in the McLoughlin case and the 1992 judgment in the Griffiths case.  Some skippers have been paying the A1 rate for their crews, some fishermen have been let pay what they want and other fishermen are in and out of work and do not know what their income is.  Will they be able to get into the optional contribution scheme on the basis of self-assessed income for last year and the year before?  If these <Col N="1718" /> fishermen want to backdate their contributions to allow them to receive benefit in January 1995 two years' income will have to be taken into account and if they want to receive benefit in January 1996 this year's self-assessment income will have to be taken into account.  I ask the Minister for assurances in this regard.</P>

The point I am making is that where these problems arise we will work on a self-assessment basis.  However, it must be remembered that a share fisherman has to be earning £2,500 net per year to be included in the system.  I know that point is appreciated.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Where any optional contributor has paid A1 rate contributions he shall be entitled, subject to eligibility, to all class A1 benefits.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt with the subject matter of this amendment in the debate on the previous <Col N="1720" /> amendments.  This amendment proposes that any optional contributor who has paid A1 rate contributions should be entitled, subject to eligibility, to all class A1 benefits.  This amendment may preempt what I hope the Minister will do in next year's social welfare Bill, that is, extend the concept of optional contributor to include skippers and or boat owners; in other words, the payer as distinct from the payee.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that those fishermen who establish a contract of service should have their class A1 contributions paid by their skipper and be fully entitled to class A1 benefits.  There should be no break in terms of the contributions paid and the benefits which will accrue to these fishermen, particularly those who up to now have been paying A1 rate contributions, until the matter is resolved by the Minister in next year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies Doyle and Allen to ensure that all employment contributions paid by share fishermen who were previously insured as employees are honoured.  I repeat my assurance that any benefits to which share fishermen are entitled on the basis of their class A contributions will be paid.  The amendment proposed by the Deputies is not necessary as social insurance benefits are paid in accordance with the provisions of the Act and people who have paid contributions are entitled to the benefits covered by these contributions. That is the legal position. There is no question of my Department not honouring the contributions paid as to do so would be contrary to the provisions of the Act.  If the Deputy has any doubts about this, I would remind her that share fishermen have been receiving benefits since February 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My priority is to ensure that share fishermen have cover <Col N="1721" /> for unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  I am trying to be as helpful as possible within the constraints arising from the High Court decision.  That is why I brought forward the Bill in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The legislation already provides that people who have paid class A contributions are entitled to the benefits covered by such contributions.  In the circumstances, the amendment is not necessary. The Deputy has more or less said that herself &mdash; we discussed how we will proceed in this regard.  I reiterate my assurance that those contributions will be honoured.</P>

I am not asking for extra unemployment benefit to be paid in any one year; rather, I am asking that there be a roll-over system whereby benefit can be carried over to the following year in any three-year period.

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill forward.  Lest he tries to make the point that it was an instant response to the problem, I have to say that the problem has existed for some time, particularly since February 1992 and the Griffiths judgment.  The Minister has taken a personal interest in this matter; he was Minister for Social Welfare, then Minister for the Marine and Minister for Social Welfare again and, therefore, of all Cabinet members, he is best qulified to view the problem that has been experienced in terms of insurance cover and share fishermen from both the fishermen's and a social welfare point of view.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a good one.  There are some parts that have to be tidied up, as we indicated through our amendments. Indeed, the Minister has gone further down the road than he indicated on Second Stage and he has responded to the concerns of our fishermen.  I thank him in particular for meeting the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the Kilmore Quay and Wexford Fishermen's Organisations and listening to their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> When the Minister is responding will he indicate how we can resolve the difficulties that will arise for share fishermen when their 13 weeks unemployment benefit period expires and they sign on for unemployment assistance as envisaged under the Bill?  There has been a major difficulty with even fairly moderately salaried self-employed people in establishing eligibility for unemployment assistance.  Unemployment assistance for the self-employed is based on the previous year's certified earnings.</P>
    <P>A total of 2,500 of our share fishermen, and their families, are earning between £2,500 and £8,000 per annum.  The average income would work out at approximately £6,000 per annum.  There is no way that a fisherman can provide for rainy days for the following year on an annual income of £6,000 when he is trying to sign on the dole.  Self employed people have met with the greatest of resistance in trying to establish their eligibility for unemployment assistance.  Share fishermen now find themselves defined as self employed against their will, as far as they are concerned they are still employees of the skipper and-or boat owner.  The judge in the Griffiths case thought otherwise but fishermen feel they were not properly represented at that hearing.  They feel that the IFO could not represent two masters and that it gave the skipper's viewpoint rather than that of the deckhands.  They believe there was a conflict of interest and that the ordinary share fishermen lost out in that respect. They feel hard done by and will not accept that they are self-employed although technically, within the tax and social welfare codes, as this Bill testifies, they are now considered to be self-employed.</P>
    <P>We are talking about 2,500 men, who consider themselves to be employees of the skipper or boat owner.  They have no say in when they go to sea, how many days they spend at sea, what type of job they carry out on the boat or the amount of money they can command.  All they have to sell is their labour and there is no other category defined as self-employed that has such little control over the job <Col N="1725" /> they do or their employment conditions. I put it to the Minister that any other self-employed group would resist strongly having such little say in their terms of employment generally.  Technically these people are self-employed but they do not and never considered themselves to be so.  Given that their outlook is that of an employee and that they are paid totally at the discretion of the skipper, could the Minister in responding to Fifth Stage indicate how he will extend eligibility for unemployment assistance to share fishermen when their 13 weeks unemployment benefit period expires? This year alone many fishermen have had their boats tied up for more than 26 weeks.  We need to know from the Minister how these fishermen can establish their entitlement to unemployment assistance because it is a most important issue.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy, which will govern the activities of the share fishermen we are debating in this Bill proposes a compulsory tie up period to preserve stocks generally.  Will the Minister give an assurance when responding that the 13 weeks unemployment benefit provided for in this Bill will not be used up by a compulsory period during which Europe has dictated that the boats cannot fish?  If there is an agreement under the Common Fisheries Policy for compulsory tie up there must be compensation for our fishermen and, at the very least, Europe should carry the cost of extending unemployment benefit for that compulsory period in addition to the 13 weeks that we are providing for in this Bill.  We need the Minister's guarantee in regard to this most important issue.</P>
    <P>The same would apply if a decommissioning policy was introduced through the Common Fisheries Policy. Decommissioning grants and enticements to reduce the tonnage on our waters generally operate in other countries; we have not had any policy worth talking about here in this area.  If decommissioning grants are forced on us by Europe and if skippers are required to take their boats out of the water and avail of the grants, their employees, as they <Col N="1726" /> consider themselves to be, will be forced onto the live register and very quickly their 13 weeks unemployment benefit will be used up.  If there is a European-piloted decommissioning programme, our share fishermen must be protected and compensated for the effects of that.  It should not be put over to the Irish authorities or the Irish Insurance Fund to carry the men.  Any time their boats are tied up, are decommissioned or out of the water under the terms of any European policy it must be over and above the 13 weeks provided for in the provisions of this Bill and funded by the Exchequer.  Therefore, the compulsory tying up to preserve stocks, and compulsory decommissioning &mdash; both of which could be around the corner and are mooted &mdash; mean that the 13 weeks unemployment benefit must be over and above anything required of the men in that regard.  I feel very strongly about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to my amendment on the concept of the family income supplement being extended to these fishermen, who consider themselves to be employees, will the Minister say if next spring we could extend that benefit to a group who, to all intents and purposes are employees but who for some technical reason a judge has held are self-employed for the purposes of the social welfare code?  Can the family income supplement be extended to them?</P>
    <P>Occupational injuries benefits are not extended under the provisions of this Bill, even under the optional scheme. The Minister did go some of the road with us on the treatment benefits.  I welcome the Minister's extension of his original intention in that regard.  Could we trespass on the Minister's generosity or, should I say, the Minister for Finance, once more given the high risk in terms of injuries inherent in fishing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, perhaps, we can trespass on the Minister's generosity rather than that of the Minister for Finance and ask him to extend cover <Col N="1727" /> for occupational injuries benefits to share fishermen in this Bill, or, at the very least, indicate that he will do so when introducing the next social welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate the benefit of the Minister's thinking in response to my request, one we in Fine Gael make, understanding the dilemma in which fishermen have found themselves since 1986.  The Minister's views on that might alleviate some of the concerns still obtaining among the fishing community about how the provisions of this Bill, welcome as they perceive them to be, will operate in practice.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister also re-examine the United Kingdom system?  I know they have a much larger insurance fund, many more contributors, given the size of their population and numbers employed there. If the United Kingdom system of a £7.50 contribution per week, allowing full A1 cover, could be introduced here all the problems of our share fishermen would be resolved.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for what constitutes a major step forward but he should clarify the points I raised.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister, and his officials, on the work they have undertaken in this Bill and indeed the committee ethos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way to ensure that share fishermen receive as many benefits as possible under the provisions of this Bill.  I should like to thank him for meeting the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, other organisations, and on having listened to their concerns.  I realise that the Minister is restrained in many ways from a financial point of view.  However, I should like to reiterate the concerns expressed about occupational injuries benefits since fishermen are subject to specific risks, including those causing serious injuries. Perhaps the Minister will consider before <Col N="1728" /> the next social welfare Bill introducing occupational injuries benefits for them and address some of the other concerns brought to his attention in relation to those skippers or employers, as they are usually termed, who would have preferred the continuation of the old employer/employee system.  An optional system could be examined for those who would like to contribute on behalf of share fishermen.</P>
    <P>I would have concerns also with regard to eligibility for unemployment assistance in the coming year and I predict it will cause some problems.  Perhaps we could be afforded an opportunity to address that problem which is not peculiar to share fishermen.  We should be given an opportunity to discuss that matter in the interval between now and the introduction of the next social welfare Bill.  I welcome the Minister's move to allow eligibility in 1995 which will go a long way to allay the fears about when one becomes eligible under the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>I look forward also to further deliberations in to PRSI contributions on behalf of those employed in the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>The work undertaken in the preparation of this Bill is much appreciated by me, by many organisations and share fishermen, about whom I can speak only of those in County Donegal.  In the interval before the introduction of next year's Bill it would be my hope that we would have an opportunity of making a further submission to the Minister and his Department so that other fears could be addressed.  I must stress that the work undertaken here in the past week or two has addressed many of the problems pertaining to the outcome of court cases.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having listened to us and hope he will give us an opportunity of further discussion on the next social welfare Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their welcome for this Bill and for the amount of work undertaken on its provisions since its introduction.  It has been a particularly <Col N="1729" /> ularly good, relevant debate, dealing principally with people, examining their needs, ascertaining how our systems can meet their needs and how the provisions of the Bill can meet their needs rather than saying if people do not avail of it, that is tough luck.  In that sense the fishermen have had good spokespersons on both sides of the House who have put their case very strongly and understood it very well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle asked me to reply to a number of points.  First, I should stress that we set out to provide a special scheme for share fishermen.  The initial proposal covered unemployment and disability benefit.  The date on which it will come into operation has been advanced by a year, that is 1 January 1995, and has been extended to include treatment benefits.  In that sense it is quite a good package.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle also raised the question of eligibility for unemployment benefit. She raised first the matter of the EU common fisheries policy.  I should inform the House that the relevant EU regulations will be reviewed as and from 1 January next.  The Department of the Marine has circulated a discussion document to the fishing industry on these regulations which provide for the payment of a final cessation premium to skippers whose boats are decommissioned permanently.  There are no arrangements for payments to fishermen while their boats are temporarily decommissioned or laid up.  I will re-examine this matter when the review of EU arrangements has been completed.  In the meantime, following on this debate, I will convey immediately to my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Members' views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also raised the question of the United Kingdom arrangements. What has to be understood here is that self-employed benefits are wider in the United Kingdom where the special scheme provides unemployment benefit only, there being no need to provide anything else.  I mention this not to disagree with the Deputy but to explain what has happened in those circumstances in the <Col N="1730" /> United Kingdom.  The balance is carried on the self employed generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work. The other question the Deputy raised related to unemployment assistance generally.  In most cases the income from the previous year is known and, therefore, it would not be so difficult to work out the unemployment assistance.  It is easier than previously.  I am sensitive to that situation and I accept what Deputies said on Committee Stage as well as on Report and Final Stages.  We will look at its operation and see how it can be improved.</P>
      <P>Returning to the Bill in general we have provided vital cover in the event of unemployment and illness and also in the event of dental and optical requirements for people engaged in share fishing.</P>
      <P>We have also provided tough new regulatory powers to tackle abuse of PRSI and social welfare in certain sectors, including the building and construction industry.  I can assure Deputies that we intend to use those powers at the commencement of the New Year because there will be a huge investment in new contracts under the National Plan with the EU moneys becoming available.  We want to ensure that those unemployed are given an opportunity to participate and that the scope for fraud and abuse is further reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also in this Bill enhanced entitlement to disability and unemployment benefits for volunteer development workers on their return from <Col N="1731" /> abroad.  That is something which was universally welcomed in the House.  I thank Deputies for their support of this measure.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill consolidates the rights of members of the country's 31,000 occupational pension schemes in relation to selecting trustees to represent their views.  That is urgent.  It clarifies the position about which there were question marks at worst.  We have put the matter right.  I did what I promised to do.  I published the regulations in July and gave everybody an opportunity to examine them and to see how they would be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I thank Members of the House and particularly the Opposition for facilitating me in dealing in a flexible and speedy way with this situation.  It is a good example of how the House can be flexible while at the same time dealing with the matters effectively.  I do not want to rush anything; I hope to be here for a good while yet.  It is particularly important, notwithstanding the new arrangements we make, that as a House we are still capable of being flexible and effective. When that happens it is much easier from the Minister's point of view to deal with what should be the exceptional circumstances which arise from time to time.  I know that is the spirit in which the Deputies raised the matters before us and I thank them.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important development which safeguards a particularly vulnerable group of workers and ensures that they have access to social welfare.  I thank all Members and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the family income supplement is that it applies to people on the full rate.  It does not apply to the self-employed.  Any of the share fishermen who have A1 contributions will be able to avail of the family income supplement.  Skippers, <Col N="1732" /> who regard themselves as employers, are paying the full stamp.  The guidelines which we are proposing to prepare will deal with that issue for other cases where skippers wish to avail of the scheme. Beyond that we are into the wider issue of the self-employed generally.  That is a matter for debate but is one that would have to be considered in the context of the budget and the main Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 17, to delete &ldquo;general&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 is to limit somewhat the general regulatory powers contained in section 3. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 will remove the reference to regulations being made for the general or for any particular purpose of the Act.  Amendment No. 4 removes the power for regulations to provide for the giving of directions and amendment No. 5 limits to three years the powers in subsection (7) to make regulations for the removal of difficulties &mdash; that is to meet misgivings expressed on Committee Stage.  The views of both sides as to the regulatory powers have been fully aired on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.  The amendments go some way towards meeting the concerns expressed.  There has been a very full debate on this issue and the need for regulatory powers has to be accepted. The section, as it is proposed to be amended, will meet these needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my disappointment that the Minister is not present to deal with the Report Stage of this important Bill.  That is not a reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, for whom I have the highest regard, but, in fairness, the Minister took this Bill on Committee Stage when we had two very long days debate.  A great deal of the business we will be discussing now by way of amendment arises directly from that debate.  While I have no doubt that the Minister of State is adequately briefed on what occurred on Committee Stage, it will be very difficult for him to have the same grasp and feeling for the debate and the views of members and to be in a position to respond to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendments watered down some of the provisions for the making of regulations under the Bill but they still leave the Minister for the Environment with very wide powers.  In particular, I would like to hear the Minister's response to amendment No. 5.  This puts a time limit of three years on the period within which regulations can be made after the establishment day.  The issue I wish to raise, which got a considerable airing on Committee Stage, relates to the transfer of houses, buildings and land from Dublin Corporation in the main to what is to be known as South Dublin County Council.  Dublin Corporation built houses on land it owns in the former county council area; it still owns land in the county council area.  Section 35 and the Third Schedule provide for the transfer of those lands and dwellings to Dublin County Council.  As I understand it, it provides an arrangement whereby a transfer scheme has to be prepared within a year of this Bill coming into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me about amendment No. 5 is the three year time limit on the making of regulations.  In setting down a three year time limit, the Minister was probably responding to the concerns expressed in the House that regulations could be made at some time in the future and that there was a wish that this be fenced off.  At the same time, I see this being in conflict with the Third Schedule <Col N="1734" /> which provides for the making of the transfer scheme within a year.  Is it proposed that the transfer of buildings and lands to the county council will now take up to three years or longer if the Minister makes regulations which provide for an even longer period of transfer?  I am worried about that and I wonder if this was anticipated when preparing the amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendments the Minister is bringing forward today improve the generality and the broad nature of this section.  I accept that, in terms of detail, implementation dates and technical levels of operation, proceeding by way of secondary legislation through orders and regulations, such as are before us in this section are necessary. I have rarely come across legislation that has such broad power of regulation vested in the Minister to do effectively whatever he likes, whenever he likes, however he likes to be sure that any difficulty that arises now or in the future is ironed out.  Should any issue manifest itself as needing attention through the operation of this Bill, by way of regulation or order the Minister can proceed without any reference to either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments before us row back from the original proposals in section 3. My biggest difficulty with this section, and with these types of proposals &mdash; I have said this before but I am making little progess in terms of having action taken on the matters I referred to, so I <Col N="1735" /> will repeat it &mdash; relates to the resolution to annul a provision before this House. Effectively, we cannot get Government time to debate an annulling resolution.  I would ask the Minister to look at this point.</P>
    <P>I felt if we could have a real debate on any regulation laid before either House of the Oireachtas, particularly the few where concerns arise in certain sectors, and could have an input to the final decision we would accept the concept of secondary legislation far more comfortably. Last year I understand that over 200 statutory instruments were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, of which one was challenged.  I tabled an annulment resolution in relation to access to freedom of environmental information regulations but the Government would not provide Government time to debate the concerns of the Opposition on that issue.  The best we could negotiate through our respective Whips was statements on access to environmental information regulation in this House on a Friday morning but the Government would not tolerate a vote.</P>
    <P>I find it strange that the Government will not tolerate a vote on these issues particularly with its 35 seat majority. What is it afraid of?  It cannot be afraid it will not get its own way.  However by so doing it would at least give some semblance of democracy to an issue that may cause concern.  Last year one out of 200 regulations caused concern to the Opposition.  Immediately the defence would be that to debate every regulation in Government time we would be here seven days a week for the next three years.  However, if the ratio of the regulations that cause concern is 1:200, I think the Government has little to fear.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could undertake to pursue our concerns and accept the principle of having annulment resolutions debated in Government time, we would be more comfortable in extending even general powers of legislation by regulation to the Government.  The principle is accepted that all the minutiae or logistical problems cannot be debated but the <Col N="1736" /> converse is also true; when there are genuine concerns we must have access to full debate in Government time.  That is the assurance I require from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will not be opposing this group of amendments because they tighten up the section.  It is, however, a general section and the procedure for dealing with annulling resolutions in relation to regulations laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas are still far from satisfactory. My concerns have not been taken care of.  I am not happy with the section but I accept that the Minister's amendments tighten it up somewhat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit reluctant to make my point in the absence of the Minister whom I understand is unavoidably abroad and it is unfair to ask the Minister of State to respond to it, but it is important that it be put on the record. If the Minister is here tomorrow, before the Bill is passed, I would like him to deal with it.  The point relates to the fact that inevitably the reorganisation concerned will cost a not insignificant amount of money.  The Minister has agreed in private discussions that a very good job has been done in giving effect to the extensive preparatory work that has been necessary in order to permit the three new councils to be incorporated as and from 1 January, if that is the agreed date when the Bill is finally passed.  All that preparatory work has a cost associated with it.  In the explanatory memorandum the Minister acknowledges the cost associated with it.  It states:</P>
      <P>There will be some initial cost for the three new county councils in the start-up phase but this should be marginal in the context of overall expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the cost is marginal in the context of overall expenditure if one takes the budgets of the three combined councils and the old Dublin County Council, but it is not an insignificant amount of money.  Before the Bill is passed, will the Minister indicate to the House whether he intends that this exceptional cost will be discharged? <Col N="1737" /> When the previous Bill was put through the House if we had said that the complex business of setting up three new local authorities would have proceeded with such speed and so few hiccups, people would not have believed us.  An exceptional job has been done in terms of trade union negotiations, staff being located etc.  A professional expert job has been done and the Minister has acknowledged this.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted and I anticipate it will, the three new councils will be ready to go, in effect they are up and running since many of the functions have already been devolved.  I would like to know if that will be possible, and if not, would the Minister of State assure us that the Minister will deal with this point tomorrow because, at a time when resources are so scarce, it is a matter of considerable concern to the existing council and to the new councils that they should be reimbursed for the necessary reasonable expenditure in bringing the process so far.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 5 the Minister proposes to insert &ldquo;but no regulations shall be made under this subsection after the expiration of 3 years after the establishment day&rdquo;.  If we look at section 35 of the Bill and the Third Schedule, which is a major issue as far as the new councils are concerned, these sections deal with the provisions for the transfer of dwellings and lands to the local authorities for the area.  Over the years Dublin Corporation assembled a significant land bank in the county and built a very large number of dwellings in the county, almost 8,000 of which are still tenant dwellings and the remainder would be tenant purchased dwellings.  At this stage, in excess of 750,000 dwellings are still rented to tenants of Dublin Corporation which is the housing authority and therefore different from the administrative authority which is the county council.  This has led to inordinate problems in the county over the last number of years.  In the Bill it is prescribed that this will be dealt with within a period of one year.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment gives cause <Col N="1738" /> for concern here of the transfer of dwellings and lands proves to be more difficult than this legislation anticipates.  Dublin Corporation did many things right.  Given the housing situation during the sixties, it was a considerable achievement that it managed to construct so many dwellings and housed so many people who were in desperate need of housing; it tackled the housing crisis which dated from the days of the old Dublin Housing Action Committee.</P>
    <P>Due credit should be given for that, but the negative side of the legacy the new councils inherit is that, inevitably there has been a lack of accountability by Dublin Corporation to the people in those new areas through their elected representatives, in other words through representatives from each of the parties elected to a local authority that is not the housing authority.  Members from every party elected to Dublin County Council are not members of the City Council which is the housing authority.</P>
    <P>The bulk of local authority housing in my constituency in most of west Dublin which is most acutely affected and in areas represented by Deputies Owen and Gilmore, where there is a problem but not to the same extent, is affected by that phenomenon and I am afraid the track record is not good.  There are terrible problems arising from the absence of estates management and any kind of hands-on management by Dublin Corporation. It has been proved that the corporation is incapable of responding to the needs of tenants in the county areas for varying reasons.  It is understandable that officials of Dublin Corporation would be more responsive to certain issues, such as the renovation of the Ballymun flats or the maintenance problems in Darndale or Finglas, which can be raised in its chamber.</P>
    <P>Nevetheless, the cumulative effect of this neglect has been felt in large housing estates in west Dublin.  For example, in one area of my constituency of west Tallaght there are approximately 4,000 public sector housing units.  The response of Dublin Corporation over the past number of years when it comes to carrying <Col N="1739" /> out maintenance work on these houses leaves a great deal to be desired. There does not appear to have been any coherant tenanting policy and many people believe that areas in the county have been used as dumping grounds for tenants who were causing trouble in the city.  Corporation officials, under siege from elected members in the city, housed these tenants in constituencies in west Dublin causing mayhem for the families in the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provisions in the legislation that give effect to the transfer of those dwellings to the local authorities in that area, but how quickly will that be done and what is the import of amendment No. 5 in that regard?  The legislation states that it will be done within one year but what will happen where the manager of the principal authority draws up a schedule which is ultimately put to the Minister and there is foot-dragging at City Hall?  In fairness, without this legislation there would be no movement on the part of City Hall.  City Hall is happy with the inherited position where people on its housing list can be located in the country.  We must bear in mind that those houses were built from capital funds, and the same can be said of the land banks. Therefore, the proprietorial approach adopted by City Hall is out of order.  The fact that we have taken the Bill early means we are deprived of the input of the Dublin city councillors but, hopefully, we will have their input during the debate.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reassure us that amendment No. 5 will not have any implications for the speedy transfer of properties and dwellings to the new local authorities being constituted under this legislation.  The fact that there will be three new county councils in the area of county Dublin is neither here nor there as far as many of the people to whom I refer are concerned.  However, they are concerned that the housing authority for their area will be the local authority and that, through their elected representatives, they can make that authority accountable for the problems in their estates.  Such problems may arise <Col N="1740" /> from the carelessness of tenanting policies where families with a bad track record in other parts of the city &mdash; such as drug related problems &mdash; are housed in the county area giving rise to many social problems.</P>
    <P>Response maintenance must be dealt with effectively; that has not been the case up to now.  The general upkeep and maintenance of estates must be tackled by the new local authorities.  Those are the bread and butter issues about which the citizens in those local authority estates are concerned, and not the abstract concept of local democracy, that the new councils will be more relevant to their needs, less remote and so on.  That may be true, but that is not their primary concern.  They want to be able to complain and get a response when their back door is warped, when water is seeping into their homes, when a tap is leaking and water is coming through a ceiling, a window is broken by a passing stone thrower, etc.  The tenants want those matters dealt with immediately, and not as they have not been up to now.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the legislation from the point of view of councillors in all parties represented on Dublin County Council.  Will the Minister assure us that, in the event of the provision for the transfer of those dwellings and properties not functioning as smoothly as he anticipates, he will take the necessary action to ensure there is no foot dragging on the part of City Hall to delay this sensible transfer of responsibility and vesting of ownership of properties in the local authority for the area concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The regulatory powers simply allow for the implementation and operation of the new county councils established by the Bill and for the necessary consequential and supplementary provisions to be made in this regard or in relation to other legal codes directly affected by this legislation. This Bill cannot deal with everything; the regulations simply allow for any necessary supplementary provision to be made.  The legislation has implications for a number of other Acts listed under <Col N="1741" /> the heading &ldquo;Acts Referred To&rdquo; on pages 3 and 4.  It is possible that some matter may arise which has not been dealt with specifically by the legislation, for example, where another enactment needs to be adjusted slightly to enable it to continue to operate following the establishment of three new county councils. It is reasonable, therefore, that the Oireachtas, having determined the principle and much of the detail for the establishment of the new councils, would enable the Minister to implement any other adjustments necessary to ensure that the Act operates fully.</P>
      <P>There is nothing unusual in that approach.  It simply allows the reorganisation process to be implemented. Clearly, it would not be possible for legislation to deal with every minute detail of the transfers to which I referred until the local authorities have worked out a detailed picture of the implications.  It is understandable that at that stage regulations could be made to allow the transfers proceed and to make any detailed provisions which may be identified as necessary to enable that take place.  At present I do not know, and neither do the local authorities, the precise arrangements which may need to be made.  That will only become clear when a complete and comprehensive picture of all the properties is assembled and the future arrangements are worked out by the local authorities in regard to the operation of the housing system, for example, in the light of transfers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to regulations and the need to have a debate on them. In general, debates on regulations in housing debates go far beyond the capacity of this legislation.  That is a matter for the House to consider under Standing Orders and I am sure the Deputy will take up the matter with the Whips.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the cost of reorganisation.  On Committee Stage the Minister undertook to consider that matter sympathetically to see what can be done in respect of once-off start-up costs associated with the reorganisation process.  I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> The schemes which will provide for the transfer of properties by local authorities under the Third Schedule &mdash; Deputy Gilmore raised this issue &mdash; will set out a time frame.  It will not therefore be a matter for the Minister except in cases where there is a failure to respond.  That is the only case where he might intervene.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of carers in the provision of care to the elderly, deplores the recent comments of Deputy Emmet Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, wherein he described nursing homes as &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; and calls on the Government to recognise, encourage and support the carer and the dependent in this, the European Year of Older People, by reforming the carer's allowance and introducing a charter for carers to ensure appropriate assistance to the dependent and by guaranteeing institutionalised care where families can no longer cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reported comments of the Minister of State at a function in Knock, County Mayo, last week as well as being an unwarranted attack on nursing homes, their staff and patients, also focused attention on an area of Government policy in need of reform and review.  The substance of the remarks must either be withdrawn or substantiated.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Minister of State is present in the House and tonight I offer him a direct challenge to explain <Col N="1743" /> his remarks to the House.  On two occasions last week, during Question Time and again at the commencement of business, I asked that the matter be clarified but on both occasions the Minister of State and the Government remained silent.</P>
    <P>Thousands of carers and the elderly community have been frightened and angered by the Minister of State's statement. The fact that he chose the closing days of the European Year of Older People to record his outburst is even move damning.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has cast a most unfair and unjustified slur on nursing homes.  I want the House to acknowledge the role of the nursing home in the State and the valuable care and attention being provided by them to old people who can no longer look after themselves.  I ask the House to consider if there is a more vulnerable group in society than those who for a variety of reasons are unable to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>Nursing home staff have a most important role in the creation of a homely environment within the nursing institution which for many old people is their home, their only residence.  What message has the Minister of State sent to these people, their families and friends?  Of course, there is a need for the nursing home in our society and this requires recognition in State policy.</P>
    <P>People go into care for a variety of reasons.  Studies show that usually a number of factors arise over a number of years.  The final decision to go to a home is often related to an incident in the life of the older person which makes it too difficult for him or her to continue to live in the community.  Health, homelessness, lack of security of tenure, death of a companion, convalescence, fear of living alone, feebleness or a planned decision are the reasons people opt for residential care in a nursing home setting.</P>
    <P>The importance of the nursing home is underlined when we look at the demographic structure of this country today. The elderly account for 11.2 per cent of the population.  By the year 2006 that <Col N="1744" /> percentage will rise to between 13 per cent and 16.5 per cent.  More seriously, in regard to the so-called &ldquo;old elderly&rdquo;&mdash; those over 75 years of age &mdash; there were 143,900 such persons in 1986 and they accounted for 37 per cent of the elderly population.  This figure will rise to 163,400 by the year 2006 by which time those aged 75 years and over will constitute 44 per cent of the elderly population. This increase poses a huge problem for policy makers and service providers.</P>
    <P>The distinction between the elderly and &ldquo;old elderly&rdquo; is important in the context of the Minister of State's remarks as it is those aged 75 years and over who benefit most from nursing home care.  I should say however that Fine Gael is supportive of the shift away from long-stay institutional care towards community care as outlined in the policy document &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;.  The main objects of this document which appear to have been forgotten by the Government are worth recording: to maintain elderly people in dignity and independence in their own homes; to restore those older people who fall ill or dependent to independence at home; to encourage and support the care of the elderly in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every way possible and to provide high quality hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, appears to have a problem with these objectives and I would like to know if his view is shared by his colleagues in the Labour Party or, indeed, their partners in Government.</P>
    <P>Policy objectives in caring for the elderly must provide for a genuine partnership between family and State.  The Minister of State's comments dealt a serious blow to this partnership.  In 1990 when the Nursing Homes Bill was introduced it was welcomed on all sides of the House and it was regrettable that it did not take full effect until September this year.  The regulations in respect of the subvention to private nursing homes <Col N="1745" /> while helping some people are nevertheless most discriminatory.  The means testing is unfair and causing severe problems. Many elderly people are ruled out because of means testing of family members who may be taking no interest in them.  Under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Coalition the very young and the very old are the only groups who are means tested on other family members' income; they are not means tested on their own income or assets alone.  This concept of ageism is creeping into Irish society with the direct support of the Minister of State and this causes a problem for us in Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Does the Government realise the extent to which caring for the elderly in nursing homes can be a drain on family finances?  Some families pay in excess of half the family income to keep an elderly relative in care.  These are the people the Minister of State accused of &ldquo;dumping old people in homes&rdquo;.  Moderate and middle income families are again being singled out for the big stick of this Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Coalition Government. When will the Government accept that the difficulty in meeting nursing home fees along with college fees is one of the major financial worries of moderate and middle income families?  As the Minister of State will be aware, £500,000 of the much talked of £4 million to implement the Nursing Homes Act was siphoned off immediately for Beaumont Hospital.  In effect, this sum represents £2.50 per patient per day as against a cost per patient per day of between £35 and £40.</P>
    <P>Delays in making payments of money due by health boards to nursing homes are a source of serious concern and should be addressed without delay.  In another debate recently the House was told that there were long delays by health boards in making payments to suppliers threatening to put many small businesses to the wall and bringing health boards into disrepute.  We must ensure prompt payment of subventions to nursing homes from the State.  Some nursing homes had to wait for up to six months for the appropriate <Col N="1746" /> grant aid earlier this year.  This must not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that 95 per cent of the 400,000 elderly persons in this society reside in the community the policy on community care must be reformed urgently.  The role of the carer must be recognised and supported by the Government. The integration of the marvellous work of voluntary organisations into a partnership of care is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Voluntary groups play a huge part in providing service for older people, including day-care services, transport, respite care, sitting services, home help, meals on wheels and support groups. Care-providers are not accorded an appropriate recognition by the State. Research clearly shows that care-providers are struggling on their own to provide care for those in need.  There is no great network of caring here as carers act independently to provide the service for the weakest and most vulnerable in our community.</P>
    <P>Who are the carers?  Carers, are, in effect, individual women and, having regard to the fact that community care is so reliant on the contribution of women, greater prominence must be given to the role of carers.  The cost of care and the supports appropriate to enable women to provide care without the burden becoming intolerable must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, introduced in 1990, is far too restrictive in its application to make sufficient impact.  The present sum of £59.60 is totally inadequate; it represents a sum less than that which is considered to be the official poverty line, something which the Labour Party Members were renowned for opposing in the past before they became silenced by the troikas of the Mercedes Benz one of which transported Minister Stagg to Knock to make his infamous comments of a week ago.</P>

      <P>The person being cared for &mdash; I am not talking about the Minister or another person who is being well-cared for under the present regime, Deputy Ferris &mdash; must be in receipt of a social welfare payment or a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This immediately rules out old people who may be in need of care but whose income, however small, is from a source other than the Department of Social Welfare.  This is a problem which I hope will be addressed by the Minister and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Woods, in the forthcoming budget.  The condition that the carer must live with the person means that the old person living alone loses the living alone allowance or loses out on the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael proposes to lift these unfair restrictions and develop and expand the carer's allowance.  Means-testing will be such as to allow a person to have a weekly income which will not be taken into account by the Department when assessing applications.  A recent report, &ldquo;Caring without Limits&rdquo;, produced by the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland puts the matter in context.  I should like to quote briefly from a book I would certainly recommend as essential Christmas reading for Minister of State Stagg, because if the Minister thinks that patients with Alzheimer's disease can be cared for at home and that if they are placed in residential care they are being dumped there, he can think again.  I urge him to read this very fine book published earlier this year.  The following is the quotation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report emphasises that if carers are to be enabled to continue giving care without intolerable cost to their own lives then a community of caring has to be established where the carers are not on their own but work together with other family members, friends, neighbours, local community and voluntary and statutory service-providers... The report recommends <Col N="1748" /> that a particular service-provider should be designated as case manager who would take responsibility for assessment of need and the planning and delivery of a package of services and supports which would be tailored to meet the particular needs of individual carers.</P>
    <P>There is much in this report that requires the attention of the Minister and his Government colleagues.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes to increase the dependent relative tax allowance to £1,000 to support the concept of home caring and reduce the financial burden on many households.  I hope the Government can act on this in the forthcoming budget.  We urge the setting up of a carer's charter along the lines of the 1991 model compiled by Professor Joyce O'Connor which will amount to a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights of carers, something that is long overdue. It is interesting to note that the Department of Health supported the concept of the charter but this acknowledgement needs firming up and incorporation in the Bill.  What the people of this country and its thousands of care-providers want is encouragement, recognition and support, not the type of ideological baggage of &ldquo;private versus public&rdquo; that is behind the Minister's scurrilous remarks of last week.</P>
    <P>Inherent in the Minister's remarks was that private nursing homes have no role but that the public institution, in the form of a hospital for geriatrics, should be the provider of care for the elderly in the community.  That is all very fine until one looks at the record of this Government and its immediate predecessors, Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil on their own, and sees the manner in which hospitals for geriatrics here have been underfunded and under-resourced for many years.  The attitude of Minister Stagg is insulting, offensive and unjustifiable. I hope he will avail of the opportunity to apologise to the old people in the community, to their families, relatives and friends, and that this Government can acknowledge the role of the <Col N="1749" /> care-provider, inclusive of the private nursing home, to a degree far greater than heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Before the last election Deputy Stagg strongly attacked his very affable colleague, Minister McCreevy, as he now is, and accused him of introducing the famous dirty dozen.  In Knock he came out with that other slogan, the corrals of death.  Right through his Ministry he has said many words on the environment. The Minister would do better to try to be remembered as the Minister for action and forgotten about as the Minister for slogans.  If the Minister were to provide money for housing and repairs instead of talking about it, many elderly people could live at home in comfort.  Nursing homes do marvellous work, and if people have to pay their way in nursing homes that is a reflection on the Government for not providing care for the elderly.  I know of no other cause that should be supported as much as caring for the elderly, and casting aspersions on those who provide that service or insulting them does neither the Minister nor his office any good.  I hope he will rectify the matter when he comes to reply.  If the Minister for Social Welfare were to increase the free fuel allowance from the £5 it has been since its inception it might encourage the elderly to stay in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, has mentioned the increase in the number of elderly people.  In the 20 years between 1991 and the year 2011 it is projected that the number of people over 80 years of age will increase by 9,000 and the number aged 85 and over will increase by 14,000, such is the increase in life expectancy. These people will need care, at home if that is possible.  For the Government to take credit for introducing a carer's allowance when one is allowed to have an income of a measly £2 before the allowance is cut makes a mockery of the old concept of asking people to look after the elderly.  The elderly themselves would like to stay at home and 99 per cent of families want to keep them at home.  When one considers that some <Col N="1750" /> short time ago only 1,500 people were getting the full carer's alowance, one sees how ridiculous the conditions for qualifying for it are.</P>
    <P>In the context of the amendment tabled by the Minister for Health, I am becoming mesmerised.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke on the financial crisis facing the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped in respect of the cost of schools and so on.  The Minister for Health replied in respect of his role&mdash; which I was not interested in hearing. Today the Minister for Health tabled an amendment to the motion and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, is alone and must defend himself and speak on behalf of the Minister.  The Government is taking credit for introducing the nursing home Bill as if that was a marvellous achievement.</P>
    <P>Last week a survey carried out in the South-Eastern Health Board area revealed that in Waterford there are eight nursing homes; of these, five submitted registration forms, two have been visited and one has been registered.  In South Tipperary there are 15 nursing homes, five submitted registration forms, two have been visited and none has been registered.  In Wexford there are 11 nursing homes, eight submitted registration forms, two have been visited and none has been registered.  In Carlow-Kilkenny there are seven nursing homes, three submitted registration forms, two have been visited and one has been registered. There is one registered nursing home in the south-east at present.</P>
    <P>The Government is claiming credit for introducing the nursing home Bill but it has not cost it a great deal of money so far.  No money has been invested in supporting the elderly.  The Government has caused a crisis because there is a two year delay on new patients being admitted to hospices or nursing homes. The Government is bragging about what it is doing, but I would say to the Minister that if words meant anything the Government would be a marvellous one.  Unfortunately, words without action are not worth uttering.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Government is committed to improving services for those most in need and one of the most vulnerable groups in society today is that composed of dependent elderly people&rdquo;. Those are the words of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, when recently he performed the official opening of the annual conference of the Institute of Community Health Nursing. This is a noble statement by a Minister for Health and one to which Members of the House and those working in the Department of Health could easily subscribe. However, it would appear that he has failed to convince the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, regarding this noble Government objective.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that a Minister would denigrate nursing homes during an interview on national radio and be convinced they are corrals of death and, thus, frighten elderly people out of their wits.  That is all the more disgusting in this European Year of the Elderly.  Nursing homes have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our elderly population and have contributed greatly to the care of our elderly in the past.  A small number of nursing homes may not have implemented the appropriate procedures up until now, but under the Nursing Home Act they will have to implement them in a more enhanced fashion.  Nevertheless, nursing homes have provided the opportunity for older people to convalesce and have taken enormous pressure off their families at a time when those elderly people were in need of medical attention and their families in need of respite.  Consider the institutional care expenditure that would be required by the Department of Health in already overcrowded geriatric hospitals if patients were not able to avail of the services of nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Minister for Health that nursing homes are not corrals of death but rather caring homes for the elderly located at reasonable distances from their relatives.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, would prefer if this country reverted to the regime that unfortunately <Col N="1752" /> existed far too often in the past where elderly people were admitted to psychiatric institutions and forgotten about by their relatives.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister of State does not understand that changes are taking place in society, that there is a change in policy in the Department of Health to deinstitutionalise patients and bring them back into the community. This policy prevails throughout the European Union and lends itself to a more caring and Christian response to the problems of vulnerable groups to which the Minister for Health referred.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to call on the Minister to review the carer's allowance scheme so that more people could be cared for by their relatives at home. Many relatives respond to the call of duty around the clock without any financial recognition from the State, and far too often this creates financial hardship for the family.  It is stressful enough to have demands made on a family due to a member of the family being ill, but it is traumatic to have a financial burden placed on those relatives in addition to that illness.  A flexible regime that could be applied to the carer's allowance scheme would eliminate this problem and continue to allow the patient to be treated by relatives at home rather than confined to institutional care in an environment in which there is great expenditure, that of a geriatric or acute hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State denigrated the health service, frightened our elderly people and misled the public about the grant-aid available to assist the accommodation requirements of our elderly. He stated that £8,000 of grant-aid was available to provide accommodation as part of reconstruction works for elderly relatives.  He failed to outline the conditions that apply to that scheme.  He failed to say that that scheme was confined to people who are handicapped or disabled.  Public representatives have been inundated with calls to establish if the Minister told the truth during his interview on national radio or if the truth about the scheme was told by people on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;, or by the officials <Col N="1753" /> of the Department of the Environment since his interview.  I call on the Minister for Health to disassociate himself from the remarks made by the Minister of State.  I am disappointed the Minister is not present to make a statement in that regard but he may be present at a later stage of this debate.  The Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, should ask the Minister of State to review his position in view of his despicable and outdated philosophy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State has a morsel of shame he should take the honourable course.  It is an indictment on the type of society with which the Minister might feel comfortable, that he should make a speech to the effect of designating nursing homes, the places that provide our elderly with respite and great care with the help of the State, as corrals of death. Is this now Government policy as enunciated by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment?  It is, perhaps, too much to expect that the Minister of State would take the honourable course in view of his many somersaults from the time he was converted from being a very vocal socialist in opposition to a modern radical conservative as part of this &ldquo;smoked salmon socialist Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the late Siobhan McKenna, with a shawl around her head, in one of her performances of <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> repeating the famous lines, &ldquo;they are all gone now and there is nothing more the wind or sea can do to me&rdquo;.  I was surprised by the glaring media headlines that a fellow Mayo man would use the language that was reported.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, who comes from our mutually beloved county, understands what rural life is like.  He understands the dependence of the elderly on the not so elderly.  The first thing he should do in response to this debate is to clear the air and clarify exactly what was meant by the words he is reported to have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that there is not one <Col N="1754" /> member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House at this time.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government is hiding behind a plethora of programme managers and the blinding light of the £8 billion to be spent in the next number of years calls into question its commitment to the population to whom it has pandered for the last 50 years.  At polling stations around the country, long before the former Minister, Commissioner Flynn, banned people from standing outside polling stations, Fianna Fáil was the expert at resurrecting the elderly and the dead.  I am surprised there is not a single member of that party in the House to hear this debate.  At least the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, had the gumption and forthrightness to come in here to answer this motion, which, after all, is not a stag hunt.  It is because this is the Year of the Elderly and because this party always has been genuinely concerned for the elderly that we raise this matter at this time.</P>
    <P>In the Official Report of 11 July 1990, column 1456, the then Labour spokesman on Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, now Minister for Health in this ill-fated Government, said when speaking on the Health Estimates: &ldquo;I feel a certain weariness in rising to speak on what for many is an annual ritual&rdquo;.  In the same debate he went on to say:</P>
    <P>We are a caring people.  It is part of our uniqueness that we care for one another and particularly for the weak and the sick.  It is a tribute commented upon by people who visit this country. If we have a national consensus about anything it is that health care above all else is a basic human right.</P>
    <P>These words mean nothing if they are not backed up by action.  We can all recall the Fianna Fáil element of this Government promoting the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made on the carer's allowance and the rigidity of the regulations governing that allowance.  Not very far from where the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, was born sits an elderly lady in a wheelchair.  This person is incontinent <Col N="1755" /> and is confined to bed and to her wheelchair.  She is looked after by her daughter-in-law.  The lady in question has five children of her own.  Her husband is a PAYE employee and she has been denied the carer's allowance because her spouse works.  This woman's daughter-in-law, because she is a very close and dear relative of the family and because of her love for her mother-in-law, takes care of her 24 hours a day.  If this elderly lady, in the closing years of her life, was confined to an institution the cost to the State would be huge.</P>
    <P>I reject any remarks about the degradation of people who run, above board, nursing homes.  The expense and the extent to which they go to make their premises as near as possible to a living home for elderly people has to be seen to be believed.  I wonder what legacy will this Government, particulary the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, leave at the end of this year, the Year of the Elderly. What mark will he make to contradict the slogan &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; which has been hung on his shoulders?  How far down the road will he go in terms of Government action in providing necessary facilities for the elderly so that those who care for them can do so with a degree of comfort and dignity.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is charged with this responsibility.  Whatever time is left to this Government, be it two years, three years or less, the Minister of State should devote all his actions and energy to this matter.  As Deputy Flanagan has pointed out, by the year 2006 a substantial number of the population will be deemed elderly or old elderly.  In the province of Connacht in the last 50 years more than 600 townlands have been wiped off the census of population documentation due to the natural decline in the birth rate and emigration.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows that throughout rural Ireland tonight, at the end of long, dark laneways, people sit huddled in their houses afraid to turn on the electric heater lest they might use more than the number of free units allocated to them.  These people's sons, <Col N="1756" /> daughters and other relatives are given no allowance for looking after them. They have to be put into what are termed modern granny flats with separate entrances and separate light meters. Thousands of people return from the United States and Great Britain on an annual basis through Knock Airport and other ports of entry to visit their relatives and to work on the family farm but as soon as they arrive their relative's living alone allowance is terminated, causing great confusion and depression.  Deputy Stagg, in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, should ensure that these people live in dignity and that their just and valid claims are backed up by Government action.  If the Minister does not use EC money and this Government authority for the benefit of the elderly he will be deemed a failure in that Department.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to have words over the years with Government Ministers from my own county and province and I appeal to the Minister of State, as a fellow Mayoman, a person who understands rural life, to ensure that the homes referred to by Deputy Browne are registered. These homes, which are well run and properly managed and which provide a great deal of care for elderly people, should be promoted so that those who spend time in them can live the remaining years of their lives in dignity.  We hope we will not have to say, as in the words of Synge: &ldquo;They are all gone now&rdquo; and this Government has not cared for them. The Minister has a golden opportunity to ensure that for those in the golden years of their lives the horizon is not black. They should receive strong support from the Government.  Otherwise, in the remaining weeks of this year, the Year of the Elderly, the Minister will be decried across the country as having been a failure in terms of implementing the mandate given to him by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to take cognisance of the terms of the motion put down by Deputy Flanagan.  He should ensure that the elderly, who have given a lifetime of valuable service to the country and who are now unable to fend for themselves, <Col N="1757" /> are given a lifeline of political support.  They should not be moved to &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo;, rather they should be moved to an area where they can look out from their humble homes or rooms to brighter days ahead.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government for the broad range of activities which were initiated to mark the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations; in particular, commends the Minister for Health for the introduction on 1 September 1993, of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which provides a framework for the registration of nursing homes and a new system of subvention towards the cost of nursing home care for those who need such care and cannot afford the cost and for his commitment to introduce a Health Charter for the Elderly; and further commends the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare for their continued support of the carer's allowance, for the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> to maintaining the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the income of pensioners and for their support of the elderly generally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Government to the motion tabled by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the European Community designated this year to honour its older citizens, to focus on the challenges and opportunities of an ageing Europe and to reinforce links between <Col N="1758" /> the generations.  This special year had its origins in the European Parliament. Some MEPs, the Irish members being prominent among them, because aware of the need to plan for the growing elderly population in the community.  They persuaded the European Commission to propose a three year programme for the elderly, culminating in this specially designated year.  During this year the Community and the member states have tried to heighten the awareness of the position of the elderly and of the challenges which an ageing population holds for society.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see that so much has been done in this country to highlight the position of older people and to promote and encourage intergenerational solidarity. In each member state a national co-ordinating committee was established to ensure the success of the year throughout the Community.  The co-ordinating committee in this country is representative of the social partners, of voluntary bodies representing or providing services to the elderly and of the statutory bodies with responsibilities for services for the elderly.  As a mark of support for the objectives of the European Year, my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, made £440,000 available to the national co-ordinating committee to fund its programme of promotion and sponsorship of activities to celebrate the year.</P>
    <P>The themes which the co-ordinating committee were promoting during the year are: the positive contribution which older people make to our society; all ages working and playing together and meeting the challenges of older age.  The European Year is an occasion to remind ourselves about the positive contribution of older people to Irish life &mdash; in politics, literature, music, amature drama, voluntary work, community development and family life.  Despite this contribution, many people still have negative attitudes to old age and older people.  It is not always appreciated that over 80 per cent of elderly people are healthy and active and leading independent lives.</P>
    <P>The Age and Opportunity Organisation has established a nationwide network <Col N="1759" /> to promote positive attitudes to ageing and to highlight the positive contribution of older people to society.  A sign of the times is that more and more older people are joining organisations which focus on the issues and interests of older people.  These include the Federation of Active Retirement Associations, The National Federation of Pensioners Associations, The Irish Association of Older People and Age Action Ireland.  Although the rate of participation of older people in groups involved in charitable work, education, the arts, the environment, human rights and consumer affairs is estimated to be as high as that of younger people, there is scope for greater involvement of the elderly in shaping every aspect of our society.</P>
    <P>Economists sometimes portray old age as a burden on the younger generation because of the taxes and social security contributions which must be paid by those in employment to fund pensions and health care of older citizens.  Of course, there are economic and financial consequences of everyone living longer; but each generation of people in their active years must accept a responsibility towards the support of the elderly so that when they in turn grow old younger people will support them.  The elderly have so much to give in return to the younger generations, gifts which may never be quantified on a slide rule or calculator.  How does one measure wisdom, spirit, experience or stamina? We know the influence which grandparents have on the upbringing of children, should the latter be lucky enough to know them.  Rooted in memory, the young person's values and beliefs will always reflect the moral influence of the older generation.  Many Deputies will also be aware of the successful mentor scheme whereby retired people with particular skills offer their assistance to new and expanding firms.  There is scope for broadening the opportunities for people with skills and expertise acquired over a lifetime to give tuition and advice to the younger generation in developing our <Col N="1760" /> economy and reducing our high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the 1993 committee, chaired by Mr. Larry Tuomey, for the role it has played in stimulating action and provoking reflection.  Thanks to the work of its members and director, Catherine Rose, and the co-operation of the many statutory and voluntary bodies involved with older people, attention has focused in an unprecedented way on ageing and the needs and concerns of older people. The 1993 committee has built on the work of many organisations over the past decade which have helped change attitudes and policies towards older people. The year has also helped many in this country to realise that their work is part of a much wider European movement and that while we have much to learn from our fellow member states, we also have much to offer.</P>
    <P>In quantitative terms the committee has approved grants to 170 groups and organisations, mostly voluntary, which are running suitable events to celebrate the aims and spirit of the year.  Over 5,000 events were organised as part of the year in villages, towns and cities throughout the country.  The year has stimulated many groups to examine the issue of ageing for the clients with whom they work.  Conferences have been held on the implications for service providers of the ageing mental handicap population, on the care of the elderly in long stay hospitals and homes, on the need to expand dementia services, on how best our general hospitals should respond to the needs of our growing elderly population, on measures to promote the health and autonomy of older people and on combating age discrimination, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>The year has also helped to strengthen links between older people on both parts of this island and between organisations working on their behalf.  These links will, I believe, be one of the lasting benefits of the year.  The exchange visits by groups of older people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the great achievements of western society in this century has been the opportunity provided to the majority of citizens to live to old age. While recognising that increased longevity usually bring more active years of life, plans must also be formulated to meet the needs of the more dependent elderly.  The Minister for Health is very fortunate to have the National Council for the Elderly as an advisory body.  Without this council, very few of the research projects, reports and seminars on a whole range of important topics pertaining to the elderly would have been undertaken. These reports have been very useful to the Department of Health in determining policy and priorities for the elderly and in informing a wider public of the challenges of ageing and an ageing population.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to put paid to some of the misconceptions going around &mdash; these were deliberately and mischievously created by the Fine Gael Party in particular &mdash; relating to my recent comments about the elderly.

      <P>There may be no spare accommodation or there may be nobody at home or nearby during the day to do the caring if the elderly person is not fully fit.  In other cases there may simply be no alternative to full time professional care facilities which, with the best will in the world, cannot be provided at home. Nursing homes, private and public, have a clear and essential role in serving this type of need.  However, my concern is that they should not be the first and only option when an elderly person can no longer continue to live on their own or may need a little help to retain their independence.  While most nursing home residents are happy that they are being well cared for, and for others it may be <Col N="1768" /> the only realistic choice, the people I am concerned about are those who want to live in their own homes or with their families and who, for the lack of a little consideration, cannot do so.  These are the people to whom I referred in my comments at Knock, people who are in institutions that they do not wish to be in and who are denied any future useful role in society.  It was to those people I was referring in my speech at Knock and not the generality as has been referred to here.</P>

      <P>Like everywhere else in Europe the ageing of the population is an issue which will have to be faced up to here also. Housing policies will have to be developed and adapted to meet changing needs.  For its part my Department already has a number of schemes in operation that can help the elderly continue to be accommodated in the home.

      <P>In addition, we found the scheme of improvement works in lieu of rehousing under which substantial improvements or extensions can be carried out to private houses.  The programme of special housing aid for the elderly continues to be financed by my Department and allows necessary repairs or facilities such as water and sewerage to be undertaken for elderly persons living on their own in unfit housing.  They can then retain their independence and continue to reside in their own neighbourhood alongside their friends.  There are, therefore, a variety of home based options available and when the day comes that an elderly person cannot reasonably be expected to go on as before, these options should be considered.</P>
      <P>It should not be forgotten either that much has also been done by the State in the provision of new housing for the elderly.  They are recognised in housing legislation as being a special category of housing need and local authorities are required to take particular account of this in their housing programme.  Indeed, a substantial proportion of those programmes is made up of new dwellings for elderly persons.  In addition, considerable support is given to the voluntary sector to cater for the housing needs of the elderly.  Grants of up to £22,000 per unit are available to voluntary groups promoting such projects. Indeed, it was at the opening of such a scheme in Churchfield, Knock, County Mayo that I made the comments that have been the subject of complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, however, it is the community and society rather than the Government which will shape future policies towards the elderly.  In this respect we are currently at a crossroads; we have to decide now whether we are to retain the traditional role and place the elderly have enjoyed in society and in the family or move increasingly towards institutional solutions.  My view is that we must strive for a situation where human <Col N="1770" /> dignity rather than personal convenience is the prize.  What message do we want to give to the elderly?  Our answer now will one day come to bear on how we are looked after in our old age.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said has given some food for thought.  If so, it will have been worth the slings and arrows of those who have chosen to misrepresent what I said and my intentions.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Health brought into being a set of regulations which has been part of the provisions of the original Act.  The provisions of that Act ensure, first of all, that all nursing homes which care for the elderly maintain a high standard of accommodation and care.  Indeed Deputy Flanagan accepted that, as we did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were sufficiently foolish to think that all nursing homes provided an excellent standard of care, obviously Members who have had any recourse to their constituents must realise that some do experience difficulties.  That is a sentiment I share with Deputy Browne who was very specific.  Some nursing homes have found it impossible to comply with the regulations made under this Act because the restrictions are tight.  Indeed I brought to the Minister's attention the legitimate point that there are no nursing homes, with the exception of two in the south-east, which have been approved under the provisions of that Act.  The money is there to help people but, because the regulations are interpreted by health boards as being very restrictive, it is almost impossible to produce any kind of an engineers' report that will satisfy health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with health boards and with the Minister.  Indeed the Minister has issued instructions to health boards to interpret these regulations &mdash; which the Minister did not write &mdash; in a manner that would ensure that existing nursing homes, already registered and-providing <Col N="1774" /> a most useful service to the community, could benefit under the provisions of this scheme in the care of elderly. It should be recognised that at present nursing homes are unable to benefit from the scheme.  Indeed the people whom all of us represent are unable to obtain subvention because the regulations are too strict.</P>

      <P>Having listened to what the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, had to say here this evening, all I can say is that it took some brass neck to come into this House and say what he did this evening.  I would prefer to refer to some other part of the anatomy but, in deference to Deputy Ferris's sensitivity, I will confine myself to the upper body here this evening.  I can tell the Minister of State that he treated not only the people about whom we were supposed to be talking here this evening, that is the elderly, but this House with the greatest contempt I have witnessed on the part of any Minister in my time here.

      <P>The trappings of office are the greatest concern of the Labour Party. They projected an image of a caring party in Opposition but the caring policies of the Labour Party which were supposedly strengthened by a backbone of integrity are now no more than a faded memory, lost in the myths of time.  The very least the Minister &mdash; who has left the House &mdash; could have done this evening was to unreservedly apologise for his appalling comments.</P>
      <P>Private nursing homes, provided they are run well and regulated, which the vast majority are, offer a service to the community which could not easily be replaced by State activity.  It is the job of the Minister of Health to ensure their regulation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, would have been much better advised directing his comments, if he believes they are true, to his colleague in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that the State is not providing sufficient support for carer's of the disabled or, indeed, the elderly.  At present there are over 66,000 elderly people in Ireland and yet only some 2,100 people are receiving the full carer's allowance; some 2,000 are in receipt of a reduced carer's allowance.  The majority of carers are women in the home who are unable to avail of the carer's allowance as it is means-tested on the basis of their husband's income.  That is the reality.  I <Col N="1778" /> firmly believe that the allowance should be means tested to the means of the person being cared for.  Without such support for the carer we cannot realistically expect families to be able to cope with the strain an elderly &mdash; sometimes infirm &mdash; relative can place on them.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the budget submission &mdash; a copy of which I am sure the Minister has received &mdash; from the Disability Federation of Ireland.  One of the points of view put forward, which I think has great merit, is the following:</P>
    <P>the allowance be paid, if desired, directly to those individuals, in particular, those with a physical disability who receive care/personal assistance. This places control and responsibility for care with the disabled person and does much to reduce the concept of dependency.  The allowance should be recognised as an essential component in the helping people with physical disability to live independent lives.  Many disabled people can and want to live non-institutionalised lives in the community but require varying degrees of help to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, who unfortunately cannot be with us, in looking at the carer's allowance in the forthcoming budget should speak with his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare and examine the issue of giving dignity to people who want to have independent lives in society.  Provision must be made for the allowance to be made available directly to the person in need of care. They should be allowed, if they have the capability, to be the arbiters of the type of care they require.  Leave it to them to go in the marketplace and seek and pay for assistance.  They can do it in a way that will best suit their needs.  Why should we put the responsibility on somebody else when in many instances the person in need of care may only have a physical disability, may be in full control of their mental faculties and would like to sustain an independent existence for the remainder of their lives.  Surely that is the direction in which we should be proceeding when dealing with community care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> If the Government is serious about shifting the emphasis from institutionalised care to community-based care around families and homes one option is to look at the support framework in the context of how carers are paid and to whom that payment is made. It is clear that the burden on the State would be much less than it would otherwise be if people remained outside institutions.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this country spends, <i>per capita</i>, one of the largest sums of money in the health area in comparison with many of our colleagues in the European Union.  I fail to understand why we are not getting value for that money in the areas to which that money is applied. It is a source of distress to politicians and political parties in general and, indeed, to front-line staff in the delivery of medical services in this country.  Great emphasis has been placed on the Government amendment which refers to the Nursing Homes Act which was finally regulated for in September.  The reality on the ground is that that Act is having little effect because very little is happening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris correctly referred to the ludicrous situation regarding the fire regulations in nursing homes.  Individuals who did not do any of the work in existing nursing homes will not sign the safety regulations because they were not responsible for the work on the buildings in the first place.  Their insurers are telling them not to sign because they cannot guarantee insurance if something goes wrong down the line.  That is one of the reasons very few of the nursing homes in this country are registered.  The other reasons is that of the £4 million made available in 1993 as the first step towards providing the subventions to people who require care in private nursing homes &mdash; I wanted the Minister for Health to be present to hear this &mdash; two thirds is absorbed in the administration costs by the health boards.  Less than one-third of that money is made available in subvention to the people who require it.  That is absolutely appalling.  We have in microcosm one of the great problems within <Col N="1780" /> the health services in that the front-line people delivering the service and the people in need of the service are the last to receive full value from the resources being made available.</P>
    <P>The example I can give and which I believe pertains throughout the country, is that approximately £340,000 would be the share to the South-Eastern Health Board region.  I believe the exact figure is £331,000.  Based on 8.5 per cent of the elderly population living in the region the figure is reasonably accurate.  The sum that will actually be made available for subvention is £117,000.  In other words, more than two-thirds of the money, about which we have heard great praise this evening, is absorbed in administration costs by the faceless bureaucrats in health boards, or whatever, once again.  That is beyond comprehension and again highlights the major question of the delivery of health care.  This is not just in relation to this issue, the sums of money made available to the health service, which in many respects are generous, are not going into the delivery of the service because so much is lost in bureaucracy.  The health board bureaucracy is interwined with the delivery of the service at local level and the Department's bureaucracy is also imposed on the health service.  Some time ago I questioned the real value of health boards during a debate on health.  I know the question of local democracy comes into the picture, but the time has come for a sharp analysis of the delivery of the service by the health boards and a cost effective analysis of their work.  Indeed, I wonder if that structure should still exist or whether the Department should not be capable of putting in place a more streamlined method of delivering health care.</P>
    <P>If it is the Government's desire to see a shift to community care as the most beneficial way to deliver the services &mdash; far more beneficial to the patients and more cost effective for the State &mdash; it will certainly not be brought about by the health boards if, when people are looked after in nursing homes or at home two thirds of the cost is absorbed in administration. <Col N="1781" /> That is ludicrous.  In next year's budget funds should not be made available to the health boards until that question is answered and somebody made accountable for their disbursement at local level.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party fully supports the motion tabled by Fine Gael. The first element relates to the behaviour of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg and I hope he will apologise.  Earlier he said he did not mean to offend anybody but I wish he had gone the full mile and apologised to those offended.  Once again the Minister of State will not act honourably, which I regret.  It is extraordinary that someone who used to lecture us during the past five years should do so many somersaults since taking up office.</P>
    <P>The second element deals with the carer's allowance on which I have already spoken.  This problem must be solved by the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health and there is an opportunity to make enormous strides.</P>
    <P>The third element deals with the Nursing Homes Act which is laudable in content and supported by the Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael Parties. However, in its practical application it will not achieve its aims.  One of the reasons for this is the heavy &mdash; if not the dead &mdash; hand of the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members on this side of the House indicated, the motion is in three parts.  The first part deals with comments reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, as follows:</P>
      <P>A Government Minister has condemned the trend of leaving elderly relatives in nursing homes, or &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; as he described them.</P>
      <P>Mr. Emmet Stagg, who has responsibility for housing at the Department of the Environment, said the elderly should be regarded as valued members of society and should not be confined to homes where they served no useful function and where they remained until death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrases the Minister used are unfortunate <Col N="1782" /> but he had an opportunity to withdraw his remarks and I regret he did not. He could have listed his successes in the Department since his appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for the elderly during this European Year of the Elderly.  For instance, he could have stated his intention of increasing the number of inspectors to carry out inspections of granny homes or grants for handicapped persons' accommodation. Is it not true that there are only two such inspectors and that the elderly are marooned because the Department cannot get around to carrying out the inspections?</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate this evening Deputy Browne read out a list of places in the south east where inspections had not taken place.  Was it the Minister's intention to criticise people who were not carrying out inspections?  I think that was the real reason he raised this matter, and that was what I took from his interjections.  I do not think the Minister has a new agenda for the care of the elderly, he was at odds with the &ldquo;caring&rdquo; Departments when he made this statement as he felt that the Department of Health was not doing its duty.  That must be the reason no official from that Department came to listen to this debate and take a note of what is happening.  His party's unfortunate Whip, Deputy Ferris, has to come in here every Tuesday and <Col N="1783" /> Wednesday night to defend the Labour Party in Government.  The Minister got an opportunity tonight to make a reasonable contribution and failed but then Deputy Ferris jumped in to defend him.</P>

        <i>Wexford</i>): Deputy Rabbitte was concerned about whether property transfers would proceed.  Section 6 is designed to provide a mechanism to ensure that the transfers will proceed and it is the subject of a separate amendment.  The Minister has indicated that he wishes the transfer process to proceed without delay and it is primarily for this reason that a power of direction is provided by section 6.  The transfer of houses and land was raised by a number of Deputies and these questions primarily relate to section 35 and to the Third Schedule.  It would be more appropriate to discuss those matters when we reach those sections.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 30 to 43.</P>
      <P>This subsection is a dictatorial provision in the legislation.  It states that &ldquo;the Minister may give to the relevant local authorities and the managers such general or particular directions in relation to the execution of or compliance with any provision of this Act or regulations thereunder&rdquo;. In section 6 (6) the legislation states that &ldquo;A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith.&rdquo; To insert a provision in the legislation where the Minister can give a direction to both the local authority through its elected members and to the manager stands the principle of local democracy on its head.  I do not see the necessity for that in this legislation.  The legislation provides that the Minister may make regulations and that those regulations shall be compiled with.</P>
      <P>Under various sections of the Bill the Minister will have the power to make regulations dealing, for example, with county boundaries, management and so on.  It was not explained on Committee Stage why it was necessary to include this sweeping provision in the legislation.  I do not think it is necessary.  It is in conflict with the sentiments expressed by the Minister during the past year.  He has spoken at great length about the idea of devolving powers and local democracy. Yet this provision has been included in the legislation with the result that he will be able to tell councillors and the county manager what to do and they will have to comply.  That is not local democracy; it is dictatorship.  It is not necessary to include this provision in the Bill and it should be deleted.  This is the purpose of my amendment.  This would not undermine the other provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The only reason I can think of that it has been included in the Bill is that the Minister thinks that local authorities will not comply with his directions.  This would be extraordinary, given, as was mentioned earlier in the debate, that the three new local authorities &mdash; Dublin Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash; have co-operated and worked enthusiastically to adhere to the target date of 1 January 1994 for the establishment of the new county councils. I attended a pleasant function yesterday evening on the occasion of the last meeting of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Given what has happened during the past year and a half to two years, I do not see either the managers or the members being recalcitrant and refusing to comply with regulations made by the Minister. The Minister of State should indicate if he anticipates the local authorities and the managers will not comply and therefore he requires this provision.  There is no necessity for it and it should be deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about section 6.  In amendment No. 6 Deputy Gilmore proposes to delete lines 30 to 43.  I have a difficulty with subsection (4) in which the words &ldquo;for those authorities such general or particular directions in <Col N="1789" /> relation to ...&rdquo; appear.  The Minister of State is not being consistent.  He has already deleted the words &ldquo;or for any particular purpose&rdquo; from the Bill, narrowing the scope of directions, regulations or orders made under this legislation.  I refer Members to section 3 (4), which will now read &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for the general purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  However, the Minister of State does not propose to delete the words &ldquo;such general&rdquo; in section 6 (4).  If he is to be consistent he should delete them.  On Second and Committee Stages the Minister, Deputy Smith, was sensitive to the concerns expressed in relation to the general powers that he was retaining to direct or order any of these three local authorities should any problems or issues arise during the next three years.  In the Bill as initiated it was proposed that he would retain this power indefinitely.</P>
      <P>If the subsection read &ldquo;The Minister may give to the relevant local authorities and the managers for those authorities particular directions in relation to the execution of or compliance with any provision of this Act&rdquo; I would be much happier. I do not understand the reason any Minister would want to assume powers to give managers general directions.  If we give the Minister the power to give managers general directions it must be bad legislation.  I understand that the Minister may need to interfere if an issue arises but I do not support the proposal that he be given the power to give general directions in this area.  I am being consistent in the sense that in the amendment we have just passed the Minister deleted the words &ldquo;or for any particular purpose&rdquo;. Therefore, I share the concern expressed by Deputy Gilmore about this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an affront to local government and local democracy that the Minister of State feels he has to include subsection (6), which reads as follows: &ldquo;A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith&rdquo;.  It is being assumed that they will not comply if the Minister gives a direction, issues a regulation, an order or a statutory instrument. <Col N="1790" /> Can the Minister of State say if the local authorities, either at management or executive level, have not complied with ministerial directives to such an extent that he must safeguard his powers by including subsection (6)?  The Minister of State served for many years on a county council and should be in a position to view this matter from the perspective of local government as well as from the perspective of national Government.  I hope he will agree that subsection (6) flies in the face of devolution of the functions of local government and of subsidiarity.  I hope he can give us a good justification for retaining it in the Bill.  While I do not have any major objections to subsection (4), apart from the words &ldquo;such general&rdquo;, I will have to support Deputy Gilmore's amendment unless the Minister of State can justify the inclusion of subsection (6), which I find repugnant in terms of the role of the local councillor and local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate on Committee Stage, Opposition spokespersons expressed misgivings at the fact that the Minister was retaining so many powers to make regulations.  Those Members directly involved in the reorganisation of Dublin County Council into three new county council mentioned that managers, officials and, indeed, the elected representatives were co-operating. I genuinely felt that the Minister has noted our views.  He indicated at that time that he would examine the section again before Report Stage.  I refer in particular to amendment No. 7.  While Deputy Gilmore wants to delete the offending passages, the Minister proposes to include a new subsection (8), which reads as follows: &ldquo;A direction shall not be given under this section after the expiration of three years from the establishment day....&rdquo;  The Minister explained that he would have to have certain powers to give directions if, following the establishment of the three new county councils, there were extraordinary circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was prepared to accept that explanation at the time.  Now we are on Report <Col N="1791" /> Stage and the Minister has gone a very small distance towards meetings our concerns. By the time the three years provided for expires it will be time for the next local elections, unless there are plans to postpone them.  This amendment is nonsensical.  It would make far more sense if he were to review the section in its entirety and come back and say that he trusts the management, the officials and the local representatives.  That is not evident from this amendment which implies that the Minister wants to exercise control for a period of three years. That is not acceptable.  Why this insistence on control rather than the exercise of true democracy at local level which the Minister for the Environment has preached at us time and time again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Much depends on which county one is standing in when one reads the section.  People in South Dublin will have a great deal of interest in this section when we come to deal with the transfer of certain assets from Dublin Corporation to South Dublin.  There may be difficulties down the line and it would be useful to have this section in operation for a period of time while negotiations take place between the three new county councils and Dublin Corporation.  It is important that, should any dispute arise, the Minister would have a means of intervening and imposing a fair solution.  Other disputes may arise between certain neighbouring counties and in the event of such disputes not being resolved we would all look to the Minister to intervene.  If there is non-compliance by the new councils, somebody must make a decision.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Amendment No. 7 limits the scope of the section by providing a timeframe within which such directions may be given.  The result is that the section is of no effect after that period expires.  The time limit for giving directions which do not relate to the transfers of land or housing, under the Third Schedule, expires after three years from the establishment day i.e. 31 December <Col N="1792" /> 1996.  The Minister may give directions related to schemes approved by him under the Third Schedule for a period of three years from the approval of such schemes.  Directions may only be given in so far as is necessary for securing or facilitating the operation of any provision of the Act.  These powers are only seen as a necessary safeguard in the start-up phase.  Concern was expressed by some Deputies at the power of direction vested in the Minister by section 6.</P>
      <P>At the same time several Deputies, including Deputy Gilmore, have asked the Minister to ensure that there is no delay in the implementation of the transfer provisions of the Third Schedule.  We have tried to meet both concerns by limiting the period in which directions may be given to three years but in the case of the transfers the period is three years from the date of approval of a transfer scheme under the Third Schedule.  As the schemes must be submitted to the Minister within 12 months of the establishment day this would most likely mean a period of about four years as the time frame within which any such direction could be given.  The reason for this is that the schemes are required to set out a time-scale for implementation and the power of direction should be available if necessary.</P>
      <P>I hope that the amendment will meet the concerns of Deputy Gilmore and others.  On Committee Stage the Minister emphasised the necessity of having such a power of direction.  However, by &ldquo;putting a three year&rdquo; time restriction on the provision, I hope that Deputies will see the power not as an idle instrument but as a necessary mechanism and a reminder to ensure that sufficient priority is given to their responsibilities by the authorities concerned.  Given the amendment and the Minister's commitment to use this provision only if absolutely essential, I hope Deputy Gilmore is sufficiently reassured as to the Minister's intention and will withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle raised some points that I would like to refer to.  She objected to section 6 (6) which requires a person to <Col N="1793" /> whom a direction is given to comply with it.  What would be the point of vesting power in the Minister to issue directions if they did not have to be complied with? This would not make much sense.  Section 6 (6) follows logically on the provision being vested in the Minister to issue directions, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from being reassured, I think the Minister's amendment makes the section far worse.  There are two reasons for that.  On the one hand he is providing for a three year time-scale within which the process of reorganisation and the establishment of the new county councils must be completed. The county councils are away ahead of the Minister.  They never asked for a three year time-scale.  The managers have met the deadline given to them under the 1991 legislation and have produced their reorganisation report.  The 1991 legislation stated that this was to be done as soon as possible; there was certainly no time-scale set down.  The elected members of the councils, immediately on being elected in 1991, proceeded to devolve their reserved functions to the area committees within a very short time, with the full co-operation of their councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole process of negotiation has been undertaken in the two local authorities with the trade unions representing the staff in relation to very complex matters, including a degree of disruption in the relocation of staff with people working in O'Connell Street being relocated to Dún Laoghaire or Swords or Tallaght, the process of the establishment of new offices and the range of practical measures that had to be undertaken to get the show on the road.  All that was done.  Now that the councils themselves are moving ahead at great speed to meet the deadline on 1 January 1994, the Minister says there are to be three more years. What for?  The councils have already proceeded with the reorganisation, as have the managers and staff.  These county councils will be up and running on 1 January and will want to move ahead as <Col N="1794" /> county councils.  They do not want to be in some kind of limbo waiting for directions from the Minister to give effect to various parts of the legislation between now and three years time.  Three years will take us beyond the date of the next local elections or, at least, the date on which they are due.  This provision will make the legislation worse.</P>
    <P>It would be much better not to have any provision for dictatorship from the top, which is what the Minister is proposing. The legislation should be left as it is and we should build on the enthusiasm of the county councils to move ahead.  The provision in amendment No. 7 is one that sends the legislation down the plug hole.  It states that Dublin Corporation's housing stock and its land must be transferred to the new county councils.  Tenants have been in a &ldquo;limbo land&rdquo; for years.  They are tenants of one authority and elect members to a different authority but have no redress to the housing authority which governs their day to day lives through elected representatives. The Minister is now saying that those buildings, flats, houses and lands will not be transferred for five years.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule says that the transfer scheme will be implemented within 12 months, provided there is no extension. Within that one year period consultation must take place between the various managers, between the manager giving the land and his council and between the manager receiving the houses and his council.  It is possible that that 12 months period might be extended and I adverted to that on Committee Stage.  The order will then be passed to the Minister and it could be on his desk for a long time.  How long was the special amenity order for the Liffey Valley, which was not a complex matter, on the Minister's desk?  It was on his desk for more than two years before it was signed.  An order for a scheme could be passed to the Minister and lie on his desk because of a general election, a heave in Fianna Fáil or for any number of reasons that would delay its signing. The period could be extended for a further year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> When the order is approved Dublin Corporation has three years to dither, delay and avoid handing over the housing stock to the neighbouring local authority. This is a concession to Dublin Corporation. I distinctly recall that the Minister for the Environment, in response to the previous debate on the transfer of houses, said he would stick to what was provided in the Bill.  He has caved in. City Hall has won the argument.  It will now be five years before those tenants will be tenants of the housing authority to which they elect representatives.  It will be an unmitigated disaster.  It will be a further period of purgatory for the 8,000 tenants of Dublin Corporation who are currently living in the Dublin County Council administrative area and who will be citizens of the new county council area.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister gave no indication on Committee Stage that he was going to show the white feather in this manner.  The provision is being introduced in a disingenuous way by stating that in some way it is putting a barrier on the Minister's powers.  It is providing a let-out in relation to the transfer of the houses.  It is a major setback and disappointment to those people who are tenants of Dublin Corporation and who had hoped they would be enfranchsied by the Bill.  Unfortunately, that enfranchisement and their democratic rights to elect people to be members of a local authority which is also their housing authority, is being denied to them for a period of five years.  That is a great mistake and I oppose that provision.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.  The general expectation is that the new county councils will come into effect on 1 January 1994.  That date has been signalled from the beginning as the target date for the establishment of the three new county councils and the winding up of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I was surprised that the published Bill did not state that 1 January would be the establishment date for the Bill and for the setting up of the new county councils.  When I tabled the amendment on Committee Stage the Minister stated that he intended that 1 January would be the start up date but that he wanted a certain amount of flexibility. For example, if unforeseen circumstances arose between now and 1 January, he wanted to be able to set an establishment date for the Bill other than 1 January.  The Minister did not elaborate further on the matter on Committee Stage.  Because he emphatically stated on Committee Stage that it was his intention that the start up date would be 1 January, I did not press the issue.  I understood that the Minister had put on record his intention that 1 January would be the start-up date and that was the date we were working towards.  It had not occurred to me that there might be some unforeseen circumstances between now and 1 January that would cause that date to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reflection, I do not know what those unforeseen circumstances are. <Col N="1797" /> Everybody is working towards 1 January. Dún Laoghaire Borough Council held its last monthly meeting last night and celebrated the occasion in an appropriate fashion.  Dublin County Council will do the same next week.  All the staffs of the authorities are getting ready for 1 January.  I met staff in Dún Laoghaire Town Hall this morning wandering around the corridor looking for their new offices and inspecting their working conditions.</P>

      <P>Everybody is geared up for 1 January and the Minister is worried about unforeseen circumstances.  I do not know what the unforeseen circumstances might be.  A guillotine will be applied to the legislation as it is intended that it will pass through the House by 5 p.m. tomorrow.  There are still two working weeks for the Bill to pass through the Seanad and be signed by the President. During the debate on the Bill nobody has raised any possible constitutional difficulties in regard to it.  Despite reservations I may have in regard to the legislation, I do not foresee any constitutional difficulties arising.  What are the unforeseen circumstances?  There are no administrative unforeseen circumstances. The only cloud I see on the horizon &mdash; perhaps I am being a little unfair to the Minister having regard to his public comments on the matter earlier this year &mdash; is the requirement by Dublin County Council to have the review of its development plan completed before 1 January. A special meeting of the county council is scheduled for next Friday to adopt the county development plan.  I intend to ensure that there will be a division on that matter because I hold the view that, notwithstanding all the work that went into preparation of the county plan, we would be better off without the draft plan before us.  That is the only possible unforeseen circumstances that could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could it be that the Minister for the Environment, who earlier this year was so vocal about his concerns as to what <Col N="1798" /> was happening in Dublin County Council with regard to the review of the development plan, is providing some &ldquo;out&rdquo; where, if the development plan is not adopted by Christmas &mdash; there has been one successful legal challenge to the development plan during the week &mdash; the county council could continue in existence beyond 1 January in order to pull it out of the fire?  It is a pity the Minister is not here to respond to this question. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us what are the unforeseen circumstances that are causing the Minister not to set down in the Bill the establishment date of 1 January but to do so by way of order? As this is 7 December surely at this eleventh and a half hour the establishment date of 1 January could be inserted in the Bill.  I am proposing that we include such a provision to put beyond doubt the establishment date.  Having dealt with this matter at local level for the last year and a half I do not understand what are the unforeseen circumstances about which the Minister is concerned.</P>

It is extraordinary that the Minister did not agree to this amendment on Committee Stage.  The establishment of the three new county councils has been at all times facilitated by management, the officials and the elected members, and everybody is working on this basis.

        <i>(Wexford):</i> This amendment seeks to confirm in the legislation that 1 January 1994 shall be the establishment day.  I wish to reiterate the Minister's full intention to appoint 1 January 1994 as the establishment day.  However, it is desirable to retain some flexibility in the event of some unforeseen event. There is nothing sinister in this provision. It is included simply and solely as a safeguard.</P>
      <P>Given the Minister's firm intention to appoint 1 January 1994 as the establishment day and his comments during Committee Stage, I am surprised Deputy Gilmore has retabled his amendment.  In the circumstances, I would ask the Deputy if he would consider withdrawing his amendment.  Further evidence of the Minister's commitment to a 1 January date is the fact that he has already, under existing legislation, fixed the period up to 21 January as the period within which the new county councils are to hold their Estimates meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the question of unforeseen circumstances and I will give some examples.  Possible legal action in relation to certain provisions of the Bill would suggest that a start-up date of 1 January should not be set out in this Bill. Such legal doubts have been raised by representatives of Dublin Corporation in relation to section 35 and the Third Schedule.  While it is extremely likely that such doubts would translate into a legal challenge, it is unwise to absolutely commit the establishment date to a specific <Col N="1801" /> date in the Bill which cannot be altered.</P>
    <P>In relation to legislation generally it is standard practice for the establishment date for a new statutory body to be fixed by order.  This practice has been followed in the preparation of legislation because many unforeseen circumstances may arise.  It is sound practice to follow this long established precedent in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If 1 January is to be the establishment date let us make it clear that that is so.  The type of circumstances referred to by the Minister &mdash; legal challenges, etc. &mdash; can equally occur if the date is set by way of order.  A person can go into court and succeed in having the establishment of the county councils delayed or deferred.  I do not think we can anticipate what might happen in such a situation.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any imminent challenge to the establishment of the county councils although the Minister referred to the possibility of a challenge under section 35.  I am delighted Deputy Broughan joined us as I was beginning to think he was the real Minister for the Environment &mdash; the arguments he made on Committee Stage seem to have made more impact on the Minister than the arguments made by the rest of us.  A challenge under section 35 would not affect the establishment date of the county councils because, under the provisions proposed by the Minister, the transfer of the housing stock will not effectively take place for five years after the enactment of the legislation.  Therefore, if there is a challenge under section 35 Deputy Broughan and his colleagues on Dublin City Council will have five years within which to mount a challenge; it will not require a challenge to the establishment date.  Therefore, the Minister's arguments in this regard are not sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard any substantial opposition to the idea of establishing county councils.  Concern has been expressed, some of which I share, about the workability of large local authorities such as <Col N="1802" /> those proposed.  I made this point during the debate on the 1991 legislation.  The only legal challenge about which the Minister might be worried is the one yesterday to aspects of the Dublin County Development Plan, which is under review, and the possible further challenges to that plan.  I think there might be much more concern about the possibility of legal challenges to the adoption of the development plan and where a January deadline in the legislation would leave that process.  If that is the case then the Minister should state it openly in the House.  If the real story is that the Minister is concerned the county development plan will not be adopted by Christmas, that many developers and land owners will be disappointed if it is not adopted and that a period of time will be allowed after 1 January to enable them to have a second bite at the cherry then the Minister should say so instead of inventing phantom legal challenges which do not exist.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> We had a lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage and I do not propose to repeat all the arguments.  Basically what is at issue is the name of the South Dublin County Council.  Under the Bill the South Dublin County Council will cover an area stretching from the Liffey to Rathfarnham: it will effectively have responsibility for Lucan, part of Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Rathcoole, Clondalkin, and Marley Park.  It is defying the rules of geography to call all that area &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo;.  Obviously part of the area would qualify, by any definition of the term, as South Dublin, but to include areas which have always been regarded as West Dublin defies the English and Irish languages and the basic rules of geography.  It is a nonsense and will cause untold confusion, not only in the new county which will be called South Dublin, but also in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county, much of which is commonly referred to as South County Dublin.  This is a great mistake.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind this proposal was contained in the Barrington report which recommended that the existing Dún Laoghaire Borough should be extended as far as the Stillorgan Road and established as a city and that the remainder of County Dublin should be divided in two by the Liffey, one part of which would be under the control of a north county council, Fingal County Council, and the other part of which would be under the control of a south county council.  In the context of the Barrington report that recommendation made some sense.  However, a different option was taken from the one recommended in the report, that of retaining the three districts established in 1985. Perhaps as a result of an oversight, one of them, the Belgard district, was redefined as the South Dublin district, inheriting the description in the Barrington report.  This happened mainly because Committee Stage debate on the 1991 legislation was guillotined and we did not <Col N="1804" /> have an opportunity to debate in detail the section dealing with the names of the county councils.  If we had had an opportunity to debate that section this current nonsense would not have crept in.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister, in his fair minded way, said he would like to leave the naming of the county councils to the councils themselves.  He put down an amendment which proposes that the councils will have a year during which to ponder their names.  To the best of my knowledge, the Fingal County Council has agreed to retain that name.  Therefore, it is unhelpful to suggest, as the Minister does in his amendment, that this council should rethink its name.  The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council agonised about its name as it is a bit of a mouthful. We toyed with various options and eventually the title Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown grew on us and we decided that we would live with that title.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by introducing his amendment asking us to reconsider this for another year, is unhelpful because it is reopening a debate in the context of that county council that we thought we had resolved and finalised.  In any event, it is not true to say that the county councils are deciding the names of the counties because in many ways the names of the counties were decided in 1991.  Perhaps one could say they were decided in 1985 because that is when the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Fingal idea originated, but South Dublin came into being in 1991.  I know there has been debate on the South Dublin Council about this; I know there is divided opinion on the South Dublin Council about it and that marginally the South Dublin Council came down in favour of retaining the South Dublin name.</P>
    <P>This House has a responsibility to ensure that a county council, which is being established by an Act of the Oireachtas, is not named in a way that makes nonsense of geography, that will cause confusion to the public and cause <Col N="1805" /> confusion in the delivery of services whether it is a public service such as Telecom or An Post, or whatever.  If somebody is sent out in a van to make a delivery in South Dublin they would probably head for the N11; now they will have to head for the N4 and look for the Galway road.  I believe this will cause a great deal of confusion.</P>
    <P>To look at this issue in a practical way, there is a long established local newspaper whose circulation area virtually coincides with the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county.  It was originally called <i>Southside</i> and now it is called <i>Southnews.</i> Will people think that that is the newspaper of the South Dublin County Council? Businesses, for example, that are located in areas like Dundrum, Shankill or any part of south County Dublin which have south County Dublin or south Dublin or southside in their title will now be expected to be found in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  It will cause a great deal of confusion.  It is a great mistake and returning it to the county councils will not resolve the problem.  I certainly do not think that reopening the debate in two of the county councils, where the matter has now been resolved with a degree of finality, is helpful.  The House should decide decisively and in the interests of common sense.</P>

As I said on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage, I feel strongly about keeping the Dublin identity and the concept of Dublin county in the title of the three county councils.  I feel strongly that the heritage, identity and culture of the greater Dublin area should be recognised in naming the new county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said on a number of occasions that it will be up to each local authority finally to decide on a title.  If <Col N="1806" /> that was to be the case the Minister could have left this section blank, we need not have put any name on the new county council.  If we are to propose names in order to get them up and running, let us choose names that are actually meaningful. If the local authorities subsequently want to change the name, let us listen to what they have to say at that stage but let us not start off with a title that is completely meaningless, particularly the South Dublin title.  In that regard I am asking the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I had suggested the title Dublin County of Dún Laoghaire.  I actually find Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to be a mouthful even though I am very familiar with it, having lived in that constituency when it was once called Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown electorally speaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin County of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is not much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The official title that goes in the Bill must recognise it.  I feel strongly about this because I was born and reared in the area.  I have been living outside it for some time.  Perhaps one recognises the importance of these things more than when one is living there all the time.  One can be too familiar with a situation to appreciate it.  I move back from the idea of the Dublin County of Dún Laoghaire, which I would have preferred, to recognise what I thought were the wishes of those living in the area in that they seemed to accept the concept of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of my amendment that I feel most strongly about is the concept of incorporating the expression &ldquo;the Dublin County of ...&rdquo; in the title.  The Dublin County of whatever can be decided if necessary by the local authority concerned but I would like to see a uniform nomenclature.  When we are dividing <Col N="1807" /> County Dublin into three administrative areas the title of the three areas should bear witness to the fact that they are all County Dublin and all originated from the greater Dublin area.  For example, they may call the Dublin County of Fingal &ldquo;Dublin Fingal&rdquo;.  For Dún Laoghaire, I would be quite happy with Dublin South-West but when it comes to officially naming something it is normally longer and more expensive than perhaps we feel it needs to be.</P>
    <P>This is not a laughing matter and these are not frivolous amendments because it is important we start with a name that is actually meaningful.  It is as of much interest to those living outside Dublin as it is to those living in the area, because we are talking about our capital city and at the moment County Dublin represents the county of our capital city and it is very important that we get this right.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in defence of his view and in opposing my view on Committee Stage, referred to the position in Tipperary. County Tipperary is divided into two county councils but the word &ldquo;Tipperary&rdquo; appears in both titles.  In opposing my view and using that example as a defence he was actually supporting the case I was making if he thought about it for long enough.  All I am asking is that we do the same for County Dublin now that we are dividing it into three administrative areas.  What I am saying is logical and it makes the concept of the three new county councils in the greater Dublin area more meaningful.</P>
    <P>The Dublin County of South-West incorporates Deputy Gilmore's amendment and I fully accept that South Dublin is totally meaningless as a description of the area it purports to identify.  It will cause untold confusion in the delivery of any number of services and untold confusion electorally when, for the purposes of general elections, South Dublin will mean something different for local authority elections.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to <Col N="1808" /> seriously accept my amendment, or others that will be moved here today.  Not wishing to reflect at all on the position of the Minister of State present, the frustrating thing about spending hours debating a serious Bill like this is that we do not have the Minister present, as distinct from the Minister of State &mdash; and I respect the fact that the Minister of State present had little choice in the matter. We really do not stand up and make our case with any real hope that the Minister of State will have the authority to accept our amendments.  Quite frankly, the Minister of State comes in here briefed on how to respond to the list of amendments circulated.  With respect, I do not think he has the authority to accept any of the cases we make here this evening and the debate therefore is somewhat of a charade.</P>
    <P>I find the Bill before us too important to have to go through all the histrionics we will go through in this House this evening, the various postures and positions and that when there is a vote the troops will knock-down anyway.  It is all very staged.  The only possibility we have is to try to convince a full Cabinet Minister to accept a point we made, or even to guarantee us that in the course of a Seanad debate he would take on board some or all of the points we make here.  But with respect, the Minister of State present is not in a position to do that, so it is all a little bit of an exercise in nothing.  It might have been simpler had he come in, read all of the briefs onto the record and gone home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am being factual. What is more, the Minister of State knows I am being factual and that I speak from experience of having been a Minister of State.  Indeed, this &ldquo;rent a Minister&rdquo; syndrome runs throughout all Government Departments.  That is not to reflect on the Minister of State at all; it <Col N="1809" /> is a reflection on the way the system operates.  When the Minister is out of town there is a mad flurry to ascertain who will be around, to thrust the script into their hands and wheel them into the House, whether that be the Seanad or here.  That has nothing to do with the Minister of State present and he knows that.  I speak as a person who was used in that way myself as a Minister of State at the very same Department of the Environment, the very same position. Therefore, there is a frustration in terms of the strength of feeling some of us have about the cases we make here and, quite frankly, a general view that the Minister of State is not in a position even to respond by saying he will examine it in the Seanad or revert to us after the Seanad debate.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister of State not to pursue the nomenclature in this Bill, which is really a mongrel version of Barrington's proposal, as was pointed out by Deputy Gilmore.  It appears somebody fell asleep drafting the names now being suggested to us, because they make no sense in terms of the revised Barrington proposal, a sort of North Dublin and South Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>Let us begin with names that are meaningful. I have no problem with the Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown concept. South Dublin causes major problems.  I contend South West Dublin would be far more acceptable.  Let us even offer them South West Dublin to begin with and let the local authority, within 12 months or whatever is suggested, take another look at it.  I am not sure I am with Deputy Gilmore in regard to his major problems with the Minister's amendment.  I would interpret that as meaning that they need review the name and change it only if there are problems.  I do not think it obliges any local authority, bar tabling it on an agenda, to ask whether they are happy with their name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>I would interpret &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that context as meaning to consider the name of the administrative county. That would mean just tabling it on the agenda of a monthly meeting.  Anyway, it does not really matter; it is neither here nor there.  I would not perceive that to be a major problem.  Rather is it the Minister's way of offering us a palliative, saying: &ldquo;Look, I am giving you this.  Will you all be quite over there on the Opposition benches and stop annoying me with this?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is also an admission on the part of the Minister that the homework was not done in regard to the names being proposed in the Bill.  Perhaps he has come a little bit off the road with us. I would ask him to take on board the fears and concerns we articulate here, which represent the views of the people outside this House.  The Minister should make a name for himself and accept what we are saying, even if he has to refer it to the Seanad.  Let us move on this issue, which is more important than it might appear.  It is quite important that we get the title of the administrative areas correct. It is important that we begin from a meaningful title and, if necessary, move from there subsequently.</P>

      <P>South Dublin.  The South Dublin Area Committee has been involved in the transfer of the old Belgard system to the new local authority of South Dublin, which process has been continuing for some time past.  We have published many leaflets, advertisements and communications to ensure that on 1 January next the new local authority will succeed in identifying itself as a new arm <Col N="1811" /> of local government in the Dublin area. We have used the name &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo; extensively in promoting it to constituents of that area.  We have sold it as a new concept and have highlighted it on our notepaper.  Indeed, it has been incorporated into the eventual design of our coat of arms, the Chief Herald having specifically garnered certain information to enable us identify with South Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the matter of South Dublin that have not come before this House.  It has not been explained to this House why we in South Dublin are so adamant to retain &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo; as our name.  I can understand other Deputies' concerns.  Indeed, it is strange that it is representatives of other counties who are concerned about Dublin.  But I must point out that we in South Dublin have gone through the democratic process and have considered a substantial number of options.  We had everybody interested in the name of the new local authority put forward motions which were debated and put to the council for consideration.  Having diligently done that, we eventually discovered through a process of elimination that the majority of members agreed with the name &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo; and wished it carried through to the new local authority.</P>

      <P>People were impassioned.  They were very serious <Col N="1812" /> about the issue and researched it in considerable depth.  Some Fine Gael Members, such as Councillor Muldoon, undertook a great deal of research to bring forward old Irish names to place before us.  Having done all of that, we eventually decided on our name.  It may not be the best or most appropriate name, but it has now been sold to the people of South Dublin as the name of their new local authority.  Belgard was considered, but it was not considered appropriate as this is a small, distinct area within the south county.  The various options were eliminated and we are now left with South Dublin.  We have decided on it.  Were we asked to reconsider it, I am sure the same debate and result would ensue, because anybody who was interested in the name was present on the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There were sufficient to form a quorum.  If there is any suggestion by Deputy Gilmore that something was done undemocratically at that stage, that the decision of that council meeting was not valid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

If we cannot take decisions in the chamber without taking account of those who are not present, then the process will be rendered very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, some difficulties obtain, which I am sure will have to be addressed again.  The provisions of this Bill will enable us to do this.  However, at the end of the day it is only right that the people <Col N="1813" /> of the proposed South County of Dublin should have the right to choose the name of their new local authority.</P>

      <P>In this instance I am in support of Deputy Eamon Walsh, as I said in the course of our Committee Stage debate.  I have no intention of supporting the amendments tabled by my colleagues on this side of the House in this one instance.  I know what we went through in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to arrive at our eventual name.  I know from my colleagues in what will be South Dublin that they went through exactly the same process.  I would defend to the last their right to come up with such an appalling name if that is what they want.  I do not agree with the name and do not consider it to be descriptive of the area.  But I imagine they found themselves between a rock and a hard place in coming up with the name, because I know various names were suggested which were considered to be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Part of the reason is that the area is so vast.  It is not our duty to reverse the democratic decision of councillors.  They are the people who live in the area. Because of the amendment put forward by the Minister they will have the opportunity to change the name.  However if you start with a particular name it is very difficult to change it.  I would not like to start off with that name.  It would not be right for us to suggest a name.  If we are to be totally descriptive the name would have to cover Dublin south, Dublin south-west and Dublin west.</P>
      <P>It does not give me any pleasure to be unable to support my colleagues.  In the interests of local democracy we should stay with the decision of the people involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment because it shows that he is taking cognisance of what was said during the various stages of the Bill where there were differences of opinion regarding the names of some of the new council areas. <Col N="1814" /> I welcome the decision to give to the local council the opportunity to change the name of the administrative county within the next 12 months.  I do not believe that will happen.  I do not think it would be in the interests of the people of the various administrative areas that that should be done.  Legislation in this area was introduced in 1985.  The 1991 legislation put in place the various area committees, including the Fingal area committee and the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area committee. The people in the Fingal area have become accustomed to the name, which is being used in correspondence and documentation.  While Deputy Doyle has acknowledged that she does not have a difficulty with the name Fingal County Council, but I take issue with her amendment suggesting that the title should be Dublin County of Fingal.  She also said that the people should be identified with the Dublin area.  The people in what will become the Fingal County Council area have a clear identity which not only takes on board the traditions and history of Fingal but has also taken on board the new areas of Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  We have also to look at the seals of the new councils which have been accepted.  In the case of Fingal it is Flúirse talaimh is mara &mdash; riches in sea and on ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion gives an indication of the problem which has existed from the start in the division of Dublin into the various counties.  There is a certain historic resonance, as Deputy Sean Ryan has so eloquently expressed, in the area of Fingal, this land of the &ldquo;fair-haired foreigner&rdquo;, which was one of the first areas of the old English invaders. Fingal has a long resonance in the history of Dublin; so too has the name &ldquo;Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown&rdquo;.  In many respects the problem is most noticeable in &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo;&mdash; hence the basis of Deputy Gilmore's amendment in relation to South-West Dublin.  I accept what my colleague, Deputy Eamonn Walsh &mdash; who incidentally is chairperson of the South Dublin area &mdash; has said on the work that has been done to research the area of South Dublin but there can be no doubt that the ambience of such areas which encompass great historic settlements such as Clondalkin, Tallaght and parts of Lucan is not reflected adequately in the title.  It may well be that &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo; is a name that will logically be accepted from this period onwards but that remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic point is that responsibility for naming the area must rest with the people and their representatives.  I hope that within a year historical societies in the general area of Tallaght and Clondalkin <Col N="1817" /> will consider the debate in this House and make representations on the final decision, if indeed there has to be a final decision, on the name of the new county council.</P>
    <P>I believe that major parts of the Dublin region should have their own council and this Bill does not address that aspect of the issue.  However, I am happy that under the proposed name we do have Dublin in the title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> We certainly have had a wide-ranging overview of Dublin.  I suppose for the first time ever a procedure involving public consultation is set out in section 9 for the new county councils to promote a change in the name of their counties.  This is as it should be because it is a local issue best decided by local people.  Furthermore the ministerial amendment No. 13 obliges the new county councils to consider the question of their names during 1994 without prejudice to anything they might decide to do in future years.  This will ensure that the points raised in this debate will be considered by the local authorities themselves in the first year of their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is consequential on amendment No. 13 and makes the consideration of the county name a reserve function.  It would, of course, be open to the new county councils to sound out public opinion as to the county name by way of surveys or other means under powers conferred by the Local Government Act, 1991.  As has been stated by different speakers, there were certainly many different viewpoints.  The local authorities themselves considered the question of the name of the new counties and none of the area committees made proposals to change the name of the new council.  Neither did Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire Corporation do so in their formal submissions to the Minister on the reorganisation report. This is a matter that should be left to the councils themselves and the Bill does that.  I do not think it is a matter for <Col N="1818" /> the national parliament to intervene and impose solutions on local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the national parliament is not intervening and imposing a solution on the local community why is any name included in the Bill?  If the names of the county councils are written into the legislation which is being enacted through the Oireachtas it is being imposed, albeit with the saver that the county councils themselves can go through the exercise of consulting the public and trying to come to a conclusion on the issue.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with Deputy Broughan's criticism of the format we eventually arrived at for the reorganisation of local government in Dublin. They very much echo the criticisms I made during the passage of the 1991 legislation through the House.  I argued that it would be better if the system of local government was organised around identifiable areas, communities with which people could identify, for example, having local authorities the size of the existing Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation. I think people could identify with councils such as the Tallaght council, Blanchardstown council and other such area councils.  In my opinion it was possible to develop in Dublin a network of ten to 12 such councils with a greater Dublin council which would pull the whole lot together.  That is the way we should have gone but it was not organised in that way in 1991 when the issue was decided by the Oireachtas and we now have to live with that fact and to work within it now.</P>

    <P>The enthusiasm I spoke about earlier within the three new county councils for getting on with the job stems more from the frustration with the existing set-up in Dublin County Council than from any sense of belief that the new system is the most perfect solution to be adopted. Nevertheless there is a pragmatic sense that the system should be worked but the fact that we are having a debate on the <Col N="1819" /> names supports very strongly the points Deputy Broughan was making that the new bodies lack an identity.  I accept that there is a very strong sense of identify in the Fingal area, as Deputy Ryan says, but I am not so sure if that is shared entirely by the people who live out in Blanchardstown whose area will become part of this new county council and I do not know whether they identify themselves as Fingalians.</P>
    <P>Because there is a Dáil constituency called Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown we have a concept that can be built on, but it is no more than that because Rathdown was a barony which stretched down into north Wicklow and the new area does not exactly correspond with the existing Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown boundaries.  I wish to put the following scenario to the Minister to see how he proposes to resolve the problem.  It is proposed in ministerial amendment No. 13 that the council of a county established by section 11:</P>
    <P>...shall, not later than one year after the establishment day consider the question of the name of its administrative county.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That will appear at some stage on the agenda of a meeting of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I recall very distinctly the discussions we had over several meetings in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area committee on the name of the new county.  We did not have a division but arrived at a consensus that as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was the name of the legislation and was the name for the district committee prior to that, it was a case of making do but in the course of the discussion there was a very serious proposal tabled that the name of the county council should be &ldquo;South County Dublin&rdquo;.  There was a very strong body of opinion on the area committee that this should be the name of the new county council.  It was suggested that we should try to tic-tac with the <Col N="1820" /> county council that officially is going to be called the South Dublin County Council to elicit their views.  The Minister has outlined that we will go back to the people to consult them on their views and have people writing in making submissions and so on.  It may well happen that when this comes back on the agenda the citizens and members of what is now to be called Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown council will conclude that the name of that county council should be the South County Dublin County Council.  What will the Minister do then?  The matter should be decided by the Oireachtas to avoid confusion.  My proposition is not far-fetched.  I genuinely believe that when this appears on the agenda, it is likely to generate confusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eamon Walsh tells us that the people in what will be called the South Dublin County Council are getting used to the idea.  However, the people of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown and the people who live in what is generally termed south County Dublin have not come to terms with this and, indeed, many of them have not heard of the idea that what is west now in the county will now be called south county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">

      <P>We did promote it.  It is quite possible that this dilemma will arise.  The Minister, with all the powers he is reserving to make regulations and give orders and directions has decided that far from allowing the people of County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown or South Dublin or Fingal to decide on the names of these county councils, he will have a man from Tipperary and a man from Wexford deciding it.  That is not logical democracy.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I raised this matter, unfortunately, the Minister was not present and it is regrettable that he is not present again tonight. Nevertheless, I am sure I will receive good news from the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.  The provision of a kidney dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital has been on the agenda since 1985.  On 15 April of that year a deputation from the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was received by the <Col N="1823" /> health committee of Kerry County Council whose members gave the association its unanimous support for the provision of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  In July 1986 a deputation from the Irish Kidney Association attended a meeting of the General Hospitals Committee. At that meeting the deputation gave a commitment that if a decision was made to go ahead with a satellite unit at Tralee General Hospital it would collect further funds for a water filtration system and would be willing to provide money through fund raising for replacement of equipment.</P>
      <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was established in October 1984 and collected £90,000 within a few months.  In response to the meeting of July 1986 Mr. Christy Walsh, then programme manager of the Southern Health Board, informed the branch in March 1987 that the Department of Health had indicated that it would not be in a position to provide funds for the running of the proposed dialysis unit.  Before the 1987 general election definite commitments were made by public representatives in Kerry that a dialysis unit would be provided if Fianna Fáil was returned to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1989 the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was received by the Southern Health Board in Cork where it was given further assurances and commitments regarding the provision of the dialysis unit.  In reply to a motion at the Southern Health Board meeting in June 1982, Mr. Pat Madden, acting programme manager, replied that the Department of Health had approved the setting up of a Protocol team to discuss the funding of such a unit.  The report of that committee, when completed, was circulated to health board members.  It detailed the costs and setting up of the unit in the Ratoo ward in Tralee General Hospital.  The Protocol team estimated that the start-up cost would be £189,000 and that the annual cost of running the unit would be in the region of £351,000. <Col N="1824" /> Therefore, the total first year cost would be approximately £540,000.  I understand that since then these figures have been revised downwards and that it will cost considerably less to provide the unit in Tralee.</P>
    <P>In July 1992 the County Kerry Branch of the Irish Kidney Association was requested by Mr. Pat Madden to raise a further £84,000 to cover the cost of the water treatment unit to which the branch agreed.  They are actively fund-raising at present and by Christmas they hope to have their contribution of £174,000 collected. It is now up to the Minister to respond.</P>
    <P>In early November 1992 Dr. John O'Connell, then Minister for Health, gave Senator Tom Fitzgerald a verbal commitment that he would provide £140,000 in the 1993 subvention to the Southern Health Board to fund the unit. Before the November general election Dr. John O'Connell informed Deputy John O'Donoghue of Kerry South that the development of a dialysis service at Tralee General Hospital was included in developments for consideration for funding in the 1993 Health Estimates.</P>
    <P>On 7 April last in this House the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, in reply to a matter I raised with him stated that his Department was discussing with the Southern Health Board the provision of a dialysis unit in Tralee in the context of the board's 1993 service development plans.  What developments have taken place since 7 April?  Will the Minister indicate whether the necessary funding will be provided in 1994?  How long more must unfortunate patients in need of dialysis treatment in County Kerry wait for a service in Tralee?  For many of them it is a matter of life and death.  Seven patients have to travel to Cork for dialysis treatment on a weekly basis along bad roads and five patients are on home dialysis. These five patients would use the unit in Tralee if it was provided.  Patients in County Kerry in need of dialysis treatment who have to travel to Cork devote <Col N="1825" /> their entire lives to dialysis leaving home at 6 a.m. and returning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. three days a week with rest days in between.  This situation could be changed dramatically with the provision of a unit in Tralee.  Units were opened in Sligo and Letterkenny with two patients and these numbers have since grown.</P>
    <P>Dr. Murnaghen of Cork Regional Hospital has suggested that medical cover could be arranged in co-operation with Dr. D'Arcy of Tralee General Hospital. The appointment of a nephrology senior registrar at Cork Regional Hospital would enable this to be done with supervision with a monthly nephrology clinic at Tralee Kerry General Hospital being part of his duties.</P>
    <P>The County Kerry Branch of the Irish Kidney Association has received verbal support from all public representatives in County Kerry as well as written support from two Ministers for the provision of a kidney dialysis unit in Tralee provided they can come up with local funding.  It has raised £174,000.  It is now up to the Government to make a decision.  I appeal to the Minister for Health, the Tánaiste and all concerned to provide this unit in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter and for presenting an opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the establishment of dialysis services at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on previous occasions that he is very much aware of the needs of dialysis patients in County Kerry and elsewhere.  However, it is important to stress this again and to make it clear that the Minister hopes to see the establishment of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital as soon as resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter in the first <Col N="1826" /> instance for the Southern Health Board which must have regard to its competing service priorities and the resources at its disposal.  On a general note, the Deputy will be well aware also that there are many competing priorities within the health services nationally and that difficult decisions have to be made if we are to provide the people of Ireland with the best possible health service in an effective and equitable way.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the provision of dialysis facilities at the hospital must be looked at in the context of the board's overall priorities and in the context of its priorities for Tralee General Hospital.  Over the past few years, the Southern Health Board has identified certain service and equipment requirements as priorities for Tralee General Hospital.  In this regard, the Minister is pleased to say that his Department was in a position to make extra funds available in 1992 and in 1993 for the development of ear, nose and throat services at the hospital and that extra resources were allocated to the hospital this year for additional orthopaedic operations under the waiting list initiative.  The Deputy might also be aware that substantial capital funds have been approved in recent weeks for the purchase of anaesthetic and monitoring equipment for Tralee General Hospital. This approval was of great importance to the hospital.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Minister hopes to see the establishment of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital as soon as resources allow.  In this regard, the development of a dialysis service at Tralee General Hospital will be considered for funding in the context of the overall funds available to him in 1994.</P>

      <P>It has been decided to provide a second level school in Dunboyne. This was originally decided in 1986 by a former Minister for Education, <Col N="1827" /> Gemma Hussey.  The negotiations to purchase a site were commenced by another former Minister for Education, Paddy Cooney.  This decision was suspended in 1987 but was reactivated by Deputy Noel Davern when Minister for Education.  It was confirmed to a deputation from Dunboyne by the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, during the summer.  Indeed, the deputation was led to believe that there would be rapid progress in building the school.</P>
      <P>The problem now is that the Minister is saying she is not going to make a decision on the management structure for the school other than in the context of the White Paper on Education.  As we are aware from the lengthy discussions that took place at the Convention on Education at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham recently, the issues involved in this White Paper are extremely complex and it may be some time before the details are finalised at Cabinet level.  It would be a disaster for Dunboyne if the decision on the management structure for the school was to be held up until the White Paper is finalised.  At this stage it is impossible for the Minister, or anybody else, to foresee how long it will take the Government, or indeed, any Government to reach final decisions on this issue. I know from experience in preparing a White Paper for Government that it always takes about a year longer than expected and that is an under-statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that if a decision on the management structure for the Dunboyne school is not taken no progress can be made.  There is a proposal before the Minister from the Catholic bishop to provide a diocesan school.  The bishop owns a site which he is prepared to provide free for such a school.  He is also prepared to provide a contribution towards the cost of the building.  If the Minister is willing to make a decision now and not wait for the White Paper she will be able to allow work on the school to start straightway because she will not have to provide any <Col N="1828" /> money to buy a site as it will be provided free.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if she waits she may have to buy the site eventually, if she decides to go for the community school option, but either way by postponing the decision on the management structure she is postponing the decision on the acquisition of a site.  As we are all aware, the first thing one has to do is to make sure one has a site for the building.  Until the issue of the management structure is decided the issue of the site cannot be decided and without a decision on the issue of the site nothing can be done.  It is my hope in raising this issue that I will able to persuade the Minister of State at the Department of Education to agree that the Minister should accept the proposal for a diocesan school.</P>
    <P>I am aware that arguments will be advanced against this on the grounds that the people of Dunboyne will be denied the opportunity to go for other options but I should point out that a community college is available to pupils from Dunboyne in Dunshaughlin, that a community school will be available in Ashbourne while there is a vocational education committee managed school in Maynooth.  The nearest diocesan or voluntary secondary school available to Dunboyne people is in the centre of the city of Dublin or in Navan or Trim.  There is, in fact, a wider choice of other management structures available closer to Dunboyne than of diocesan management structures.  In providing a diocesan managed school in Dunboyne the Department of Education would be simply providing a better range of choices for people in the Dunboyne area.</P>
    <P>Most important is the urgency of starting to build.  There are pupils who, literally, will have nowhere to go in September unless this school is started.  I have on my books, so to speak, in my capacity as a local TD, a child who left school in particular circumstances and now cannot be admitted anywhere in the area.  No school is prepared to take this <Col N="1829" /> child because he happens to be over the age of 15.  That is just one example of the sort of situation that is current in Dunboyne.  There are parents who just do not know where they can send their children next September.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could agree to accept a diocesan structure, the site is there and it would be possible, if necessary, to erect prefabricated buildings there to cater for an initial class from next September, pending the building of a 400-pupil school.  If, on the other hand, the Minister holds back until a White Paper is produced and makes no decision on the management structure, nothing very much can be done about the site apart from considerable expenditure by the Department and it will probably be impossible to cope with the problems next September.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House now that a decision is being taken.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make, if I am not trespassing on the time of the House, is in regard to the Estimates that have been agreed by the Cabinet.  We do not know how much is available for school building next year, but the Minister does. The Minister knows if she can provide this school.  I believe she can and that we will hear news here tonight that the Minister has agreed to a diocesan school. If that is the case, work can commence very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Bruton for raising the matter and I acknowledge the efforts he has constantly made to have this matter resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dunboyne is located within the greater Dublin post-primary catchment area for accommodation and full transport purposes. In general, post-primary pupils from the Dunboyne area attend Dunshaughlin community college, Coolmine community school and Maynooth vocational school.  Other second level schools which cater for pupils leaving primary schools in Dunboyne are the <Col N="1830" /> Dominican Convent, Cabra; St. Declan's CBS, Navan Road, and schools in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in August 1991, consultants from the service industries research centre of UCD were commissioned to undertake an independent study in the Huntstown-Hartstown - Dunboyne - Castleknock areas in order to determine whether a new second level school was required in the area and, if so, the required size and most appropriate location.  The findings of the study indicated that there was an immediate need for a new post-primary school in Hartstown, to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne.  Accordingly, priority was given to the new school in Hartstown which was subsequently opened in September 1992, when accommodation for approximately 100 pupils was provided.  The remainder of the required accommodation at Hartstown is being provided in two phases.  It is intended that the school will eventually provide a total of about 1,000 pupil places.</P>
    <P>In relation to a possible site for the second level school for Dunboyne, the suitability of the former Good Shepherd Convent, Dunboyne, for the establishment of a secondary school under diocesan trusteeship was considered initially.  Following architectural assessment of the building it was decided not to pursue this proposal.  A site, adjacent to Dunboyne community centre and in the ownership of the diocese is considered a suitable location for the proposed new school.</P>
    <P>It was expected that the new school would be a community type school and accordingly an offer was made to the Catholic Bishop of Meath, Dr. Smith, for the purchase of the site.  In response to the offer for the site, Dr. Smith seemed to indicate his preference for a diocesan secondary school.  Department officials met the Bishop subsequently and he confirmed this interest.</P>
    <P>The significance of the type of management <Col N="1831" /> for the school with regard to the site is that in the case of a community type school the site would be acquired by the Department whereas with a secondary school the diocesan authorities would be responsible for the provision of the site.</P>
    <P>The question of the type of management for the proposed school is under consideration in the context of the White Paper on Education.  No final decision has yet been taken.  It is not anticipated that there will be any undue delay in the matter.  I accept that time is of the essence in this case and that the issue of the site should be settled as soon as possible.  I will ask the Minister for an early response to the Deputy's submission.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom anocht cúpla focal a rá ar Scoil Pheig Sayers i gCorcaigh i mo dháilcheantar atá i mbaol dúnadh.  The Minister for Education has refused to designate the school as being in a disadvantaged area.  I cannot understand the Minister's decision because the school is seriously overcrowded.  The conditions are so bad that three children were withdrawn from the school in recent times.  Previously there were 92 pupils in the school.  Níl ach 89 daltaí ann anois. Tension is running high because of the situation there.  First, second and third classes are in a tiny room which allows only 9.5 square feet per pupil, whereas the Department of Education guidelines require space per child, excluding furniture, to amount to 15 square feet per child.  Fourth, fifth and sixth classes are in another tiny room and because of conditions there children are falling behind in their school performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers there are very committed. I and other TDs in my constituency, a Minister and school inspectors, have visited the school and have all expressed dismay that the situation prevailing there could be allowed <Col N="1832" /> to exist.  The school has an extra empty room, courtesy of Na Piarsaigh Hurling and Football Club and if they had an extra teacher, appointed under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the situation could be defused and the school could operate as normal, learning and teaching could take place in a healthy environment.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has refused to designate the school as being in a deprived area because the north side of Cork city has been designated as an area of disadvantage due to high unemployment and other adverse circumstances.  Thirteen schools on the North side have been granted disadvantaged status by the Department and have the extra teachers they are entitled to because of that status.</P>
    <P>In the school in question the involvement and commitment of the parents and teachers must be seen to be believed.  The Gaelscoil is disadvantaged to a far greater extent than any other school that I am aware of and the Christian Brother who is chairman of the board, the teachers and parents are fully committed to the survival of the school.  The school authorities have made several attempts to have the school recognised as being in a disadvantaged area and have submitted all the relevant data which show that 58 per cent of the parents are unemployed and 67 per cent of them live in local authority housing.  They also qualify in the context of the other parameters set up by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Gaelscoileanna in Cork city have been a huge success, despite the obstacles and challenges they have faced to date.  However, parents are becoming increasingly disillusioned and teachers are under pressure because there is a danger the school may fold up and there is no alternative vacant building in the area.  They are tied to that building which has an extra room and could facilitate an additional teacher which would relieve some of the pressure.  At a time when <Col N="1833" /> there is so much talk about spending money on Teilifís na Gaeilge, we should also acknowlege that the future of the Irish language lies in the development of the language at primary school level.  The greatest medium for preserving and developing our language is through our primary schools and I appeal to the Minister to make a positive decision in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>Where access to education services is concerned, I regard any individual or group as being disadvantaged if, for socio-economic reasons or because of handicap or disability, they are in any way impeded in participating in and benefiting fully from the normally available range of educational services.</P>
      <P>There is abundant evidence that educational qualifications or the lack of them determine to a large extent the life chances of our young people.  The likelihood of obtaining educational qualifications is closely associated with social background and the children of socio-economically deprived groups constitute a majority of those who do not benefit from the educational system.</P>
      <P>The link between educational deprivation and unemployment is clear.  The majority of those who are long-term unemployed have few or no educational qualifications, have left school early and have not benefited from the educational system.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that education plays an indirect but important part in the perpetuation of poverty.  The children of deprived groups are themselves most likely to leave the educational system early, to experience unemployment and to have limited chances.  Thus, the cycle of deprivation is perpetuated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the breaking of this cycle of deprivation as one of the single greatest challenges facing our education system.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, to note that concrete measures have been taken <Col N="1834" /> in the current year to contribute to this process with the firm backing of all my colleagues in the Government, whose commitment to this area is strongly reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme plays an important part in our initiatives to break the cycle of deprivation by early intervention at primary school level. Schools included in this scheme not only receive extra teaching posts but qualify for a supplementary capitation grant at a rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
    <P>I am pleased it has been possible to allocate a further 68 posts to this scheme in the current year which facilitated the inclusion of 50 new schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This brings the total number of schools in this scheme to 258, embracing 76,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>A further £100,000 has been made available in supplementary capitation grant supports to schools identified as having significant levels of socio-economic disadvantage, but which did not rate high enough for a concessionary post.  In addition, a sum of £250,000 has also been made available this year to alleviate the burden of certain schools in disadvantaged areas who are in severe financial crisis.</P>
    <P>The home-school community liaison scheme has been further extended by 15 co-ordinator posts, bringing the total number of schools in this scheme to 106 at primary level with the services of 60 co-ordinators embracing 34,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>The procedure for selecting schools for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme have, to date, been based on a range of socio-economic criteria agreed by a working party comprised of representatives of the Department of Education, the INTO and schools' management.</P>
    <P>The factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the <Col N="1835" /> views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year all primary schools not already in the scheme were invited to apply for inclusion in the scheme and to submit relevant data based on these criteria.  The applicant schools were assessed and given priority in order of need.  I regret that the school referred to by the Deputy did not rate highly enough for inclusion on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The question of a further expansion of <Col N="1836" /> the scheme to embrace additional schools is being kept under review and the needs of all schools, including the one mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>Three investigations, in the course of the year, have resulted in the seizure of angel dust.  Summonses have issued in 10 other cases involving the use of Clenbuterol. In addition a further 7 such cases are being examined by my Department with a view to instituting proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 207 live animals and 129 carcases were found to have been treated with Clenbuterol this year.  All carcases have been condemned and legal proceedings <Col N="1585" /> are in train for the destruction of the live animals in order to ensure that they will not enter the human food chain.</P>
    <P>Last April the High Court held, in a case concerning a challenge to the regulations controlling the use of veterinary medicinal products, that the regulations were invalid in so far as they purported to extend the period under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act during which legal proceedings may be instituted.  This provision relied on section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972, which the High Court found to be unconstitutional in so far as it provided for the amendment of statute law by Ministerial regulation in specified circumstances.  That decision was appealed to the Supreme Court which has reversed the High Court decision.  In so far as the veterinary medicines regulations are concerned, the effect of this decision means that cases which were suspended or in doubt pending the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal will now go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision has restored certainty into the whole area of secondary legislation implementing EC law.  In so far as the application of measures to deal with the use of illegal growth promoters is concerned the action taken by my Department to meet our obligations has been vindicated.</P>
    <P>Since 1 October, 1993, the illegal use of growth promoters is addressed under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993.  This legislation, enacted by the Oireachtas, gives me extensive powers in relation to the availability and use of animal remedies. I am satisfied that the provisions of this legislation give adequate powers to tackle this problem effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 25, 63, 88, 90, 96, 176 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>In response to an item raised on the Dáil Adjournment on 10 November I outlined the requirements of the EC regulations with regard to the identification of agricultural land parcels in the context of administration and control of the premium schemes and the arable area payments schemes flowing from the CAP reform.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the EC rules for the various premium and disadvantaged areas headage schemes and the arable area payment schemes are complied with in 1994, farmers are required to submit a map or maps showing the boundaries of the holding as well as the boundaries of each plot on the holding.  The maps are required to help identify and locate the areas of land being farmed as submitted in the area aid application which applicants for various EU premia and headage grants have to submit.  In the livestock sector, the necessity to submit the area aid application is linked to the stocking density provision under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes and under all disadvantaged areas headage schemes.  In 1993 I succeeded in confining the requirement to submit maps to arable aid applicants only but, from 1994 on, maps are required from all applicants for headage and premia payments who are obliged to submit area aid applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal requirement is that farmers must submit with their area aid applications Ordnancy Survey maps on the 25 <Col N="1588" /> inches to the mile scale in all areas for which maps on this scale are available. Maps on the 6 inches to the mile scale will be acceptable from farmers who are already in possession of such maps and from those in areas where 25 inch scale maps are not available.  In addition, official Land Registry maps already in the possession of farmers will be accepted with 1994 area aid applications.  I have had to point out to farmers that I have been advised by the Land Registry that they cannot guarantee delivery by the 1994 area aid application deadline of 31 March 1994 of any Land Registry maps ordered from them now other than those required for normal land transactions.</P>
    <P>Arising from my concern about the position of farmers who require more than one map to cover their holdings, the Ordnance Survey office has made arrangements to reduce the financial burden of map purchase for such farmers.</P>
    <P>The following special arrangements are in place for farmers needing maps: £25 for the first map; £12.50 each for the second, third and fourth map; £12.50 each for additional maps where an individual farmer can provide proof that his/her holding extends over additional Ordnance Survey sheets; and £2 postage to cover all these maps.</P>
    <P>These revised fees apply to all orders in connection with area aid applications submitted to Ordnance Survey before 15 December next.  The new arrangements mean that the price for any maps required by a farmer over and above the first is reduced by 50 per cent.  All of the revised prices have to be compared with the normal charge of £42.  Help is available to farmers in Teagasc offices to identify the sheet numbers of their map requirements and maps may be ordered through these offices.</P>
    <P>Where Ordnance Survey or Land Registry maps are out of date &mdash; this can happen with changes in field boundaries etc., which take place all the time &mdash; livestock producers will have to do in 1994 what the arable aid producers had to do this year.  They will have to amend the maps to reflect the up-to-date posicine <Col N="1589" /> tion before submitting them with their area aid applications.</P>
    <P>The Department needs to have confidence in the accuracy of any maps submitted. They need to be legible and true to scale.  Photocopies frequently are not. Thus, we require original Ordnance Survey or official certified Land Registry maps.</P>
    <P>Farmers who submitted maps with their area aid applications in 1993 need not submit maps again with their 1994 and future applications where there are no changes in the land farmed in 1994. Those submitting maps with their 1994 area aid applications need not submit maps with their 1995 and future applications if there are no changes in the areas declared by them in those years. Even where such changes take place the only maps that need to be submitted will be those covering the parts of their holdings that are changed.  This means that the outlay arising from the purchase of maps will benefit the vast majority of farmers over a number of subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has to be remembered that the value of the various EC premium and headage schemes to Irish farmers in the future will be of the order of £500 million to £600 million per year and that we must be prepared to meet EU requirements if these payments are to be guaranteed.</P>

      <P>To date, in 1993, £16.9 million has been paid to farmers in aid under the farm improvement programme.  I expect that between now and the end of the year a further £3 million will be paid and this should clear all outstanding payment claims up to late November 1993.

Furthermore, it is the practice of my Department to review the control system periodically and, as a result, it has been regularly adjusted and, indeed, in the past few years has been fundamentally overhauled.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 51, 68 and 80 together.  Eligibility under the scheme whereby some 5.3 million gallons of milk will be distributed free of charge was based on two broad criteria: (i) economic dependence on milk production as evidenced by size of quota and of holding and level of off-farm income and (ii) commitment to milk production as evidence by past purchase or lease of additional quota and proportion of quota delivered in recent years.  The detailed conditions chosen as fulfilling those two criteria were designed to ensure that they could be readily applied by the applicant's co-op or dairy and that successful applicants would obtain a meaningful quantity of additional quota.</P>
      <P>In relation to the size of holding, the basic requirement is that the producer's holding should not be more than 70 acres. Recognising however that there are producers whose holdings exceed 70 acres but who, because of the poor quality of the land, are nonetheless small scale producers, I made special provision for acceptance of holdings of over 70 acres provided these producers derive at least 75 per cent of their farm income from milk production.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 58, 78 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>There are satisfactory appeal arrangements within the Department open to farmers who are not satisfied with decisions on applications for premium and headage grants.  The Department is the competent national authority for implementing the premium and headage schemes and, as such, must take all decisions relating to payment or refusal of payment under those schemes &mdash; it cannot delegate this function to a separate appeals body.</P>
      <P>It can and does however take into account all elements of cases made on behalf of applicants by those applicants or their public representatives or their farm organisations or by their solicitors, accountants or agricultural consultants. It also takes into account the views of the Ombudsman in relation to any cases referred to him.</P>

Details of its main features are contained in the National Development Plan which was published in October.  In summary, these provide for a comprehensive development programme aimed at achieving the output and employment targets recommended by the expert group and involving substantial financial assistance in the areas of capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and training.</P>

With this in mind I will be giving the highest priority to developing the food industry and to such on-farm investment measures as those involving dairy hygiene improvement and pollution control.</P>
      <P>Considerable support will also be made available in the form of headage payments in support of the incomes of farmers in the disadvantaged areas and for various rural development measures. Both of these elements are important in maintaining people in farming and securing employment in our rural areas.</P>
      <P>In the past significant resources have been put into land drainage activities but these could not now be considered to be in the same priority categories for Structural Funding as those I have outlined. I will, however, be keeping the position with regard to the Structural Funds under review and, should further finance become available, it may be possible to consider support for some elements of drainage.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to measures aimed at increasing greater land mobility.  To this end modifications have been introduced, over the past two years, in the Young Farmer Installation Aid Scheme, whereby leased land can be taken into account in assessing eligibility.  I am continuing <Col N="1604" /> to review the scheme in the context of the next round of Structural Funds and hope to be able to announce further changes shortly.</P>
      <P>I expect the European Commission to give formal approval very shortly to my proposals for the implementation of the EC early retirement scheme for farmers. My hope at this stage is to have the scheme in operation early in the New Year.  This scheme provides for the payment of a pension, of up to £8,780, at current rates, to farmers between 55 and 66 years of age who retire from farming and transfer their farms by sale, lease or gift to younger qualified transferees.</P>
      <P>I believe that the early retirement scheme, in conjunction with the installation aid scheme should, overall, improve the opportunities for young farmers seeking to enter farming.</P>

      <P>The appeals panel completed its detailed analysis of areas seeking inclusion in the disadvantaged areas and presented its recommendations to me on 3 August.

      <P>As the proposal for extension represents in excess of 1.5 per cent of the area of the country, the procedure is that, if the Commission accepts it, it will make a detailed proposal to the Council which must consult with the European Parliament before making the final decision. I am confident that the cost of any extension agreed by the Council will be met from within the EU and national resources provided under the National Development Plan 1994-1999.</P>

      <P>Tax clearance is applied to all persons applying for grants, subsidies and similar type payments in excess of £500 from the State and public authorities.  In the case of payments between £500 and £5,000, the applicant is required to furnish his tax reference number, to indicate the tax office dealing with his affairs and to confirm that, to the best of his knowledge, <Col N="1611" /> his tax affairs are in order.  In the case of payments of £5,000 or more, the applicant is required to furnish a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Tax clearance procedures are to be extended to disadvantaged areas headage payments from 1 January 1994.  This was originally intended for introduction in March 1992 but an extension was granted to allow farmers time to obtain tax reference numbers.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the tax clearance procedures have been adapted specifically to accommodate those applicants for headage payments who do not have an RSI number for tax purposes but who are also receiving a means-tested social welfare payment.  Under the adapted scheme, an applicant for headage payments of between £500 and £5,000 will be able to quote the RSI number under which the means tested social welfare payments are made.  This adaptation will deal with the concerns raised in the Deputy's question in relation to small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Proposals were received by me earlier this year from the Minister for Health concerning measures which might be taken to control Giant Hogweed.  The Minister for Health proposed a broad range of measures, including the eradication of the plant on their <Col N="1612" /> own property by land and fishery owners, including the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative for a broadly based approach to the management and control of the problems posed by the spread of Giant Hogweed. The Office of Public Works will cooperate with the general plan of action to control the spread of the plant, envisaged by the Minister.  The Office has monitored and chemically treated outbreaks of the plant on its property in recent years and will continue to do so. The Office would also support and cooperate with any programme for further research of the problem and for the systematic control and eradication of the plant that may be devised.</P>
      <P>Measures being taken to date by the Office of Public Works are implemented as part of the Officer's overall operation for the maintenance and management of waterways and drainage schemes under its control and separate costings for this aspect of the work are not available.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works will continue to deal with the problem as long as it is necessary to do so but it is not possible to say what timescale will be involved since the eradication of the Giant Hogweeds will depend on all owners of affected property dealing with it thoroughly.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the increasing role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in providing support for the housing costs of those who are unable to secure local authority housing or who are unable to provide for their housing needs from their own resources.  In this context, an interdepartmental group has been established with representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance at which matters of common concern in relation to rent and mortgage supplementation and housing policy are regularly discussed.</P>
      <P>In 1992 I established an Advisory Group, under the chairmanship of my Department, with representatives from the eight regional health boards, to review all aspects of the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The group is currently working on a review of the guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation.  In the context of revising the guidelines I am concerned to ensure an equitable and effective system of provision for people who need assistance with housing costs, in the context of State provision for housing needs generally.</P>

      <P>The application by the company concerned to participate as a private bus operator in my Department's free travel scheme has been given careful consideration. In assessing this application, my Department had to take a number of factors into account.  These included an examination of the level of bus services currently available to free travel scheme customers in the region, the question of whether there is a need to provide a greater level of such services having regard to customers needs, the possible effects on existing operator services and the financial resources available under the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>In July 1993, it was decided that the needs of the Department's free travel passengers would best be served by inviting tenders from licensed bus operators for the routes covered in the company's application.  A number of tenders were received by the closing date &mdash; 31 August 1993 &mdash; including a tender from the company in question.  Each tender had to be carefully examined to compare the tendered price for each bus route against the frequency and quality of service being offered.  It was necessary also to verify each tendering company's compliance with licensing and tax clearance requirements.</P>
      <P>It is expected that a decision will be made very shortly.  All of the bus operators who submitted tenders, including the company concerned, will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free electricity allowance scheme is intended to provide additional comfort for old age or incapacitated pensioners who live alone or with certain dependants by encouraging them to use adequate electricity for cooking, light, hot water and room heating.</P>
      <P>The scheme covers a person's normal electricity standing charges and up to 1,500 standard units of electricity each year &mdash; up to 200 units in each bimonthly billing period in summer and 300 units of electricity in each bimonthly billing period in winter.  Up to 600 unused free units may be carried forward for offset against electricity usage in any subsequent billing period.  Many recipients carry forward their unused summer allocation of units to provide extra comfort for themselves in the winter season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mainly for administrative reasons, the allowance does not cover the ESB &ldquo;Nightsaver&rdquo; system of electricity supply <Col N="1618" /> at a reduced unit tariff which is used for night storage heating.  However, I am aware that the use of night storage heaters ia an economical way of providing comfortable background heating during the daytime.  Such a heating system can be of considerable benefit in reducing the risk of hypothermia, particularly for older people.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the ESB, I am considering the best way by which the scheme might be extended so as to cover electricity usage for night storage heaters.  An extension of the scheme in this way could have expenditure implications and would have to be decided in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As I stated to the House on 25 November, a UK registered company applied to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and was granted specific permits under the Occasional Trading Act, 1979 to hold sales of furniture at various locations around the country, including the hotel referred to by the Deputy, between 23 September 1993 and 10 October 1993, inclusive.  It appears that the company operated on the basis that a 50 per cent deposit on goods was taken from purchasers on foot of a contactual undertaking that the purchased goods would be delivered within eight weeks from the date of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment that an alleged breach of the Occasional Trading Act, 1979 by an Irish registered company, which appears to be connected with the company already mentioned, for trading without a permit on various dates in October has been sent to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for his advice as to whether proceedings can be instituted against this company for breach of the Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to the involvement of the Garda Síochána in this matter, the position is that, on the basis of suspicions which had been aroused, the Garda had been making certain inquiries from an early stage into the company referred to by the Deputy i.e. the UK registered company and the sales of furniture by them.  My advice is that, for technical reasons, the failure by that company to deliver the furniture promised could not in itself amount to an offence unless that failure arose on or after the date on which delivery was due to be made under the contract.  Whether, even at that stage, the failure to deliver amounted to an offence is a matter which would fall to be assessed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the Garda are conducting an investigation into this matter and, as part of that investigation, they are making arrangements to interview members of the public who agreed to buy furniture from the company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 127 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I have made regulations, entitled the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, under which the fees for planning applications will be increased by 30 per cent with effect from 1 February 1994.  However, the existing overall maximum fee of £10,000 is being retained because it is set at an appropriate level to ensure that an applicant for planning permission makes a reasonable contribution towards the costs which a planning authority incurs in its examination of a major development proposal.</P>
      <P>The question of subjecting retention applications to a higher fee than planning applications generally is under examination in the general review of planning regulations which is being finalised in my Department.</P>

The sea fisheries officers of the Department of the Marine, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are continuously upgrading their monitoring and control programmes to ensure greater protection for the valuable fish resources in our waters.</P>
      <P>General responsibility for control of fish stocks lies with the European Commission.

That regulation also allows for the introduction of special measures in relation to local stocks particularly under threat.</P>

      <P>All aquaculture licensing proposals are assessed by the Department <Col N="1633" /> from the relevant technical and scientific perspectives.  Comments or objections on aquaculture development projects are invited in the first instance through a public consultative process (which includes advertisement in the local and national press) and secondly through consultation with the local authority, as well as other relevant bodies such as the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte, IDA, the Regional Fisheries Board, the Department of the Environment and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>An application by the person concerned was recently assessed by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multi-disciplinary advisory committee comprised of technical and scientific experts from within the Department and an expert from the Central Fisheries Board.  The committee's deliberations included assessment of an objection to licensing one of the three sites which was lodged with the Department on foot of advertisement of the proposal.  With a view to securing the broadest possible range of views on the application for licensing of the sites in question, the committee recommended that the second stage of the consultative process should now be proceeded with and that comments of the relevant consultative agencies should be ascertained prior to finalising its recommendations to me on licensing.</P>

    <P>I have no responsibility for the sale or keeping of these animals other than animal health conditions governing their <Col N="1635" /> importation.  The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 govern the welfare of all animals, domestic or wild, and the Garda Síochána are responsible for the enforcement of this legislation.  There is provision for fines up to £500 together with prison sentences on conviction of cruelty.  The court is also empowered to deprive an owner who has been convicted of cruelty of any animal in relation to which the offence was committed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>The National Stud has incurred substantial losses in recent years associated principally with a serious downturn worldwide in the thoroughbred industry.</P>
      <P>Late last year the Minister requested the board of the stud to draw up a rationalisation plan with a view to returning to viability in order to ensure that the stud can continue to provide a service to the thoroughbred industry.  This plan is now being implemented and involves the introduction of some new work practices necessitating some redundancies.  I would point out that day-to-day matters including the issue of redundancies are matters for the board and in relation to which I have no function.  However, I understand that redundancies will be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Minister have every confidence in the future viability by the stud.  This confidence is demonstrated by (1) the fact that the remaining authorised shares in the company were taken up by the Minister for Finance during 1992 at a cost of £1.3 <Col N="1640" /> million; and (2) the introduction of the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 1993 earlier this year and its passing by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The new Act increases the authorised share capital of the stud from five million shares of £1 each to ten million shares of £1 each. Increased borrowing powers are also provided for, subject to a ceiling of £5 million and to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The new procedure to which the Deputy refers is a rapid screening test devised by an Irish company to detect residues of clenbuterol in the bile of slaughtered animals. It is currently being run as a pilot project <Col N="1641" /> to assess its suitability and feasibility for general use.  The pilot project, which is the final stage in the development of the system, is being partly funded by the Commission of the European Union and my Department.  The cost of testing has not yet been finally determined but will be of the order of £750,000.</P>
      <P>The future use of the system will be reviewed following the completion of the pilot project.</P>
      <P>Most drugs can be eliminated from an animal's system during an appropriate withdrawal period.  It is this principle which enables authorised products to be used safely.  The period for which a residue can be detected depends on the substance and the tissue in which the residue is sought.  In testing for residues my Department concentrates on tissues in which the drug persists longest.  In the case of clenbuterol the effects of the drug are reversed if a reasonable withholding period is observed and therefore the incentive to use the substance no longer exists.  It is believed that the new test methods, which can detect 0.1 part per billion, now being employed, can act as an effective deterrent.</P>

A proposal for a directive on the protection of animals, including poultry, at the time of slaughter is currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union.  This proposal lays down detailed rules for stunning procedures and, when adopted, will be transposed into national law.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with farm organisations, it was agreed in March 1992 that the requirement of RSI (Revenue and Social Insurance) numbers for disadvantaged areas headage payments would be deferred until the beginning of January 1994.</P>
      <P>From January 1994 onwards, farmers applying for disadvantaged areas headage payments which in total amount to £500 or more will be subject to tax clearance.  This means that farmers applying for headage payments of between £500 and £5,000 must state on the application form: (i) the RSI number issued to them for tax purposes, (ii) the tax office dealing with their tax affairs and (iii) that, to the best of their knowledge, their tax affairs are in order.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment and who accordingly have no tax liability will simply have to quote the RSI number associated with their means tested social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>In the rare event of applications for headage payments totalling £5,000 or more in any one calendar year, farmers will be required to supply a tax clearance certificate from the Collector General with their headage applications.</P>

      <P>The current preliminary estimate by the CSO is that farm income, i.e. excluding farmer's income from non-farming activities, will have increased by 8.2 per cent this year.  The <Col N="1646" /> year on year increase would be over 11 per cent when account is taken of the added benefit arising from reduced interest payments by the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Farm incomes would thus have increased by about 37 per cent in the two years since 1991, again taking account of interest payments by the sector.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech therapy in the Midland Health Board is a matter for that board.  At present the board provides speech therapy services to St. Brigid's school in Mullingar for one day per week.  The board has no immediate plans to expand this service.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the adequacy of speech and language therapy services in different parts of the country.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that in the light of competing demands for the development of other services for persons with a mental handicap and the physically and sensory disabled, improvements in the speech and language service can only come about on a phased basis.  Additional funding of £200,000 was provided this year towards improvements in speech and language therapy services.  I hope to build on these developments in the future.</P>

      <P>The technical specifications laid down by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for licensed MMDS systems require compliance with the safety guidelines laid down by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) on the limits of exposure to radio frequency magnetic fields in the frequency range used by the operators.

      <P>Capitation grants are paid to national schools in two instalments each school year, with 70 per cent being paid on 31 January.  The balance is paid on 30 June, subject to confirmation having been received to the effect that the local contribution has been lodged to the school account.  This has been the case for the past ten years, and I propose to continue with the same arrangement for the current school year.</P>
      <P>Up to 1984 capitation grants and grants in lieu of tuition fees were paid in three instalments each as separate grants to voluntary secondary schools, in March, July, November in the case of the former and in January, April, October in the case of the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From August 1984 these two grants were combined and renamed the &ldquo;<i>per capita</i> grant&rdquo; and were paid in three instalments over the school year in October, January, April.  With effect from the 1991-92 school year, the October instalment was brought forward to September and a commitment given that each instalment <Col N="1662" /> would be paid in the first half of the relevant month.  The next instalment is due to be paid in January 1994.</P>
    <P>Vocational and community and comprehensive schools are financed by a system of school budgets, rather than by capitation grants and, in the case of vocational schools, the school budget is determined by the appropriate vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>The total funding allocated for the alleviation of disadvantage at primary and post-primary levels, and the percentage such funding forms of the total allocation to these areas is set out on the attached table.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the scheme of assistance for schools in designated areas of disadvantage provides a range of special support measures.  Schools included in the scheme are allocated concessionary teaching posts and they also receive additional special funding at a rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
      <P>A total of 258 primary schools are currently included in the scheme and a total of 293 concessionary teaching posts have been allocated.  The schools in question embrace a total of 76,000 pupils.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving the above supports, a total of 106 disadvantaged schools, embracing 34,000 pupils, are included in the home-school-community liaison scheme.  These schools have the services of 60 full-time home-school-liaison co-ordinators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of special additional initiatives were undertaken in 1993 to provide extra support to selected schools in disadvantaged areas.  These included the allocation of £250,000 to selected schools identified as having particular financial difficulties at present.  A further £100,000 was provided to smaller schools which were identified as suffering serious disadvantage and for whom financial rather <Col N="1676" /> than staffing support was considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Under a further initiative undertaken in 1993, arrangements have been made to meet the cost incurred by schools in disadvantaged areas in purchasing television licences.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, the programmes being funded are the allocation of additional teaching posts to schools in disadvantaged areas, including remedial and resource teachers to schools; the school book scheme for needy pupils; special initiatives to improve the retention of pupils from disadvantaged areas in education, including the home-school-community liaison scheme, the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and the alleviation of examination fees.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to promote the organisation, or reorganisation, of schools on co-educational lines on the basis that co-education is actively encouraged as the norm at both primary and secondary levels.</P>
      <P>I have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to undertake research in the area of co-education in post-primary schools with the following terms of reference, viz:</P>
      <P> (a)  to test whether co-education has negative effects on girls' education.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> (b)  to identify the relevant causes if this is the case.</P>
    <P>(c)  to develop models of good practice by schools and teachers which would lead to the elimination of the negative effects. </P>
    <P>When I receive the report of the ESRI I will decide on the further action to be taken.</P>

      <P>An amount of £64,106 was paid to Dublin Corporation in 1993 towards the provision of a school library service.  The grant is paid in respect of all primary school pupils enrolled in the Dublin Corporation area.  The present rate of grant is 50p per pupil.</P>
      <P>The money is distributed to the chief librarian of the local authority area and, supplemented by other funds at the disposal of the chief librarian, is used to buy books for lending or distribution to schools.  The chief librarian has discretion as to the number of books purchased.</P>
      <P>The grant to Dublin Corporation was paid in respect of 128,212 primary school pupils.</P>
      <P>In the case of second-level schools, my Department makes grants available for the running costs of the schools and it is open to schools to buy books for their libraries out of these grants.</P>
      <P>While the level of grant provided takes account of the overhead costs involved, I continue to pursue increases in the level of grant payable, as resources permit.  In 1992 the library grant was increased from 38p to 47p per pupil and I secured a further increase in 1993 which brought the grant to its present level of 50p per pupil.  In addition, an allocation of £1 million was provided through national lottery funds in 1989 for the replenishment of the stock of books used for the national schools library service.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme was basically designed to cater for children in rural areas, who, if living a long distance from school, might have difficulty in attending regularly.  In urban areas, the nearest school is rarely more than two miles from a pupil's home, and the provision of transport is not normally necessary.</P>
      <P>Children in urban areas, whose parents wish them to attend a school under Protestant management; an all-Irish school or a multi-denominational school may be issued with bus tickets, provided that they otherwise satisfy the conditions of the school transport scheme, on both age and distance grounds.  Children between four and ten years must live at least 2 miles from their nearest school, and be attending that school, in order to benefit. Children over ten must live at least three miles away.</P>
      <P>The children in question live two miles from their nearest all-Irish school, while the one they are attending is 7.2 miles away.  Under the terms of the scheme, they are not eligible for free transport to that school.</P>
