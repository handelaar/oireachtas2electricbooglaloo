      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the agenda for the meeting on 25 March last of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> included the employment creation impact of the budget, a draft progress report on the achievements to date under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the area-based strategy county enterprise boards, North/South economic co-operation and the national development plan for EC Structural/Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> In accordance with established practice, however, it would not be appropriate for me to disclose details of confidential discussions with the social partners except to say that there was a very useful discussion at this meeting on all the issues which I have just listed.</P>
    <P>The grave unemployment problem is an ongoing item for review and discussion by the Central Review Committee Deputies can be assured, therefore, that through this mechanism, as well as through other meetings and contracts, the Government and individual Ministers directly concerned are kept fully informed and can be assured that we will continue to give the most careful attention to the views of the social partners in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might also mention that a draft progress report on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is at an advanced stage of preparation by the Central Review Committee and it is expected that the report will be published in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the present level of unemployment is the biggest collective failure of the Irish political system and that its solution requires collective and courageous sacrifice by all the interests in this House and those represented on the Central Review Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the grave position in regard to unemployment and, as the Deputy knows, there is no simple or immediate solution to it.  He can be assured that the Government is taking every possible action open to it to resolve the problem.  Deputy Bruton, as well as other Deputies, will appreciate that the Irish economy, being an open one, must export £2 out of every £3 it produces to foreign markets and is naturally affected by the deep recession throughout the world in the past number of years.  Thankfully, the British and US economies appear to be coming out of recession.  An initiative was taken last week by the 12 member states to give a boost to economic activity and that is the <Col N="1187" /> main area in which jobs will be created. All other actions open to the Government are being taken.  Interests and mortgage rates have tumbled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People inside and outside this House said that we made a wrong decision, that we got our timing and others matters wrong.  Yet the countries that devalued early had to devalue more than once and some of them are still in serious trouble while Irish interest rates are at their lowest level for a number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The present level of interest rates and mortgage rates will, inevitably, give a boost to investment and employment.  The Finance Bill will be introduced shortly and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, will make major announcements in the next couple of weeks in relation to the Culliton report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that such recovery is not as a result of Government policies but as a result of the Government abandoning its policies and taking the advice Fine Gael offered <Col N="1188" /> which it criticised initially but subsequently took?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is in revisionism, but he made a good try.  On the basis that our record in job creation in recent years has been an absolute disaster, will the Taoiseach consider it worth while, from the point of view of changing our system, to talk to employers and encourage people to become involved in enterprise and job creation and, second, to talk to the trade unions with a view to changing those parts of our system which tend to make it more worth while for people to be on the dole than to take up employment?  Will the Taoiseach not agree that those two proposals would have a major impact on the existing anti-enterprise culture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the blockages in the economy were identified in the Culliton report and, as I stated already, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment <Col N="1189" /> will be making proposals to deal with those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that in view of the credit he is now claiming for the fall in interest rates he should thank the Bundesbank for their contribution to the timing since the Minister for Finance complained so bitterly about its role in the matter?  Second, will he agree in a budgetary context that it is time to use all the windfall gains arising out of the lower interest rates to eliminate the 1 per cent income levy which is destroying jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is bringing in new matter; this is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle said, the Deputy raised a separate matter in the second part of his question. With regard to the first part of his question, Irish interest rates are on the way down and the recent drop in interest rates by the Bundesbank is, of course, helpful in continuing that downward trend.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna &mdash; Questions.   Oral Answers. - Ministerial Responsibility for Northern Ireland Affairs.</Title>
    <Qst Pid="PeterBarry" ToPid="AlbertReynolds" Dept="Taoiseach" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <Qid>3</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. Barry</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has overall responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, is given ultimate authority, and, therefore, ultimate responsibility, in relation to the overall operation of the Government. In line with this responsibility, the Taoiseach has an overseeing role and a corresponding involvement in all major policy areas, such as Northern Ireland, economic issues and EC affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has direct functional responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs.  In his role as co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he has <Col N="1190" /> immediate responsibility for the implementation of that agreement in all its aspects and in relation to particular issues which arise in Anglo-Irish relations from time to time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the talks process, as I stated in the House on 6 April last, I envisage that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs would, in line with the arrangements made last year involving the then Tánaiste, John Wilson, lead the Government delegation in any resumed talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree &mdash; I am not being contentious &mdash; that the different emphasis placed on this issue by the Tánaiste and him is not helpful to anyone in this House in terms of finding a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland?  The most recent example of this difference was the reaction of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to the speech made by Deputy O'Malley last week. Earlier, they placed different emphasis on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The Taoiseach said that ultimate responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs rested with him.  If the Tánaiste has operational responsibility for such matters, does the Taoiseach not consider that it would be wise for both of them to use the same words, have the same emphasis and same direction on all these matters?  It is not apparent at present that the two Government parties have the same direction on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputy Barry.  I am sure that like me he is aware &mdash; I am not attributing this motive to him for putting down his question &mdash; that many people outside and inside this House, would love to drive a wedge between the Tánaiste and me by highlighting differences in our parties' policies.  I assure Deputy Barry and the House that these people will fail dismally in their efforts to do this.  There is close and continuous consultation between the Tánaiste and me on all policy matters. Both parties in Government operate on the basis of our common policy on Northern Ireland, which is set out in detail in <Col N="1191" /> the Programme for a Partnership Government.  There is no difference in our approach or objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the response we do not want.  There is a clear difference in emphasis between the two Government parties on this issue.  When Deputy O'Malley spoke last week the Taoiseach said he was adopting a simplistic approach, whereas the Tánaiste said his speech needed further consideration as it had much merit.  Earlier in relation to Articles 2 and 3, the Taoiseach said that they were not for sale &mdash; in his speech to his party at Bodenstown he gave a very strong commitment to Articles 2 and 3 &mdash; while the Tánaiste said that these Articles are not cast in bronze.  This is sending the wrong signal to the Nationalist and Unionist communities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the British Government.  There should not be that difference of emphasis in this House in its entirety, not to mention between the two parties in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Dr. Con Power was employed, on secondment from the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, as special economic development officer to the Taoiseach from 1 April 1992.  This arrangement will end on 30 April 1993. From 1 May 1993, Nemesis Limited a consultancy company of which Dr. Power is a director, will commence trading and will: (i) take over and complete on a consultancy assignment to the Department of the Taoiseach any projects which have been commenced by Dr. Con Power, as special economic development officer to the Taoiseach, and not completed at 1 May 1993 and (ii) undertake such other projects as may be specified from time to time by the Taoiseach.  I am circulating to Deputies details of the contract between my Department and Nemesis Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the contract, Nemesis <Col N="1195" /> Limited has undertaken that it will not, while this agreement is in force, engage in any activities which could reasonably be regarded as interfering with, or being incompatible with, the full and proper discharge of its functions.  I am satisfied that the arrangements put in place to govern the interaction between my Department and Nemesis Limited will ensure that no practical conflict of interest will arise.</P>
    <P>Carr Communications have been retained on a consultancy basis to provide advice and assistance to me as Taoiseach, and to Ministers of State at the Department of the Taoiseach on the text, format and presentation of speeches, announcements, etc., for print media and television. A fee of £30,000 per annum plus VAT is payable.  The contract commenced on 12 January 1993 for a period of 12 months or for the term of office of the Taoiseach, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>It has always been the practice to employ consultants on the basis of proven skills and experience in particular fields. The established practice was followed in these instances.  The normal arrangements regarding withholding tax on consultants' fees apply to all individuals and firms engaged by the Department on a consultancy basis.  The National Economic and Social Council which operates under the aegis of my Department has not retained any firms for the purposes set out in Question No. 53.</P>
    <P>Terms of contract between the Department of the Taoiseach and Nemesis Limited.</P>
    <P>1.  Nemesis Limited.</P>
    <P>(i)  take over and complete on a consultancy assignment to the Department of the Taoiseach any projects which have been commenced by Dr. Con Power, as special economic development officer to the Taoiseach, and not completed at 1 May 1993, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  undertake such other projects as may be specified from time to time by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>2.  Nemesis Limited.</P>
    <P>(i)  will utilise the services of Dr. Con Power <Col N="1196" /> in discharging its obligations under this agreement</P>
    <P>(ii)  will undertake that the company will not, while this agreement is in force, engage in any activities which could reasonably be regarded as interfering with, or being incompatible with, the full and proper discharge of the functions set out in paragraph 1.</P>
    <P>3.  In consideration of the services to be provided by Nemesis Limitied the Department of the Taoiseach will pay to the company an inclusive fee of £300 per consultant day of seven hours (plus value added tax) on the following basis:</P>
    <P>&mdash;days worked will be invoiced, by project and by nature of service, for each four weeks period in arrears.  The project days will be agreed with and certified by a designated officer of the Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, vouched expenses for travelling and subsistence necessarily incurred by Dr. Power in discharging the company's duties under this agreement will be reimbursed to the company.</P>
    <P>4. (i)  This agreement will commence on 1 May 1993 and will terminate when the Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, TD, ceases to hold that office.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In the event of misconduct by the company or its agents the agreement may be terminated for stated reasons without notice.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Subject to 4 (ii), this agreement shall not be terminated within one year of its commencement but may be terminated at any time thereafter by either side at one month's notice.</P>
    <P>(iv)  In the event of the agreement being terminated under 4 (i), 4 (ii) or 4 (iii) no fee or compensation will be payable other than that applicable to services already rendered.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware &mdash; if he is not aware of this he should ask his colleagues who were in Government &mdash; that the established practice was followed in both instances. It has always been the practice to employ consultants on the basis of proven skills in certain areas and experience in particular <Col N="1197" /> fields.  The established practice was followed in both instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question, and I assume that the contracts were not put out to tender. Will the Taoiseach confirm that Dr. Power was paid £65,000 for his full-time involvement in his Department and will now receive, through Nemesis, £69,000 for his part-time involvement in view of the fact that he will be catering for its private sector clients?</P>

      <P>I call Deputy Rabbitte who has two questions tabled on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any complaints about the Carr Communications contract as the Government needs it.  In relation to Nemesis Limited, how can the Taoiseach say that normal practice is being followed when, effectively, somebody who was employed on a full-time basis to advise the Taoiseach is being converted into a contractor and the stated public purpose of that person's company is to advise the private sector on how to &ldquo;overcome barriers&rdquo; imposed by legislation and public administration?  Surely there is a manifest danger of a conflict of interest arising in that situation?  I hasten to add I am not suggesting that Dr. Power would act in any way improperly.  It is an appalling precedent to establish a John Birt style arrangement for an adviser at the heart of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1198" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Rabbitte at least agrees that Dr. Con Power is above the kind of activity the Deputy might insinuate will be carried on.  A misunderstanding or misinterpretation is being imputed here, deliberately or otherwise, to the activities of Dr. Con Power, what he has been doing and what he will be doing.  Dr. Power was employed by my Department on secondment from the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation to carry out the same project development duties for which two members of the IDA were seconded on previous occasions.  Dr. Power's role is to help to develop certain projects.  Now that Dr. Power has finalised his position with the IBEC and is a director of Nemesis Limited he will complete the projects in which he has been engaged.  There is no difference. The areas that Deputy Rabbitte is trying to insinuate might lead to a conflict of interest, it certainly will not be a conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know that in order to avoid conflicts of interest several other conditions provide for a break in time between people ceasing to act as public servants and commencing work as consultants for the public service.  Will he consider that such a time break, perhaps six months, might be appropriate in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Projects that Dr. Power is working on at present need to be processed as soon as possible.  Those projects will help in job creation, an issue that Deputy Bruton spoke about earlier. Dr. Power's functions were clear when he was on secondment from the IBEC and it is clear what his functions will be now.  There is no way that the conflict of interest being imputed to those activities by some Deputies will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that Nemesis Limited has offered the public a lobbying service and that there is a clear conflict of interest when a company offers the public a lobbying service if, at the same time, it offers the <Col N="1199" /> most senior politician in the State an advisory service through one individual? What interest does Dr. Power have in Nemesis Limited?  Who is Nemesis Limited and what capital structure does it have?  Is the Taoiseach not engaging the services of a person who proposes to act as a lobbyist as his own personal adviser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated clearly and distinctly that the duties of Dr. Con Power will be in the development of economic projects.  He will be completing projects in which he has been engaged up to now.  That is a completely different matter and does not allow for conflicts of interest.  There is clear protection in this regard in the contract drawn up between Nemesis Limited and my Department. There is no question of a conflict of interest.  There is a vast difference between lobbying in cerain areas and pursuing and trying to develop particular projects.  This functional duty was carried out on two previous occasions by two staff members of the IDA who were seconded to do the same job.  Deputies will see that there is clear protection in the contract.  Dr. Con Power would be the last person to engage in a conflict of interest, all Deputies know that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was in the United States did anybody bring to his attention the widespread concern with regard to the lobbying system in Congress, whereby people in high powered positions in government cannot wait to leave their employment in order to advise major companies on ways in which to circumvent laws they helped to draft? Would Ireland not be going well beyond anything in the American system in that somebody who is still at the heart of government is offering advice to the private sector on ways in which to circumvent legislation?  Following from the question asked by Deputy McDowell, does the Taoiseach know that Nemesis <Col N="1200" /> was the Greek god of retribution?  Perhaps the Taoiseach should beware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know who Nemesis was.  Deputy Rabbitte is making a mistake in that Dr. Con Power is not at the heart of government, he has specific projects to carry out.  That is the misunderstanding of the Deputy in relation to Dr. Power's role.  There are provisions for termination in Dr. Power's contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Power's function is to follow up the developmental projects in which he has been engaged up to now. He is not engaged as an adviser to the Government, he is not engaged as an adviser to me and he is not at the heart of government and able to exercise influence over the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that one of the projects in which Dr. Power is involved is the mythical proposal for a transshipment port in Shannon? In view of Dr. Power's direct involvement with that project, would all transport companies concerned and potential construction contracts be beyond or within the scope of Dr. Power's advice in the private sector?  In that specific instance, what steps have been taken to ensure that there is no conflict of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I shall circulate the contract to Members of the House.  Deputies may make their own judgment and should feel free to ask further questions if they are not satisfied. I believe that Deputies will be satisfied with the contract and will find that Dr. Power is not involved in activites in the way in which Deputies have tried to portray. Dr. Power is not at the heart of government and does not have involvement in areas in which he could have the influence Deputies may think he has.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to my reply to parliamentary questions in the House on 10 February last when I stated that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> 1993-97 makes clear the Government's determination to work for an early resumption of political dialogue with the aim that all of the relationship involved will be comprehensively addressed in a spirit of openness and innovation; and that the Government is ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes.</P>
      <P>I have repeated on many occasions my view that all constitutional issues should be on the table so that, in the words of the Programme for Government, a balanced accommodation of all constitutional issues could be arrived at.  If other parties wish to discuss Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, it is only reasonable that Northern Nationalists would wish us to discuss the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which is at the origin of the partition of Ireland.  As I stated in my Dáil speech on 1 April, the partition of Ireland was presented in 1920 and reluctantly acquiesced in on the basis that it was a temporary expedient and that Ireland should be united under a single parliament in the long run.  A Council of Ireland, the provisions for which were carried over into the Treaty of 1921, was to be established to facilitiate progress towards that end, through developing functional co-operation.  The spirit of that compromise was subsequently lost or abandoned.  Our Constitution was formulated in 1937 against that background. A new and balanced accommodation of all constitutional issues will need to take all these factors into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave no speech at the Arbour Hill commemoration, but spoke briefly to a reporter afterwards, which, I assume, is <Col N="1203" /> what Deputies are referring to.  I was repeating a point made in the course of my Dáil speech.  The underlying point is surely obvious.  If we in this part of the island appear to walk away from constitutional nationalism by unilaterally abandoning our long-standing position with regard to Northern Ireland, the only form of nationalism left in entire possession of the field is a violent form of nationalism, which we all repudiate.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment of 1 March 1990 clarified that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution must be read in conjunction with Article 29, namely that Irish unity may be pursued by peaceful means only and that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not &mdash; I repeat &ldquo;not&rdquo;&mdash; inconsistent with the Constitution and in particular with Articles 2, 3 and 29. Moreover, the Court's other conclusions included that Article 3 of the Constitution does not permit the enactment of laws applicable outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is therefore absolutely no incompatibility between Articles 2 and 3 and Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Therefore, it is strange to suggest that these Articles of the Constitution do not accord with or are inconsistent with the principle of unity by consent.  In fact, the Supreme Court found in effect that the Articles did not need to be altered, by reason of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. There is nothing inconsistent with a constitutional imperative or goal being bound by the principle of agreement and consent in its implementation.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment to the achievement of a lasting political settlement which will accommodate the two traditions in Ireland on equal terms, and which will bring about a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland, and between the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note the remarks of the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, during his recent visit to Northern Ireland in relation to a resumption of the talks process.  In welcoming the Prime <Col N="1204" /> Minister's remarks, I stated that I had no doubt but that there would be full consultation between the Irish and the British Governments about any new initiative to reactivate the talks.  There is an agreement in place whereby the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister meet twice yearly to discuss matters of mutual interest.  Under this agreement, I last met the Prime Minister on 7 December 1992 here in Dublin.  A date for our next meeting will, in accordance with normal practice, be announced close to the time of the meeting.  I expect the meeting to take place around June.</P>
    <P>I visited Derry on 16 April 1993 to attend the launch of the Secretariat of the Donegal, Derry, Strabane, Limavady Cross-Border group.  During my visit, I met Lord Arran, Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State, who was deputising at the launch for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, MP.  I also met the Leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, the Deputy Mayor of Derry, Mrs. Annie Courtney, the Unionist Mayor of Limavady, Mr. Norman Reynolds, as well as other public and local community representatives in the north west region.  I had an informal exchange of views with these individuals and others on a range of matters, including the development of the region, and the prospects for increased cross-Border co-operation in the context of the Single Market.  I found these exchanges most useful and informative.</P>

      <P>I should like to address questions to the Taoiseach in regard to Questions Nos. 7 and 8.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that the only factors deterring most Nationalists <Col N="1205" /> from joining the IRA in Northern Ireland at present are Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  That is what he implied in his Easter commemoration address &mdash; that if those Articles are to be changed in any way they would create a new recruiting ground for the IRA.  Would he explain why he believes that to be the case?  In stating that he hopes all constitutional positions will be discussed in the course of the talks, will he say whether he is aware that over the past weekend Sir Patrick Mayhew has said quite clearly that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland will not be changed and that it is foolish to expect that it will be changed and that, therefore, this question of expecting that Northern Ireland in some way will be brought into some form of a united Ireland is foolish?  Will the Taoiseach say whether he intends to meet Mr. Gerry Adams and, if not, will he inform us why he does not intend to meet him?</P>

Second, it is my firm view that if we were to follow the course now being advocated &mdash; I think, only by Deputy De Rossa on behalf of his party, in the South &mdash; to unilaterally abandon Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, that would certainly be very helpful to the IRA recruiting campaign.  That is my strong view.  Deputy De Rossa may differ from it and he is entitled to do so.  I might add that I had no meeting with Mr. Gerry Adams.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not feel anything at all of the misery, bereavement and pain of so many victims of the political vacuum filled by terrorists in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years?  Does he not recognise &mdash; from what we observed in this country over the past few weeks &mdash; that the people of this State now want urgent movement, not bland, historical verbiage; in particular, that they want him to show real leadership on this issue by breaking the log-jam preventing the resumption of the talks, by saying simply that, if there is a settlement, he will be prepared to re-cast Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution to demonstrate that people's lives matter more than territorial claims?</P>

That is why I have devoted to much time and energy to it.  The Deputy may not be aware but I should say I meet people regularly, on a confidential basis, from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland.  The first priority for all of us should be to endeavour to achieve a formula for peace because one will not get any agreement unless such a formula is to bring about peace.  Therefore, the fist priority is to endeavour to create an environment in which to find such a new formula for peace.  That is why I am proceeding along that path. The Deputy should be aware also that I made it very clear in my address at Bodenstown last October that, in the event of a broad-ranging agreement with new acommodations, such can be put by way of referenda both North and South.

On I March 1990, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and found that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not inconsistent with Articles 2 and 3 and 29 of the Constitution; that Article 3, pending unification, prohibits the enactment of laws applicable in Northern Ireland and that the Agreement was not concluded in disregard of the interests of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 19, 39, 49 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House of the background to Ireland's application for EC funding of mobile assets.  Arising out of negotiations following submission of the National Development Plan 1989-93 to the EC Commission on 22 March 1989, the Commission agreed that, subject to the results of a feasibility study, investment in sea and air freight services might be considered.</P>
      <P>The Access Transport Study, completed in July 1990 by KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the Irish Government and the EC Commission, found that while investment in internal transport facilities was necessary, it was not sufficient to cater for Ireland's unique peripherality problems.  Substantial additional investment in access transport services was needed.</P>
      <P>In the Operational Programme on Peripherality published in November 1990, the Irish Government and EC Commission undertook to examine the conclusions of the study and possibilities for co-financing by the Community of the access transport investment measures identified by the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of the consultants' findings by a high-level interdepartmental group, the Government <Col N="1211" /> made a formal application on 27 May 1991 for EC funding of external access transport services, with specific priority being sought for direct ro-ro and lo-lo shipping services to the European mainland.</P>
    <P>Both my predecessors and the former Minister for the Marine met the relevant European Commissioners to advance our application and to seek a favourable decision.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, a formal reply from the EC Commissioner for Regional Affairs indicated that the Commission had rejected Ireland's application.  In January 1992, my predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, wrote to the Commissioner expressing profound disappointment at the Commission's negative reaction.  He requested further discussion with the Commission in order to critically examine the basis of the Commission's decision and to seek to reverse it.</P>
    <P>Following further extensive discussions and correspondence with the Commission, a second proposal was forwarded to the Commission on behalf of the Irish Government in April 1992, followed by an updated version of the Access Transport Study which was forwarded to the Commission, at their request, in September 1992.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Commission's response was again negative.  The main reason for rejection centres around the Commission's belief that aid for mobile assets would lead to a distortion of competition. It is understood that a number of representations have been made to the Commission by third parties about potential distortion of competition if they acceeded to the Irish Government's proposals. I do not, however, have details of these.</P>
    <P>Despite the negative reaction from the European Commission both I and Government colleagues have continued to vigorously pursue the proposal in line with the specific commitment to press for it in the Programme for a Partnership Government which we are implementing.</P>
    <P>I have recently discussed the matter <Col N="1212" /> with the EC Commissioners responsible for Transport, Competition and Regional Affairs.  I have also written to the latter two Commissioners on the subject and I am awaiting their response.</P>
    <P>However, I must inform the House that all Commissioners still see the competition problems arising from such aid as being the major reason they cannot grant the aid we are seeking.</P>
    <P>On the question of services provided by operators on specific ferry routes, the Government's position is that it favours the maintenance and development of as many access transport services as possible to and from this country in the interests of our trade and tourism.  However, the decision to operate specific services and the nature of the services provided on particular routes are ultimately matters appropriate to the commercial judgment of individual ferry operators.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to put on the record of this House my appreciation for the support of all the social partners in Ireland for our case.  My appreciation and thanks extend to our MEPs and many Members of the House from all political parties who have also vigorously supported our application.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that while his two immediate predecessors and himself were foostering around with this catalogue of failure which he has now communicated to the House the Greek Government succeeded in obtaining co-funding for 13 aeroplanes and two helicopters, the Spanish Government for ten aeroplanes, the Portuguese Government for three aeroplanes, the United Kingdom Government for 15 ferries and the French Government for two aircraft?  Is the Minister aware that in recent months, arising from interference with road transport in the Balkans, the Greek Government has got a subsidy for a ferry service through the Adriatic to the port of Trieste in Italy?  Will the Minister explain how his Department, his two predecessors and himself have failed to deliver when precedents were set in relation to Greece, <Col N="1213" /> Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and France?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can explain.  With the exception of Greece, all the issues to which the Deputy referred relate to internal services and between the mainland and the islands.  No grant-aid is made available in respect of shipping routes to the mainland of Europe.  Therefore, the Commission does not accept that this precedent should apply to what we are seeking. Second, in relation to the Greek issue, I suggested to Commissioner Matutes and Commissioner Millan last week that a precedent may well have been set.  It is my understanding &mdash; although I have not yet received a formal reply from the Commissioner &mdash; that it is being suggested co-funding will be available if it forms part of its national development plan.  I should point out, however, that it is also being suggested that this would be made available from a private investor.  I have sought clarification on this matter but I have not received a formal communication from the Commission that that will be the case. The issues to which the Deputy referred relate to internal services.</P>

Meanwhile Aer Lingus is going down the tubes and the main difficulty lies in the replacement of shorthaul aircraft to provide services to Europe and the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  I met Commissioner Van Miert and after that meeting I made it clear that the position is as follows.  The question of equity for Aer Lingus can only be looked at in the context of the comprehensive proposals and plans being put in place and it is not possible to deal with the question of equity in isolation from the recovery proposals being implemented by the airline. For that reason no formal application has been submitted as of yet because we must have &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy agrees with me &mdash; the detailed recovery proposals in place, because of our wider responsibilities to the taxpayer.  We must know the level of equity that should be put into Aer Lingus before we will be in a position to put the full package to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Noonan that at political and official levels I and the officials of my Department have been in touch with the relevant directorates and we have spoken to the relevant Commissioners. We are ensuring that the proposal we make will be in line with the State Aid Regulations that apply.  We have had full discussions with the EC officials and they are very happy with the <Col N="1218" /> approach we are taking.  We have told them that we will be in touch as soon as the full recovery proposals are to hand so that a decision on the level of equity for Aer Lingus can be made by the Government.  That is the position.  It was suggested that there was a lack of duty on our part but quite the opposite is the case.  I have met with three Commissioners on this issue and I have sent officials to the Commission to ensure that when we make our proposals they will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that such an issue has never come before an Irish Government and I want to make sure that when the submissions are made, they will be totally in accord with EC precedent.  The Deputy need have no worries whatsoever.  Let me assure him that in no way am I misleading the House on this or any other issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 26, 34 and 50 together. The ESB is conducting a feasibility study in relation to the possibilities for electricity interconnection with the UK. Part of this feasibility study involves seabed surveys of possible routes for an interconnector. It is recognised that the link is technically feasible and could yield benefits such as saving on fuel costs, reducing the need for new plant and the amount of plant reserved for emergencies. However, before these benefits can be estimated accurately the undersea cable costs need to be identified.  I expect to have the results of the studies fairly soon.</P>
      <P>It is too early at this stage of the project to consider details of particular contracts for the supply of electricity.  The competitive electricity market in the UK will permit the ESB to choose the electricity company or plant from which it will purchase electrical power.  This means that there is no requirement to purchase nuclear generated electricity.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious that the restoration of the electricity link with Northern Ireland be undertaken at the earliest opportunity.  As the Deputy is aware the difficulty with restoration of this line is primarily a security one.  I can assure the Deputy that the issue is under constant review by authorities on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 29, 36, 259 and 260 together.  I refer the Deputies to my response to a similar question on this issue on 3 March 1993 &mdash; Parliamentary Debates Volume 427, No. 3, columns 536-537.</P>
      <P>Agreement reached between Cablelink and satellite operators for the return of a range of satellite channels to the Cablelink network revolve around a mix of increased subscription charges to the subscriber and approval to carry local insert advertising on the advertising breaks of the satellite channels.  Shortly before Easter, Cablelink submitted an application to my Department seeking approval for this two-pronged approach. The two elements of the package are intrinsically linked and the whole package pivots on approval being granted for the concept of local insert advertising. Consultations between my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the issue of local insert advertising are continuing and a decision will be taken shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the satellite services in question have been available hiterto free of charge <Col N="1224" /> to the company and its subscribers alike, I recognise that there is a misguided impression abroad that subscribers have already paid and contracted for these services. This is not the case; subscribers have paid for and continue to receive a basic tier of services consisting of both RTE 1 and Network 2, BBC 1 and 2, UTV and Channel 4. I am conscious, nonetheless, that the cost impact of any deal between the cable company and the satellite TV services on the subscribers should be kept to a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Has the Minister any plans to ensure continuity of service in circumstances where cable companies have a monopoly in a particular region and where services frequently break down?  What responsibility has the Department to ensure continuity of service considering that the Department issue the licence in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a slightly different question which I would have answered had I been given notice of it.  The MMDS system must be considered in this regard. This system provides an excellent service and I would like to see a more widespread operation of the system throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will put down a question on that matter &mdash; the Minister is correct in that he would need notice in order to reply to it.  What is the Minister's attitude to access to overseas channels, whether by satellite or by stations coming in on the airwaves being provided by unlicensed deflector systems? Is it different from that of his predecessor, who seemed to have one attitude on south Munster and a different attitude on the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Again this is a separate question that I would like to answer in detail.  In any modern European state, in so far as illegal drinking clubs and shebeens should not be allowed, neither should illegal deflector systems.  As a member of the legal profession I cannot <Col N="1225" /> condone illegal systems whether they relate to the broadcasting service or otherwise.  I am aware that illegal deflector systems operate in certain parts of the country where no other service is available.  We will try to ensure that the MMDS system operates in as many areas as possible so that if one were to get rid of the illegal systems people would not be left without a service.  That is probably the most pragmatic approach to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Cablelink, will the Minister agree that it is totally unacceptable that Cablelink subscribers pay more than £80 a year for a service that amounts to no more than a children's channel?  In that context has he any plans to ask Cablelink either to make a refund of contributions to those subscribers who have not been getting the service for which they paid in the last number of months or to absorb the money already received from subscribers to ensure that no increase will be made in subscription charges to those subscribers?  In relation to advertising, when does the Minister expect that consultations with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, will be concluded? Has an assessment been made of the impact on RTE's revenue of allowing Cablelink to run advertisements?  Will he comment specifically on the reports that the impact of allowing Cablelink to run advertisements on its service would be more severe on RTE than was the advertising cap on that company which has been the subject of controversy in the last couple of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last question first, I do not accept there is a finite amount of advertising revenue available. RTE's advertising increased by 25 per cent in the period 1988-92.  There was an increase of 5.4 per cent in 1992 over 1991 in spite of the cap on advertising and minutage, which will be eliminated as a result of the decision of Government to amend the Broadcasting Act.  In the period 1988-92 local radio advertising increased to £10 million per annum.  I do not accept there is a finite amount of <Col N="1226" /> advertising revenue available to one company and not to others.  Local radio is in a position to increase advertising revenue, while at the same time there has been a 25 per cent increase in advertising revenue to RTE.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question it is not correct to say subscribers are paying £80 for the Children's Channel.  There is unfortunately, a misapprehension that that is what one is paying for but what one pays for is the six mainstream channels &mdash; RTE 1 and 2, BBC 1 and 2, UTV and Channel 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's submission that people are subscribing only for the UK channels and the Irish channels, because implicit in the advertising was the availability of satellite channels.  Would the Minister accept that the service has deteriorated substantially in the last number of months and that the only way the channels that have been lost will be restored is by the introduction of advertising by the cable companies at local level?  Has the Minister a difficulty in principle with that idea, or is it a question of working out the detail of how such an arrangement could come to fruition? As the Minister raised the question of MMDS, would he accept that the delivery of the new system has not occurred in most areas throughout the country for which it was promised so it is not yet seen as an alternative to cable services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The MMDS system was raised in reply to a question asked.  I simply answered a question about it.  If the Deputy wishes to put down another question he should feel free to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the misapprehension in relation to cable companies.  Cable companies were permitted by the Department to relay satellite television services on an experimental basis in 1986.  At the beginning of 1988 the Minister of the day announced that he was prepared to authorise cable companies to relay satellite services on a permanent basis.  As a result of a discretionary condition most cable companies relayed what were then, free satellite services, including Sky 1 and <Col N="1227" /> Sky News, as part of their basic packages. Charges were not passed on to the subscribers because at the time satellite broadcasters were more than happy to be carried on a large cable company such as Cablelink, as they could claim an almost immediate increase of 250,000 viewers. As Sky and other services became more popular throughout the UK the Cablelink penetration figures became less critical. Cablelink were aware that the Sky Broadcasting Corporation would be seeking payment in respect of their services. Other satellite services were also seeking payment from Cablelink, although none of the other services appeared to have become as popular as the Sky service.</P>
    <P>In recent years Cablelink has been paying copyright holders for the relay of the UK terrestrial services, the normal UTV, BBC services, roughly the equivalent of 10p per subscriber per channel per month.  The Sky Corporation's initial demand was for 30p per month per subscriber per channel, which would have meant an annual payment of the order of £1.2 million.  Cablelink, understandably, tried to minimise and delay the introduction of these new charges as far as possible.  Unless there was a change in departmental policy, they could not agree to an increase in basic charges. They also hoped that they could obtain approval for the insertion of advertisements aimed specifically at the Irish market during breaks in the Sky services and they were led to believe that Sky would be satisfied with the advertising revenue thereby derived.  This negotiating stance seemed to have been viewed as procrastination by Sky and in early December they told Cablelink that unless there was an agreement by 24 December Sky would revoke permission for the relaying of Sky 1 and Sky News.</P>
    <P>According to Cablelink, they had decided on a commercial basis that while they did not wish to lose Sky 1 and Sky News they should not pay more for the services than they pay in respect of the terrestrial channels.  Accordingly the company was not prepared to offer more <Col N="1228" /> than 10p per channel per subscriber per month for Sky 1 and because Sky News is a dip-in service it was felt that less should be paid in respect of this service. According to Cablelink, negotiations broke down before Christmas when it appeared that Sky would not accept below 30p per channel per subscriber per month for each service.  In early March MTV also withdrew from the Cablelink network in a dispute over royalty payments. That dispute was recently resolved and resulting from the agreements reached in these two cases Cablelink have now submitted an application for a modest price increase as one element of a package designed to ensure the return of a range of satellite services to its network.  The other element of that package is the local insertion of advertising. The details of the whole package were made available to me just before Easter.  As the House knows, this has been going on for six months.  I have had it for a few weeks and I will deal with it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Cable television is chaotic.  Is the Minister seriously saying that cable subscribers are now paying for the privilege of getting the Irish and UK channels only, topped up perhaps by a small ration of tabloid television?  Can the Minister inform the long suffering subscribers to Cablelink when they will get the service for which they have been paying and have access to the range of cable channels, particularly cable channels in other languages that are available in every other country in the European Community?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the amount of radioactive waste which has been transported from Ireland to Drigg nuclear dump in Cumbria, England; and the source from which this waste originated.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Radioactive material in the form of sealed sources which has come to the end of its useful life or is no longer required is returned to the original suppliers in accordance with the licensing requirements of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The location and manner of the final disposal is the responsibility of the original supplier as directed by the national regulatory authority and is not a matter for my Department. Accordingly no information is available on whether any waste from Ireland is ultimately disposed of at Drigg. No waste from Ireland is transported directly to Drigg.</P>
      <P>Most of the material in question comes from Canada, the remainder comes from the US, UK and other EC states.  Most of the sealed radioactive sources returned to the UK in recent years have come from two Irish hospitals where they were used in the treatment of cancer.  The remainder came from a variety of industrial locations throughout the country and a few third level educational establishments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any substance in assertions by the management of British Nuclear Fuels, with whom I was speaking recently, that radioactive material from Ireland makes it way to Drigg nuclear dump just south of Sellafield?  I am anxious to know if any recent EC directives on freedom of information would enable us to have more information? Does the Minister intend to minimise the amount of equipment and material needed and generated so that we do not need to dispose of these substances?  If British Nuclear Fuels is correct would he not accept that we are weakening our position on the discredited nuclear industry <Col N="1230" /> in Sellafield which we are seeking to close as matter of Government policy? Does the Minister also agree that by endorsing an electric interconnector with Britain we will become more dependent on the nuclear industry that we would otherwise be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might put down separate questions on some of these issues.  The question here related to our position on radioactive waste which goes back to its place of origin under existing regulations.  A recent report on radioactive waste management in the European Community from the Commission to the Council made the point that radioactive waste management is an important element as far as safety and environment protection is concerned and that it must be developed and structured for all waste whatever its origin.  The contention by the Deputy that the use of radioactive materials to counter cancer in Irish hospitals is in some way a support for the nuclear industry is incomprehensive. I did not get the Deputy's point, so he may want to make it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The important word I used there was &ldquo;minimise&rdquo;.  I understand that the treatment of cancer involves the production of nuclear waste and the use of radioactive material.  I am concerned that we take all medical precautions. Does the Minister seek to minimise the type of radioactive material being used? Can he enlighten me as to what regulations he has in mind so that we know exactly what regulations are involved and how much information the licensee is required to give concerning where the material goes?  It is of general public interest to know where it goes rather than to be told it is being dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the regulatory procedure.  This radioactive material in both sealed and unsealed form for use in industrial, medical and <Col N="1231" /> laboratory applications is imported under licence issued by the RPII.  There is no national waste facility in which this material can be stored and disposed of here after use.  Therefore, all imported sealed radioactive sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives.  This is a precondition imposed by the board prior to the issue of a licence.  All suppliers are located outside the State.  Under the licence regime all materials must be returned to the original supplier.  It is presumably a matter for its proper use in industrial, laboratory and hospital location as to whether the volume increases in the future.  Regardless of this, it means that under the present licence regime it must be returned to the original suppliers so that none of it remains here.  That is the present position.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office publishes a range of energy statistics in publications relating to different topics such as prices, foreign trade, census of industrial production and household budget survey.  My Department maintains a database of detailed energy statistics which is used to service <i>ad hoc</i> requests and to respond to EC and international enegry agency requirements.

    <P>I am also aware of the large investment needed and indeed proposed by Telecom Éireann to ensure that Ireland's telecommunications system remains amongst the most modern in Europe.</P>
    <P>Work is well under way on the preparation of a national development plan which will set out the Government's proposals for the use of EC assistance under the next round of Structural Funds.  This is being co-ordinated by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and final decisions as to the level of assistance to be designated for any area and the priority of particular types of projects will depend on the Government's assessment of overall national priorities and the outcome of negotiations with the EC.</P>

      <P>In the context of the proposals by Telecome Éireann, will the Minister clarify the positon regarding telephone charges and the proposals to increase local charges, particularly in the light a report in the <i>Irish Press</i> today which quotes him as saying there will be no increase in local charges and an official from his Department as stating that the proposals are still in the melting pot?

      <P>It is of course true that one of the recommendations of the Culliton Report concerns a rebalancing of our telecommunications tariff charges to help our competitiveness in the future.

      <P>In view of the Minister's declared intention to recommend that some of the Structural Funds be applied to the updating of the telecommunications system, will he agree that this is in conformity with the Culliton report and therefore it is a matter of priority if we are going to have a knock-on effect on job creation?</P>

Telecom Éireann have invested heavily in the past.  We have seen the benefits of that in having one of the most modern telecommunications systems in Europe.

      <asker>Mr. O'Malley</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has satisfied himself that Irish air fares and sea fares are competitive for tourists; his views on whether further improvements can be made on tourist access to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of air fares available to tourists for travel to Ireland is generally competitive with those in countries with whom we compete in international markets.  Despite increases in air fares since the Gulf War, average yields from air fares to and from Ireland are generally still below their levels of 1985-86.</P>
      <P>Ferry operators have responded to the challenge of lower air fares in recent years by offering attractive fares incentives and successfully developing their niche in the car market.</P>
      <P>With regard to access arrangements, investment in roads, rail, ports and airports under the Operational Programme on Peripherality is designed to improve transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The provision of modern facilities and adequate capacity will facilitate increased competition among operators which will help to bring down fares for tourists. Also, in the interest of tourism development, I am committed to pursuing the improvement of air links to and from Ireland.  Ireland now has air transport agreements with 19 states apart from EC member states and discussions about new or revised air agreements are being sought with a number of other states, including Australia and Japan.  Irish airlines are also pursuing interline agreements with other carriers with the object of improving access between Ireland and the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments on improving <Col N="1241" /> access arrangements are in line with the objectives set down in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government also states that grants will be sought for access transport, especially mobile assets, with special reference to investment in direct shipping services to continental Europe. Despite the negative reaction from the European Commission, who are concerned about the effects such aid might have on competition, the Irish Government will continue to press for aid with a view to improving the quality and competitiveness of these important external links.  While the main purpose is to improve access to international markets for trade, any improvement in multi-purpose ferry services would also benefit tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of fares to Ireland for tourists from certain continental countries, particularly Germany, is between two and three times the cost of access from the same country to Spain and Portugal, even though the distance from, say, southern Germany to southern Spain is the same as it is from Southern Germany to Ireland?  Is the Minister further aware that these extremely high fares seem to exist on most continental routes where there is no competition?  Will he take steps to ensure that air fares to Ireland are brought down to a level that is reasonably consistent with similar fares in other parts of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 January 1983 it has been open to any EC airline to operate a service to and from any country in the EC.  The Deputy claims that at present there is no competition in regard to Irish routes, but other airlines may operate on those routes if they so wish.  Subject to those airlines meeting the usual safety requirements I have no discretion in the matter.  The usual approval would be given by my Department in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to countenance the continuation of a position in which fares to this country, <Col N="1242" /> even for tourists, can be as high as £400 from relatively close parts of the European Continent?  Does he not realise that while fare levels of that magnitude continue we will not attract significant numbers of tourists from those countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that it is up to each airline to decide the level of its air fares having regard to whatever competition exists.  If no competition exists, presumably it will make a judgment based on the volume of transport it wishes to carry.  Since 1984, when liberalisation in this area began under our EC Presidency, we have been successful in attracting more tourists.  We would welcome other airlines who may wish to operate in and out of this country in order to provide consumers with the best possible deal.  We are no longer in the regulatory business.  We now have a liberalised air transport regime in Europe and it is a matter for the market to decide what routes are to be served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

Will he indicate what he proposes in that regard as that area comes under his control?  Will he confirm also whether Irish ferry operators have contacted his Department expressing concerns about hidden subsidies to their competitors on the Irish-French routes deriving from ships being made available by consortia which seem to include local chambers of commerce in France?  They effectively supply the ships on a subsidised basis in order to gain competitive advantage for the ports in which they are located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern in Question No. 39 was to ensure continuous contact with mainland Europe through our ferry service, both from a trade and tourism point of view.  I am somewhat upset to hear the Minister say that, as a result of the Single Market, it is now open to free competition.  Will the Minister not agree that it is vital for trade and tourism that we ensure both a ferry and air service operate to most European countries to export goods and to bring people, particularly <Col N="1244" /> tourists, into the country?  We cannot leave it up to the market to decide whether tourists come here.  Surely the Government have a role to play in guaranteeing a service to and from Europe, particularly having regard to our location on the periphery.</P>

We have been unsuccessful to date as have previous holders of this office.  The Commission has taken a certain view on this matter.  The two applications we have made have been unsuccessful but we will continue to pursue the matter.  I accept that, following the completion of the channel tunnel, we will be the only island nation and that such short sea shipping routes will be even more important to transport our exports to the market.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if any offshore oil drilling will take place between now and the end of 1993; if so, if he will give details of the locations of such drillings; and whether there is any increase in drilling activity attributable to the changes in the relevant law introduced in the Finance Bill, 1992.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two wells are planned to be drilled in our offshore area during the 1993 drilling season.  Aran, in partnership with Mobil, plan to spud a well in block 50/12 in the North Celtic Sea in the summer of this year, depending on rig availability.  Marathon will also drill a well before the end of the year.  The specific location of this well has yet to be decided by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Finance Act, 1992, relating to petroleum exploration together with revised licensing terms for oil and gas exploration and development which were issued in November 1992 are designed to attract additional exploration investment to Irish waters.  At this stage <Col N="1245" /> it is too early to see the effects of these changes in terms of exploratory drilling but it is significant that three new licences have been agreed with groups of companies to explore in our offshore area. Each of these licences will involve a commitment to drill one exploration well during the first phase of the licences and further wells if the acreage is retained.</P>
    <P>Since last year, there has been a considerable increase in the volume of inquiries to my Department from oil companies who are looking towards Ireland as an exploration location.  The industry has given a positive reaction to both the tax revision and the new licensing terms and the indications are that this new regime has been favourably received.  We are confident, therefore, that in time we will see an even greater increase in activity as a result of these new measures.</P>

As this is the first time the Dáil is operating under the revised procedures on the <i>sub judice</i> rule approved on 7 April last, which is relevant to certain aspects of the questions, I ask Deputies to exercise the utmost restraint in relation to reference to persons outside the House and, when asking supplementary questions, to avoid making references which might prejudice the right of any individual to a fair trial.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with all Members of the House, I was shocked to learn of the tragic circumstances in which the child, Kelly Fitzgerald, died in London early last February.  I have received a preliminary report from the Western Health Board outlining its involvement with the family since they returned to live in Ireland in December 1990.  A number of central issues are still being examined by different <Col N="1248" /> authorities, and these are as follows: first, the inquest in London has been adjourned for the time being; second, I understand that the Garda investigations are continuing; third, four children of the family are currently in the care of the Western Health Board on a temporary basis, pursuant to a place of safety order and fourth, an application to the District Court for a fit persons order, committing the children to the care of the board until they attain 16 years of age, has been adjourned by the District Court to the first week in May.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I hope the House will understand that it would be wholly inappropriate at this stage for me to go into any detail about specific aspects of this case.  I am sure Deputies will accept that it is vitally important to refrain from making any comment which might in any way prejudice the various matters currently before the different authorities. Bearing in mind what I have said about this tragic case &mdash; in particular, that it is far too early to draw any definitive conclusions in relation to it &mdash; I should like to make a number of general points in response to the various concerns which have been expressed about child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the mid-eighties the number of suspected cases of child abuse and, in particular, child sexual abuse, reported to the health boards has increased dramatically.  The number of confirmed cases of child abuse known to the health boards increased from 184 in 1984 to more than 1,400 cases in 1991.  In response to this frightening problem much work has been done in recent years. Guidelines for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse cases were revised in 1987 to include for the first time specific reference to child sexual abuse.  Appropriate services for the investigation and management of alleged child abuse have been established in each health board area.  Some services are based in a particular hospital in the region while others are provided on a community basis.  My Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, is currently preparing new guidelines for health boards and gardaí on a co-ordinated <Col N="1249" /> approach to the investigation of suspected cases of child abuse.  For its part, the Department of Education has circulated guidelines to schools setting out procedures for dealing with suspected cases of child abuse which come to light within the school setting.</P>
    <P>The foregoing measures are designed to facilitate the investigation and management of suspected child abuse.  It is of the utmost importance to develop strategies aimed at preventing all forms of child abuse.  In this context my Department and the Department of Education, together with the health boards, have actively promoted the Stay Safe Child Abuse Prevention Programme.  The aim of this programme is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are taught safety skills in the classroom and these skills are reinforced through discussions with their parents. The response of parents, teachers and children to the Stay Safe programme has been very positive and resources have been made available to ensure its full implementation in all primary schools.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that following the shocking revelations of physical and sexual abuse of a young woman in the Kilkenny incest case I established an inquiry to examine not only the role of the health services in that case but also to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of suspected cases of child abuse.  The investigation team headed by Catherine McGuinness, senior counsel, is now in the process of completing the report and I understand it will be submitted to me on 14 May.  I intend to take the recommendations of the McGuinness report to the Government and to discuss with my colleagues the provision of the necessary resources to allow for the full and effective implementation of the Child Care Act at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that 17 sections of that Act have been brought into operation to date, including a number of important service delivery and <Col N="1250" /> preventative provisions.  The next phase of implementation will involve the commencements of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  The important new provisions contained in these parts will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in cases of child abuse.  However, at the same time it must be recognised that these are the more complex provisions in the Act and the most significant in terms of resource implications.  The successful implementation of these provisions will require a massive investment of additional resources for improvements in the social work and child psychiatric services, additional residential places and foster homes for children who cannot live at home, special therapeutic services for disturbed adolescents and improved funding to voluntary bodies providing family support services.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that it is my intention that these key parts of the legislation will be brought into question as soon as the necessary staff, services and facilities which are required to underpin it have been put in place.  The substantial additional funding needed for this specific purpose is one of the matters I will be discussing with the Government when I receive the report of the McGuinness inquiry.  Full implementation of the Child Care Act is only one part of the strategy to address the horrendous problem of child abuse.  Society in general, and not just professionals such as doctors, teachers and social workers, must be sensitive to the rights and needs of children.  While these professionals can make a significant contribution, they can only do so much.  All of us as a society must clearly acknowledge that children have certain basic rights and that we have a collective obligation to vindicate those rights.</P>

      <P>In response to this rather lengthy reply, I put it to the Minister that he is totally unaware of the <Col N="1251" /> extent of this problem throughout society when he says that considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years. This problem will, regrettably, continue to increase until such time as the Minister implements the provisions of the Child Care Act which was passed in this House more than two years ago.  I remind the Minister that the Child Care Act was formerly known as the Child Care Bill, 1986, and was then known as the Child Care Bill, 1988.  Although the Minister says that 17 sections of that legislation have come into force, he should not feel any sense of achievement or pride in that because included in those 17 sections is the short title and the interpretation. Out of a total of 79 sections, a mere 17 sections have been given the force of law.  Until such time as the powers of the Garda Síochána in this matter are strengthened and until the concept of a supervision order and an emergency care order is introduced and given the force of law in order to allow the Garda Síochána and health board personnel to enter houses in circumstances where there are fears that the welfare of children is a risk, the problem will occur and will increase substantially. On the matter of costing, the Minister has accepted that the cost of full implementation of the Child Care Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In response to questions asked at the weekend, the Minister has said that £44 million is required.  If that sum is an accurate account of the amount needed to provide a level of acceptable care for the children of this community, that is an extraordinary shame that successive Ministers for Health have to bear. Is the sum of £44 million a true figure? Does the Minister accept that he is justified as Minister for Health in saying that because he does not have £44 million he cannot do anything?  I put it to the Minister that there are important and worthy provisions of that Act that could <Col N="1252" /> be given the force of law without an expense of anything like £44 million.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is very important to implement in full the Child Care Act and it is my intention to do so as soon as resources allow.  I have no intention of bringing into force provisions of legislation that cannot be implemented.  A complex system of resources needs to be put into place, including the making of regulations and the training and staffing of personnel.  I want to put all of that into place and I intend to do so.  It would be a mistake to think that the House could pass a law that would simply abolish child abuse. Full implementation of the Child Care Act will not solve all the problems.  There needs to be a programme of sensitisation for the whole community, so that everybody is aware of the increase in a phenomenon that is abhorrent to us all. I have outlined a number of strategies, including the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme, which is an integral part of that plan.  I regret that the Deputy opposite cannot find it within himself to accept that significant progress has been made in realising the extent of the problems in society and in putting in place a series of strategies to address those problems.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Western Health Board has supplied the Minister with a detailed file, on which staff members worked over the weekend, in relation to the particular case concerned. I see that the Minister nods in agreement.  In the public interest, I ask the Minister the number of visits made by Western Health Board social workers to the home of the deceased teenager from the time that a file was referred by Lambeth Social Service Council to the Western Health Board, the time that the <Col N="1253" /> deceased came within the jurisdiction of the health board?

Reluctantly, I do not wish to give the kind of detail sought by the Deputy.  I say that because there are care proceedings in relation to members of the family before the courts.  The district justice at Charlestown District Court on 23 April said that all parties with a knowledge of the case should refrain from making any comment in relation thereto until the case is finally determined.  The district justice specified that breach of that order would be deemed a contempt of court.</P>

However, I am determined that there will be sufficient resources in place once the provisions are enacted to ensure that it is not simply a matter of passing legislation in the House, then giving the book to the health boards and saying &ldquo;Get on with it&rdquo;.  The resources have to be found.  I do not have a figure for the exact cost.  My departmental staff are working on that, in consultation with the health boards and professionals.</P>

Does the Minister know exactly how much under resourced and over loaded the service is? If so, why does Cabinet not now bring in a supplementary estimate to deal with the crisis?  It is incredible to any member of the public who considers the tragedies that have occurred and the brutality that has been inflicted on young children that there is no action, especially in view of the fact that in the not too distant past an estimate for £50 million was brought in to provide the Market Development Fund.  Why is it that the Minister cannot bring the same sense of urgency to the protection of our children from torture and brutality?</P>

      <P>After the incident that came to light in Kilkenny I established a committee of inquiry.  That committee had a double brief.  Not only was the committee to examine the specifics of that case, more particularly it was to examine the service and management of child services.  I have asked the committee, chaired by Catherine McGuinness, to report as expeditiously as possible.  The earliest date on which that committee of inquiry could come back to me is 14 May.  The least we can do is await the report of that committee to ascertain what recommendations or changes are put forward.  Perhaps further legislation and-or additional resources will be required.  We must ascertain what, in specific terms, is required.</P>
      <P>I have also said I will do two things: I will publish the McGuinness report and bring the findings of that report to Cabinet for action.  That plan is not in any sense a knee-jerk reaction to a particular tragedy but is doing the right thing, that is drawing up an analysis, with the professionals involved, of the position, ascertaining what is needed, so that the best possible provision can be made for care.  That is my objective and that of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that there has been a very slow gestation of public policy in regard to child welfare since the foundation of the State and a rather shameful lethargy in the implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.  I will adhere to administrative matters and not refer to a specific case.  In his contact with the Western Health Board, has the Minister ascertained whether sections 7 and 8 of that Act &mdash; which I understand have been implemented &mdash; have been adhered to by the Western Health Board?  For example, has it established child care advisory committees to review individual responsibilities and performance of functions specified in that Act?  As the Minister will be aware, under the provisions of section 8 of that Act, there is a responsibility on <Col N="1257" /> the relevant health board to undertake an evaluation of the adequacy of child care and family support services in their part.  Will the Minister say whether those two sections have been adhered to by the Western Health Board?  Will he agree that such adherence would go a long way to reassure people nationwide that there is at least some compliance with existing legislation?  The Minister would appear to be full of good will in this respect but he needs the support of this House in giving impetus to implementation of the remaining provisions and finding the necessary resources.  That is a matter of choice we will all have to support.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to impress on his Cabinet colleagues the urgency and importance of implementing in full the remainder of this very positive legislation. Will the Minister agree that this is positive legislation, that it is about supporting families, rather than supplanting them, and that in a very small minority of cases &mdash; perhaps recent ones which have been highlighted &mdash; the strong arm of the law will have to intervene in the family?  Will he agree that, essentially, legislation is about supporting families in a very positive manner which constitutes the way forward in these matters?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her support, which is the approach which should be adopted.  I think we are all equally horrified at incidents of child abuse, particularly at some of the cases that have arisen recently.  We must address them in a collective manner. They are difficult for us as a society, in more ways than simply finding resources. A number of difficult circumstances have presented themselves which must be addressed by us as a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board acted very responsibily in regard to this case and I know that the uncle of the deceased has been very positive in his comments in relation to the child care services in the Western Health Board area.  Under the provisions of section 7 of the Child Care Act, 1991, the board has established a child care advisory committee and is reviewing the procedures even in relation <Col N="1258" /> to the treatment of this case.  No doubt I will be able to make a fuller statement when all the various inquiries and court cases have been finalised.  I am committed to the Act and some Members who have been here for a while will realise that I participated in the deliberations of the Special Committee on the Child Care Bill, 1991, the best legislative committee on which I ever served.  Most of us who worked on that committee recognised the effort and determination on the part of all participants to draft the best possible legislation, supportive of the family unit, in relation to the betterment of children.  I am determined that the next step in bringing that legislative process to completion, that is the full enactment of the Act, will be done as soon as I can possibly manage to do so.</P>

That is an insult to the professionals involved in developing those services.  I might add that it constitutes one arm only of all the legislation, action and guidelines I have already outlined to the House being put in place.  I do not think legislation, or the health services alone, have the solution to problems such as these.  Rather it is a societal problem that goes well beyond the health services.

I take the Minister's point that a number of sections of the Child Care Act have been implemented but I am sure he will agree that the essential sections which would allow intervention, where necessary, have not been implemented.  With the question of resources, that is the key question.  What steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure that people who are concerned about the physical and sexual abuse of children are clear on the question of <Col N="1262" /> making referrals, the consequences and, in particular, the legal consequences for people when they take action?  The cause of inaction is lack of clarity.</P>

      <P>As I said in my initial reply, I recognise that the most complex and significant sections of the Act have yet to be implemented.  I intend to bring them into force as soon as possible, not in a meaningless way but in such a way that they will have an impact.  In relation to the procedures to be followed, I have established a committee of inquiry to look into this matter.  Catherine McGuinness is chairing this committee which is comprised of a team of professional care workers.  Its report, which will be published after I receive it, will be made available to me on 14 May. I hope it will provide a framework for changes or initiatives which need to be taken.  I ask the House for its support on all these matters.</P>

      <P>The fundamental aim of this Bill is to meet the demand for comprehensive and coherent legislation on animal remedies covering the entire spectrum from the point of manufacture to the sale for human consumption of produce derived from treated animals.</P>
      <P>The issue of animal remedies has generated a certain amount of controversy and can be divided into three principal areas of concern.  First, there is the industrial aspects whereby animal remedies are developed and placed on the market. Secondly, there is the producer who relies on safe, efficacious animal remedies to ensure the health of his stock so as to derive the optimum return for his investment and labour.  Last but not least, there are the consumers who rightly demand that the animal produce which they purchase comes from healthy animals and is not contaminated or rendered less wholesome by the use of animal remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interests of each of these groups are equally important and any regulatory controls must recognise the legitimacy of their concerns and strike the right balance to ensure that no single group asserts its demands at the expense of another party.

It is <Col N="1519" /> the function of the legislative system to ensure the necessary mechanisms are applied to ensure that the rights of all are respected.</P>
    <P>To achieve this necessary balance a comprehesive approach must be adopted as consistent treatment is not facilitated by fragmented legislation.  Our existing legislation has served us well.  We enjoy a very high animal health status and our animal produce enjoys an enviable reputation for natural wholesomeness.  In today's highly competitive food sector there is no room for complacency.  As it is over 30 years since primary legislation was introduced in this area it is timely, in view of the rapid pace of change and development in the pharmaceutical and farming sectors, that the legislative position be reviewed and updated to lay the basis of regulation for the years ahead right into the third millennium.</P>
    <P>I would not like to create the impression that there has been total legislative inactivity in this area.  Throughout the eighties there has been a steady stream of secondary legislation arising from national initiatives and out of harmonisation measures adopted at EC level.  It is important to recognise that the decision to ban hormones, both natural and synthetic, was taken in the mid eighties at Community level.  This decision was taken because of growing consumer unease and a series of abuses in a number of member states.  We have exercised very strict controls in the interest of farmer, industry and consumer over this period and only two major criticisms can be directed at our efforts.  These are the fact that this legislation is fragmented over a number of different Acts and that responsibility is also divided between different Ministers.  The situation has been referred to on more than one occasion as a legislative maze.  The other aspect is one which has been raised on a number of occasions in this House. I speak, of course, of the low level of penalties applicable to serious offences. I fully share the sentiments of those who call for a punishment to fit the crime and feel that the Bill before us today will <Col N="1520" /> leave potential offenders in no doubt as to the Government's intention to deal severely with such activities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most striking aspect in the development of the animal health industry over the years is the increasing consumer awareness of farming practices and concerns regarding the safety of substances administered in livestock production. Consumers quite correctly demand assurances regarding the safety of these substances and their correct usage.  The pharmaceutical industry and the farming community have to respect these concerns if their industries are to prosper.  There is little point producing any commodity no matter how economically if the consumer refuses to buy it. Equally the consumer must be educated that all animal remedies must satisfy strict criteria of safety, quality and efficacy before they are approved for placing on the market, that the responsible use of animal remedies improves the health and welfare of animals and consequently the quality of their produce.  Healthy stock reduces farmers' overheads and so consumers share the benefit of more economic production.</P>
    <P>It should also be acknowledged that the vast majority of farmers are quality conscious, respect the law and are interested in supplying a product in which the consumer will have confidence.  As a final guarantee strict official controls are applied at slaughtering facilities and dairies to ensure the safety and quality of animal produce entering the food chain. A comprehensive testing regime is in place ranging from tests on live animals to samples taken at the point of slaughter. Much of this sampling is taken on the basis of suspicion.  It is therefore possible by co-operation of all interests and the regulatory authorities to make the food chain a chain of quality.</P>
    <P>Trade in animal produce has been greatly facilitated by the adoption of a comprehensive range of harmonised measures at EC level dealing with the criteria for approval of animal remedies, thereby ensuring that different demands cannot be used to create artificial barriers to trade.  To complement these measures <Col N="1521" /> harmonised schemes for monitoring for correct usage have also been put in place.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately a disturbing trend of using illegal substances for growth promotion in livestock production has emerged throughout Europe and, there is evidence to suggest, further afield as well. We in Ireland have not been immune and it is deplorable that an unrepresentative group of unscrupulous producers and dealers threaten the hard earned reputation and the viability of our livestock and meat industry.  Particular attention has focused on the use of beta-agonists, commonly referred to as angel dust and hormonal substances.  These developments have created a degree of consumer resistance to beef and other meat products and aroused a suspicion in regard to the use of animal remedies generally. Reports of usage in the national and international media are, to say the least, not good for our image as a producer of quality produce and undermine the basic elements of the marketing strategy for our food sector.</P>
    <P>Live animal and meat exports are vital to the economy and contribute in excess of £1 billion annually in export earnings to the economy.  While this is a vital contribution to the economy, I do not exaggerate when I say it is the lifeblood of the farming community.  Good reputations are hard to earn and once lost almost impossible to regain.  We cannot tolerate the activities of those persons who threaten the very existence of our livestock industry.  I will not enter into debate as to whether those who supply or those who use are more to blame.  It is sufficient to say that supply and demand cannot be separated as they are totally inter-dependent. Any person who supplies, uses or encourages the use of illegal substances must be treated with equal severity and this Bill provides the appropriate basis for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation relating to animal remedies is contained in the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, which deals with the regulation of animal remedies which have immunological properties, the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, which regulates the availability of animal remedies <Col N="1522" /> and the Poisons Act, 1961, which regulates the use of animal remedies which are deemed by regulations under that Act to be poisons.</P>
    <P>Developments in immunology and biotechnology have long since surpassed the scope of the Therapeutic Substances Act and a new legal basis for dealing with this area is now necessary.  The Animal Remedies Act and the Poisons Act have limitations in scope and more importantly provide for summary offences only, with the maximum fine under either Act being £100 and the Poisons Act having a provision for a prison sentence of six months.  The greatest limitation in scope arises in relation to the powers of enforcement, adequate when regulating a law abiding sector, but totally inadequate for dealing with users or suppliers of illegal substances.  There is the added complication of having to make two separate regulations when the availability and use of an animal remedy requires to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Developments in veterinary medicine and biotechnology have led to a situation where strict controls are necessary on animal remedies and harmonised action in this respect has been provided for by a series of EC Directives.  Because of the limitation in our domestic legislation to implement these measures the European Communities Act, 1972, has been utilised to provide the substantial powers of enforcement necessary to combat what, in many instances, amounts to serious criminal activity in relation to the supply and use of illegal substances.  A series of very stringent legislative measures entitled the European Commmunties (Control of Veterinary Medicinal Products and Their Residues) Regulations 1988 to 1992, have therefore, been introduced to prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale, possession and use of illegal substances or the abuse of authorised substances.  Despite this, the regulations lack effectiveness because the European Communities Act provides for summary offences only.  This means that the maximum penalties which may be imposed are those applicable to summary jurisdiction, which in the context of profits <Col N="1523" /> to be gained from the illegal use of these substances are insufficient to have a substantial deterring effect.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, this Bill will provide a single legislative basis for the regulation and control of all animal remedies and for the consolidation of existing legislation in this area, as well as providing for appropriate enforcement and sanctions.  The wide ranging powers to regulate reflect the degree to which animal remedies are an integral part of livestock production.  Because of the importance which attaches to the use of pharmaceutical products at EC level, provision is made that future Community legislation in this area should be transposed into national law under the provisions of this Bill.  This is an important provision as it will enable future EC legislation to be transposed into domestic law independently of the European Communities Act, 1972, the use of which for implementing EC legislation has many advantages but also has weaknesses.  I have already referred to the restrictions on the penalties which may be imposed under the European Communities Act.</P>
    <P>The second consideration is the requirement that all measures regulated for in this manner must be necessitated by the parent instrument.  Any measure introduced on this basis may be challenged on the basis that it might not be necessitated by the parent directive or decision.  Implementation of EC instruments by means of regulations under this Bill will enable the incorporation of wider ranging incidental and supplemental provisions so as to make the enforcement of the legislation more effective and better suited to Irish conditions and practice.  It also means that infringements of such provisions will attract the high penalties provided for in this Bill and will leave our EC partners in no doubt about our commitment to the application of harmonised rules.</P>
    <P>The Bill in section 1 revises the definition of &ldquo;animal remedy&rdquo; so as to cover fully the scope of EC legislation on veterinary medicinal products and to keep abreast of technological developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> Section 2 sets out the animals to which the Act will apply.  The definition is greatly extended from the 1956 Act and includes all mammals, birds, fish molluscs and bees and any other animal kept, or whose produce is intended, for human consumption.  This is necessary to take account of species not covered by the 1956 Act which are now being farmed or reared for human consumption, for example deer and fish.  It is also desirable to provide that all remedies intended for any animal are covered, as otherwise unacceptable products could be marketed for species outside the scope of the Act and diverted to animals intended for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the enlargement of the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee which, under the 1956 Act, advised and assisted the Minister in the making of regulations under the Act.  The Committee will have seven members.  The extension of the size of the committee will ensure that all interests likely to be affected by regulations made under the Act will be adequately represented.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the information which must be conveyed on the container or outer wrapper in order to ensure safe and proper usage of the animal remedy. The same particulars must be stated on any advertisements for an animal remedy.  The particulars required may be varied by regulation in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>The possession or control of an animal remedy in contravention of the provisions of the Bill or of regulations to be made thereunder, or of an animal or carcase, or animal produce knowing it to have been illegally treated, is an offence under section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 7 inserts an implied condition in any contract of sale for an animal, or in the case of a carcase or any animal products, that the animal from which it was derived had not been illegally treated.</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the Minister, following consultation with the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee, to make regulations &mdash; to control the availability, including manufacture and sale, <Col N="1525" /> advertising, possession and use of animal remedies; to prescribe maximum residues limits for animal remedies in foods of animal origin; for the control of animals to which animal remedies are administered and of food derived from such animals.  The controls provided for include powers to restrict the sale, slaughter or movement to or from any place, and for the marking and detention of animals which are believed to have been treated with animal remedies.  The disposal or destruction of illegally treated animals is also provided for.  Section 8 also empowers the Minister to make regulations for the inspection and testing of substances, animals and food of animal origin and for the charging of fees in respect of such sampling and analysis.</P>
    <P>This section also enables regulations to be made giving effect to Acts of the European Communities and validates regulations relating to animal remedies already made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  This is a very important section as the regulations made under this section will regulate all day to day activities relating to animal remedies. When a new Bill is introduced there is always speculation about the type of regulations which will be made thereunder. In the case of this Bill the question is largely answered as the provisions relating to continuing in force of existing regulations will ensure a smooth transition in that the Bill once passed will be immediately operational.</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, under section 9, prescribe approved methods of analysis for the determination of the composition of animal remedies or for the presence of residues in animal produce.  The authorisation of the persons and bodies to carry out such analysis and for the admission of documents stating the results of such analysis as evidence in legal proceedings is also provided for under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 11 confers extensive powers on authorised officers, officers of Customs and Excise and members of the Garda Síochána.  I should mention that there is already very good co-operation between the different enforcement agencies in this <Col N="1526" /> area.  These include, <i>inter alia,</i> powers to stop vehicles and enter any land or premises where there are reasonable grounds to believe that such vehicles, land or premises are used in connection with an animal remedy or an ingredient for an animal remedy, or are used in connection with the keeping or slaughter of animals, or where the offence under this Act has been, or is being, committed. Following entry, officers have extensive powers to search, examine, inspect, test or take samples and to seize and detain suspicious items as may be found thereon.</P>
    <P>Persons connected with the afore-mentioned activities are required to produce relevant documentation or other items, including animals, and to give such information or assistance as may be requested by the officer or member concerned. This power is exercisable in respect of a dwelling only where there is reason to believe that relevant material would be destroyed before a search warrant could be obtained.  The provisions here are in effect the same powers of enforcement as already applied under the regulations made under the European Communities Act.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that a judge of the District Court may issue search warrants to an authorised officer, officer of Customs and Excise or member of the Garda Síochána to enter and search a dwelling house where there are reasonable grounds to suspect evidence of an offence is to be found therein.  Members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise are empowered to search a suspect person under section 13.  Section 14 empowers members of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant persons suspected of having committed an offence.  Section 15 provides that nothing in the Bill shall curtail or prejudice other provisions of existing legislation in relation to powers to search or to seize or to detain property which may be exercised by members of the Garda Síochána or officers of Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the Minister may issue composite identity cards to his officers in lieu of the separate warrants <Col N="1527" /> of authorisation prescribed by the various statutes in respect of which the officers are authorised.  This provision is inserted because many officers are engaged in a wide range of duties and as a result are obliged to carry a large number of separate warrants.  This provision will enable a single composite identity document to be issued to such officers.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that any person who obstructs or impedes an authorised officer, an officer of Customs and Excise or member with the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of any of the provisions for by or under this Bill shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 18 deems the impersonation of an authorised officer to be an offence.  Section 19 provides that where it is not possible to prove the specific identity of an animal remedy in relation to which a contravention took place it will be sufficient to prove that contravention took place in relation to a particular class of animal remedy.</P>
    <P>Section 20 makes it an offence to contravene by act or omission any provision of the Bill or regulations made or continued in force thereunder.  It also provides that it shall be an offence to contravene a term or condition of any licence or authorisation given or granted under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 relates to offences by bodies corporate and provides that where an offence is committed with the consent or connivance of any person who is a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate that person shall, in addition to the body corporate, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished as if guilty of the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 22 empowers the Minister to prosecute summary offences and provides that summary proceedings may be instituted within two years of the date of the offence.  This provision is considered necessary because the investigation of offences relating to animal remedies can at times be lengthy if all parties to the offence are to be identified and proceeded against.  Under EC law we are obliged, in relation to certain offences, <Col N="1528" /> to trace breaches of the legislation back to the source of the illegal substance and to involve the authorities in other member states if necessary.  Equally we could be asked by another member state to investigate a possible Irish link with a problem which came to light in their territory.  In such circumstances it is important when the investigation is completed that we should not find the issue of proceedings statute barred.  The provision gives an independent legal basis for prosecuting offences which is important in the context of the recent High Court decision on the European Communities Act, 1972, where regulations in this area were found invalid because they involved amending statute law by statutory instrument.  This decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Section 23 addresses the issue of penalties and offers a range of options appropriate for the offence involved so that the punishment shall match the crime.  It is provided that maximum penalty on summary conviction shall be a fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  For conviction on indictment a maximum fine of £50,000 is provided, rising to £100,000 on second or subsequent offence, and ten years imprisonment or both.  It is additionally provided in section 24 that on conviction on indictment for a second or subsequent offence a person may, in addition to the penalty imposed, be disqualified from keeping, dealing in or having control of any animal or class of animal or any animal remedy or be disqualified from working or participating in the food trade for such period, including the life of the person, as the courts thinks fit.  This possibility should act as the ultimate deterrent and is important in that it enables the public to be protected from a person who operates with callous disregard for the health and welfare of innocent parties.</P>
    <P>Section 25 empowers a court at its discretion to order the forfeiture of an animal, an animal remedy or other thing in relation to which an offence has been committed and section 26 deals with the manner in which items seized by authorised officers, members of the Garda <Col N="1529" /> Síochána, or officers of Customs and Excise will be disposed of.  Section 27 enables the Minister to recover the cost of disposal of items seized or forfeited as a contract debt.</P>
    <P>Section 28 to 31 deal with procedural matters such as the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the fixing and charging of variable fees and levies for different classes of licences and authorisations and the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 31 will continue in force all instruments, documents and authorisations issued under the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, which were in force immediately before the Act was repealed and ensure uninterrupted application of controls.  Section 32 repeals the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, section 21 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and provides for the repeal of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, by order of the Minister for Health following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  These provisions arise because the subject matter of these instruments is now incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and in so doing I would like to thank all the bodies who have contributed to its preparation.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier that it is an appropriate time to introduce this legislation.  The timing coincides with a major statement by the European Commission on the subject of the use of hormones and beta-agonists in livestock production.  The general direction and thrust of the Commission's view is supported and the recognition of the need for a more direct and vigorous attack on the use of illegal substances is welcomed.  Many of the Commission's recommendations are already in force in this country, and more are addressed in the Bill before us.  I will also be asking the Commission to take account of the strong legislation in force in this country and to ensure that an <Col N="1530" /> equally vigorous approach is applied across the Community.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an open and constructive discussion on the Commission's proposal at the Council of Ministers when the detailed proposals are presented.  It is important that all aspects of the problem are considered.  I am aware that there are wide ranging views as to how this problem should be addressed and that there are those who consider that the use of natural hormones should be relegalised by amending the Community law.  However we have to recognise, first, that many of the substances being used illegally are far removed from and a good deal more potent than natural hormones, and, secondly, that the argument goes beyond the economics of production or the safety and efficacy of veterinary products.</P>
    <P>We produce considerable amounts of food products for sale not just on our own domestic market but on a wide range of international markets.  Therefore the requirements of the consumer are paramount. If consumers indicate that they do not want produce produced with the usage of these substances then that is the end of the argument.</P>
    <P>This legislation has to be seen in a broader context of a comprehensive legislative approach designed to bring greater coherence and flexibility and to keep abreast of scientific and technological changes.  This body of legislation is required regardless of whether natural hormones are legalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We should thank the Minister of State because in his speech he has added quite a bit to what we can find in the explanatory memorandum of the Bill. I thank the Minister for having added those things.  I have to say, however &mdash; and I hope the Minister for State will not think me grudging in this &mdash; that it is a pity he did not add a bit more because there are a number of questions that arise out of this Bill which will have to be teased out.  It would be useful if the Minister could give us some extra information on some of the points I will raise when <Col N="1531" /> he comes to reply to the Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last paragraph, and particularly the last sentence of the Minister's speech, made my hair stand on end.  The Minister seems to be raising the question of whether these natural hormones might again be legalised.  I would be utterly opposed to that.  In a previous job I had in the European Commission in 1979 and 1980 I was instrumental in making sure that the Commission brought forward a proposal to ban the use of these hormones and I think that was an entirely right and proper thing to do.  The only bad part of it was that it took too long to get agreement on that.  If there is any suggestion of relaxing that ban and allowing the use of these hormones I would totally oppose it.</P>
      <P>I know, Sir, that there is a body of opinion &mdash; the Minister hears this as do I and other Members of the House &mdash; that the fact that hormones are banned makes it more difficult to apply controls to hormones and to beta-agonists and all of the other substances we are concerned with.  That is a baseless argument.  Where a substance has come on the market that has made it possible to make a quick buck, experience shows that no amount of controls to try to limit or direct the use of these things will work.  The only way we can be sure of avoiding the kind of side effects we get from these products is to ban them and to have not only legislation but also systems in place that can make that ban work.  That is the business of this Bill before us in relation to clenbuterol and the various derivatives and combinations of it that are coming on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I am not at all convinced that this Bill goes far enough.  I have no doubt that it is going in the right direction, but I am not sure that we have fully understood the nature of the problem before us.  We have to understand that if we are to have any chance of <Col N="1532" /> making sure that the legislation tackles the problem properly.</P>
    <P>We have already had one experience in this area of legislation that did not prove to be adequate.  In 1991 the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Michael O'Kennedy, introduced the Animal Remedies (Control of Certain Sales) Regulations.  The then Minister made very loud noises about his intentions, but the regulations proved inadequate for the job in hand.  That was largely because the Minister of the day tended to underestimate or to down-play some of the advice he was getting in the House and from farmers all over the country to the effect that the magnitude of the problem was much greater than he was prepared to admit.  Indeed, I heard the Minister classify statements made to him about points and methods of distribution of these substances as being only hearsay.  We now know that not only were they not hearsay, but according to the people who talked about the iniquity of distribution methods that encouraged farmers at factory gates to use products of these kinds they were, if anything, understated.  The fact that the Minister of the day chose to underestimate or to down-play the importance of that advice led to regulations that did not have the full effect we wanted.  This had led to a situation where that trade seems to have fallen into the hands of a small number of particularly nasty and unscrupulous people.  I do not think we can take the chance of that kind of thing happening again.</P>
    <P>I have to say with the utmost seriousness that it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the nature of the problem facing us.  I will illustrate a few things for the Minister who may feel, for reasons of discretion, that he cannot bring all of this out in public.</P>
    <P>There is, for example, evidence to suggest that the Provisional IRA is involved in the importation of clenbuterol.  That tells us something new and additional about the intrinsically evil nature of those people.  It also suggests that an organisation that has a proven ability to conceal illegal materials and a network of safe <Col N="1533" /> houses and supporters around the country is involved in dealing with this malign substance, as well as being directly involved in the business of murder.</P>
    <P>Like every other Member, I congratulate the Garda on their successes in recent years in unearthing caches of arms and explosives, but I do not think even the Garda would claim that they know the full extent of the operations and the connections of the Provisional IRA.  If it is true, as it seems to be, that the Provisional IRA is now engaged in this filthy trade in clenbuterol, then the people who are given the job of enforcing this legislation must be equipped and supported accordingly.  If we are to send members of the Garda Síochána, customs and excise officers and other authorised officers into a situation where we suspect they may be dealing not just with ordinary criminals but with people who are in the Provisional IRA or connected with it, then that creates an extra need for support and equipment for those people in order to allow them to do their jobs effectively and to deal with the ruthlessness that they will undoubtedly meet with. The Minister will agree that in some cases there has been a remarkable degree of determination on the part of people who have been suspected of having these substances to resist arrest and to get away. We are sending out gardaí, customs officers and other authorised officers to do a dangerous job and we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>It also seems that the Provisional IRA or other importers of clenbuterol may be getting some of their supplies from sources connected with the drug baron rings in South America either directly or through Spain and perhaps from Eastern Europe.  The implications of any such connections are huge and far reaching and we must ensure that the full and necessary international effort to choke off this trade is put in place.  It is up to us to play our part in that.  The provisions of section 4 (7) of the Bill may not be entirely in keeping with that obligation. That subsection takes a more relaxed view in regard to circumstances in which substances may be exported than of circumstances <Col N="1534" /> in which they remain on our territory.  I ask the Minister to examine that with a view to ensuring that we are playing a proper part in an international effort to choke off the trade in such products.</P>
    <P>Clenbuterol is a lethal substance and we are aware of some of the effects it can have on consumers of meat in which it has been ingested.  It can have serious effects on consumers with cardiac problems. Those are the immediate effects, but we do not know anything about the possible effects of repeated ingestion of small quantities of residue over an extended period, such as would result from supplies of clenbuterol-treated meat being sold on a consistant basis in a particular area.  There is no way of knowing the potential effects of that type of dosage over a period.</P>
    <P>Clenbuterol in powder form can be lethal to an ignorant user.  There are documented cases of ignorant users mixing this powder into feed without using protective gloves or masks who have died soon afterwards from massive heart attacks.  The main physiological effect of this substance is to increase the heart rate and a person using the substance in powder form is liable to inhale it and undergo the same effects as animals who are treated with it.  Ingestion in that manner is usually at a much higher level than that which an animal would get in its feed.</P>
    <P>The use of this product produces short term gains for the unscrupulous user. Treated animals appear to have a better conformation and, therefore, command higher prices, given the system we use for pricing beef animals in our factories, a subject which we could debate for several days.  The meat those animals yield following treatment is much tougher and less palatable than untreated meat.  Apart from the malignant effect on consumers' health, there is also a substantial effect on the palatability of the product.  Continued and widespread use of clenbuterol would inevitably degrade the quality and damage the image of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives sweeping and comprehensive <Col N="1535" /> powers to the Minister, to authorised persons, to the Garda Síochána and to Customs and Excise officers. People might argue that those powers are excessive but the matter must be dealt with in proportion.  The risks to users, consumers and to the image and wellbeing of our beef sector are so great that substantial powers may be justified. However, we must be sure in the first instance that the proposed powers are in fact, required and proportionate to the job required.  We must ensure also that the powers proposed in this Bill are constitutional.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us the benefit of any advice he has received on this issue because it is not as if this is the first time this has arisen.  In previous years similar questions have been posed in regard to the extent of powers given to Customs and Excise officers.  One Bill debated in 1990 dealt with this issue and the Finance Act, 1992, is notorious for having given substantial powers to officials of the Revenue Commissioners. Some of the Minister's partners in Government were unhappy about those powers but they seem to be less unhappy about them now.  They now propose to give such officials analogous powers under the provisions of this Bill.  I am not arguing that those powers should not be given, but I would like to be sure that they are given in a proper manner and that they will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Are the people who are being given those sweeping powers fully and comprehensively trained to recognise what they are being sent out to detect?  Do meat factory inspectors, for example, have sufficient knowledge to visually identify a suspect carcase?  The process must start somewhere.  From my knowledge it is possible visually to identify a carcase that has been treated with clenbuterol, following which the process of testing and examination begins.  Are there any factors which would help livestock inspectors, members of the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers to recognise the use of this substance either in a premises or a herd of <Col N="1536" /> cattle?  Can further information be given to the people being sent out to do that important job, sometimes in dangerous circumstances?  Are we sufficiently equipped or have we access to a sufficient level of service to carry out the volume of analysis that will be needed to crack down on the use of this drug?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; I think the Minister of State was present on that occasion &mdash; was somewhat amused when I asked him a question about an establishment in my constituency which carries out some testing in this area.  Do we have access to enough facilities to ensure that testing is carried out at a level necessary to keep track of what is taking place and, above all, to convince the people who might be tempted to use this filthy substance that it is not worthwhile because they will be caught?  No matter how effective the legislation is, it cannot be fully effective if the resources to apply it rigorously, in practice, are not available.</P>
    <P>I had to smile when I heard the Minister talk about the provision in the Bill for identifying the authorised officers.  The Minister stated that he will be issuing a single composite identity card to those officers.  I would plead with him to make sure that the regulations governing this single composite identity card are more simple and straightforward than those governing blue cards, ear tags and so on for the animals those people will be inspecting.  If this is not the case it will be a nightmare for the people involved.  We might end up sending punches from authorised officers' ears to Abbotstown for examination to see if they have the proper powers.  Simplicity in this regard is of the essence.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a substantial stiffening of penalties and a widening of the scope of penalties to include forfeiture and a ban on keeping animals or being involved in the trade in certain circumstances. I welcome the widening of the scope of penalties.  We want to see these penalties applied and our experience so far is not encouraging.  As far as I am aware, the highest penalty applied so far is a fine of £2,000.  I know the Minister will say that the fines are being <Col N="1537" /> increased substantially under the provisions of this Bill and that is true, but a fine of £2,000 under the existing legislation is at the low end of the provisions in that legislation.  Given the effects of clenbuterol, the price charged for it and the gains that may be made from its illegal use, that level of fine is utterly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Up to the time the recent High Court judgment, to which the Minister referred in his speech, was handed down and put a stop to proceedings, it appears that proceedings had been instituted in only 58 cases, summonses had been issued in 18 cases, the papers were being examined by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 14 cases and 26 cases were under investigation. None of that gives me confidence that this matter is being pursued with the necessary vigour.  In one case where a major seizure of clenbuterol was made in the latter part of 1991 the matter had not come before the courts before the High Court judgment was handed down.  Why has it taken so long for those cases to be pursued?</P>
    <P>The Minister explained why it is proposed in section 22 that summary offences may be prosecuted and summary proceedings instituted within two years of the date of the commission of an offence rather than six months, as the law provides at present.  He said the reason for this was that European Community legislation requires us in such cases to track down where the substance originated, that that could take time and required co-operation with other countries. Is that the reason the proceedings in the cases which have been taken so far were delayed, or is there another reason for this?  If there is another reason for this we ought to know before we pass this Bill into law.  We need answers to those questions before we can be happy that this Bill will deal with the full extent of the problem before us.  There are other questions which also need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission is preparing new measures which will be implemented as part of its campaign to curb the use of <Col N="1538" /> these illegal substances.  The measures being proposed by the Commission include a requirement that producers provide the authorities of their member states with a formal written guarantee that they have used no anabolic substances before they can qualify for any Community funded aids under the Common Agricultural Policy.  False declarations will lead to disqualification from aid for a period of one year for the first infringement and disqualification from aid for an unlimited period for subsequent infringements.  Failure to cooperate with the authorities will also lead to withdrawal of aid.  I should like to know if this Bill is fully compatible with what the EC Commission is proposing. The Commission talks about requiring a formal written guarantee from producers that they have used no anabolic substances. Section 7 of the Bill refers to an implied condition in a contract of sale.  I do not know which of these two requirements will prevail.  Will the EC requirement for a formal written guarantee prevail over a provision in our legislation which says that it is an implied condition of a contract that no illegal substances have been used?  Is the Commission's approach as tough as we would wish it to be?  If all these provisions are in harmony, what measures will be required at national level to ensure that they are all fully and harmoniously put into effect?</P>
    <P>There are two European Community directives &mdash; directives 90/676 and 90/677 &mdash; dealing with the approximation of laws in the member states concerning veterinary medicinal products.  These directives, which date from December 1990, do not seem to have been brought into effect in this country.  Why has there been a delay in implementing these directives? Is this delay in any way connected with the fact that the preparation of this Bill has been going on for some time?  Will the Minister explain the statement in his speech that this Bill provides that future EC legislation in this area of animal remedies will be transposed into national law without, as far as I can see, requiring any further action on our part?  In the light of recent experience a Minister who comes <Col N="1539" /> into this House and says that this Bill or any other Bill will automatically provide in the future for the transposition of EC legislation into national law is what the French would call <i>tres hardi</i> and is chancing his arm more than a little.  I do not think past experience of guarantees like that, even in Bills which have been passed as a result of referenda, is all that reliable.</P>
    <P>The point needs to be made that we need to look very closely at all the possible sources and distribution methods of these substances.  There is a substantial number of wholesalers and retailers of veterinary medicinal products in Ireland. In addition, a good many pharmacists naturally in the normal course of their business deal in veterinary medicinal products.  There is a substantial body of opinion &mdash; and I think the chemical industry in this country would include itself in that body of opinion &mdash; that we need a strict licensing procedure for all those involved in the distribution of veterinary medicines.  There is no such provision in this Bill.  I know that the regulations currently in force were aimed at dealing with the problem of van men who used to appear at marts and other places where farmers gathered.  That is only part of the distribution network.  A licensing provision of the kind envisaged would provide an effective means of controlling and tracking the movement of veterinary medicines.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should consider even for a moment arguing that such a licensing system would be too onerous. After all, it is the Minister and his colleagues who agreed that farmers should be tied up in knots by this new integrated administration controlled system.  This system is frightening the life out of farmers and causing them to lie awake at night because they are afraid they will make a mistake in filling out this enormous form which requires 16 pages of explanations. It requires farmers, among other things, to deduct the area of rock outcrops on their farms from their declaration of area. It almost asks them what kind of cereal they had for breakfast yesterday morning. It asks for information on what fields <Col N="1540" /> farmers had under tillage in 1990, 1989 and 1988.  If farmers get the answers wrong they will be penalised by 1 or 2 per cent in their area aid in future years. The emphasis in that system is very much on administration and control.  If such a system had not been in the works for some time before the Labour Party, with some astonishment, arrived in Government I would almost accuse it of having invented it.  That system is more onerous and interfering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That system is more onerous and interfering than anything I have seen in the record of the old Soviet Union or Central or Eastern Europe. It reminds me of the story about the manager of a nail factory in Russia during the new economic plan of the thirties who was told his factory had to make 20,000 nails in a year.  He asked the planners the very reasonable question, what kind of nails they wanted &mdash; masonry nails, car-pentry nails, round head nails or square head nails.  The answer he got back from the planners was that he had to produce 20,000 tonnes of nails.  The manager got his workforce together and they made one gigantic nail which weighed 20,000 tonnes.  I believe this man ended up in jail.</P>

      <P>The same fate awaits farmers in this country who make a mistake in filling out their IACS forms.  The Department has told us that for most areas of farming enterprise direct aid amounts to between 45 per cent and 60 per cent of farm income.  If farmers make a mistake in filling out their IACS forms they will endanger that proportion of their income.  A Minister who produces a control system of that kind for farmers who are going about their ordinary legal <Col N="1541" /> business should not hesitate for a moment in introducing a control system for veterinary medicines and applying it as rigorously to those people as it is intended to apply it to farmers.  They should apply it to the illegal traffickers. Maybe they should apply it even more to the honest and reputable people who do not get involved in illegal trafficking, to make sure that there is no room left for the peddlers of death and destruction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 is in danger of perpetuating the problem.  One of the reasons for a large part of the Bill is that the High Court found that a doubt hangs over the validity of regulations made in the past under various enactments.  I have consistently argued in the House for many years on a variety of subjects that the making of regulations proposed in section 28 should be limited.  When something important is being done the House should lay down regulations that will not come into effect until specifically approved by the House.  I am delighted to note that I am at least partly vindicated in my view.  If that procedure had been followed more often in the past, especially in relation to legislation concerning European Community basic legislation, much of the content of this Bill would not be needed.  The Bill perpetuates the same mistake.  For years and in all connections I have objected to that practice, and I will object to it again in relation to this Bill.  I invite the Minister to reflect a little, to look back on the reason he has to provide retrospectively to validate a series of regulations and to come to the same conclusion that I have <Col N="1542" /> reached &mdash; that that is the wrong way to do it.</P>

Beidh cuid mhaith le rá againn, áfach, i dtaobh moltaí a fheictear dúinn a bheith riachtanach le go mbeadh an Bille sásúil ina iomlán.  Tá súil againn, nuair a bheidh an díospóireacht seo thart, go mbeidh an Bille seo neartaithe ar bhealaí éagsúla.</P>
      <P>In view of the enormous importance of the agricultural industry to the Irish economy and in view of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms currently being implemented, it is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to promote Irish agricultural produce as being of the highest quality available, not just in Europe but in the world.  To achieve that accolade in the market-place demands the highest standards of excellence at every level through the production chain.  Divergence from the highest standards at any one level can undo all the good work of others in the food production chain who worked diligently to comply with all the legal requirements to ensure the safety and welfare of the animal, the handler, the environment and, most important, the ulimate consumer of animal products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Livestock based production is our primary industry and we should set world trends in standards of excellence that would make Irish food produce most in demand in the world's markets.  We must become the world's brand leaders in the food produce in which we specialise. Because of the structure of Irish agriculture, the animals we produce traditionally pass through many different handlers before slaughter.  After slaughter there are many different handling agents and processes before the final food product is available to the consumer. Every person in that production chain has a vested interest in ensuring that the consumer will have full confidence in the final food product.  The perception of the quality and excellence of the product in the market-place will be a major factor <Col N="1543" /> in determining the value and price of the product, which works its way back along the production chain to the primary producer.</P>
    <P>In such a unique situation it is essential to have an overall controlling body that will rigidly, efficiently and effectively ensure that the highest standards are applied at all stages of production so that a few cannot destroy the diligent work of the others in the production chain.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, some people will seek to make a fast buck irrespective of the long-term damage they may cause, which can and has resulted in death for others and, sometimes, even for themselves.  The evidence given to date in the Beef Tribunal refers to many sharp practices involving relabelling and reboxing for ulterior motives.  Despite the hundreds of millions spent on eradication of TB in this country, little progress seems to have been achieved in attaining the goal of disease-free status.  Many irresponsible practices are mentioned as being the cause of such little progress.  The current angel dust saga is again evidence of the presence of evil people, men and women, who will unscrupulously involve themselves in illegal practices irrespective of the danger to the lives of others or the destruction of the good name of Irish agriculture in order to make personal financial gain for themselves.  These gangsters are murderers, too, because death can be &mdash; and has been &mdash; the end result of their illicit trade.  Does anyone really know how many farmers have died through accidents with angel dust?  Some beef farmers who have worked under very tight profit margins have been tempted to use angel dust, one of whose properties converts fat into lean beef. Those same farmers should realise that angel dust also converts meat eaters into vegetarians.  It is believed, as mentioned by Deputy Dukes, that the IRA is involved in organising the distribution of some of the most lethal drugs in use illegally.  Let us be in no doubt but that the shadow of the gunman will continue to hang over our most valuable industry <Col N="1544" /> until action is taken that will wipe out this ugly, murderous trade.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have called for tough legislation in this area for a number of years past and, though not excusing the delay in bringing forward adequate measures to deal with the situation, we welcome the introduction of this Bill as a necessary and urgent step to deal with the situation.  We still have reservations in regard to the adequacy of the Bill as the proposals by the Minister are really enabling provisions and it is impossible at this stage to judge how comprehensive and effective the regulations will be until we see them.  The extent to which this is mostly an enabling Bill is clearly noted by an examination of section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is in effect the heart of the Bill as under this section the Minister gets sweeping powers to introduce regulations to cover practically every situation involving the manufacturing, distribution and use of animal remedies.  Section 8 empowers the Minister to make regulations relating to animal remedies and ingredients therefor, for the control of the manufacture, importation, exportation, handling, storage, transportation distribution, advertisement or other promotion, sale, supply or use of animal remedies and to prescribe maximum permitted levels of residues of animal remedies in foods of animal origin. Regulations may also provide for the control (including the movement to or from any place, the importation, exportation, sale, slaughter, inspection, sampling and analysis, detention, marking, disposal or destruction) of animals to which animal remedies have been administered and a food derived from such animals and for the charging of fees in respect of such sampling and analysis.  This section also enables regulations to be made giving effect to the Acts of the European Communities and validates regulations already made.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgency of this issue and its grave importance for the agricultural industry, it is essential that this Bill includes a requirement that the Minister introduce the basic regulations within <Col N="1545" /> three months of the Houses of the Oireachtas passing the Bill.  Otherwise, there is the danger that the current unsatisfactory situation will continue indefinitely. If the Minister cannot give the House watertight assurances regarding this matter, the Progressive Democrats will feel obliged to propose amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Even when all the desired regulations are in place, there remains the crucial question as to how efficiently and effectively they will be policed and enforced. It is incumbent on the Minister to spell out in detail the mechanism, the personnel and the resources he will put in place to ensure that adequate and accurate checks are made regularly to ensure that all requirements are complied with. Rigorous enforcement and ruthless prosecution are required if Ireland is to earn a worldwide reputation for excellence in animal food products.</P>
    <P>I expect the Houses of the Oireachtas will approve this Bill, hopefully with some strengthening amendments, but implementation will rest with the Minister and his staff.  We can examine the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage. It constitutes an important step in the direction of protecting the good name and livelihood of our livestock farmers and in guaranteeing the consumer that the food offered is totally free from any substance deemed to be an impurity.</P>
    <P>A major omission from the Bill is any provision requiring the licensing of wholesalers and retailers of animal health products.  There is a strongly held view in the chemical industry that control of distribution and the stamping out of illegal practices will remain a problem until licensing is introduced.  Of necessity such a system would be a complex one.  I accept that its details would have to be set out under reglulations.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister may have power under the provisions of section 8 to introduce such a licensing system but that section places no specific responsibility on him to do so.  If the Minister indicates, in replying to Second Stage, that he proposes introducing such a licensing system for wholesalers and retailers, I will accept <Col N="1546" /> that.  Otherwise my party will consider tabling a suitable amendment to provide for it.</P>
    <P>The concept of licensing involves controlling the products a wholesaler or retailer keeps on his premises.  A wholesaler should only stock prescription medicines if he has vets or chemists as customers.  A retailer should not stock prescription products.  If a wholesaler or retailer breaches his licence conditions he should be penalised up to the point of having his licence removed.</P>
    <P>Licensing should also involve the concept of fitness to hold a licence and should require adequate premises, including keeping sufficient records to allow tracing of products; being able to operate batch recall; adequate stock rotation and appropriate storage facilities, such as fridges, for vaccines and so on.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries advanced major proposals in relation to animal health product distribution routes in Ireland and suggested proposed distribution categories. I will list them as follows &mdash; veterinary surgeon use only; prescription only medicines; pharmacy sale only; licensing seller &mdash; intramammary preparation; licensed seller &mdash; general and general sales list.  FICI identified the type of animal health products that would fall into each of those categories.  Since I am sure the Minister will be familiar with the document I will not go into greater detail on it now.  Nonetheless I should like him, when responding to this debate, to indicate whether he intends establishing such a system on the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to a number of sections.  Section 3 is the one under which the Minister proposes to re-establish the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee and to increase its membership to seven, one of whom will be a nominee of the Minister for Health and the remaining six nominees of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the period of appointment to be two years.  I would suggest to the Minister, in the interests of ensuring that the advice he receives is of the highest order and is independent of any departmental or ministerial influence, <Col N="1547" /> that he should designate bodies who would nominate people whom he would appoint to be members of such a consultative committee.  This is a practice the House has adopted in the case of a number of other bodies which have been established in recent years.  I regret to note the Minister reverting to the old form of merely allowing power in the Bill for ministerial nominees alone.  It is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I am surprised it should occur when the Labour Party are in Government with the Minister's party since they, along with my party, had been advocating this type of approach in the case of the Radio-logical Protection Bill, 1991, which was introduced in my period of office as Minister for Energy when we effected that change.  It was widely welcomed then and was adopted by my colleague, Deputy Harney, in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency, which principle was adopted also in the case of An Bord Pleanála and a wide range of other bodies established under Acts of the Oireachtas. I would ask the Minister to reconsider whether he should be the person to select and nominate such members.  As the Minister knows, there is a tendency to elect party members.  One wants to ensure that the highest possible standards are applied in regard to these matters. There are responsible and experienced bodies dealing with this in the market place.  Their involvement and commitment should be recognised and they should have some role in proposing nominees.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the provisions of section 23 where the maximum fine for indictable offences is being raised to £100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both.  Bearing in mind the huge amounts of money that can be made by people who indulge in this dreadful illicit trade in drugs such as angel dust, I wonder whether a maximum fine of £100,000 is a sufficient deterrent. The Minister might re-examine that.  We should not be afraid to insert exceptionally high figures since, as time passes, we may well find such figures need adjustment <Col N="1548" /> later.  This horrible trade can result in vast sums of money being made by unscrupulous individuals.  We should not place a limit on the courts in the amount of fine they may impose.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 24, I question the disqualification from involvement in the trade on conviction for a second offence. Those who are prosecuted for drunken driving, on conviction of a first offence, have their driving licence suspended.  I wonder whether it would not be better to leave it to the discretion of the courts as to whether disqualification should apply on a first offence.  I do not know why the Minister should consider that only somebody having been caught twice, should be disqualified from participating in the agricultural industry.  I should like the Minister to address that issue when replying.  We can re-examine it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to two EC Directives relating to veterinary medicinal products which are long overdue for implementation.  Directives 90/676 and 90/677 contain a requirement that &ldquo;Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with directives not later than 1 January 1992.  They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof&rdquo;. My information is that we have not yet complied with the directives dealing with this whole area.  I should like to know whether there is some special reason for this.  Will the Minister inform the House at the conclusion of Second Stage what is the real position and whether it is intended to comply with these directives at an early date?  Have I been mistaken?  Have they been complied with?  I understand they have not. The Progressive Democrats will consider whether to table an amendment committing the Minister to regulate for these directives within three months of the passage of this Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas, that is if the Minister cannot give us a satisfactory response to that question.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report furnished to Deputy O'Malley, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, in January 1992 is perceived by this Government as the <Col N="1549" /> blueprint for the future of industrial development and employment.  In a special appendix on the food industry, Culliton highlighted its importance:</P>
    <P>It accounts for almost one-third of the gross output of all manufacturing industry in Ireland with the Irish-owned sector of the food industry accounting for over half of the gross output of all Irish-owned industry.</P>
    <P>As we know, the food industry is by far the most important component of the indigenous sector of Irish industry.  It is largely Irish-owned, the meat and dairy sectors contributing by far the largest part of the Irish food sector.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill it is important to recall what Culliton had to say regarding environmental and health factors and the future prospects for the animal food industry:</P>
    <P>Consumers throughout the Community are becoming increasingly interested in the environment, including farming techniques, animal welfare, use of fertiliser sprays and fungicides, effluent, and other forms of pollution.</P>
    <P>Environmental Protection legislation in likely to intensify during the next decade.  This is likely to constrain the development of the agriculture industry in highly populated countries with highly intensive production-methods such as the United Kingdom, Holland and Denmark to a greater extent than countries such as Ireland. These trends could provide significant opportunities for Ireland if correct policies are adopted.</P>
    <P>Of all the opportunities which may become available to Irish agriculture in the 1990's and beyond, those based on health and environmental factors are probably the most significant.  The Government, farmers, food manufacturing, and related industries should work together to ensure that Ireland achieves a leading and unique position in Europe as a producer of high quality, <Col N="1550" /> environmentally friendly, safe food.</P>
    <P>Future marketing must be directed at identifying and meeting consumer, rather than producer, needs.  Government Departments and State Agencies can play an important role by ensuring that financial assistance for the food industry is concentrated on firms which are driven by consumer needs. Additionally, they must ensure that agricultural and processing research, training and education relate closely to the identification and development of products to meet market needs.  Trends within the rest of the community should be anticipated and led rather than followed by introducing stringent, environmental legislation and regulations. The development and promotion of a clean, pollution free environment should become a major policy instrument for the food industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all parties in this House would subscribe to those views.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I express the hope that the Animal Remedies Bill, 1993, will prove to be a most effective instrument in achieving for the food industry the objectives set before us by the Culliton review group.</P>

      <P>This Bill is both welcome and necessary.  For too long the use of products such as clenbuterol by unscrupulous farmers has put lives at risk and damaged an industry upon which many thousands of jobs depend. However, the context in which this Bill is being presented is unwelcome and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>It has been said that to every human problem there is a solution which is simple, neat &mdash; and wrong.  This month's High Court decision in the Tipperary case shows how wrong a solution can be.  The fight against the illegal use of angel dust has been undermined by the failure of the Legislature while 500 EC directives have been put in jeopardy because the Government pursued a course which was simple, neat and unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Too often legislation is brought before us as a reaction to court decisions.  When this happens people rightly wonder who is in charge: is it the courts, or those whom the people elected to govern?  With the expertise of the Attorney General, the Law Reform Commission, the legal advisers, the programme managers and the public service <i>et al</i> at its disposal the least we should expect from the Government is that it would abide by the Constitution. In the most recent case the High Court ruled that the State acted unconstitutionally and found that regulations introduced by the Minister to comply with an EC directive on veterinary products were invalid.  I would have thought that the first duty of any Minister is to ensure that any regulations introduced do not contravene the Constitution.</P>
    <P>During the short life of this Dáil we have already seen legislation being rushed through on foot of another court decision.  In that case the problem related to public building works which suddenly were found to have been constructed illegally.  We were presented with an extraordinary Bill which has created a lacuna in the planning process.  Today the State has an absolute right to build anywhere and at any time without being held accountable or without there being the usual checks and balances that democracy demands.  This is a direct result of legislation which was rushed blindly throught the Dáil to plug a sudden leak in the system.  A new Pandora's Box has now been opened at a time when the Government is trying to convince the country that it is able to reform the Dáil to make it work efficiently.  Obviously, this Bill covers a lot of ground other than the problem that arose in the High Court; but it is my understanding that the Minister is providing a solution whereby this House will be bypassed in incorporating new EC regulations.  While this may be efficient, it does not sound very democratic.</P>
    <P>One area where it is clear the previous approach failed was in the control of the drug clenbuterol.  The illegal use of this drug continues despite all the promises <Col N="1552" /> that have been made in the House, despite the media investigation, the extensive debates and the fact that there is a tribunal investigating the meat industry. This shows up clearly the gulf between expressions of concern and the reality.  High standards in the meat industry is the catch cry of the day; yet the litany of criminal activities and scandalous disregard for the law is lengthening. The reality was never more clearly expressed than last week when meat plants around the country were on the point of closure, not because of any particular failing of the meat plants but because the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry had cut back on the amount of time spent at the factories by agricultural officers, whose job it is to ensure that standards are maintained.  It was only when the agricultural officers refused to accept these cutbacks and threatened strike action that the matter was taken seriously.</P>
    <P>Shoddy practices in our plants, along with the use of angel dust by unscrupulous farmers, and the failure of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to stamp out this activity once and for all has caused serious damage to our standing as a beef producing country.  Clenbuterol is a lethal substance which is known to be a killer.  It can destroy humans, animals and public confidence. Its continuing use has led to the EC Commissioner, Rene Steichen, advising us to be ruthless in dealing with it.  I wish the Minister well in relation to this Bill and in stamping out this activity.</P>
    <P>The statement follows on a study which was carried out on abuses of the substance in member states.  It is regrettable that the Commissioner chose not to publish the findings.  Too much secrecy does not serve the public good.  We should know the extent of the problem in Ireland compared with other EC countries and we should know his findings in that regard.  Otherwise, there is always the danger of complacency and that we may presume that by introducing stiff penalties somehow the problem will be solved.</P>
    <P>We need to look carefully at the international <Col N="1553" /> trade in angel dust and at those criminals at home who feed off this lucrative and lethal trade in drug abuse.  If our objective is to develop a beef industry of the highest quality which can flourish in the future in an increasingly competitive market we are going to need more than a law which penalises the use of illegal growth promoters and controls veterinary products.  In every part of the meat business we need an inspection process which is extensive, expert and up-to-date. Let me cite the cold meats sector as an example.  Full training is not provided for agricultural officers who have been given the important task of applying complex EC directives.  This training should be provided for these officers.  We need proper management of resources so that the budget is spent most effectively and the best return may well be achieved through not spending quite so much on highly expensive veterinary officers but by examining how this work could be done by technical staff and employing more officers within the overall budget.</P>
    <P>The Culliton review group carried out a comprehensive study on the future development of the food industry.  Last week the expert group on the food industry presented its report, which called for a strategy which is broadly in line with the Culliton proposals.  One of the most glaring weaknesses of the expert group's report is that that group did not include anybody who represented consumer interests.  It was left to the retailer, Senator Feargal Quinn, to raise critical points in relation to the weaknesses of the report.  Today we received a commitment from the Minister that he will take the concerns of consumers into account, but the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to recognise the central importance of the consumer may well undermine opportunities to create jobs in the food sector in the future.  The report should have included an in-depth analysis of changing patterns in consumer demand.</P>
    <P>The Culliton review group argued the case for business-to-business sales and in favour of providing food ingredients in line with the growth in prepared food, <Col N="1554" /> but the expert group adopts a different approach and argues in favour of branding. Both cannot be right and it is clear that there is a conflict.  If we are to assess the future needs of consumers we need to know much more about them.  The failure to include representatives of any consumer groups in the make-up of that expert group shows how underdeveloped the Department's approach still is.</P>
    <P>Today I listened to a report on the findings of a recent study in the United States which contains some surprising information in relation to dietary habits. We are all aware that people are more health conscious now; but this survey shows that all of a sudden people are eating more fat, taking less exercise and starting to smoke.  We need to know why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We need to know the reason for this change and why consumers make certain decisions.  An important step would be to include consumer representatives in any future strategy in relation to the food industry.  In this regard it must be remembered that women make up the vast number of consumers and they will decide whether we have a food industry.  We have come very late to the idea that the consumer is central to the whole matter of food production. For too long the producer has dominated and benefited from our position in the EC while the consumer has come out a poor second best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> In relation to veterinary products and additives to meat, it is clear that the over-whelming demand from consumers is for a &ldquo;green&rdquo;, chemically free product.  Lip service is paid to this notion and there is a great deal of talk about producing green products in future but it is interesting to note that in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry this year there was a reduction in the expenditure for the development of organic farming.  That is a minority niche, but it is still growing and it is a great surprise to me that we do not see the potential that lies in organic farming, particularly in a country like Ireland where we can sell ourselves as being environmentally friendly.  The larger question of a green approach to nonorganic farming needs to be built on the firm foundation of research and an awareness of what the consumer wishes to buy rather than on what we can produce.  A weakness in the report on the food industry is that there is not sufficient attention or concentration on what people want to buy.</P>
    <P>A wide range of animal and fish will come under the remit of this Bill which controls the use of veterinary products as part of the general EC trend to protect traditional agriculture against modern technological advances.  At a time when the EC is trying to reduce output, the capability of bio-technology is to increase it and the EC decision in 1988 to ban all growth hormones, including natural implants, was a result of consumer pressures as well as the economic reasons for such a decision.  Mr. Alan Gillis recently questioned this decision and called for a rethink on it.  At a time when the appetite of the consumer for a chemical free product is growing and Ireland is promoting a green image in all areas from tourism to agriculture, there seems little point in either he or the Minister of State reopening that debate.  However, the question still remains, and in the longer term it is important, as to Irish and EC policy on the relationship between agriculture and modern technology as a whole; this includes advances in veterinary products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> We need to ensure that the impact of technology benefits the development of Europe's food industry.  Understandably, given the high number of farmers, the EC adopts a cautious approach to the question of bio-technology.  If, as a consequence of that caution, bio-tech companies concentrate their research in laboratories in the United States rather than in Europe, the future of European and Irish agriculture may end up at a disadvantage in the long term.  We need to be conscious of this.</P>
    <P>A full assessment of how consumer patterns emerge and change is urgently needed and participation by consumers as equal partners in the food industry is critical to that process.  Any expert body set up to oversee and plan development in the industry must include consumers, indeed any consultative committee set up to advise the Minister on animal remedies that may be damaging to the interest of the industry must also provide for the role of the consumer.  Deputy Molloy has already raised this matter.  There was a great deal of dissatisfaction when the caretaker Government brought in many political supporters and people who did not seem to have justifiable reasons for being appointed to State boards at a time when the general public was expecting better representation and expertise from people in a position to wield power and influence.  In this regard there is an opportunity to set the record straight and to ensure that this consultative committee represents fully the interests that have a right to be there and have a contribution to make.  When the committee makes recommendations it would be of value if they were made public so that we all know why something is being banned. At the end of the day if we are to alter radically our approach to the business of producing, processing and marketing food from our natural resources, the consumer needs to be central to that change. Unhappily the approach taken by the Department so far has failed to make that critical leap but it is vital to the success of any modern Irish food industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comprehensive <Col N="1557" /> Animal Remedies Bill, 1993. It deals with the regulation of animal remedies and regulates the remedies that may be administered to animals and the testing of food deriving from treated animals.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way from the days of the misuse of drugs such as stilboestrol, testosterone, chloramphenicol and naturally and synthetically produced hormones in veterinary practices.  A conglomoration of antibiotics was sold to farmers by people operating at marts from the backs of vans.  These products were also advertised in every farming journal and agricultural newspaper and were claimed to be the cure for all problems.</P>
      <P>We moved from the knowledge we had acquired during the war that sulphonamide treatment does not build up the same resistance in animals.  It was a pity that we moved so quickly after the discovery of penicillin to the <i>ad hoc</i> administration of antibiotics as a cure for everything.  It was believed that antibiotics could cure everything, so much so that due to over usage over a period animals built up a resistance to the normal use of antibiotics.  Antibiotics for a wide variety of diseases were being sold on the side of the street, indeed people used them for the treatment of mastitis &mdash; or for what they considered to be mastitis &mdash; without as much as taking a bacteriological culture from the animal or trying to find out to what treatments the bacteria were sensitive.  The veterinary profession had a major problem in trying to convince the farmers that this might not be the route to follow in the treatment of animal diseases.  Sows that were unable to produce milk for their bonhams were injected with stilboestrol. This was done in the knowledge that these pigs would be used for human consumption. This substance had such a detrimental effect on the female population that irreparable damage was done by those who wanted an instant solution to their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have moved a long way down the road from that position.  Testing was introduced and carried out by the co-operative <Col N="1558" /> movement in the dairy industry and other areas.  Milk contaminated by antibiotics was proven to be unsuitable in the manufacture of cheese.  A requirement was introduced whereby milk contaminated with antibiotics was discarded. This resulted in a major economic loss to the farmers concerned because they were not allowed sell this milk into the food chain.  Because the farmer was penalised in this way the widespread misuse of antibiotics was soon brought to an end.  Only then did we get down to the proper management of mastitis and other infectious diseases that caused widespread concern to people involved in animal treatment.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in this regard.  I agree with Deputy Dukes &mdash; I find it difficult to agree with him because he is a most disagreeable person &mdash; in that the Bill is only as good as its operation on the ground.  Competent, trained staff should be available to ensure that people who misuse substances in the production of food, thereby endangering the livelihood not alone of humans but also of animals, are penalised.  Unless officials have power to enter farms, whether in County Tipperary, which has been named as being involved in this despicable practice, or elsewhere, this legislation will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>I have memories of debating and supporting the Abattoirs Bill which was put in place as a result of a requirement in an EC directive that the highest standards apply in the killing of animals and the preparation of meat for consumption. Under that Bill powers vested in the Minister were transferred to local authorities without making available the necessary funding to properly carry out the job.  A specific amount of money was to be used by local authorities to employ veterinary surgeons who would ensure that slaughtering was properly carried out and meat was properly prepared, hung and stored.  This work could be done only by a team of professionals at local authority level, for which provision was made by order.  However, local authorities have been unable effectively to carry out the work without extra funding, over and above that provided for in the <Col N="1559" /> legislation.  The local authority in my area expends in the region of £65,000 per year in addition to that provided for under the Act.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the necessary staff and resources are available to implement legislation such as this.  Until that is done we will be unable to carry out the work.  It is very difficult for small producers and butchers to meet the strict requirements, to which none of us objects, unless additional funding is made available.</P>
    <P>As regards meeting requirements laid down in EC directives, we have been proved to be probably more pro-European than anybody else.  We have adopted regulations and directives over the years in the hope that our food will achieve the highest standard and reputation. In spite of the fact that it has been sullied in the last number of years by individuals who managed to maintain control over the bulk of the food chain, people still perceive the Irish product as being clean and hormone free, produced in an environmentally friendly climate. We have a green image and it is important that we meet requirements laid down in directives.</P>
    <P>Many of our neighbours in the Community have abused and disregarded EC directives.  Our small farmers and butchers have been penalised in this regard in the knowledge that there is total disregard for regulations in other countries where in some cases people carry carcasses of animals on their shoulders from an open truck to the butcher shop, where meat is prepared and sold to the consumer. The strictest regulations are in operation here but very little assistance is provided in meeting the requirements.</P>
    <P>There is deliberate misuse by farmers, dealers and illegal organisations of the product known as angel dust.  Many people use it as a fund-raising product.  It is used with no consideration for the animal's life or for the lives and health of the consumers.  The people using this product employed the best legal advice available to them and found the State negligent under the Constitution, proving legally <Col N="1560" /> that they could escape their responsibility. These people are criminals, they are almost guilty of murder and no reduction in penalties imposed on them should be tolerated.  Whether a penalty is at the discretion of a justice or laid down in legislation it will not be severe enough to be a disincentive to the users of this commodity.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the increase from 16 per cent to 21 per cent of VAT on clothing and footwear and calls on the Government to reconsider this measure in view of the fact that since 1991 this particular VAT rate has more than doubled and is now higher than the UK rate and as this will lead to increased clothing imports, substantial job losses, both in the retail and manufacturing sectors, and increased sales of clothing and footwear through the black economy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the budgetary measures, the measure that has evoked uniform hostility amongst all people has been the decision, in the abolition of the 16 per cent VAT rate, to increase VAT on clothing and footwear.  VAT on clothing and footwear is a most contentious issue, as we know from 1982.  We are dealing with a necessity for ordinary people.  The point that has impacted most severely is the certain knowledge that this measure will destroy about 3,000 jobs.  What makes it unacceptable to all segments of this massive industry is its selectivity and <Col N="1561" /> severity.  VAT has been increased from a 1991 rate of 10 per cent to 21 per cent. The rate has more than doubled in less than two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his PR machine made great virtue of the fact that labour-intensive industries should be fostered and helped.  Before the budget there was a huge protest by hairdressers and their rate was reduced to 12.5 per cent.  The VAT rate for garages was brought to 12.5 per cent and the rate for the confectionery industry was also reduced. With regard to all those labour-intensive sectors the argument as to the effect of increased VAT was acknowledged, but in the case of clothing and footwear the rate was increased to 21 per cent.  It is this selectivity and severity which is causing such pain.</P>
    <P>Later I will detail surveys showing the depression in the industry.  Ten footwear units in this city have closed in the last fortnight.  This occurs at a time when the clothing and footwear trade is experiencing a severe depression due to the general recession, unemployment levels and the weakness of consumer spending power.  There is no doubt that the effects of the multiples in the retail trade are just a crystalising of what is a very painful process of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>We are basing this debate primarily on the issue of jobs.  There are 16,500 people employed in the manufacture of clothing here.  Surveys in the industry indicated that at least 10 per cent of existing jobs are at risk in that sector.  That means 1,500 jobs will face the axe immediately. At retail level, a further 10 per cent contraction would result in the loss of 2,000 jobs.  It is generally acknowledged that we have 3,500 legitimate outlets employing 20,000 people.  The loss of 3,000 jobs which we estimate is conservative.</P>
    <P>VAT is normally considered to be a tax on consumption.  Given the constraints of the market place which mean that the industry cannot pass on an extra 50 per cent, a 30 per cent increase in the tax, what are they faced with?  If manufacturers increase the price of their product for the tax man, they will sell less. They have to absorb this VAT increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> Given the depressed demand for clothing and footwear products, it would be counterproductive for the trade to raise their prices as it would only result in diminishing returns.  This means that the industry, out of their meagre margins, will have to bear the brunt of this tax increase.  That can only result in reduced margins, greater losses, more closures and fewer orders for the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>Further jobs will be lost due to the disparity between the standard rate of VAT here, in Northern Ireland and in the UK.  I am sure that when the Minister introduced his budget he was convinced that Mr. Lamont, in the UK budget, would increase his standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to at least 18 or 19 per cent.  Mr. Lamont made no such change and now we have this huge disparity in the rates of VAT which means more clothing imports and more jobs lost. When one adds this to the abolition of VAT at the point of entry one can see a huge cash flow benefit for people who source their clothing material abroad. This is a direct job loss.  There will be a decline in the market share on the domestic market for Irish clothing manufacturers. It should be acknowledged that the Irish Republic is the largest market for the UK clothing industry, accounting for £314 million of sales, representing 17 per cent of their clothing exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play of the fact that so much of our clothing material is exported and there is no VAT on exports, so that our exports will not be affected.  Anyone in the industry can tell us that a viable domestic base, particularly for small manufacturers, is an essential ingredient to a thriving export sector.  If we decimate the domestic sector we will jeopardise the export sector.  This Government is jeopardising their prospects.</P>
    <P>At retail level, there have been constant complaints among those operating in the 3,500 retail outlets paying VAT that they have faced unfair competition from the black economy.  This primarily comprises casual traders.  In every city and town we have designated areas where <Col N="1563" /> once a week or once a month we have casual traders.  I do not know to what extent the VAT man or the tax inspector scrutinises their books, as they do any time a draper looks for a VAT refund. With the increase in the VAT rate, the competitive advantage for someone who is not registered for VAT will be even greater.  Those that are paying their rates to the local council, their full PAYE, PRSI and VAT will be at a huge cost disadvantage and will lose market share. Similarly, traders operating in the retail sector in Border counties, because of the disparity between the UK and the Irish rates, will see yet again an increase in cross-Border trade, which we thought we had eliminated.</P>
    <P>It is always the case when any Opposition party proposes tax reductions that the Government emphasise the loss of revenue if the rate is reduced.  In 1992 when the rate was 16 per cent the combined revenue from VAT on clothing and footwear was of the order of £144 million. The breakdown was £118 million from clothing and £26 million from footwear. It is anticipated that the increase of 5 per cent will bring in an additional £30 million.  My experience indicates that the level of revenue will not reach £30 million as forecast.  Even if that was the case, there is an obligation on Opposition parties who put forward motions of this kind &mdash; regarding spending or cuts in taxation &mdash; to specify how they will be paid.  There is a point of diminishing returns here which I do not believe is £30 million. Leaving that aside I am very concerned about the drift of this Government and the lack of controls by the Minister for Finance.  Things are now happening in Fianna Fáil that would never have happened in Mr. MacSharry's time.  Every time Labour Ministers speak they commit themselves to at least £10 million. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins announced a new Irish television station costing in the region of £14 million which will lose £5 million per year.  Having won an Oscar we now have to spend £10 million on a film board.  Commitments have been <Col N="1564" /> made in the area of child care and indeed in each spending Department on a daily basis.  All this indicates that we have a tax and spend Government.  The people's hard earned money is easily spent.</P>
    <P>Out of £10.5 billion of public expenditure there is ample scope for savings.  I am convinced I could find savings of £30 million under the headings of waste, duplication, administration, etc., where pertinent questions could be asked.  The Tánaiste's office costs £831,000 per annum, not to provide additional public services, but to bolster his ego.  The list is endless.  During the lifetime of this Dáil I would be happy to name areas where spending can be reduced.</P>
    <P>In the tax area alone I am concerned that we now have a 10 per cent tax rate on special savings accounts, which are heavily marketed by banks and building societies.  There is a limit of £50,000 per person.  The only condition is that one must give three months' notice of withdrawal. There are no conditions attached to this money yet if somebody in this House or elsewhere invests in a business and creates jobs and if the three out of ten small businesses which survive get through the jungle of red tape, the difficulties of extracting market share and making a profit, they will be taxed at 40 per cent, having paid PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  Do we want to give the message to people that if they win the Lotto or come into money they can put it into guaranteed savings accounts where it will not incur a risk and will be taxed at 10 per cent whereas if they work they will be taxed at 27 per cent or possibly 48 per cent and will also have to pay an income levy, a health levy, a youth levy and PRSI?  If we are interested in jobs this is the wrong message to send.  There is a multiplicity of waste and the Government should have no difficulty in finding savings of £30 million within the VAT code.</P>
    <P>In the context of this debate I have received many complaints about the interpretation of sizes in clothing and footwear for adults and children.  The Revenue Commissioners interpreted that anything above the normal size for an 11 year old is adult wear but a big eight <Col N="1565" /> year old may require a size for an 11 year old.  Because of the interpretation of sizes the vast majority of clothing and footwear products have a VAT rate of 21 per cent.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that definition.  I have here a list of shops which have closed since January 1993 from the Fashion and Footwear Federation &mdash; which was faxed to me today: Boylan's Shoe Shop group &mdash; eight shops closed; Nova Shoes &mdash; three shops closed; Vive Shoes &mdash; three shops closed as well as a number of closures in Walkinstown, Ashbourne, Palmerstown, Dublin 6, Cork, Rathkeale, Abbeyleix, Wexford, Monaghan and Birr.  Is this the Minister's message to the clothing and footwear sector?  We are all aware that the clothing and footwear sectors are very competitive and this is the first time the clothing industry has got together.</P>
    <P>On 23 March 1993 &mdash; I think the Minister was out of the country on that day &mdash; some 8,000 people filled Molesworth Street and Kildare Street to protest that their livelihoods were being extinguished by this measure.  Trade surveys have been carried out during the past 12 months in regard to the decline in the trade.  The VAT crisis Futura special report states that the picture which emerged for the first quarter of this year showed that as many as 79 per cent were down on the corresponding first quarter of 1992. Already the devastating effects of the increase have been witnessed in Clerys department store which employs in excess of 400 staff.  Last week the store management announced that 60 jobs were being lost.</P>
    <P>Every day in the newspapers I read that the Finance Bill will be pro-jobs, the Minister for Finance said that the budget was pro-jobs.  This single measure will destroy more jobs than the total of the most optimistic forecast of all the other measures put together.  If the Minister is really concerned about jobs and safe-guarding them that is not the way to do it.  I realise the Taoiseach in America announced the creation of 2,000 jobs. Later he announced the creation of another 600 jobs but I cannot see how they will be created.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> Of all the budgetary measures this is the most iniquitous and negative in relation to employment.  Perhaps the Minister now sees the error of his ways. There is no point in doing a little for knitwear or trying to divide the manufacturing and retail areas.  This is a crisis in the labour intensive sector.  They have a just case and I urge the Minister to respond immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Yates, on this motion. The reaction of those involved in the clothing and footwear industry to a nonsensical and illogical VAT increase from 16 per cent to 21 per cent is justified.  The Minister is apparently unaware that the industry is going through one of its most turbulent and unstable periods and it should be automatically supported. Instead the Minister dealt the clothing and footwear industry the cruellest blow. This was done by the Government &mdash; the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties &mdash; to raise funds that will probably be used to fund their elaborate team to oversee the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>Not one member of the Labour Party is present to hear this debate.  It does not take from the fact that on budget night they walked through the lobby in support of this massive hike which, in effect, sounded the death knell of many traders in the footwear and clothing industries in our towns and cities.  No notice has been taken of the fact that since 1991 the VAT rate has more than doubled and, unfortunately, it is now higher than the UK rate.  Fine Gael strongly opposes this detrimental penalty because it will cause an increase in clothing imports and substantial job losses in the retail and manufacturing sectors.  Furthermore, it will cause hardship to those on low wages and to social welfare recipients.  All businesses looked to the budget of 1993 for strong and convincing evidence that this Government recognised the need to restore competitiveness in our economy. Business sought a budget which would boost confidence, investment and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several months the economic and <Col N="1567" /> commerical environment has been dominated by the currency crisis and by exorbitant interest rates, and the scope for business to plan effectively has been severely damaged.  There was an opportunity in this budget to improve conditions and begin recovery but, sadly, that opportunity was missed.  The Government has exacerbated an already difficult situation for the clothing and footwear industry with its inappropriate and unjustified action in increasing VAT by a further 5 per cent.  The Minister has the audacity to state that the budget was framed on the principle that the overriding national priority was job creation; yet he introduced a measure that will damage our competitiveness and result in a severely unhealthy environment for business and employment growth.</P>
    <P>The Irish clothing industry is going through one of its toughest and most difficult trading periods.  We all notice that the annual summer and winter sales are now replaced by discounts, even during what we would normally consider peak trading months, and the volume of stock sold at half price is increasing.  As one business person said, it is now even difficult to satisfy the customer at the half price sale. This is an indication of the extent of the problems in the business caused by a decline in disposable income as a result of high unemployment and massive interest rates.</P>
    <P>The businesses directly affected by this hike in VAT are in general family run businesses that have never received grant or aid from this State but who are providing many valuable jobs in our towns and cities.  They have already been the unpaid and unrecognised tax collectors of this country.  Now the Government has used them as an easy and uncomplicated means of providing additional funds to the Exchequer.  The people involved in the clothing and footwear industries have been exploited and discriminated against by being singled out for such a regressive and unacceptable VAT increase.</P>
    <P>In order to survive the vast majority of retailers have to absorb the VAT increase themselves.  They realise that further <Col N="1568" /> price increases will reduce sales, thus damaging the future of their businesses. What strategy had the Government in mind by imposing a 5 per cent increase in VAT on clothing and footwear?  It is not only difficult but impossible to comprehend. It must have been crystal clear to the Minister that the net result would be a reduction in employment and a decline in the VAT intake.  I doubt if this will raise the additional £30 million the Minister estimates.  This measure must stand out as the most ill-conceived, illogical and worst notion dreamed up by a Minister for Finance for decades.</P>
    <P>The severity of the increase is exceptional. In 1991 the VAT taken on adult clothing and footwear more than doubled.  This happened at a time when due to increased costs and static prices the profit margins in those industries are constantly declining.  There was a time when new retail shops and boutiques were mushrooming all over the place. That time is long gone and instead numbers of premises are papered with closing down signs.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for business people to accept the Government's reasoning in selecting exclusively this sector for such a massive VAT increase.  Other business sectors had their VAT rates reduced from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent on the basis that this reduction would boost job prospects in these sectors.  The Minister for Finance must explain why the clothing and footwear industry could not also boost job prospects following a VAT reduction.  The Minister should explain why he believes a VAT reduction was not merited by the clothing and footwear industry on the basis of its potential to boost job prospects.  I do not believe the Minister can give a convincing explanation of why this industry was selected for this dramatic and unexpected penalty.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the Minister has under-estimated the importance of the clothing and footwear industry to the Irish economy. A survey conducted by FÁS in 1991 showed that the domestic market output supports 7,000 manufacturing jobs and the Irish market for clothing is valued at £700 million.  Fashion retailing <Col N="1569" /> employs 15,000 and half of those jobs are directly dependent on the domestic market.  It is conservatively estimated by those in the industry that up to 3,500 jobs are threatened by the action of the Minister for Finance on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.  Substantial job losses have already occurred, forced by the lack of confidence in the future of this industry, and the list was shown here tonight by Deputy Yates.</P>
    <P>The high level of tax will also, sadly, provide an incentive for casual traders to avoid payment of VAT, and an increase in casual trading at the expense of legitimate retailers has widespread commercial consequences.  It is estimated that casual traders by their tradition import almost 100 per cent of their merchandise requirements while independent retailers support Irish fashion merchandise.  This is a very serious problem. Any growth of the casual trading sector will result in a substantial loss to the Exchequer.  The net result of the budget measure may be a reduction in the uptake from VAT on clothing rather than an increase.</P>
    <P>The responsible force of action must be to reverse this decision.  The Minister for Finance and the Government must dare not to be too proud or too stubborn to change their mind.  The stakes are too high, the costs excessive and the livelihoods of too many are at risk.  It is not too late to admit that the interests of the industry and of the country will be best served by withdrawing this measure.  If the Minister for Finance still wants the overriding national priority to be jobs he now has the opportunity to put his words and his commitments into action.  I ask the Minister to withdraw this punitive and regressive tax and allow those in the clothing and footwear industry to survive and grow from strength to strength and thereby recognise their contribution to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to compliment my colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, spokesman on Finance, for introducing this motion.  He was reflecting the views of many when he put down this <Col N="1570" /> motion and I would regard it as one of the more serious Private Members' motions to be put down in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that he made a serious mistake in raising the VAT rate from 15 per cent to 21 per cent. There was a serious lack of forethought in relation to that decision.  I find the Minister's amendment to this motion quite amusing.  In regard to the Minister's Financial Statement of 24 February, he praised it in terms of its potential to generate and sustain employment.  That has a very hollow ring and is an insincere approach to this very serious Private Members' motion.  The Minister must be aware that this measure is not conducive to creating employment and is in stark contrast to a reduction given in other sectors from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent. We do not begrudge those decreases to the hairdressers, to garages, confectioners, etc., but if the Minister was serious about harmonising VAT rates he would have considered reducing VAT rate on the clothing and footwear industry from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent and might have given a stimulus to job creation and helped to create the environment that is required at present.</P>
      <P>Ministers have told us that job creation is the be-all and end-all of everything and that county enterprise boards are being established on a national basis.  There is much speculation in regard to those county enterprise boards, the ultimate objective of which will be to create small pockets of jobs in various counties.  A sum of £25 million has been allocated in that regard.  This has come about because of a vision the Taoiseach held formerly. He feels he must sustain that vision and the Minister for Finance feels he must implement it in the budget.  I would contrast that with the dichotomy in relation to this VAT increase in an industry where jobs have already been lost.  The Minister is well aware of the job losses which occurred because of procrastination in regard to devaluation and which drove many clothing and footwear industries out of business.  The Minister's talk of job creation rings very hollow and insincere with me and he should recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> I applaud the group of 8,000 retailers, manufacturers and distributors who got together from all parts of the country to march to the Dáil at their own expense. By galvanising their support those company directors and employees showed they had the spirit to maintain and create jobs.  Yet it appears their efforts were ignored and have been in vain.  The retailer is a significant employer.  In every small town throughout the country drapery shop owners have experienced difficulties in regard to other taxes and the Minister has now introduced a further punitive measure in an effort to drive them out of business.  The clothing industry is very sensitive.  It is prone to large imports from the United Kingdom.  We import £340 million worth of clothing from the UK annually; indeed we are the largest importer of clothing and footwear from the United Kingdom.  We must also compete with Third World countries and the effects of the Multifibre Agreement. Prior to Christmas a large chain store introduced a premature sale which distorted the whole market-place and had an impact on every retailer here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about encouraging indigenous industries he should reduce VAT to at least 16 per cent.  Since 1991 it has doubled and yet we have a deteriorating economic climate.  It has been indicated that up to 3,500 jobs are threatened and the Minister will ignore those figures at his peril.  If he does not support this motion we will continue to remind him about the job losses in the clothing and footwear industry that will result from this punitive measure.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other levies, duties and conditions applying to those industries, we operate a punitive regime as opposed to our counterparts in the UK. As Deputy Yates correctly stated while the Finance Act is intended to be biased in favour of jobs, this has been disproved in regard to the budget.  It has been projected that the Minister may introduce a concession in regard to employers' PRSI which would be welcome.  But if the Minister believes that will be a palliative for the clothing and footwear industry and <Col N="1572" /> will appease their demands for a reduction in VAT on clothing and footwear and our demands in that regard, he is making a big mistake.  I attended a meeting of retailers and manufacturers recently in Limerick at which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and Deputy Kemmy were present.  It is symptomatic of Government Deputies to attend meetings and make promises.  It is then a case of saying they will do one thing here and doing something different outside.  To be consistent they must believe in the approaches adopted by the Minister and avoid being insincere when they meet groups around the country to discuss clothing, footwear and other issues.  That is farcical and hypocritical.  There is much more I would like to say but I will bow to my colleague, Deputy Allen, who is well aware of the position in Cork.  A logic prevails in what has been said and I call on the Minister not to implement the silly decision made in the last budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available I will endeavour to outline the serious position in relation to this matter.  I met representatives of the fashion and footwear industry in Cork recently.  They were a determined group of people; but it was obvious that behind their determination was a desperation, because they knew that many of their businesses are under pressure and will go to the wall unless the Minister reverses his decision. They were conscious of the contribution their companies are making to the Irish economy and to job creation.</P>
      <P>Having listened to ministerial statements and statements from the Taoiseach in recent weeks regarding job creation, I believe the Government's job creation programme is a sham.  It is the product of a highly paid group of public relations people.  I do not take kindly to the Taoiseach's announcement of phantom jobs faxed home while on foreign visits, jobs which were already in the pipeline from the IDA.  The Government is involved in a highly sophisticated and polished exercise, but behind that facade many of the measures it is introducing will destroy jobs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> The productive sector of this economy is being hammered on a daily basis.  Little action is being taken by the Government in regard to the slick manoeuvering in the financial services area where millions of pounds can be made overnight while the productive sector of our economy suffers.  The Minister should realise that the cost of preserving a job is far less than that of creating one.  If he keeps that in mind he will realise that the decision to raise VAT on fashion and footwear is foolish and shortsighted.  The clothing industry has been dealt a double hammer blow this year.  It was already reeling under the prolonged recession and from high interest rates, not to mention the high commercial rates operating in many of our towns and cities, and the evidence of that pressure is there for all to see.  Many shops have had to close down and the level of stocks in shops in cities and towns throughout the country is very low because of that pressure.  Sales were held prior to Christmas and in addition we had the currency fiasco which was the sole responsibility of the Minister, who was negotiating on the power-broking system while the overall economy was going down the tubes.  That cost this country not only a great deal by way of foreign debt but thousands of jobs were lost.  It also cost the retail fashion and manufacturing industries hundreds of jobs because of the indecision and selfish quest for power by the Government, which left a vacuum here for many weeks.  The greatest hammer blow of all came when the Minister announced that VAT would be increased again in 1993. The Irish market is valued at £700 million and home manufacturers make up 30 per cent of that market.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Taoiseach said this morning, I ask the Minister for Finance to be his own man and realise that this is a productive sector of the economy which cannot afford to be burdened further with more taxation.  More than £3.5 billion is spent on social welfare every year.  Some of the money being spent in that area could, with some ingenuity and imagination, be applied to more productive sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The Minister, and the Government, should realise that we cannot continue to dole out money and create further dependency in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann welcomes the overall thrust of the Finanical Statement of 24 February in terms of its potential to generate and sustain employment and its financially responsible and balanced nature.</P>
      <P>I have stated on numerous occasions that this year's budget was framed on the principle that our overriding national priority is jobs.  At its very core were measures to generate and sustain employment by improving the long term growth potential of the economy and by promoting local enterprise and wealth creation.  It is policies such as these which underpin real and lasting economic progress.  Let us all be clear that there are no popular &ldquo;quick fixes&rdquo; to the national problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no doubt that my budget will enhance the prospect of increased employment creation not just in 1993 but in the longer term.  I should like to emphasise, however, that it must not be left solely to the Government to create sustainable employment opportunities. The partnership and consensus approach which has worked so well in recent years &mdash;<i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; must continue.  Indeed, now is the time to redouble our efforts and renew our commitment to sustained economic prosperity for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental ingredient in both these programmes was the firm commitment <Col N="1575" /> by the Government to adhere to sound budgetary and financial policies. My February budget set desirable and prudent financial targets for the coming year despite an unfavourable economic climate at the time.  This key element of our budget strategy sent an unequivocal message to the markets that we will not relax our strict financial discipline, thereby creating the conditions for lower interest rates and stability in the exchange rate markets.  This firm fiscal discipline is vital to investment, to long term growth, to enterprise and to employment consolidation and creation.</P>
    <P>Recent decreases in interest rates will be of substantial benefit to the economy, including the clothing sector.  Since devaluation, and especially since the budget, interest rate developments have been positive.  There have been very considerable reductions in interbank interest rates, causing retail interest rates to tumble.  The Central Bank's key short term facility, STF, rate has now been reduced some eight times since its rein-troduction in early February to its current level of 8.75 per cent.  Irish interest rates are now well below the levels at which they stood prior to the currency crisis, and the differential between key Irish and German interbank rates is only about half a percentage point.  This is close to the historically low levels achieved towards the middle of last year, and suggests the markets have quickly and fully accepted the new parities of the Irish pound within the ERM.</P>
    <P>The Irish equity market has recovered strongly in recent months.  The overall ISEQ index is up almost 40 per cent from last October.  In addition, gilt market yields have fallen sharply in recent months, particularly since the budget. The yield on ten year bonds is now just over 8 per cent.  More importantly, the gap between Irish bond yields and bond yields abroad has narrowed dramatically since the value of the irish pound was adjusted and particularly since the budget.  At the end of 1992, Irish ten year gilt yields were almost 2 per cent above the corresponding UK gilts; this gap is <Col N="1576" /> now almost eliminated.  The international markets now recognise the fundamental value of Irish gilts and equities and, as a consequence, over IR£1.1 billion of Irish gilts have been purchased by non-residents since the beginning of the year. Strong non-resident interest has also helped to push the equities market ahead.</P>
    <P>All this was achieved, while at the same time generating and sustaining employment. The budget provided for the jobs fund heralded in our Programme for a Partnership Government.  A total of £260 million is being provided for the fund this year, comprising £148 million of expenditure related to the Cohesion Funds, £25 million for the new county enterprise partnership boards, and an additional £87 million to the Exchequer funding of the remainder of the Public Capital Programme. In all, the year-on-year increase in capital spending will total almost £500 million, up by more than one quarter on last year's level.</P>
    <P>This entails a major expansion in investment in environmental infrastructure and in transport, including roads, rail, commercial ports and airports. The expenditure on these projects, as well as giving many new jobs in the implementation phase, will also underpin the longer-term potential for growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise partnership boards, for which, as I have said, I have provided £25 million, will have a mandate to support local initiative through assisting the start-up of small enterprises.  The boards will also have the responsibility for the promotion of tourism locally.  By any standards, the combination of the Public Capital Programme, Cohesion Fund expenditure and the additional expenditure for the county enterprise boards adds up to a very substantial investment stimulus to the economy and a considerable boost to employment.</P>
    <P>The pro-jobs bias in the budget does not end there.  On the taxation side also there are measures that are decidedly pro-business. For instance, the business expansion scheme has been extended and improved, with the lifetime cap being <Col N="1577" /> lifted with immediate effect.  As part of the effort to assist the construction industry, the urban renewal incentives to allow delayed projects to qualify has been extended.  The urban renewal incentives are also available in Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area until 5 April 1996 and 24 January 1997, respectively. Stamp duty has been adjusted to assist the building industry generally.  The improvements in mortgage interest relief will also be of assistance.</P>
    <P>As part of the adjustments to the VAT structure announced in the budget, the Government ensured that particular account was taken of our employment needs by reducing the rate applicable to certain labour intensive services, such as garage repairs, electrical repairs, drycleaning and laundry services, hairdressing, contract cleaning, photographic services and driving instruction.  All such services are now on the reduced VAT rate, which is 8.5 per cent below the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The rates applicable to flour confectionery and non-chocolate biscuits were also reduced substantially in recognition of the employment-intensive nature of the sectors concerned and of the exceptional rate differential which existed <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland for the products involved.  The tourism sector can also be expected to benefit from the initiative in relation to the short term carhire fleet which was announced as well as from the standstill for the excises on petrol and drink.  The continued restraint shown in relation to the mainstream excises reflected the Government's awareness of the need to avoid trade diversion and associated job losses within the radically new environment of the EC Internal Market.  Later I will return to and deal separately with those areas where VAT increases were imposed and which have been the subject of much, selective, criticism.</P>
    <P>The budget also contained measures aimed at improving the flow of equity finance to Irish business, such as the introduction of special investment accounts and the extension of the BES, which I have mentioned already.  The <Col N="1578" /> Government is keenly aware of the importance of equity investment for all Irish companies, whether large or small. The special investment accounts will enable those who invest in Irish equities, either directly or indirectly, to avail of a very favourable tax rate of 10 per cent. To benefit from this low tax rate, the funds will be required to invest 40 per cent of their assets in Irish equities this year, rising to 55 per cent in 1996.  To ensure that the funds are not focused completely on larger companies, there is a further requirement that 6 per cent of assets are invested in smaller companies in the first year, rising to 15 per cent in 1996.  There is no requirement that the equities held have to be in quoted companies. Indeed, there is an extra incentive to invest in BES-type companies, as the income and capital gains from those companies will be ignored for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my budget statement that the Government was anxious that pension funds, in making their investment decisions, should take the needs of the Irish economy into account so as to make a greater contribution to the development of employment.  With the current unemployment situation, it is vital that every possible effort be brought to bear on assisting employment.</P>
    <P>Pension funds are one of the main players in the area of providing non-debt finance to Irish industry by way of equity investments.  However, like life assurance funds and unit trusts, their main interest in this area has tended to be in blue chip stock with the area of venture and development capital being served only to a minimal extent.  My budget day initiative has to be viewed against the background of pension funds assets of close to £10 billion, the recent trend which has seen them increase the share of their total assets in overseas equities and the very favourable tax regime which they enjoy.</P>
    <P>Both my officials and I have been having discussions with the pension fund representatives over several weeks and these discussions are continuing.  While the Government would be anxious to see and would encourage pension funds to <Col N="1579" /> localise a greater percentage of their investment in Ireland generally, our specific concerns in relation to this initiative is to get a constructive unity of purpose between the pension funds and the Government to help address the problem of a lack of equity finance in the small and medium company sector.</P>
    <P>Given this specific target area, it is clear that a very small percentage of the pension funds' assets properly focused would make a considerable difference to the availability of equity funds.  All told, I am pleased with the way discussions with the pension funds' representatives have been progressing and I expect to reach an agreement with them very shortly.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this initiative will provide a worthwhile avenue of investment for the pension funds while helping to address the funding problems of developing indigenous business, thereby promoting employment prospects in the Irish economy.  Indeed, my ultimate wish would be that the success of the initiative would of itself encourage the long term development of the Irish venture capital market, which all institutional investors will come to see as a part, even if a modest one, of their normal investment activity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that two areas, in particular, of the taxation measures which I announced in the budget have been taken out of the context of the balanced overall package and selected for adverse comment.  These are the necessary increases in the VAT rate applicable to certain goods and services and the introduction of the temporary income levy.  I will deal with each of these areas in turn.  By way of introduction, however, I would like to make the general point that some measures to increase revenue were inevitable if we were to maintain a prudent level of borrowing and if we were to remain on course for full participation in Economic and Monetary Union.  That discipline was also crucial to securing the downward movement in interest rates that has already emerged.  In that context, the Government looked mainly to <Col N="1580" /> taxes on spending and assets, so as not to impose any unnecessary burdens on the rewards to effort, enterprise and investment.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my Financial Statement, the primary purpose of the various VAT increases was, of course, to raise revenue. However, the changes involved, which were also necessary to achieve compliance with Community law, have contributed to a considerable simplification and consolidation of the overall rating structure.</P>
    <P>Among the areas previously taxed at 10 per cent were hotel and holiday accommodation, newspapers, building services and short term car hire.  These are taxed at the 12.5 per cent rate from 1 March.  In the majority of these areas, measures were taken to cushion the impact of the increase.  For example, the increases in respect of accommodation and short term car hire will not apply to contracts entered into prior to 25 February last.  In the case of building, account was taken in the provisions in the Public Capital Programme to ensure that the local authority new house building programme and the voluntary housing programme will not be adversely affected by the rate increase.  Because of the effect that the increase will have on the cost of new homes, the grant to first-time house buyers was increased from £2,000 to £3,000.  And, finally, where house building contracts with private individuals existed prior to the budget, the earlier 10 per cent VAT rate will apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the European Community agreements permit the application of only one VAT rate in excess of the agreed Community standard rate minimum level of 15 per cent. Thus, our 16 and 21 per cent rates could not continue to co-exist legally.  Budgetary <Col N="1582" /> circumstances dictated that the standard rate should remain at 21 per cent on this occasion and that certain categories such as adult clothing and footwear and telecommunications services, previously taxed at 16 per cent, should also be taxed at that rate.</P>

      <P>While it would have been possible from a legal standpoint to shift those activities temporarily to the lower 12.5 per cent rate, as was done in the case of certain labour-intensive service industries mentioned earlier, thereby benefiting more than 50,000 jobs, it was simply not possible because of the budgetary cost.  A reduction from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent for clothing and footwear alone would cost the Exchequer nearly £48 million this year in lost revenue and £77 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions since the budget that I recognise that the increases concerned will, in some instances, add to difficult trading conditions.  However, a significant contribution towards budgetary correction from the indirect tax area was unavoidable on this occasion.  Naturally, the sectors facing rate increases feel aggrieved.  The Government, however, have to take a view of what is best for the economy as a whole in terms of promoting economic growth and the sustainable jobs which flow from it.  I do not deny that the clothing sector is a labour-intensive industry at both retail and manufacturing levels.  I must stress that my decision was not taken lightly and, since the budget, I have re-examined it thoroughly following consultations with representatives of the trade.  However, if the budgetary strategy is to remain on target, I cannot rescind the VAT changes at this stage as the consequential Exchequer loss cannot be made good elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed that the higher VAT rate will only encourage retailers to import cheaper supplies and that this will adversely impact on domestically manufactured clothing.  Unfortunately, high import penetration is already a well established feature of the Irish fashion trade: almost 80 per cent of the total clothing market was already being imported before the budget &mdash; a figure which has not changed much in recent years.  I should emphasise that the standard rate of VAT applies to all clothing sold here, regardless of country of origin.  On the other hand, some 65 per cent of Irish manufactured clothing is exported and, of course, will be unaffected by the VAT change here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise particularly the need to sustain a strong indigenous manufacturing presence as a base for developing export <Col N="1584" /> markets.  It is for this reason that at a recent meeting with representatives of the industry, while ruling out any change on the VAT front, I invited them to put forward proposals which would address their cost competitiveness concerns. These proposals, which are wide-ranging, have been received recently and are under consideration.  Time does not allow me to go into the detail of those discussions other than to say that, despite increases imposed on the trade, very useful submissions were put forward to me by the assistants.  I have given a commitment that I will examine those submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I am also well aware that established traders in the clothing sector are concerned about unfair competition from casual operators. Last year's Finance Act gave the Revenue greatly strengthened powers, including the power of arrest and confiscation of goods, to deal with such traders.  The effectiveness and use of those powers is under constant review, but early indications are that they are working well, particularly in relation to hotel sales.  I know that that is creating major problems for various groups that I met, and I shall return to that issue on another occasion when I have more time.</P>
      <P>The Government did not easily decide on the introduction of the income levy. The levy became unavoidable only at the end of long and difficult consideration of the budgetary provisions.  I look forward to going into some of these measures in more detail during debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am sharing my time with Deputy Liam Lawlor, I say in conclusion, that high interest rates damage confidence and investment and lead to a deterioration in employment levels.  The responsible and balanced nature of the budget this year has already been a major contributory factor in getting interest rates <Col N="1585" /> down.  Let us be clear about this.  A hospitable interest rate environment is vitally important for business and for the availability of equity finance.  It is only in stable economic conditions that real sustainable jobs will be generated in our economy.</P>
    <P>The first quarter Exchequer returns published at the beginning of this month are strongly supportive of the overall budgetary projections of the trend in revenue and expenditure.  This has given added and objective credibility to the budget strategy.  The returns are also encouraging in the indication they give of the continuing ability of the Irish economy to accommodate the adverse interest rate and currency environment we faced during the early months of the year. Recent economic developments are indeed encouraging.  Underlying unemployment has fallen for the last two months.  The decline in interest rates represents a substantial improvement in the climate for investment.  The latest inflation figures confirm the price stability of goods and services.  Official figures on industrial output indicate a relatively robust performance by Irish manufacturing during the period of currency-related turbulence.  Our exporters are now enjoying the benefits of devaluation.</P>
    <P>I remain fully confident in the strategy underlying the budget.  As I have said, unfortunately there will be ups and downs, some items having to be increased and others decreased.  Approximately 80,000 jobs will benefit from the decrease.  I know that the clothing industry came out on the wrong side.  In spite of what Members opposite say, in all of the friendly, straight discussions I have had with the industry they have made the point continually to me about the PRSI rates helping their competitiveness, because competitiveness is what keeps them in business.  Perhaps that would not help all retailers.  But I must take into account the personal services sector, garage services and so on, in which sector all of the work is generated within our own economy as against the retail end where 80 per cent of what is being sold represents imported goods.  I know of the difficulties being experienced and I have <Col N="1586" /> agreed to examine some aspects in this and future years.</P>
    <P>I might add that the budgetary objective of reducing interest rates and stimulating growth and investment is clearly working.  I look forward to the support of this House for the forthcoming Finance Bill, which will complement the broad thrust of the budget and give further incentives to the clothing industry in addition to others.  That Finance Bill will address a number of specific issues which will benefit enterprise and employment and which were raised by representatives of the clothing industry.  I might stress that there is no question of departing in the Finance Bill from the overall thrust of the budget and the general thrust of tax reform of recent years.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Carey in one respect, that is there is no real need to have a rehash of the budget debate here this evening.  It demonstrates how futile is the purpose of tabling this Private Members' motion this evening when the predictability of the outcome is so obvious from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill is due to the circulated next week, when Deputy Yates will have every opportunity to table amendments and suggest changes in budgetary policy.  Hopefully he may be somewhat more pragmatic than he was when quoted, perhaps incorrectly, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday to the effect that there was a potential of £30 million which should be found elsewhere within the overall budgetary system.  The Minister has informed the House this evening that the amount will be £48 million in this financial year and £77 million in a full year.</P>

The reality is that a decision had to be taken to move the rate upwards or downwards in order to comply with the Single Market guideline.  I do not for one moment not share other Members' concern that the clothing industry is caught up very much in the whirlwind of international competition. Since some 12,000 people are working in the manufacturing sector, I sincerely hope the Minister will examine the PRSI issue or some other selective support for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to listen to the bleating opposite that it will affect exports.  I should stress that export manufacturing in the clothing sector will not be affected.  Bearing in mind the other budgetary changes, the progressive features of our fiscal policy and the drop in interest rates, hopefully the possible negative effects on clothing sales, where some difficulty might be experienced, will be offset by the overall improved financial climate.</P>
      <P>The House must recognise how useless is a debate on such a Private Members' motion a week in advance of the circulation of the Finance Bill, when all of these matters can be thrashed out again by the Finance spokespersons on the opposite benches.  I would have thought that the time had passed for political party posturing and opportunism, endeavouring to pander to a particular sector by tabling simplistic amendments, knowing full well that we cannot find one penny of alternative funds outside the framework of budgetary policy.  I would have thought also that these would be an end to the practice of Opposition Members coming into the House and talking in millions about housebuilding, health services, social welfare and so on without advancing any tangible solution to the problem of where savings could be made.  I do not disagree with the contention that the manufacturing sector warrants careful handling and support in the matter of international competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane made a point with <Col N="1588" /> regard to equity for the jobs fund.  I was deeply involved in assessing the need for equity for jobs.  Apart from Fine Gael, there was all-party agreement on the dearth of financial equity, particularly for small industries.  It would be an absolute tragedy if that issue were not taken on board and confronted.  It arose in the first instance through consultation with the IDA, the many banking institutions, the private sector and various representatives of Government Departments. They discovered that anybody in the small business sector attempting to start up or run their businesses with equity possibly had to put their homes on the line, to take out second mortgages and so on, because of the problems they encountered in finding equity.  When we discussed with the four main banks how this might be alleviated, they were very frank with us.  The AIB said they had a network throughout their branch system which had not taken off, even though they had allocated £10 million to provide high risk equity for jobs.  The Bank of Ireland had a different formula.  They had a small team located at head office who collected all refusals and assessed them.  They said they had supported 99 small industries, 11 of which had failed. Nonetheless they felt it had been a worthwhile exercise.  The other main banks were also examining how best they could address this issue.  It is totally ridiculous to suggest therefore that that £25 million did not constitute a positive, pragmatic step in the right direction.  Perhaps if Deputies opposite had been involved in the Jobs Forum before the last general election they might have reached the same conclusion as did all other political parties.</P>

      <P>Whatever it may be that the Opposition chooses to put down, they do so without any apology to the Government benches since it is in the nature of Private Members' time that they are enabled to do so.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is that frequently when legislation, such as the Finance Bill, is presented by the Government after much planning and thought it is as if it is a tablet of stone and almost immutable.  Some times it is worth signalling our concerns in advance to indicate to those who prepared the Bill where the concerns of the marketplace lie.  Therefore, the debate tonight and tomorrow night is timely.</P>
      <P>Theoretically, 1 January this year marks the completion of the single European market.  Unanimity is required in respect of taxation matters and because of that it has taken much time to complete the dossier on taxation, in particular indirect taxation.  We have not moved towards harmonisation but rather towards approximation as agreed last October by the Minister for Finance on behalf of Ireland at the relevant ECOFIN meeting.  It was agreed by the Council of Ministers that a EC directive should be introduced in respect of indirect taxation.  Not surprisingly, it is being argued &mdash; this was repeated again tonight, in my view, incorrectly &mdash; that the reason the rate of value-added tax on adult clothing and footwear has increased from 10 per cent to 21 per cent in recent budgets is that we wish to be consistent with the relevant EC directive.</P>
      <P>That EC directive, which was agreed rather late in the day, provides for a transition to the agreed levels by 1996 by which time the Finance Minister will have to decide again on the direction the system should take.  At that time we will have a chance to iron out many of the creases which we have identified already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I wish to ask therefore, in relation to the rate of value-added tax on adult clothing and footwear, is whether this increase was the necessary and inevitable consequence of the tax arrangements agreed to by the Minister for Finance at EC level in October 1992. Since the EC directive provides for a <Col N="1591" /> process of transition, whatever about his ultimate choice in this matter, in the current year and potentially for the next few years the Minister for Finance has discretion not to insist that VAT on adult clothing and footwear be charged immediately at the highest rate.</P>
    <P>In case anyone is in any doubt about this matter the fact that the Minister exercised discretion in respect of other services, such as garage services, repair and maintenance services and various personal services, including hairdressing, confirms that he has discretion and that in this case both he and the Government chose to make a decision which was not in the essential interests of the clothing and footwear industry.</P>
    <P>For the uninitiated, it is easy to argue that the Europeans decreed that we should charge VAT at a standard or upper rate of 21 per cent, but this is not the case.  The agreement reached last October provides for the maintenance of the zero rate on a limited range of goods, a reduced rate and a standard or upper rate.  The only requirement in the EC directive is that the standard rate or upper rate should be 15 per cent at a minimum.  Therefore this is Irish budgetary policy.  As the Minister said tonight, and in his Budget Statement, the needs of the Exchequer dictate that the standard rate of VAT should be 21 per cent even though the EC arrangements specify that it should be 15 per cent at a minimum.  It is clear that the blame for this ill-timed, damaging and excessive imposition on the clothing and footwear sector rests unequivocally with the Government and the Minister for Finance and not with the European Community.</P>
    <P>At Question Time recently the Minister acknowledged implicitly that he currently has discretion in this matter and he explained to the House the reason he used this discretion to protect employment in certain other sectors.  He made the argument once again tonight that, on balance, both he and his advisers in the Department believe that the risk to employment is minimal in the clothing and footwear sectors.  The Minister, and his advisers, are wrong in that regard.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I <Col N="1592" /> reject the Minister's assertion that the clothing and footwear industries, both the retail and manufacturing sectors, will not suffer grievious and unnecessary job losses as a result of this year's budget.</P>
    <P>There is a strong inter-action between domestic clothing manufacturers and the existence of a healthy, independent retail sector.  However, this was lost on the Minister in his analysis of the market place tonight and there is a profound gap in the logic he applies.  The Minister mentioned that imports account for 80 per cent of clothing and footwear sales in Ireland but the remaining 20 per cent cannot be dismissed lightly in terms of the consequences for jobs and the potential for job creation.  Irish clothing manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, footwear manufacturers who have been devastated depend on the survival of a healthy, independent retail sector.  A significant portion of imports are supplied by the large multiples which specialise in the sell-and-wrap technique.  They import large volumes and make a very small profit in terms of the number of units sold.  It is largely a sell-and-wrap business. What the Minister and the Government have chosen to do is to give greater encouragement to those companies and in the process diminish the capacity of the retail sector to survive which provides the critical link for Irish manufacturers who wish to find a space for their products on Irish shelves.  That was the missing link in the Minister's presentation tonight.</P>
    <P>In terms of industrial policy, as the State tries to promote indigenous industry it would be folly to suppose that the domestic market, small as it is, is not of the utmost importance, especially for many small and medium enterprises in the clothing sector.  This is true in the case of successful export oriented small and medium firms which made forays into the export markets once they had rooted themselves in the Irish market.  I do not accept the logic behind the analysis which the Minister presented tonight but in his proposals he has clearly signalled that something will be done in the Finance Bill to alleviate some of the tax burden on Irish manufacturers.  If this happens and it is efficient I will welcome it but <Col N="1593" /> this will not be of benefit to the small independent retail sector.  The key, in terms of the structures in Ireland, is to open the Irish market to domestic manufacturers. This is particularly important for the small and medium enterprises in that sector.  That forms the basis of the Government's industrial policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to his general remarks on the fundamentals of the economy, the Minister said it would cost £48 million this year and £77 million in full year to reduce the rate of VAT on the clothing and footwear sectors to 12.5 per cent.  I was surprised by his figure having regard to the implications this would have for jobs in these vulnerable sectors.  I wish to ask a specific question because I am not certain if the Minister has discretion and I ask him to give a response before the debate closes.  Is it possible to hold any class of intermediate rate this side of 1996 under the EC Directive or is the Minister automatically obliged to catapult goods on to either the lower or standard rate of VAT?  I do not know the answer but if there is any room for discretion I plead with the Minister to explore it and seek to use it.</P>
    <P>On the question of how the Minister might make good the budgetary shortfall, I cannot say where he might find the money but he has enough people employed to look under stones, carpets and other places where the money might come from.  I listened with great care and attention to the Minister's speech on budget day and he said that he hoped that as a result of the budget and the devaluation of our currency, interest rates would eventually come down to much lower levels some time later this year.  I have no doubt that the Minister and his advisers, no less than myself, are pleasantly surprised at the speed and scale with which basic interest rates have tumbled in this economy.  That is bound to have a positive effect on the budgetary arithmetic.  I would like to know before the close of this debate exactly what effect this will have because certainly it was not argued with the same vigour by the Minister when he spoke to this House on budget day.  It is right that we have this debate tonight and that we point to the flawed logic in ignoring the importance <Col N="1594" /> of the independent retail sector and the role it plays in clothing manufacture. It is right that we try to explore any degree of discretion that he may have in terms of the budgetary arithmetic, improved interest rates or EC potential. It is wrong to assume that the EC must carry the burden of explanation for a set of choices determined primarily at home.</P>
    <P>It is folly in terms of trying to encourage an indigenous sector which has a low share of the total domestic market that we should say to hell with it and cast it aside.  That is not logical in the context of encouraging and sustaining indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>With your permission a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share my time with Deputy Martin Cullen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says; and that he cannot please everybody at budget time.  I am sure everybody in this House could take up the fight for every single aspect covered by the budget because somebody is bound to be dissatisfied with it.  What is particular to the clothing and footwear industry is that from the moment the increase in VAT was announced, there was an immediate reaction throughout the entire industry and across both sides of the House.  It is most peculiar but it is becoming a feature of debates that when any difficulty arises the Labour Party absconds from the House.  The party which Deputy Spring and his merry men led on such a merry dance during every Private Members' debate does not now seem to have an interest in turning up to find out what is happening.  It is regrettable but in my view it shows the interest that party has when it comes to the real issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unquestionably the increase in VAT will cause job losses.  It was most interesting to hear the Minister admit tonight that his first criterion is to balance the books, in other words this supersedes the impact on job losses or creation.  The constant reiteration that the Government's priority is jobs and that everything is screened on that basis has been clarified. <Col N="1595" /> The Minister clearly stated that this is not the case when considering the massive 30 per cent increase in the rate of VAT on the clothing and footwear industry. That is regrettable but at least it is honest.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about county enterprise boards and the need to create jobs in the community.  We, more than any other country in Europe, were to the forefront in creating small family businesses. These family-run businesses created sustainable jobs because the people running them had an interest in business and were highly successful in running them for decades.  This has changed in recent times.  We have seen the growth of the multiples and chain-stores which has had an effect on small family-run businesses.  Now we see artificial barriers being created by the Minister which will ensure the further demise of family-run businesses and the jobs that go with them will decrease at an ever increasing pace.  There is something wrong with the policy being laid down by the Government which this Minister represents.  Retailing in the clothing and footwear business in every city and town throughout the country is mainly carried on by independent family-run businesses that give good employment in small communities. I cannot understand why we need county enterprise boards and other community-based information bodies to tell us how to create jobs when we know what is required to sustain jobs in the market place.  We are actually cutting out jobs that can be sustained in the economy.  That is an extraordinary tragedy.</P>
    <P>We may ask where the Minister would find the money to make up the shortfall if he were to change the VAT rate.  The Minister had a windfall because of the rapid reduction in interest rates.  A large proportion of the £30 million required could be found in the provision that the Government made for mortgage interest relief which will no longer be required because of the drop in interest rates over the past number of months.  I suspect that in this area alone we would find substantial savings within the provision the Government had made.  This area <Col N="1596" /> could be looked at.  I do not accept that the budgetary arithmetic on the day the Minister delivered his speech pertains today.  The arithmetic has been totally thrown out of gear by factors in the past number of months.  If the Minister can benefit from windfalls, surely he can alleviate the enormous pressure building up in such areas as the clothing and footwear industry.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the relationship between manufacturing and retailing, particularly in the clothing and footwear sector, is not being taken on board by the Minister.  We are struggling in terms of creating indigenous industries and the clothing and footwear industry offers the opportunity for growth on the manufacturing side.  The Minister rightly pointed out that some £300 million of UK clothing exports come into this country, which is some 17 per cent of the UK total. Surely there is an opportunity to replace those goods with Irish manufactured goods, which in my view far outstrip the quality of goods imported from the UK. Surely the Minister should be encouraging growth in manufacturing as this creates growth in jobs which would have a knock-on effect in the retail sector. By his own admission none of this was considered in the budgetary arithmetic some six or seven weeks ago.</P>
    <P>An opportunity exists to look at the changed situation.  Nobody on this side of the House will berate the Minister for making changes.  It is good that the Minister should be flexible, given the changing circumstances in the past number of months.  The Minister hinted that some movement may be made with regard to PRSI.  I, as indeed do most Members, have a copy of the submission made to the Minister by the clothing and footwear industry.  If he is not going to make changes in the VAT area I can only surmise that he will reduce the employer's rate of PRSI.  Certainly we in this party welcome that, as we have felt for a long time that this has been one of the greatest barriers to creating and sustaining employment.  If the Minister is considering such a move I certainly welcome it, not alone for the clothing and footwear industry but for all industry.  I will be interested to see the Minister's <Col N="1597" /> arithmetic in this regard.  Obviously he has flexibility but he should exercise it imaginatively in trying to create and sustain jobs in this economy.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  In July of last year the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, issued the controversial Directive 14/92 to community welfare officers restricting the discretion they enjoyed under social welfare legislation to make exceptional need payments.  A number of payments were restricted but most hardship was caused in that community welfare officers could assist with only one ESB bill per year, to a maximum of £100.</P>
      <P>The directive was strongly criticised by the Democratic Left Party and by a number of welfare organisations.  Considerable hardship was caused for those on the lowest incomes who found that an important safety net previously available to them was whipped away.  The number of disconnections of electricity increased and it is likely that many other families denied this supplementary welfare allowance turned to illegal moneylenders to pay their bills and keep the lighting and heating in operation.</P>
      <P>The impact of the directive can be seen from the fact that while in September 1991 community welfare officers in the Dublin region of the Eastern Health Board area were able to assist 1,435 families to pay ESB bills, in September 1992, shortly after the Minister introduced the directive, only 1,026 people received help.  Under that directive those people are now precluded from receiving help until September of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following strong public criticism the then Minister, Deputy McCreevy, told the Dáil on 14 October last that it had not been his intention to limit the discretionary power of community welfare officers who make these payments and <Col N="1598" /> that he would issue a further directive to clarify the matter.  While neither Dáil Deputies nor members of the public were allowed by the Department of Social Welfare to see the original directive or the so-called clarification Directive 18/92, Deputies know from experience that community welfare officers were obliged to continue applying the original directive limiting assistance with ESB bills to one occasion a year, and the consequent hardship continued.</P>
    <P>On 4 March last the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, told me she was reviewing the supplementary welfare scheme.  During debate on the Social Welfare Bill last month the Minister, Deputy Woods, said he would be shortly issuing a code of practice for dealing with fuel debts which would replace the directives issued last year.  However, this has not been done and people are still being denied necessary support.  Often at this time of year, when arrears have accumulated during the heavy use winter period, bills are at their highest and people need urgent assistance.  I appeal to the Minister, pending the publication of guidelines, to withdraw the circulars which have caused so much hardship and to allow community welfare officers to make payments as needed, as was the case prior to July last year.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare system is intended as a scheme of last resort.  It is designed to support and assist those who are desperate and who face real hardship if not helped.  Over the years it has ensured that thousands of children who would otherwise be cold have some degree of comfort and that those who would otherwise go hungry have decent meals.  The community welfare officers have done an exceptional job in recent years in administering the system despite its inadequacies and the growth in poverty.  Community welfare officers are now doubly disadvantaged because Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies and Ministers claim that these directives have been overturned and people are consequently blaming the community welfare officers for not giving them assistance. This Government has been trying to con the public by claiming that most of the <Col N="1599" /> McCreevy dirty dozen cuts have been withdrawn, while the fact remains that the majority of them remain in place and continue to cause hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Woods, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, have contested my statements about the cuts.  Perhaps they will accept the verdict of SIPTU, the biggest trade union in the country and an affiliate of the Labour Party, who, in a statement issued last Friday pointed out that in only four of the 12 areas had there been some easing of the cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week I will introduce a household budgetary facility for 10,000 unemployed people in the Dublin area. Legislation has already been put in place to allow for these deductions to be made from social welfare payments with the customer's consent.  The new payment option will help social welfare clients to put aside a set amount towards regular bills, such as ESB and gas bills, so that the prospect of falling into arrears will be reduced.  The ESB and An Bord Gáis have agreed to participate in the scheme. Following the initial pilot phase the scheme will be extended throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am preparing new guidelines for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which will cover all aspects of the scheme, including rent and mortgage payments, exceptional needs payments and other payments under the scheme. These guidelines, which will be comprehensive and detailed, are being prepared in consultation with the health boards.  When finalised, they will be made available and will be publicised for the benefit of clients.</P>
      <P>Separately I am drawing up a code of practice under the system of exceptional needs payments to deal with debts in respect of ESB and gas bills.  I want to establish a standard national practice which would involve health boards and utilities such as the ESB and an Bord Gáis working together in helping people on low incomes with fuel debt problems to meet their fuel bills on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code of practice will involve: a clear indication of the circumstances which will warrant a special payment under the SWA scheme for fuel, whether in respect of a current bill or arrears; arrangements for clients in difficulties to register with easypay schemes operated by utility companies or, altrnatively, the home budgeting scheme operated by my Department; payment of SWA as appropriate, towards arrears which have arisen in the exceptional circumstances as defined and where clients have ongoing problems with meeting fuel debts the health board would contact the utility and would work with the client in meeting his or her current <Col N="1601" /> fuel bill over a certain period.  Any arrears would be dealt with on an agreed basis with the utility.</P>
    <P>My purpose is to provide a service geared to the individual circumstances of people in difficulties which recognises the responsibility both of the client and of the utility company and which uses the SWA scheme in helping to achieve an effective and lasting solution.  The precise details of the arrangements have to be worked out in agreement with the utility companies and the code of practice will include an outline of the arrangements which the utlitities will apply in relation to people with fuel debt problems.  These arrangements will be finalised within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>When the new arrangements are finalised I will publish an information leaflet in conjunction with the interested parties. This will offer guidance to customers who are experiencing difficulties with their fuel bills.  The leaflet will provide information on payment methods, advice on efficient use of fuel, and ESB-Bord Gáis Éireann policy in relation to hardship cases.  It will also inform clients of the circumstances under which assistance with fuel bills may be considered by health boards.  Meanwhile, I want to emphasise that health boards have discretion to make payments in support of ESB and gas bills where they consider that the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair <Col N="1602" /> for allowing me to raise this matter. PDFORRA and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health carried out a series of consultations on the application to the Permanent Defence Forces of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  These consultations went on over a period of two years.  They came to an agreement on a formula which the Authority, the statutorily competent body in the matter recommended to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who has the statutory function of making regulations.  The agreed formula provided a satisfactory level of protection to members of the Defence Forces, while recognising that there are circumstances in which such protection is not practicable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment made regulations on 18 February last which take no account whatever of the formula agreed between PDFORRA and the Authority, and which effectively deprive serving members of the Defence Forces of any protection under the Act.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Department of Defence and the Department of Enterprise and Employment held separate consultations without consulting either PDFORRA or the Authority, and came to quite a different conclusion.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Authority was not consulted about the final wording of the regulations issued, in spite of the fact that it had specifically recommended the formula agreed with PDFORRA.  I also understand, that neither the Minister for Defence nor the Minister for Enterprise and Employment was informed of the fact that a formula has been agreed between PDFORRA and the Authority before the February regulations were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This flies in the face of the reason PDFORRA was recognised and set up and totally disregards the statutory functions of the Authority.  It is salutary to look at the difference between the two formulae.  The formula agreed between PDFORRA and the Authority says that the relevant statutory provisions shall not apply in the case of activities in which members of the Defence Forces, subject to military law, are engaged, where such <Col N="1603" /> activities relate to armed engagement or civil emergencies and where any such activity prevents compliance with the relevant statutory provisions.  That is a very clear, concise and just formula.  The regulations adopted and promulgated by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment of 18 February are much more restrictive. They provide that the relevant statutory provisions, the Act, shall apply to members of the Defence Forces except when they are on active service as defined in section 5 of the Defence Act, engaged in action in the course of operational duties at sea, engaged in operations in aid to the civil power or in training directly associated with any of those activities. That is a much more restrictive formula than that agreed between PDFORRA and the Authority and effectively deprives members of the Defence Forces of virtually all protection under the Act.</P>
    <P>At Question Time on April 6 last, the Minister for Defence was clearly unaware of the background to this case, and kindly issued an implicit invitation to have the matter raised again, so that he could reflect on it and give a considered response.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Minister to ensure that the utterly unsatisfactory regulations made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment are immediately withdrawn, and replaced by the formula agreed between PDFORRA and the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter arising from my invitation in response to a parliamentary question on 6 April last.  I indicated that I had very good relations with the officers' organisation in the Army on the one hand and with PDFORRA on the other.  On that basis I indicated, subject to examination of the official report, that I would meet PDFORRA representatives to discuss this important matter.  I intend to meet PDFORRA in the near future in advance of their conference in Killarney.  I will be glad to give the Deputy the outcome of my deliberations with PDFORRA when I meet them.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which contains <Col N="1604" /> extensive provisions for the safeguarding of the well-being of persons at work provides for the preparation of safety statements by employers setting out the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of persons in the workplace will be secured and for the selection by employees of representatives to consult on their behalf with management on all matters arising in that connection.</P>
      <P>Since the Act came into operation the Defence Forces have been actively engaged in a comprehensive programme to give effect to the relevant provisions on this programme has been constantly directed and monitored by a committee in the Department of Defence comprising civil and military representatives. Already safety statements and safety representatives are in place at unit level throughout the Permanent Defence Force and 63 safety standards providing detailed technical safety guidelines on a wide range of general and specifically military activities have been completed and issued.</P>
      <P>This is a treatise on the operation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and it does not, in all honesty, answer the Deputy's legitimate question on the Adjournment.  I apologise to the Deputy for not giving him the information he required arising from the parliamentary question of 6 April.  I will either place an indication on the record of the House or correspond with the Deputy to inform him what may be done arising from my meeting with PDFORRA in the near future.</P>
      <P>There are certain activities undertaken by the Permanent Defence Forces which are unique in character, as they involve the carrying of weapons.  In that regard the Deputy raised these exclusions during the course of his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The military authorities take all possible steps to secure the safety of personnel engaged on military operations and training.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, which were made recently by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment provide for the application of the relevant statutory provisions to members of the Defence <Col N="1605" /> Forces except when the Defence Forces are on active service or deemed to be on active service, for example during service in Lebanon, engaged in action in the course of operational duties at sea, engaged in operations in aid to the civil power, or engaged in training directly associated with any of the above mentioned activities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Department that the Act will continue to have the broadest possible application within the Permanent Defence Forces.  The scope of representation available to the representative associations provides for the raising the matters in this context within the conciliation forum for the force.  I will respond to the Deputy after my meeting with PDFORRA in the very near future on this very important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain people have been facetious about this issue.  I will not be facetious as a serious problem exists.  I should like to discusss this matter with the Minister and make sure we do not have a recurrence of the escape of farm salmon.  Farmed fish and wild fish stock are mutually exclusive and they must, of necessity, be kept apart.  We must take great care to ensure that we do not have escapes similar to that from Salmara in west Cork.  There is antipathy between fish farmers and the fisherman.  For instance, the fisherman will tell you that the decline in sea trout is directly attributable to farm salmon and farm trout.  Whatever the reason, the sea trout population has declined rapidly during the past number of years and, therefore, fishermen are suspicious.</P>
      <P>A number of serious questions have arisen as a result of this incident.  How did 8,000 farm salmon escape from Salmara? My information suggests a service vessel was responsible.  How could this be allowed to occur given the grave consequences for our wild fish stock?  We are all aware that farm trout experience difficulty with sea lice.  If there was to be interaction between farm fish and wild fish stock God only knows where it would end.  It would be a catastrophe for fishing in general.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that two of the salmon were fished out of the Lee valley last week and that eight of these fish were caught in the lakes of Killarney. It has been suggested also that there has been a catch in the Ilem river in Skibbereen. I understand some of these have been sent for analysis and I would ask the Minister if there has been report so that we can establish whether the fish have made their way into our rivers and lakes.  We are all aware of the consequences of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> The whole question of security and the powers of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board has now been called into question.  It has been stated that the escape was known for six days without any action being taken.  It has been alleged that on the sixth day the South Western Regional Fisheries Board visited the farm but were not allowed access on the basis that the manager was in Dublin that day.  This begs the question whether the South Western Regional Fisheries Board &mdash; the people protecting our fish &mdash; have the power when there is such an occurrence to go in and check out the position.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure we do not have a repetition of this irresponsible escape, what mechanisms will the Minister put in place?  Can he confirm the number of fish that escaped?  The original number suggested was 800, the newspapers said it was 8,000 but nobody is sure of the extent of the escape.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences for our wild fish stock if they have made their way into our river and lakes?  Is there a major consequence for the wild fish stock?  Will it be a catastrophe for our fishing season?  It is necessary to allay the fears of people but more especially it is necessary to put in place mechanisms to ensure that we never have a recurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this very important issue.  I agree with him that some Deputies regard it as a flippant issue but it is very serious.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to inform the House about the facts of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late in the evening of 8 April last, Salmara Fisheries notified the Department of the Marine and the South Western Regional Fisheris Board that an incident had occurred at 5 p.m. approximately at the Inishfarnad licensed salmon farm site in Kenmare Bay which led to the escape of salmon.  It is obligatory under the terms of every operator's licence that notification be given of escapes immediately and the company complied with this requirement.  The escape of approximately 9,000 fish arose from damage to <Col N="1608" /> the net of one salmon cage caused by the propellor of a service vessel.</P>
    <P>A request by the South Western Regional Fisheries Board was subsequently received for the issue of a permit to Salmara Fisheries under section 14 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to allow the company catch escapees.  The permit was issued subject to the netting being carried out under the supervision of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>Despite intensive netting by Salmara Fisheries, the latest information available to me and confirmed by the South Western Regional Fisheries Board is that no escapees have been caught.  The best advice available to me from the Department of the Marine's technical experts is that in all likelihood the fish in question dispersed at sea.</P>
    <P>Regarding salmon escapes generally, the evidence currently available to me suggests that the effect of farmed escapees on wild stocks is inconclusive. Pending the outcome of ongoing research into this complex problem the approach of the Department must be to work with the aquaculture industry to take all necessary precautions to avoid escapes and notify the relevant authorities urgently if and when such an incident takes place.</P>
    <P>Escapes of salmon result in serious economic loss to fish farmers and it is of course in their own interests to minimise the risk of escapes occurring.</P>
    <P>Following these consultations I have today initiated a review of the departmental procedures for handling salmon escapes and the strengthening of emergency response procedures.  I have personally inspected the company's operations in the area and have held extensive consultations with the local South Western Regional Fisheries Board and other fishery interests.</P>
    <P>Existing emergency response arrangements will be strengthened to ensure that authorisations to net escapees as required by statute will be streamlined to ensure that the most immediate and effective response is put in place by both salmon farm operators and fisheries boards.  Furthermore, I have decided that the Department and fisheries boards must <Col N="1609" /> be notified immediately escapes occur, accepting that the licensed operator in the recent case complied fully with this obligation.  I have also decided that the salmon farming industry should ensure that effective arrangements for the immediate netting of escaped salmon are put in place.  I am anxious that the present arrangements be rigorously reviewed to ensure the maximum co-operation between fishery boards and salmon farmers and to avoid administrative delays.</P>
    <P>I have directed the Department's marine survey office to review the circumstances leading to the Inisfarnard escape which arose from damage to the net of one salmon cage by the propeller of a service vessel.  Management systems for service vessels on site will be reviewed to ensure that all steps are taken by farm managers to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.</P>
    <P>As this is a national review of existing emergency response measures I have directed the Department to consult fully with the Central Fisheries Board and the representative national organisation for salmon farmers, the Irish Salmon Growers Association.  I concur with the Deputy that the present situation is not satisfactory and I have taken steps to change it immediately.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should stress that I am of the strong view that salmon farming and the wild fisheries can co-exist in harmony provided that farming activities are controlled fully.  Our policy is that these controls be rigorously enforced and observed.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, A Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Minister the disgraceful overcrowding at the Christian Brothers High School in Clonmel, County Tipperary.  Quite simply, the school is bursting at the seams, causing totally unacceptable levels of stress and strain to the teachers and school management, overcrowding and unsuitable conditions for the pupils and feelings of desperation on the part of parents who wish to secure a place for their child in this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The lack of accommodation has been outlined by school management in correspondence with the Minister. Details have been forwarded in relation to costings, architects reports for the four classrooms requested, supported by the projected student population growth.</P>
    <P>The school was built to accommodate 350 pupils and the present school population is 603.  There is not sufficient accommodation for these students and neither can the principal admit the number of pupils, 184 applicants, who wish to attend the High School in September next.  Last September entry was refused to more than 80 boys and the situation is even worse this year.  While the Minister has publicly stated her opposition to entrance tests, I ask, what option has the management in the High School but to hold an entrance examination, undesirable as it is?</P>
    <P>The situation is such that the results of the High School entrance examination elicited the same interest and fear as the leaving certificate results.  This is appalling for young boys who experience rejection at so early an age, and for parents who have to cope with a despondent child trying to come to terms with failure caused entirely by the lack of accommodation in the school.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have rightly rejected the Department's offer of two prefabricated classrooms and as one who experienced the task of teaching in this type of accommodation, I support their decision.  The school population is projected to grow to 1997, the year that one can reasonably make projections.  It cannot then realistically accept temporary solutions which will involve costly maintenance and are, in the long term, totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>A proposal has been forwarded to the Minister for the provision of four concrete classrooms, estimated to cost £92,000.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider this request and provide the school with its minimum needs so that it can provide education to all who wish to attend the High School.</P>
    <P>Added to their accommodation problems, is the dilapidated condition of part of the existing school, now 100 years old.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> It was deemed structurally dangerous some years ago.  In addition, the more modern part of the school, built in 1976, has major defects.  Specifically, structural enigineers have recorded falling concrete which is dangerous to pupils as it falls off the concrete surrounds of the buildings. Nothing has been done about this to date.</P>
    <P>This school is not seeking luxury &mdash; but rather the very basic accommodation in which to provide for the educational needs of the students.  The reality is that the students are crammed into substandard classrooms, and what of those who are refused entry?</P>
    <P>The situation has reached crisis stge and the Minister's intervention is urgently needed.  The minimum required is £92,000 to provide for four additional classrooms.  I urge the Minister to extend the hand of friendship towards Clonmel High School.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I hope I can clarify the position at the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991, the school authorities submitted a number of proposals to the Department, including a proposal for the provision of some additional classrooms. Having examined the matter carefully it was concluded that the school had sufficient accommodation for the projected numbers at the school in the longer term. However, in view of the numbers currently at the school, and the likely numbers in the short term, the Department was prepared to grant-aid the provision <Col N="1612" /> of some additonal temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, the school authorities were informed that an equivalent grant towards the cost of a more permanent structure would be available if it was their preferred option.  This additional accommodation consists of one general classroom and one larger specialist room for mechanical drawing.  Additional toilet facilities are also being grant-aided.</P>
    <P>Approval to seek tenders for this additional accommodation was given to the school in July of 1992.  The school, however, responded recently with alternative and more substantial proposals which are now being examined.  When this examination of these proposals has been completed the Department will be in further contact with the school authorities with a view to advancing the provision of the approved accommodation. The classrooms that have been approved, will provide the school with sufficient accommodation for its current needs.</P>
    <P>I should add that my Department's main responsibility in the matter of provision of school accommodation is to ensure that in any given centre or catchment area, there are sufficient post-primary places available overall to meet the needs of the area.  It is considered that with the provision of the current approved accommodation for the High School, the centre will have sufficient accommodation to meet the needs of the area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 April 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose <Col N="1265" /> to take Questions Nos. 33, 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains fully committed to Bord na Móna, to the development of peat reserves and recognises the importance of peat to the economy of the midlands.  The commitment is specifically recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>The board is a significant employer in the midlands and has made enormous progress in recent years in reducing costs and improving productivity.  This is evidenced by the fact that operating profits per employee have risen by a factor of four over the last four years.  I am satisfied that continued progress on this front is the only means to secure long-term employment in Bord na Móna and I am fully confident that management and the workforce will build on the achievements already made.  On the basis of current operating costs, peat is now almost competitive with oil or gas but, of course, the price of peat paid by ESB also reflects the cost to Bord na Móna of servicing its excessive burden of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering Bord na Móna's difficult financial position which is due to this debt, it is important to remember that through its sales of milled peat to the ESB the company receives the equivalent of an annual subsidy of about £18 million. This &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; has been at this level for a number of years and is even more advantageous than a direct equity injection because no dividend is payable on it.  One of our objectives must be to minimise costs within the economy to promote industrial growth and this burden on the electricity consumer cannot continue indefinitely; however simply transferring it to the taxpayer would not benefit the national economy.  In accordance with the proposals in the Culliton report I am working on arrangements to make the subsidy more transparent with a view to its eventual elimination in parallel with a reduction in the excess debt.  It is likely that if we do not take action ourselves to eliminate the subsidy, we will come under pressure from the EC Commission to do so in the interest of <Col N="1266" /> ensuring fair competition in the energy sector at European level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Bord na Móna is currently in the process of conducting a full feasibility study into the construction of a new peat-fired power station.  The Government is committed to such a station provided that it is found to be feasible and if it proceeds it will utilise 1 million tonnes of peat per annum.  This will be an important element of the current programme to secure the future of the peat industry.</P>
    <P>My objective for the future is to see Bord na Móna develop as a solidly structured company capable of making a useful contribution to energy requirements and sustaining viable employment. I am confident that the efforts of all concerned will contribute to revitalising the peat industry and will lay the foundations for the continued use of peat at a competitive and economic cost for the national benefit.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies to Question No. 65 on 18 May 1988, columns 1791-92, Volume 380, Official Report No. 8 for that day, Question No. 87 on 20 November 1990, columns 1902-3, Volume 402, Official Report for that day, Question No. 2 on 2 April 1992, columns 417-419, Volume 418 of the Official Report for that date and Question No. 414 of 10 February 1993, Official Report not available yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These replies set out the reasons why successive Governments have decided that it would neither be practical nor in the national interest to license illegal rebroadcasting or deflector systems.  It has also been explained in answers to <Col N="1267" /> parliamentary questions in the past why UHF deflector systems, for practical and policy reasons, cannot be licensed and, therefore, do not and never have constituted an acceptable alternative means of providing a multichannel television service on a nationwide basis to areas which are not cabled.  That policy is not being reviewed.</P>

      <P>I have examined the various studies carried out on the Arigna power station.  Unfortunately I see no reasons to depart from the conclusions of the most recent report carried out by independent consultants who concluded that the continued operation of the station past its proposed closure date is not a competitive proposition. I indicated recently at a meeting with a delegation of Oireachtas Members from the Arigna area that the key issues are the cost, availability and quality of local coal and the necessary investment needed in the station itself.</P>
      <P>I can see no basis for intervening in the ESB's decision to close the station unless local interests can come forward with a convincing case based on coal supplies and cost.  I have been assured by the ESB that there is no question of compulsory redundancy for workers at the station.</P>

      <P>The fourth and final phase of the £9 million terminal building development project is scheduled to commence in June of this year.

    <P>It is not possible in advance to say what the cost of particular counter-measures would be in the event of a nuclear contingency, no more than it is possible to cost beforehand the measures needed in <Col N="1270" /> the event of a national disaster like hurricane or storm damage.  It is a hypothetical situation in that any counter-measures to be introduced would depend very much on the location, nature, scale, extent and the longevity of a specific accident and the prevailing weather conditions. The consequences of an accident differ as between the different types of nuclear installations and a distinction may also be made between those accidents where the consequences may affect the whole country and those likely to affect only a limited area.  Provision is made in the Estimates for maintaining the preparedness of this country so that we are in a position to respond quickly in the event of a nuclear emergency but not for the consequences of any emergency that might arise.  The counter-measures mentioned by the Deputy would only be introduced if it would achieve more good than harm having regard to health, social and economic factors.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, is the national authority with responsibility for undertaking measurements of the naturally-occurring radioactive gas, radon.  Since 1989, over 3,000 homes have been measured and the highest levels have been found in the western counties of Galway and Mayo. Nationally, approximately 4 per cent of houses exceed the reference level adopted by the Government in 1989, of 200 becquerels per cubic metre.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the institute launched a geographically-based national radon survey. This survey will involve measurements in over 6,000 homes over the next four-five years.  Once completed, the results will assist in identification of areas of greater risk of high radon levels and allow planning authorities to consider what actions might be desirable to limit radon accumulation in new buildings.</P>
      <P>The RPII offers a radon measurement service at a modest cost for schools, workplaces and houses.  The risk associated with exposure to high radon levels is regularly highlighted by the institute in its reports and press statements.</P>
      <P>Remedial action to deal with unacceptable levels of radon gas is primarily a matter for the householders and property owners concerned.  Where high radon concentrations have been identified techniques exist which enable levels to be reduced.  Responsibility for advice on these matters rests with the Environmental Research Unit of the Department of Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case of certain schools in counties Clare, Mayo and Galway, in <Col N="1273" /> which radon gas levels have been established to be unacceptably high, the Department of Education in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and the school authorities undertook remediation measures which have dealt with the problem in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that building regulations came into effect on 1 June 1992 and established for the first time, on a national basis, a statutory building code.  Under the regulations, precautions must be taken to avoid danger to health and safety caused by substances, including contaminants, on or in the ground to be covered by a building. The relevant technical guidance document, which gives guidance in relation to meeting this requirement, advises of the need to take precautions against the entry of radon into buildings in certain areas.  In this regard, guidance on appropriate measures to be taken in the design and construction of buildings is available from the Evironmental Research Unit of the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The first democratic elections in over 20 years were held in Lesotho on 27 March 1993.  Twelve political parties participated and all seats were won by the Basotholand Congress Party (BCP).  The elections were monitored by a team of international observers, including three Members of the Oireachtas and an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The monitors found that the standard practice of free and fair elections had been followed.  The result was upheld by the Chief Justice of Lesotho following a challenge in the courts by the main opposition party, the Basotho National Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and its partners in the European Community have welcomed the elections as a major step towards the <Col N="1278" /> restoration of democratic and accountable government in Lesotho.  The leader of the BCP was appointed Prime Minister on 2 April 1993 and a civilian Government is now in power.</P>
    <P>Lesotho is one of the priority countries in the Irish bilateral aid programme.  Irish bilateral aid during 1992 amounted to IR£2.2 million.  Planned aid in 1993 will be in the region of IR£2.57 million.  In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> to expand Irish ODA, it is expected that Irish development assistance to Lesotho will be increased in the coming years.</P>

      <P>As I have previously indicated, the Government is determined to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement very vigorously.  Both Governments have committed themselves to the full implementation of this agreement unless or until it is transcended by new agreed arrangements.</P>
      <P>There is a very substantial volume of work which requires continuing attention under each of the agreement's headings. Areas of particular importance clearly include political matters, with special reference to the need to make political progress in relation to Northern Ireland; security and related matters; legal matters, including the administration of justice; and cross-Border co-operation on security, economic, social and cultural matters.</P>
      <P>At the March meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, for example, we confirmed arrangements we had made to discuss at a series of forthcoming conference meetings a number of specified topics in the field of North/South economic and social co-operation.</P>
      <P>Our next such discussion will take place at a meeting of the conference which has been scheduled for next month and will deal with co-operation in the fields of enterprise and employment and science and technology.  Other topics to be discussed at forthcoming meetings include arts and culture, inland fisheries, education, transport and agriculture.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1993 the Revenue Commissioners have had responsibility for the maintenance of a register of all motor vehicles in the State and for the collection of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). Vehicles, particulars of which are not on the register, are deemed to be unregistered.</P>
      <P>Unregistered vehicles may be held by authorised distributors and dealers who are subject to systematic control by the Revenue Commissioners.  They may not supply vehicles for use on the road unless the VRT is paid and the vehicles are &ldquo;plated&rdquo;.  Unregistered vehicles, e.g. foreign registered vehicles driven by visitors, may only be used legitimately in the State under the provisions of the Temporary Exemption from Registration of Vehicles Regulations, 1993. There are heavy penalties, including seizure of vehicles, for non-compliance with official requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not maintain statistics on the numbers of unregistered <Col N="1281" /> vehicles in the State as it is impossible to estimate the number of vehicles liable for registration in the State at any one time.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have undertaken a publicity campaign including the placing of advertisements in the national press and the publication and dissemination of leaflets and Public Notices in relation to the VRT regime. Additionally, the Commissioners have deployed extra staff and resources to detect the illegal use of unregistered vehicles in the State.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Commissioners that they are satisfied that the enforcement measures taken are in line with their general policy, which is to provide a service which keeps checks and controls to the minimum necessary to enable them to carry out their functions effectively, efficiently and economically.</P>

      <P>An average of 309,000 was projected at budget-time for the Live Register in 1993.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as the Live Register is subject to considerable fluctuations from one month to the next, it would neither be practical nor productive to attempt a projection for particular dates as far in the future as the end of this year.  I consider, however, that an end-1993 Live Register forecast of 330,000 is too high.  It would imply a serious deterioration in unemployment trends for the rest of the year.  In view of the improving outlook for the economy, particularly as a result of the recent sharp falls in interest rates, I do not expect such a development.</P>

      <P>The increase in the rate of VAT applicable to supplies of buildings and building services from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent applies to all such supplies made after 1 March 1993.  There is no provision that would have the effect of applying the increased rate retrospectively to supplies made before that date.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, the date on which a contract is entered into is not a factor in determining the date on which a supply is regarded as being made for VAT purposes. A building is deemed to be supplied to the extent that it is paid for or when it is handed over.  The date on which a building is deemed to be supplied is determined, therefore, by reference to the date on which any deposits or progress payments are paid, up to the point at which the completed building is handed over.  This rule applies not only to buildings but to supplies of goods and services generally.  For example, where a building is under construction and part payments are being made, those part payments made before 1 March are liable at the 10 per cent rate, while those made after that date are liable at the 12.5 per cent.  Similarly, where a deposit is paid before 1 March and the building is handed over after that date, the deposit is liable at the 10 per cent rate while the balance is liable at the 12.5 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that I took measures in the budget to ensure that the VAT increase would not impact adversely on housing construction.  Accordingly, the Financial Resolution passed by the House on budget night provides, by way of exception to the rules that I have outlined above, that the 10 per cent rate will continue to apply to contracts for houses entered into with private individuals prior to 25 February 1993 regardless of when the actual supply is made.  The first time buyer's grant was increased to <Col N="1288" /> £3,000 in the budget in order to offset the impact of the VAT increase on contracts entered into after 25 February 1993.  Furthermore, I have arranged for appropriate adjustments to be made to the Public Capital Programme so that the local authority new house-building programme and the voluntary housing programme will not be adversely affected by the rate increase.</P>
    <P>Where non-house building is concerned, I should point out that VAT registered persons are able to recover the VAT borne on their business inputs including the purchase or development of premises.  Thus, the VAT increase should, in most cases, have no more than a short term cash-flow impact.</P>
    <P>Overall, I consider that the VAT increase should not give rise to serious financial problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Budget Statement of 24 February 1993 sets out clearly the Government's strategy in relation to the Public Finances. The IBEC, in their document, stated that the imperative to maintain firm contol over the public finances in order to ease pressure on interest rates was recognised by the Minister for Finance who set the EBR at 2.9 per cent of GNP, somewhat lower than commentators expected.  The Deputy will be aware that much of the rest of the commentary in the document, which is date lined 15 March, 1993, has been overtaken by events.  In particular, the concerns <Col N="1290" /> expressed by the authors about the importance to the budget targets of speedy reductions in interest rates have proved groundless given the pattern of repeated rate cuts which have since occurred &mdash; reductions which were clearly considerably facilitated by the approach taken by the Government in the budget.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are in the process of upgrading facilities for dealing with personal callers in major centres throughout the country.  Upgraded facilities have already been provided in a number of locations such as Limerick, Tralee, Kilkenny and Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> Plans for the installation of a modern Information Office in a central location in Cork are well advanced.  The commissioners are in negotiation with other public service occupants of the building with a view to the provision of a suitable block of space.  It is anticipated that these negotiations will be brought to a successful conclusion shortly.  Arrangements will then be made to carry out the necessary physical alterations.</P>

      <P>Of the total of £12.2 million of loans and investments which were outstanding at the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta on 2 April 1991 £2.3 million had been recovered up to 31 March 1993 in respect of the principal amount of such loans and investments.  A further amount of £1.1 million was also recovered in respect of interest and other amounts due.  Under the terms of the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Act 1990 ICC Bank is responsible for the recovery of amounts due to Fóir Teoranta and for the transfer of any sums recovered to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an application for a tax <Col N="1292" /> clearance certificate from the person concerned was refused by the Collector-General's Office on 23rd April, 1993 due to outstanding arrears of income tax totalling £5,896.97 in respect of the Income Tax years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. The Collector-General is precluded from issuing a tax clearance certificate to the person concerned until these arrears have been paid in full.</P>
      <P>If payment of the outstanding amount due to the Collector-General in one sum would cause the person concerned undue hardship, it is open to him to apply to the Collector-General for an arrangement to pay by instalments over a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>Following regularisation of the tax affairs of the person concerned, a tax clearance certificate will be issued by the Collector-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of various comments on the effects of the temporary income levy.  I would emphasise however, that the levy was introduced in the interests of a sound budgetary policy as an essential element of employment strategy and to maintain adequate social services and programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the income levy, which came into effect from 6 April, is payable in any week where income is greater than £173.  In setting the threshold at this level, rather than the general tax exemption limits, I was conscious of the need to protect the lower paid.  The potential full-year yield from the levy is reduced as a result by some £20 million. In addition, all medical card holders are exempt from the levy.  Welfare payments <Col N="1293" /> are also exempt from the levy and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to allow any further exemptions from the scope of the levy.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the statement made by the Justice Office of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in their budget document that the budget failed to tackle adequately the cause of poverty and social exclusion in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures announced in the recent budget, and continued in the Social Welfare Act, 1993, significantly improve the position of those who depend on social welfare for their income.  A general increase of 3.5%, which is ahead of the projected rate of inflation for 1993, maintains the real value of payments for some 800,000 recipients and their 700,000 dependants. Those on the lowest payments received a higher increase of 4.9%</P>
      <P>Child Benefit was increased to £20 for each of the first three children, and the increases in the upper limits of Family Income Supplement will result in an additional £12 per week for families at work on low pay.  A special grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins.</P>
      <P>Other measures included an increase of 11.7% in the Carer's Allowance and increases in both the minimum and maximum payments of Maternity Benefit, bringing them to £65 and £159 respectively.</P>
      <P>I have also improved the situation for unemployed persons who wish to take up part-time work by substantially increasing the amount of earnings which can be disregarded in assessing means for Unemployment Assistance purposes to the equivalent of the normal daily rate of Unemployment Assistance plus an additional £15 per day.  A married man with two children can earn up to £34.42 per day for each day worked without affecting the rate of Unemployment Assistance payable for other days in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements will cost an additional £180 million, bringing the annual expenditure on social welfare to <Col N="1297" /> £3.7 billion, or over £10 million for each day of the year.</P>
    <P>While the primary function of social welfare continues to be the provision of an income for those who, through illness, unemployment or old age, are unable to support themselves or their families, an adequate and efficient income maintenance system cannot, of itself, be regarded as a complete response to the needs of those who depend on the State for their livelihood.  Over the years, I have introduced a considerable element of flexibility into the system which facilities those who wish to take up part-time work, voluntary work or to resume &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education without affecting their weekly payments.  Almost 2,400 long term unemployed people are currently engaged in full-time education at second and third level and I propose to extend that further over the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Government's allocation for supporting voluntary organisations who work to tackle poverty and social exclusion was also substantially increased in the budget, from £3.484 million in 1992 to £4.73 million in 1993.  The allocation for the Combat Poverty Agency has increased from £1.35 million to £1.48 million.</P>
    <P>Unemployment itself is ultimately the most significant root cause of poverty particularly for families.  The Government's policy in the 1993 Budget was strongly pro-employment.  The thrust of the provisions in the budget is to strengthen the basis for jobs growth this year and into the future.  Measures in the Budget provide sound management of the economy and building business and consumer confidence as the main vehicle for accelerating the pace of job creation.</P>
    <P>The budget also recognised the importance of fiscal policy in directly assisting job creation through a significant fiscal injection, including the Cohesion Fund, which will result in a year on year increase of almost £500 million, or 27%, in the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the budget and Estimates policy has, as its paramount <Col N="1298" /> aim, the effective tackling of unemployment, the alleviation of poverty and the creating of new jobs for those currently out of work.</P>

      <P>The legislative measures providing for equal treatment during the period of delay, from December 1984 to November 1986, in implementing EC Directive 79/7 are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the regulations, <Col N="1299" /> the retrospective payments are being made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.  The person concerned has already received a payment in respect of the higher personal rate of disability benefit which was paid to her during that period of delay.  While she will also qualify for a payment in lieu of dependancy increases her exact entitlement in this regard has not been calculated. When calculated, her entitlement, if it amounts to £100 or more, will be payable in two equal instalments in 1993 and 1994.  If her entitlement is less than £100 the payment will be made in one instalment in 1993.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of free telephone rental allowance is that the claimant must reside alone or only with certain excepted categories of people.  Such categories consist of child(ren) under age 15 and/or other person(s) who are so permanently incapacitated that they would be unable to summon assistance in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was awarded free telephone rental allowance from September 1990.  At the time she resided alone and fulfilled all the conditions for receipt of his allowance.  However, her entitlement to the allowance was <Col N="1300" /> reviewed in September 1992.  In response to a questionnaire which issued to her then, she informed my Department that her daughter was residing with her. According to the information available to my Department, the daughter of the person concerned is not one of the excepted categories of people mentioned above.  In these circumstances, the conditions for receipt of the allowance were no longer satisfied and it, therefore, became necessary to withdraw her allowance.</P>
    <P>If the household circumstances of the person concerned change, it is open to her to re-apply for the allowance at any time.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the present authorised level of Garda transport at Shankill station is four vehicles, that four vehicles are attached to that station at present and that they are in operationally effective order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vehicle referred to in the question was temporarily attached to Shankill station in November, 1992, as a replacement for one of the official cars which <Col N="1308" /> was out of service.  When the official car was returned to service the replacement car continued to be used by the gardai at Shankill station until March of this year, when it was withdrawn by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present level of transport at Shankill station is adequate, but the position is kept under review in the context of the authorised levels for the Division as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am advised that in the community as a whole, approximately 1 in 200 people show evidence of having contracted or been exposed to the hepatitis B virus at some time in their lives.  While it is not possible to say how much of this is related to work-associated risks &mdash; as distinct from normal social contacts &mdash; it is recognised that some employees, because of the nature of the work they do, such as health workers, prison officers, gardaí and others may be open to greater risks in the course of their work and need therefore to take certain precautions.</P>
      <P>Although the number of gardaí who are known to have contracted the viruses mentioned &mdash; 10, of whom 6 were hepatitis B and 4 hepatitis C &mdash; may appear to be relatively small by comparison with the general community experience I have mentioned earlier, I fully accept that there is certainly no room for complacency on this score and that it is of the utmost importance that all possible preventative measures and safeguards are put in place and that the gardaí avail of these to reduce the risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Garda authorities have taken the necessary steps in this regard, including vaccination programmes, <Col N="1309" /> safety instructions and other facilities to protect members of the Garda Síochána from contamination.  While the decision to avail of any medical treatment must be a matter for the gardaí themselves, I note that, accordingly to Garda figures, the hepatitis B vaccination programme which has now been in operation for three years, has been availed of by only 20 per cent of gardaí.  In other words, the level of concern indicated by the Deputy's question and in Garda publications does not appear to be matched within the force itself.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the workload of the Supreme Court is very heavy and that there are delays in the hearing of certain cases.  To ease this workload legislation to establish a new Court of Appeal is currently being drafted in my Department. The Court of Appeal will, in addition to hearing appeals in criminal cases, also hear civil appeals from the High Court and thereby considerably ease the pressure on the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that it would be misleading to quote figures for average delays in the hearing of appeals to the Supreme Court, because different types of cases receive different priorities. There are also a number of factors which contribute to delays.  In the first instance, while the notice of appeal from the High Court must be lodged within 21 days, this period may be extended by consent or by application to the court.  Furthermore appeals cannot be listed until all necessary documentation has been completed by the parties in the case and the length of time this may take varies considerably <Col N="1310" /> from a matter of weeks to over a year and rests entirely with the parties.</P>
    <P>When the documentation is complete the case is listed for hearing by the Chief Justice who lists cases on a priority basis depending on the particulars of each individual case.  I am informed that, for example, priority is always given to cases involving personal liberty, family law, extradition, cases with an inbuilt urgency or cases of general public interest. Priority is also given to certain personal injury cases particularly where the plaintiff is either very young or elderly.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that there is also a facility available to parties to apply to the court for a priority hearing which will be granted where the court deems it to be warranted.</P>
    <P>At present less urgent cases can take from 18 months to 2 years to be heard while urgent cases can be heard almost immediately.</P>

    <P>Teamwork is a community-managed scheme designed to help local voluntary organisations provide temporary community-based employment for the mutual benefit of persons aged between 17 and 25 years of age and their communities.</P>

    <P>The social employment scheme is designed to provide needed opportunities for long term unemployed persons who are at least 25 years of age. I have no plans to extend the scheme generally to persons under 25 as this could only be done at the expense of those whom the scheme was designed to assist.  However, the community employment development programme &mdash; CEDP &mdash; which operates in the 12 areas designated under the area-based strategy to combat long term unemployment allows participation by persons over 21 years of age.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The extra £1 million provided in this year's budget for the renovation of inner city flats forms part of the allocation of £7.5 million which has been made to Dublin Corporation for their 1993 programme of remedial works, including inner city flats at Oliver Bond House, St. Mary's and St. Joseph's Mansions, and Blessington Street.  The increased allocation will enable the designation for funding under the remedial works scheme of further flat complexes to which the corporation has accorded highest priority.  Decisions on the schemes being newly designated will be conveyed to the corporation shortly.</P>
      <P>An application has been received from the corporation for assistance for planned maintenance works, mainly window replacement, in 39 of their flat complexes throughout the city including Mary Aikenhead House and St. Michan's House.  As the corporation has already been informed, these works are not eligible for funding under the remedial works scheme as the maintenance of their dwellings, including the replacement of windows, is the responsibility of the local authority to be funded from their own resources.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> Since its introduction on the Irish market, there has been a steady increase in the sale of unleaded petrol as a percentage of total petrol sales and this trend is continuing.  In February 1992, unleaded accounted for some 30 per cent of retail petrol sales; by February 1993, the market share had grown to over 37 per cent.  Unleaded market share is expected to grow significantly in the future taking account, in particular, of the fact that current EC emission standards require all new petrol engined vehicles run on unleaded.</P>
      <P>I am keeping under review the question of incentives and campaigns to increase sales of unleaded petrol, but I do not consider that a greater price differential between unleaded and leaded petrol is necessary in current circumstances.</P>

      <P>A key element of the work required to enable the Dublin Transportation Initiative make a definitive recommendation on access to Dublin <Col N="1328" /> Port is the conduct of a detailed origin and destination survey of commercial traffic to and from the port.  This is essential to enable travel patterns for goods vehicles to be clearly identified.</P>
      <P>As a result of an industrial dispute at the B &amp; I container terminal, normal commercial traffic patterns to and from the port were disrupted for some time and the DTI study team, having consulted Dublin Port, recommended that the traffic survey should be deferred.  This recommendation was accepted by the DTI technical committee.  Following further consultations with Dublin Port, it now appears that traffic patterns are sufficiently settled to allow the survey go ahead in early May.</P>
      <P>In the intervening period, other elements of the port access study have been proceeding but vital transportation modelling work has had to be delayed pending the availability of the traffic data.  Every effort is being made to complete this work as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> EC Council Regulation (EEC) 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Communities provides that member states may take appropriate measures to prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to shipments of waste from outside their territories.  However, this provision does not apply in the case of hazardous waste produced in a member state of shipment in such small quantities that the provision of new specialised waste disposal installations within that state would be uneconomic.  Any difficulty arising between member states with regard to the implementation of these provisions may be referred to the European Commission, which may determine the issue in accordance with specified procedures.</P>
      <P>Irish policy in relation to disposal of hazardous wastes was set out in the Environment Action Programme.  This recognised the need to ensure sophisticated and safe methods of disposing of these wastes.  Without prejudice to the overall policy established in the Environment Action Programme, my Department has for some time been conducting a more detailed review of hazardous waste management requirements in light of various developments since 1990.  It is intended to finalise this review very shortly in the context of the new National Development Plan.</P>

        <i>Wexford</i>): I take it that the question refers to LIFE, an EC financial instrument which provides funding towards the development and the implementation of Community environmental policy by the financing of demonstration projects.  The latest date for the receipt of proposals under LIFE (1993) was 31 March 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This source of funds was advertised <Col N="1334" /> very broadly.  An advertisement by the Department of the Environment in relation to LIFE appeared in the daily newspapers on 16 February, 1993 and also in magazines.  This advertisement drew particular attention to an information pack available from the Department. The information pack and an explanatory note was also circulated to all local authorities, relevant Government Departments, universities, regional technical colleges, relevant representative organisations and a number of other organisations, including private companies.</P>
    <P>The number of proposals received under LIFE confirms that these publicity arrangements were fully satisfactory.</P>

Pending adoption of this decision, Ireland has already transmitted a national CO2 strategy to the EC Commission; I intend to publish this shortly. Irish CO2 emissions in 1990 were estimated at 8.9 million tonnes of carbon. An inventory of methane emissions will be prepared during this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I understand that the Commission of the European Communities is preparing a draft Directive on the limitation of emissions of organic solvents from certain processes including dry cleaning but it is not clear when a draft may emerge or what proposals it may contain.</P>
      <P>However, the substance referred to appears to be CFC 113, the production and import of which are controlled by the UN Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.  Ireland, together with its EC partners, is a party to this Protocol.</P>
      <P>The Montreal Protocol, as revised in Copenhagen last November, provides for the phasing out of the production of CFCs by 1 January, 1996.  However, the EC has already decided on an earlier Community phase out date of 1 January, 1995.  Industry is aware of the controls and alternative ozone friendly substances and processes are being developed and introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CFCs are not manufactured in Ireland and importers and distributors of these substances are cutting down on supplies in accordance with phase out dates. Given the polluter pays principle, there are no plans at national or EC level to provide for compensation as referred to in the question. <Col N="1337" /></P>

      <P>The promotion procedures which apply in the case of officers of the Permanent Defence Force are set out in detail in Defence Force Regulations A15.  The corresponding arrangements for noncommissioned personnel are contained in Defence Force Regulations A10 and associated administrative instructions.  A summary of the principal provisions is set out as follows.</P>
      <P>In general promotions to fill vacancies in the ranks of Commandant or above (including Brigadier General) are effected by the Minister on recommendations made through the new merit system the principal feature of which is the setting up of promotion boards to assess and interview candidates in relation to prescribed criteria.  There is, however, separate provision for promotion within a fixed period for junior officers up to the rank of Captain and for professional officers up to the rank of Commandant, subject to suitability.  The Regulations provide for the promotion of Privates to the rank of Corporal subject to the completion of certain courses and to fulfilment of certain requirements in relation to conduct and medical condition. Promotion within non-commissioned officer ranks is effected by the Adjutant General normally on the basis of recommendations by selection interview boards.  Candidates for interview must be recommended by their Commanding Officer and have completed prescribed courses.  Other relevant factors taken into account are seniority, suitability, conduct, health, overseas service and experience.</P>
      <P>Arrangements relating to promotion come within the scope of the conciliation structure which has been established for the representative associations in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 172 together.  There is a long standing commitment in principle to the undertaking of a significant development programme at this harbour, provided the costs can be justified by reference to the economic benefits arising.</P>
      <P>Because of the extremely exposed nature of this harbour and the complexity of the design issues, which could have a major bearing on the scale of costs which could arise, comprehensive predesign exercises were required.  To this end a hydraulic model study was commissioned. This comprehensive study is on-going.  In July 1992 a site investigation, which is a prerequisite of such development projects, was started.  This site investigation was later halted pending more favourable weather conditions. It will recommence during the summer. Pending completion of these exercises, I am not in a position to indicate the feasibility of any development project or the associated costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The E3 Tanker project, as it is officially termed, began in 1990 when five leading European Shipyards (Astilleros Espanoles (Spain), Bremer Vulkan &mdash; and Howaldswerke &mdash; Deutche Werft (Germany), Chartiers de l'Atlantique (France), and Fincantiere (Italy) launched a co-operative effort for the design of a new tanker generation reflecting market requirements up to and beyond the year 2000.  The project was presented at a conference on tanker safety in Brussels last month.  The Commission and member states will be monitoring development of the design project with considerable interest.</P>
      <P>The impetus for the project came from the concern at the number of accidental oil spills from tankers and the need to replace the ageing world tanker fleet.  The tanker design is for a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC), is 318 metres in length, 57 metres in breadth, 280,000 deadweight tonnes and has a carrying capacity of 2 million barrels of oil.  The design surpasses both International Maritime Organisation and US Oil Pollution Act, 1990, requirements in having and extended double hull aimed at minimising the risk of breaching cargo tanks in the event of collision or grounding.</P>
      <P>The design of the project aims to fulfil three key requirements: to provide an extremely high level of protection against accidental and operational pollution of the seas; to be competitive in capital and running costs when compared with other alternative designs in the market; and to utilise advanced technology together with European workmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the designers are confident that the E3 environmentally-friendly <Col N="1347" /> VLCC Tanker has a good commercial future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that European shipyards are making a concrete contribution to the effort to reduce the threat of pollution through the design of a new generation of large oil carriers.  Commercial initiatives such as this will usefully complement the Community's political and legislative measures to enhance safety and the prevention of pollution at sea.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.  EC Regulations provide for individual producers quotas rather than national quotas in the suckler cow premium scheme.  The individual producers quotas are based on the number of suckler cows in respect of which the premium was paid in 1992.  As applications for the suckler cow scheme were accepted up to the end of 1992 and as the retention period for the scheme is six months, it will not be possible for some time yet, to indicate the total number of suckler cows which received the premium in 1992.</P>
      <P>The EC Regulations provide for the establishment of a national reserve quota equal to at least 1 per cent and at most 3 per cent of the sum of the individual quotas allocated to producers.  I will confirm the details of the national reserve at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <P>The scheme was revised in January 1992 and under the new rules a young farmer is being allowed up to two years to meet the minimum labour unit requirement of 1 Man Work Unit &mdash; previously this criteria had to be met at the time of installation.  This revision applies to all applications from 1 January 1990.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present examining the various elements of the installation aid scheme with a view to ensuring a more effective availability of the measure.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in making telephone contact with staff in the section of my Department in Castlebar dealing with suckler cow and ewe premium quotas.  The section has only recently been set up and is not yet fully staffed or equipped.  My Department is giving priority to staffing it fully and equipping it with more telephones. Indeed additional staff is being assigned to the section with immediate effect and additional telephone facilities will be provided shortly.</P>
      <P>At present there is an internal extension available to the section and the staffing consists of an assistant principal, a higher executive officer and two executive officers.</P>

    <P>B.  Control Measures.</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for supervising and certifying production of beef for APS aid contracts and for intervention storge.  My Department is also responsible for supervising and certifying production of male beef for export with the benefit of exports refunds and for payment of the refunds.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Customs) is responsible for the verification and certification of the description, characteristics and weight of the products under customs control for export and for monitoring the products while in store.</P>
    <P>In a programme of controls upgrading at present being followed a number of new procedures are already in place.  The updated control system includes the setting up of a Beef Controls Division which is responsible for systematic unannounced visits to beef plants and cold stores, on a regular basis.  The unannounced visits include <i>post-factum</i> checks on random selections of all aspects of the plants' and cold stores' activities. In addition a number of additional new staff have been assigned to beef plants to augment existing staff there.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this new Beef Controls Division a Systems, Investigation and Training Section has been set up which is responsible for follow-up investigations and for monitoring the inspection system.  This includes a regular monitoring of the control arrangements, reviewing the documentary and office procedures, updating the sanctions applicable and liaising with the other State agencies involved &mdash; customs, gardaí and the legal services.  That section is also responsible for putting in place an extensive training programme for new and existing control officers on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>The new system provides that all meat traders, meat processors, cold stores and sub-contractors involved in EC market support schemes will in future be registered by my Department and all must formally undertake to abide by the regulatory provisions.  New formal and tighter contractual arrangements between the Department and those involved in intervention and deboning operations have been drawn up.</P>
    <P>This whole new approach provides a unified, streamlined control system with <Col N="1369" /> full departmental control at the point of intake; a strong supervisory presence at other points of the chain; a switch in emphasis from the permanent presence towards <i>post factum</i> scrutiny; a measure of mobility between plants in the assignment of control officers and strong investigative and training functions.  All of this is being implemented within the Intervention Unit, set up in October 1990, to bring together within a single structure all of the Department's functions in regard to intervention and export refund activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, in respect of beef placed in storage under the exporter refund regime I understand that Customs Authorities carry out separate control checks on a spot-check basis at different stages between placing beef under control and its exportation and also at the point of exportation.  My Department and the Customs Authorities work in close co-operation to ensure the effective application of all regulatory provisions.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that fewer than 500 of the 8,000 Mayo farmers who applied for special beef premium grants in June 1992 have not yet <Col N="1370" /> been paid.  Most of the outstanding cases are the subject of queries or have been rejected by computer at a validation check.  All of these cases are being given urgent attention and it is hoped to have the bulk of them cleared for payment in the near future.</P>
      <P>Approximately 3,600 applications for the special beef premium schemes were lodged in Mayo in the November/ December 1992 application period.  A further 5,200 applications were submitted during the January/February application period.  These applications are being processed at present.  It is expected that payments to November/December applicants will commence before the end of May.  Payments in respect of applications submitted in January/February are expected to commence early in November in accordance with EC Regulations which provide for the payment of 60 per cent of entitlements after 1 November.</P>

      <P>In a reply to a similar question put down by the Deputy on 19 November 1991, it was indicated that the price at which land is allotted is a matter reserved by law to the Land Commissioners and that I have no function in the matter.  The land has been vested in the person named and at this stage the Commissioners have no legal power to alter it.  I can confirm however that the purchase price recently offered is correct and in accordance with the Governments' decision granting a 50 per <Col N="1371" /> cent discount on the outstanding advance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate I am sure that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the purchase prices being offered to the neighbours.</P>

      <P>The intradermal tuberculin test is the officially recognised test for Bovine TB, both at EC level and internationally.</P>
      <P>The development of an accurate blood test is at the experimental stage and an animal from the herd in question was blood sampled as part of on-going research on the development of a diagnostic blood based test.  It is hoped that in the future a suitable blood test could be used to augment the tuberculin test but it is not intended that a blood test would change the status of an animal which fails the tuberculin test.</P>

      <P>Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease have occurred in 53 holdings in Italy.  The export of animals and their products from affected areas of Italy is prohibited by an EC decision.  The source of this infection is believed to be cattle imported from Eastern Europe.  Because of uncertainties as to the exact origin and movements of these cattle the EC decided to place a temporary ban on the importation of susceptible animals and products from all Eastern European countries.  The latest indications are that the outbreak in Italy is under control.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241, 242 and 243 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following signature of a Letter of Intent between Coillte Teoranta and Louisiana Pacific, detailed negotiations, involving Coillte Teoranta and the Industrial Development Authority and Louisiana Pacific, are continuing in connection with the planned establishment of an oriented strand board facility in this country by the end of 1994. No firm decisions have yet been made to establish such a facility although it is intended that the project would be a joint venture between Coillte Teoranta and Louisiana Pacific and in addition Coillte Teoranta would supply approximately two thirds of the raw material requirement. In this regard the facility under discussion would require an annual volume of 650,000 cubic metres of raw material of a minimum diameter of 7cm, any species and any age.  On this basis, the output would be approximately <Col N="1380" /> 250,000 metric tonnes of oriented strand board per annum.  The principal market for the product is envisaged to be the European Community.</P>
    <P>In so far as the location of such a facility is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter primarily for the promoters to decide in the event of the negotiations now underway being completed successfully and within the context of determining the overall economic appraisal of the project's viability.  All areas of the country are being considered and the main factors which would influence a final decision in this regard would be inbound raw material costs, outbound transport costs, land availability, transport infrastructure and the supply of water and energy.</P>

      <P>A study has been commissioned into the marketing of the services of the Geological Survey of Ireland which is under the aegis of my Department.  The contract for the work was signed on 23 April, 1993 and work is expected to continue until 23 June, 1993.  My Department will be making a contribution of not more than IR£1,600 towards the expenses and the costs of the organisation carrying out the study, the Graduate School of Business in UCD.  The project was not put out to tender due to its low cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of oil and gas exploration detailed information relating to wells which have been drilled and seismic data which has been acquired by companies through their activities in our offshore, is made available to my Department.  When the confidentiality period of the data has <Col N="1387" /> expired it is the policy of my Department that it should be made available to the widest extent in order to encourage further exploration.  In order to do this the services of Erico Petroleum Information Limited and Erico Data Services (Ireland) Limited have been acquired to market and distribute the information. Under the terms of the relevant contracts, my Department receives certain royalties from the companies' sales of the data.  Five firms were asked to tender for these contracts.  The initial three year period of the contracts, which began on 18 July, 1991, has been extended to run to 17 July, 1994, and when this expires my Department will decide whether to re-tender for these services.</P>

    <P>The Dublin gas network is now well up to international standards.  Expenditure in this area will continue, where necessary, to maintain this status.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis estimates that, of approximately 300,000 households in the greater Dublin area, it has identified around 200,000 homes on streets where a gas supply is available.  Of those, a total of 160,000 are customers.  At present, BGE estimates that there are approximately 100,000 homes in non-gas areas.</P>
    <P>In the light of its statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis, Bord Gáis intends to offer natural gas to everybody currently without a supply and to make it available where there is sufficient interest, and where it is economical for the Board to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in the House on 10 February 1993 by my colleague the Minister for <Col N="1390" /> Health, the registration of stillbirths had not been provided for in the original legislation governing the registration of births which we have inherited from the last century, and it will now require a change in primary legislation to achieve this.  Preliminary work on a comprehensive review of the entire code of registration legislation covering births, deaths and marriages has been undertaken by the Minister for Health but will now be taken over and carried out by my Department. The object of the review, which is a major task of considerable complexity, will be to determine how registration procedures and structures devised in Victorian times can be modified to suit modern conditions and needs.  I will ensure that the question of the registration of stillbirths is given sympathetic consideration within the context of the review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 281 together.  Details of arts and culture projects (exclusive of Irish language projects) which have benefited from national lottery funds from 1987 to 1992 <Col N="1396" /> are listed at Appendix 1.  Lottery funds committed to similar projects by my Department for 1993 are detailed at Appendix 2.  Funds committed by the National Heritage Council in the period 1988 to March 1993 are detailed at Appendix 3.  The Arts Council is funded by both the Exchequer and the national lottery and detailed lists of grants given by the Council are published in their annual reports, copies of which are laid before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy on patient numbers and duration of stay is set out in the following Table 1.</P>
      <P>In relation to costs, my Department has been developing detailed mechanisms for attributing hospital costs to the different elements of the hospital's activity.  These mechanisms enable more reliable estimates to be made of the daily cost per in-patient than was previously the case.  At present, this information is available for twenty of the biggest hospitals, and is set out for 1991 in Table 2. 1992 figures are not as yet available. These figures exclude costs attributable to out-patient services, long-stay cases, day cases and dialysis.  It should be noted that they do not take account of capital costs.</P>

      <P>The present position is that cardiac surgery for public patients is performed in three locations &mdash; the National Cardiac Unit at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, Cork Regional Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>In 1990, a working group which was chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of my Department recommended a significant expansion of cardiac surgery services.  Specifically, the Group recommended that cardiac surgery services should be further developed in Cork Regional Hospital to provide for a doubling in the number of public open heart procedures which could be carried out in that centre.  It also recommended that the capacity to carry out public open heart procedures should be increased by one third within the Dublin area.  The working group and the cardiac surgeons considered that the proposed increased capacity for open heart surgery at Dublin and Cork would meet the national requirements for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain that my predecessor accepted the recommendations of the working group.  This has been Departmental policy since 1990 and has not been changed by me since assuming office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The position is that this patient is on the semi-urgent out-patient waiting list at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the consultant concerned, and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of his case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other procedures), ophthalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties, and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussions regarding waiting lists are now nearing completion with the various hospitals and health boards, including the Western Health Board, and I will shortly be announcing my decisions in regard to the allocation of the £20 million.</P>

      <P>An additional £8.5 million has been made available in 1993 for the development of services for people with mental handicap. The total allocation for services for people with a mental handicap this year is approximately £209 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the additional £8.5 million I have made available new resources of £2 million <Col N="1441" /> to strengthen the funding base of the direct funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs. As many of these agencies provide services in more than one health board area it is not possible to say at this stage how much of the additional money is going to each area.</P>
    <P>£4 million has been allocated to the health board regions, of which £586,000 has been allocated to the South Eastern region.</P>
    <P>The guidelines issued to the South Eastern region proposed that 8 residential/respite places, 50 day care places and additional home support and early intervention services be put in place in 1993.  The precise services to be provided in the South Eastern region will be agreed by the mental handicap co-ordinating committee, which is representative of the health board, voluntary agencies and parents, within the guidelines issued by my Department and will be subject to my approval.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees and approved by my Department. Accordingly, it is not yet possible to indicate how much will be allocated to each area.</P>

      <P>Firms are contracted from time to time by my Department to assist with market research, advertising and public relations.  These firms are not paid a retainer but are contracted on a fee per service basis.  The duration of the contracts vary depending on the nature of the service involved.

    <P>The State advertising contract for the placing of advertisements and notices on behalf of all Government Departments is held by Brindley Advertising Ltd.

    <P>The Assessment and Advisory Committee was established in 1975, with the approval of the Minister for Health, to assess the qualifications of chiropodists who wished to provide services on behalf of health boards or who might apply for full-time employment as officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>The committee operates independently of the Department of Health, under its own terms of reference, and seeks to maintain standards in chiropody services provided to public patients.  The committee assesses persons by reference <Col N="1447" /> to their qualifications or experience.  The criteria for admission to the committees list of approved chiropodists are: (1) the possession of a formal qualification in chiropody gained after a course of at least three years duration from a recognised School of Chiropody or (2) completion of a number of years in full-time practice in chiropody prior to June, 1963, subject to assessment.</P>
    <P>These are the same as the criteria required by the statutory Chiropodists' Registration Board in the United Kingdom and for employment under the British National Health Service.  A long-standing reciprocity of standards with the United Kingdom has thus been maintained.</P>
    <P>There is no recognised School of Chiropody in the Republic of Ireland.  The possibility of establishing such a facility is under active examination given the relative shortage of formally qualified chiropodists here.</P>
    <P>I am, at the moment, examining the whole question of how chiropody services are provided to public patients.</P>

      <P>The sale and supply of condoms is governed by sections 4 and 5 of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1992.  Under the legislation, outlets are not required to be officially designated for the sale of condoms. Section 5 of the Act requires that condoms may only be supplied to persons over the age of 17 years or who are married. The sale of condoms must also be under the supervision of a person over the age of 17 years.</P>
      <P>The sale of condoms is however prohibited through the following outlets; vending machines, mobile outlets, street vendors, primary or secondary schools, youth clubs or sports centres, catering for persons under the age of 17 years.  As provided for under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to bringing a new Bill to the Oireachtas, before the summer, to amend the existing Act and to provide for the more widespread availability of condoms.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of the problems regarding the school transport service to Dernakesh NS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bus serving Dernakesh NS operates <Col N="1460" /> three trips, one to Cootehill Comprehensive School, and two to Dernakesh NS.  On the first trip to Dernakesh NS, approximately 70 pupils are catered for.  The first pupil is picked-up at 8.40 a.m.  These children arrive at school at 9.10 a.m.  The bus then collects approximately 30 more pupils.  They arrive at 9.40 a.m., 10 minutes after school commences.  In the evening, the 30 pupils are brought home first.  The remaining 70 are then collected at 3.40 p.m., with the last set-down at 4.10 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Department normally operates a policy of first in, first home.  Having consulted with Bus Éireann, a change in the time-table will be made.  This will mean that the 70 pupils who are first in, will now be first home in the evening, while the smaller group of children will have to wait approximately 35 minutes after school to be collected.  This is the fairest way to operate the service, as the waiting times will now be shared more equally between the two groups.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received, from Dún Laoghaire Corporation, a proposal which would enable the Blackrock School Attendance Officer to function in the Dún Laoghaire School attendance area which includes Ballybrack and Loughlinstown; the reason she has refused to sanction the proposal; and the reason she has not yet responded to the request for information regarding her intention for the school attendance service in the Dún Laoghaire, Rathdown, area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the School Attendance Acts approval of the appointment of School Attendance Officers and provision for their remuneration are matters for the appropriate council of the county borough, in the case in question Dun Laoghaire Corporation.  The Minister for Education merely sanctions such appointments and the level of remuneration. The deployment of School Attendance Officers is a matter for School Attendance Committees.</P>
      <P>Having given careful consideration to it, I regard the proposal from Dun Laoghaire Corporation that an allowance be paid to a school attendance officer to provide a limited service to an area where there is a vacancy for a school attendance officer as inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Were Dún Laoghaire Corporation to propose the appointment of an officer to fill the current vacancy I would be happy to sanction an appointment.  It would however be a matter for the Corporation to fund the post.</P>

      <P>While the question of making school facilities available to the public is one for the school managerial authorities, I am aware that many second-level schools already make their premises available as suggested by the Deputy.  My Department issued a Circular to schools in April 1992, urging them to make their premises available as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the use of school premises for community purposes outside the school hours and I would strongly urge that school buildings provided by way of State aid should be readily available for such use.  I will be addressing this matter further in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is <Col N="1509" /> determined by the enrolment on the 30th September of the previous year.  In the case of Scoil Íosagáin, Aughavannagh Road, Dublin 12, there were 281 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September, 1991.  This enrolment warranted a staff of Principal plus 9 assistants.  The school also has the services of a concessionary teacher under the scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas and a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>There were 260 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September, 1992, which warrants a staff of Principal plus 8 assistants for the 1993/94 school year. An enrolment of at least 273 pupils was required on that date in order to retain the post of 9th assistant for 1993/94.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school might qualify for the retention of the post of 9th assistant under either of these exceptions, my Department would be happy to examine the position on receipt of details.</P>

      <P>I met with EC Commissioners Padraig Flynn and Bruce Millan on 18 March 1993 to discuss with them the implementing of regulations for the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, respectively.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this meeting was to brief the Commissioners on the broad policy objectives which I wish to pursue in the context of the next round of structural funds and to discuss with them the extent to which these objectives could be facilitated within the eligibility criteria being proposed for the operation of both Funds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a National Development Plan is in the course of preparation for the utilisation of the next round of EC Structural Funds. Proposals for developments in the education sector will form an integral part of that plan.  It would, therefore, be premature for me to discuss, in the manner requested by the Deputy, specific proposals for interventions in the education sector.</P>
