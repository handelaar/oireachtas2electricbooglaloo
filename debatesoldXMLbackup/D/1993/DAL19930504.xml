    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's most immediate objective in relation to Northern Ireland is to achieve the earliest possible resumption of the three-strand talks process. This commitment reflects our belief that a durable peace can stem only from an equal accommodation between both traditions on this island.  The talks process mirrors this, through its focus upon seeking to balance the many elements within and between the three relationships. The ultimate objective of the talks <Col N="130" /> must be the establishment of political arrangements to which each tradition can give unequivocal allegiance.  The eventual form of these arrangements is a matter for negotiation and agreement between all parties to the process and, thus, comment on any specific proposal would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches particular importance to the principle of confidentiality as enshrined in the agreed basis for the talks.  Therefore, I do do not propose to comment on any specific aspect of the exchanges which may have taken place between the Government and other parties to the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the negotiations for peace and political progress in Northern Ireland are complicated and difficult enough already without people raising problems to which they are not able to propose a solution? Why then has the Taoiseach decided to put the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 on the table and make it an issue in these talks without saying what changes he wants to that Act?  Does the Taoiseach want an end to the British connection or joint authority?  If the Taoiseach cannot answer that question why is he raising this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising that question and many others because they are fundamental to the achievement of lasting and enduring peace in the North.  If the Deputy does not see it that way, he is entitled to his view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be well aware that we do not deal with individual aspects of negotiations in the public arena as it is not conducive to good negotiation, to the finding of a peaceful formula or to the achievement of an <Col N="131" /> agreement on an institutional framework to which both communities can give unequivocal allegiance.  I am sure that, deep down, the Deputy appreciates that but, for other reasons, he may feel he has to ask questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no other reason for putting the question apart from wanting to understand why the Taoiseach has raised an issue, namely legislation that has been on the Statute Books since 1920, which he apparently wants to change although he is unable to say in what respect.</P>

We will proceed on that basis.  I am aware that Sir Patrick Mayhew said that he intends to bring forward some type of British paper.  I do not regard what he has said as a proposal to produce a blueprint.  It is purely a paper with some <Col N="132" /> ideas on which to kick-start the talks process on which I expect the Irish Government will be fully consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objectives of my visit to the United States from 20 to 26 April were; to promote manufacturing investment, financial services development and increased trade and tourism investment; to hold discussions with Irish American opinion formers in relation to Northern Ireland, and to assess at first hand the present situation of Irish emigrants in the US and how our efforts on their behalf are progressing.  I see job creation following from the meetings I had in Boston and New York on manufacturing, financial services, trade and tourism projects as the key reason for my visit.  In both Boston and New York, accompanied by senior IDA personnel, I met executives of a number of US corporations that are considering establishing <Col N="133" /> plants in Ireland or are planning to expand their existing operations here. Owing to the extremely keen competition for such investment, I do not consider it appropriate to list the names of the companies in question or any other particulars that could adversely affect a positive outcome.  Indeed, this keen competition underlines the necessity for this visit and for further similar visits by me and by Government Ministers.  The reality of international competition for scarce new jobs through mobile investment is that contact at senior Government level plays an increasingly key part in securing new projects.  It is also essential to ensure that rationalisation following in particular from the EC Single Market does not adversely affect us.  I found the meetings I had to be of potentially great benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Boston, I met some of the most prominent representatives of the Boston-Irish business community.  Again, I availed of the opportunity to emphasise the competitive advantages of Ireland as a location for overseas investment.  I launched the Centre for Irish Management at Boston College.  The centre constitutes a new structure through which the Development of Entrepreneurs in Boston for Ireland programme, known as DEBI, and a range of new programmes will be administered.  The DEBI programme &mdash; which is largely financed by the International Fund for Ireland &mdash; brings young entrepreneurs from Ireland, North and South, to Boston for a four-month period during which they receive tuition at the School of Management and pursue a corporate placement in a firm which relates to their particular business interest.  Therefore the centre will give these young people an opportunity to experience American business at first hand while, at the same time, giving them complementary academic training.</P>
    <P>I officially opened Ireland House at New York University.  Ireland House joins a small and select group of national houses at the University.  I am confident that the comprehensive programme of Irish studies and events which are planned <Col N="134" /> for there will become an important resource for Irish academic and cultural activities in New York.  It will undoubtedly enhance the cultural, artistic and academic links between Ireland and the United States.  The university conferred on me an honorary degree for which I am deeply grateful.  The ceremony also included the conferral of Presidential Medals on eight prominent Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is important at this juncture in the Northern Ireland situation to outline clearly and discuss constructively the Irish Government's position with opinion formers in the American-Irish community. I did this at two levels, through meetings with individuals such as Mayor Flynn and Cardinal Law of Boston and through interviews broadcast at a national level in the United States.  In meeting Mayor Flynn, who has recently been nominated to be the US Ambassador to the Holy See, I also used the occasion to convey the Government's deepest appreciation to him for his commitment to Ireland, to the Irish community in the United States and to extend our best wishes to him in his new position. I discussed with him a proposal partly sponsored by Boston Ireland Ventures and the International Fund for Ireland to provide training and work experience for 300 unemployed young people from the inner cities of Dublin and Belfast in Boston.  I also had occasion to meet former Congressman Brian Donnelly and Congressman Bruce Morrison, and to thank them publicly for their part in initiating legislation, which will have enabled about 70,000 young Irish people to gain legal status over the past four years, when the current programme is complete.</P>
    <P>While in Boston, I addressed a group of about 100 Irish emigrants most of whom were recent arrivals.  Also present at this function were representatives from two of the principal immigrant advice organisations there &mdash; the Irish Pastoral Centre and the Irish Immigration Centre. I thought it appropriate that their service on behalf of our emigrants should be formally acknowledged by me.  I was greatly encouraged by their commitment and dedication as exemplified by their <Col N="135" /> plans to hold a major jobs fair for Irish immigrants in late May.  In New York, I presided at the official opening of a second centre for the Emerald Isle Immigration Group in the Woodlawn section of the Bronx which has a large Irish-born population.  Again, I was most pleased to formally express the Government's deep appreciation of the very valuable work being carried out by this and other like-minded organisations in New York.  I also gave an interview to the Irish Ethnic Media there which covered a range of issues of particular concern to our emigrants.</P>
    <P>In addition to the functions I have mentioned, I addressed the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on the topic &ldquo;Ireland in Post-Maastricht Europe&rdquo;. This was followed by a question and answer session on various foreign relations issues as well as a recorded radio interview for extensive transmission.  The Council is the leading US forum in New York for the discussion of foreign affairs. I attended a reception hosted by the County Roscommon Association of New York.  I paid a courtesy call on the opening of the National Gallery Exhibition of Early Masters Paintings in New York.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants the details he will get them.  In New York I unveiled a plaque where Eamon de Valera lived for the first two years of his life as part of a function hosted by the American-European Community Association.  I unveiled a signpost in lower Manhattan proclaiming &ldquo;Drumgoole Square&rdquo; in honour of Father John Drumgoole, an Irish priest &mdash; Deputies opposite appear to laugh at the achievements of Father John Drumgoole &mdash; who devoted his life to the most needy and vulnerable in the society of his time. Deputies opposite are embarrassed now for having tabled the question.  I aunched the promotion of the Cobh Heritage Centre &mdash; maybe Deputy O'Keeffe will laugh at that too &mdash; in the US which <Col N="136" /> should prove to be a major tourist attraction, particularly for Americans of Irish ancestry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the next time if I get an opportunity.  The total cost of the visit will not be determined for some time.  I availed of a long-standing invitation to attend two Fianna Fáil night functions, one each in Boston and New York.  In all I attended 25 functions over a period of five days.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Half way through the answer I was getting weary.  First, it would be appropriate for me to congratulate the Taoiseach on being conferred with an honorary degree of Doctor of Law.  Would he agree that it would help dispel public apprehension that this was primarily a Fianna Fáil fund raising junket, and that those other meetings were merely window dressing put together to justify the State paying for it, if he could be more forthcoming and tell us the names of those companies which promised to invest in Ireland, how many jobs they are likely to create and how they are to be created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite Deputy Rabbitte's best efforts, despite being aided and abetted by other Members, to refer to two night functions out of an itinerary of 25 functions and try to present them as being the main purpose of the visit will not wash.  If Deputy Rabbitte is suggesting that meeting industrialists in Boston and New York, attending a meeting on future exchanges in New York to try to get an associate of that institution to come to the Financial Services Centre and wants to treat those and other cultural and tourism aspects as <Col N="137" /> irrelevant he will fail dismally in his task to try to misrepresent the purpose of that visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Taoiseach's reply.  This is the second occasion on which the Taoiseach has had an opportunity to reply to a question like this and has treated it trivially. The Taoiseach paid a visit to the United States and had an opportunity to brief the press and the public.  So far as the people here are concerned all that was presented on the media was the two Fianna Fáil functions.  From where did the Taoiseach get the power to decide to visit New York for two Fianna Fáil functions when he cannot ascribe the expenses incurred by his Office to the Fianna Fáil fund raising events?  Surely there should be some charge to his party in view of the fact that he spent so much time courting subscribers to his party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is despicable to try to misrepresent a visit which had so many important aspects to it so far as the Irish nation is concerned.  I do not know where Deputy Carey was during that period.  I understand my visit was dealt with adequately in the national media and on radio and television.  I have no apologies to offer to Deputy Carey.  Surely three and a half pages of a reply is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was tabled two weeks ago but, because some Opposition Members wanted to go to the international match last Wednesday, they decided to bring these questions forward. Will the Deputy explain that to the Irish people instead of going on with some of this nonsense?  The general secretary of Fianna Fáil, who is the principal organiser, travelled out at his own expense and any expense that was to be met by the party has been met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the Taoiseach on the conferring of a doctorate of law degree on <Col N="138" /> him.  The Taoiseach mentioned that when he was in America he accepted two long-standing invitations to attend Fianna Fáil fund raising functions.  If the Taoiseach could tell the House when he received those invitations it would afford the House and the general public a better way of assessing the merits of his reply.</P>

      <P>EC Directive 89/130 specifies that the GNP estimates of EC member states must be compiled in accordance with the rules of the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts (ESA).  According to these rules, the value of own-account production of services, including unwaged work, should be excluded from GNP.  This treatment is consistent with the recommendations of the United Nations System of National Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister stated that it is consistent with the United Nations System of National Accounts, but we agreed a UN Resolution in 1985 at the Nairobi Conference to document unwaged work.  That resolution called on all Governments to measure women's unwaged work and claimed that, if they did not, there would be huge consequences given the amount of unwaged work carried out by women and their low participation in the economy.  This is particularly true in the case of Ireland. Will the Minister consider compiling a <Col N="148" /> comprehensive report and examining how we could measure the contribution of women's unremunerated work?</P>

While nobody wishes to downgrade or devalue the work of anybody in the home, the Deputy will appreciate that including the own-account householder services in GNP would have serious implications and could start figures that <Col N="149" /> would be required in others.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 41, 45, 71, 100 and 275 together.</P>
      <P>Effective planning, implementation and review structures are in place which are addressing the serious public health challenges which AIDS-HIV represent. As Minister for Health, I am directly involved in the development of a comprehensive and integrated national AIDS policy in terms of prevention, treatment, care and rehabilitation.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am chairman, has developed a number of strategies to implement national policy goals as a priority on a multi-sectoral basis.  The Deputies will be aware of these strategies which concern the care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS, HIV-AIDS surveillance, education and prevention strategies and measures to avoid discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the strategies which received a major additional investment of £3.3 million during 1992, is currently being undertaken by statutory and voluntary agencies.  A sum of £4.4 million has been allocated specifically for the HIV-AIDS strategy during the current year.  This has facilitated the delivery of a range of innovative services and programmes aimed at stemming the spread of the infection.  These include: primary care clinics for IV drug users at which preventative and risk-reduction services such as methadone, needles and condoms are available on the basis of individual counselling and assessment; the provision of a consultant-led HIV-AIDS service in the Mater and Beaumont <Col N="151" /> Hospitals and hospice and palliative care for persons with AIDS.  This £4.4 million is additional to the general funding provided for the care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS through the mainstream health services.</P>
    <P>Programmes and services for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are an integral part of the health services, in common with the programmes and services for HIV-AIDS. These are also funded as part of the mainstream health services through the budgets of individual hospitals and a major mammography breast-screening programme is currently under way at the Mater Foundation.</P>
    <P>A prevention programme by way of information and education on HIV-AIDS is an integral feature of the ongoing work of my Department's Health Promotion Unit.  This element of the national AIDS strategy will be developed further with the implementation of a multi-media campaign on HIV prevention which I will launch during the present month.  The campaign will be very intensive and will involve TV and radio advertisements.  The campaign will be promote the need to practise safe sex and the role of condoms in this area.  In this regard, previous campaigns have been rather coy in relation to the role of condoms and the need to practise safer sex, and I intend that these issues will be dealt with more openly in the new campaign.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the more widespread availability of condoms and I propose to bring a new Bill in this regard before the Oireachtas as early as possible.  Also in the area of prevention, I am extending the HIV-risk reduction methadone programme aimed at IV drug users in line with the recommendations of the expert groups established to draw up a protocol for methadone prescribing.  The protocol will ensure that methadone is available to IV drug-users in an accessible and controlled manner.</P>
    <P>The surveillance of HIV-AIDS is an integral and essential element of the <Col N="152" /> national AIDS strategy.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee has recommended an extension of our existing surveillance programme which is based on: (i) the reporting of cases of, and deaths from, AIDS to the Department of Health; (ii) the reporting of positive HIV tests from the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, to the Department of Health, under the voluntary, linked HIV testing service and (iii) the anonymous, unlinked surveillance of HIV through the screening of bloods taken for routine clinical purposes at ante-natal clinics and which is surplus to requirements.  This will include testing of unlinked surplus bloods taken at STD clinics and out-patient departments.  This will be done on a phased basis.  I am satisfied that the summary of HIV-AIDS statistics and service developments which I issued in January 1993 accurately reflects the known position based on our present method of surveillance.  In this context, the number of HIV positive homosexuals reported during 1991 was 38 and 37 during 1992; and in HIV positive intravenous drug users it was 49 during 1991 and 67 during 1992.</P>
    <P>As regards AIDS co-ordination, the current structure facilities the effective development and implementation of our national AIDS strategy on a multi-sectoral basis and in a co-ordinated manner. They are being kept under review to ensure that they are responsive to any change in the reported epidemiology of the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accuse the Minister of a certain amount of negligence in so far as this entire issue is concerned.  With specific reference to his reply, will the Minister state the number of times the National AIDS Strategy Committee met since he took up office?  How many times has this committee met the incumbent Minister for Health since last April?  In view of the fact that he does not appear to be on top of the problem, will the Minister consider the request to set up an independent body who would oversee <Col N="153" /> the implementation of the very sound recommendations of the strategy committee, as published in April 1992?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time the Deputy has accused the Minister of negligence, and once again he is wrong. I am taking the issue very seriously.  I have had one meeting with the National AIDS Strategy Committee, which I chaired, since I came into office some three months ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very long meeting and covered a number of issues, including reports from three Government Departments, a number of voluntary agencies and all the statutory agencies involved in the foundation of a national AIDS strategy.  Since I came to office, I have promulgated new legislation which, I hope, will be brought before the House in the immediate future.  The charges laid against me by the Deputy opposite are totally without foundation.  I am convinced he will realise this when he sees the impact of the initiatives I have announced, including the multi-media campaign, a new protocol on methadone prescribing, new clinics for treatment and the improvements in palliative care for those with AIDS.  This campaign and the legislation will provide ample proof that I am a very concerned Minister and very much on top of my brief in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that he ignored my comments on the setting up of an independent body, I take it that the Minister does not favour this idea.  Is he prepared to reappoint the national AIDS co-ordinator, a post abolished by his predecessor almost a year ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the National AIDS Strategy Committee is the most effective way of dealing with this problem.  The former national AIDS co-ordinator is retained as a consultant to my Department and is a member of the national AIDS co-ordinating team. In fact, he was involved in the drawing-up <Col N="154" /> of the methadone protocol.  He is available to me for advice, and I shall take any such further action I deem appropriate to deal most effectively with the issues which arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply referred to the legislation on condoms. Is he prepared to put a timeframe on this legislation?  We have been hearing about this legislation since the Minister came to office.  We also heard about the activities of the Office of Public Works in Clare and in regard to national monuments; legislation in these areas was passed with the agreement of the House within a matter of hours.  Having regard to the fact that he confirmed, through the statistics he has given today, that the increase in HIV is within the heterosexual community, and not within the other at risk groups which were heretofore responsible for the increase in this infection, will the Minister take the matter a little more seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that my short sojourn in the Department of Health seems a long time to the Deputy opposite, but I can assure him that the Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is my objective to have it brought before the House to coincide with national AIDS day, which is this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 39 together.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides for the registration by health boards of all nursing homes, enhanced powers for health boards in ensuring high standards of care in nursing homes and a new system of subventing persons in nursing homes.  Regulations have been drafted which set out the conditions under which a person may qualify for a subvention under the Act to include an assessment of means of the person applying for the subvention.</P>
      <P>The objective of the new scheme of nursing home subventions is to ensure that the new subventions are paid to those most in need.  For this reason it is necessary to have a means test which will assess fully the financial position of each person who applies for a subvention.  The proposed assessment of means takes into account the income of the person applying for subvention and the value of assets owed by the person.  If the person applying for subvention has a spouse, that person's income will be assessed jointly with the applicant's in accordance with the principles and practice of the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the regulations, as currently drafted, health boards may not take into account the income of an adult daughter or son in deciding whether a person is eligible for a nursing home subvention. However, it is proposed that health boards may take the income of adult <Col N="156" /> daughters or sons of the person who is eligible for a subvention into account in deciding how much the subvention should be.  The circumstances in which health boards may make these inquiries will be limited by the subvention regulations.</P>
    <P>The proposed new system of subvention will replace existing arrangements which have been criticised by the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, the National Council for the Elderly and other groups active on behalf of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the funds allocated for the new subvention scheme must be distributed in an equitable manner to ensure that subventions are paid to those most in need.  The proposed assessment of means and circumstances has been designed to ensure that this will be the case, by taking into account the financial situation of and resources available to those applying for subvention.  The same means test will be applied in all health boards to ensure an equitable approach throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 by 1 May 1993, provided that negotiations had concluded with interest groups on the draft subvention regulations by that date. Negotiations are continuing with the nursing home associations and other interest groups about the new system of subvention.  I will implement the Act as soon as these negotiations have been concluded.</P>
    <P>To ensure as broad an input as possible to the draft subvention regulations, I have consulted with those organisations with an interest in the nursing home sector and in the welfare of the elderly. The following groups have been consulted on the draft subvention regulations: the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association; the Federation of Catholic Voluntry Nursing Homes; the Council of Homes; the Jewish Home of Ireland; the National Council for the Elderly; the Association of Nursing Homes; the Alzheimer Society of Ireland; An Bord Altranais; Age Action Ireland; the <Col N="157" /> Carer's Association and the Irish Association of Older People.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 a regulation made under that Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as it is made.  Each House may pass a resolution annulling the regulation within the following 21 days on which that House sits.</P>
    <P>I presume that the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 April 1993 to which Deputy Proinsias De Rossa refers is the one by Padraig Ó Moráin entitled &ldquo;Nursing Homes Benefit may be means tested&rdquo;. The article is misleading.  The draft regulations do not permit health boards to take the income of adult sons or daughters into account in deciding whether an applicant is eligible for a nursing home subvention.  It is proposed that health boards may take the income of an adult son or daughter into account only in deciding the nature and amount of subvention to be paid to an applicant.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the additional funding made available to implement the Act is used to help those without sufficient funds to pay for nursing home care.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern of some families supporting relatives in nursing homes in relation to the draft subvention regulations.  I would like to assure these families that the proposed new system of nursing home subvention will enable health boards to pay a greater contribution towards the cost of nursing home fees than is at present available if a family is experiencing genuine difficulties in funding the care of an elderly parent.</P>
    <P>The maximum amounts of subvention under the draft Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations are under negotiation at present.  The draft subvention regulations, including the procedures for the assessment of means and circumstances, are available from my Department if Deputies wish to check them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's rather lengthy reply might well have been contained in one line, in that he has confirmed <Col N="158" /> to the House what he had already circulated to some private groups within the community, which is that he intends to proceed with a rather elaborate and outrageous system of means testing that will deny thousands of people throughout the community redress under the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I put it to the Minister that, in effect, he is ensuring that very few people will qualify for a subvention under the provisions of that Act.  Would the Minister elaborate on the condition that the means of sons and daughters will be taken into consideration in the assessment and say whether such will apply in the case of sons and daughters who may be living outside this jurisdiction?  For example, would he say what will be its application in the case of sons and daughters who, for one reason or another, may have fallen out with the applicant and will not be in a position to provide the relevant health board with the requisite information to allow a subvention be assessed?  I put it to the Minister that it is an outrageous attack on thousands of carers throughout the community.</P>

      <P>I am interested in endeavouring to do the greatest possible good with the resources available to me.  For example, this year I succeeded in getting £4 million to implement the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which has been on the Statute Book for quite some time.  Henceforth we shall have a proper system of nursing home subvention.  I am determined that the money available to me will go, in a targeted fashion, to those most in need.  It is important that we do not have an open-ended scheme, leading to anybody, regardless of their income, availing of scarce State money.  I reiterate that the only factors taken into consideration in assessing eligibility will be an applicant's medical condition, his or her income and that of a spouse.  They are the only criteria used in determining eligibility.  In determining the scope and scale of the actual subvention, it is reasonable to take into account the income of sons and daughters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there are sons and daughters who are not in contact with elderly parents, who are abroad or who have lost contact with them even within the country, there will be no question of that in any way affecting the level of subvention being made available.</P>

      <P>The review of the maternity and infant care scheme was initiated by the former Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, to examine the role and effectiveness of the scheme in the context of the maternity services generally.  The initial membership of the group was as follows: Dr. Peter Boylan, Master, National Maternity Hospital; Dr. Gerard Cummins, General Practitioner, Irish College of General Practitioners; Mrs. Norah Cummins, Public Health Nurse, Institute of Community Health Nursing; Dr. A.N. de Souza, Director of Community Care, South Eastern Health Board; Ms. Maura Foran, Western Health Board; Dr. Elizabeth Griffin, Neo-Natologist, Coombe Hospital; Ms. Dora Hennesy, Department of Health; Dr. Peter Keogh, General Practitioner, nominated by the Irish Medical Organisation; Dr James Reilly, General Practitioner, Irish Medical Organisation; Dr. Martin White, General Practitioner, Irish Medical Organisation; Dr. Jim Kiely, Department of Health; Dr. Tom Matthews, Paediatrician, Faculty of Paediatrics and Dr. Brendan Powell, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently expanded the group to include a midwife and a consumer representative.  Ms. Ann Martin, midwife, was nominated by An Bord Altranais and the consumer representative, <Col N="161" /> Ms. Bernie O'Hanrahan, has been nominated by the Council for the Status of Women.  The group is chaired by Mr. Peter McQuillan, former chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board.  The work of the group will be completed this year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am delighted to note that the Minister has included in the group a representative of the midwifery profession since the exclusive consumers of all maternity services are women.  The absence of such a representative had been one of the great deficiencies of the maternity and infant care scheme since establishment.  In relation to the gender balance on the review committee, is the Minister happy that a proper balance, between males and females, has been struck?  Can he confirm that only four or six of the 14 members are women?</P>

      <P>When I was given the breakdown I was concerned that a proper balance had not been struck and, for that reason, I expanded the membership to include two other women.  The difficulty when one establishes boards such as this is that when one asks constituent bodies, such as the IMO or other faculties, to nominate a person one has to accept their nominee.  I do not think the gender factor was taken into account by all the nominating bodies but I will take it into account if any further boards are set up during my term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by Deputy McManus in relation to fatalities from the effects of solvent abuse is at present being collated &mdash; I hope to receive it this afternoon &mdash; and I shall forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 74 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which came into operation on 1, December 1991, makes it an offence for a person to sell, offer or make available any substance to a minor where the person has reason to believe that the substance or its fumes will be inhaled for the porpose of causing intoxification.  The penalty for an offence is a fine of up to £1,000 and/or up to 12 months' imprisonment.  The <Col N="163" /> section also empowers the Garda to seize substances in the possession of children in public places which they suspect are being abused.  As the Deputies opposite might recall, an Opposition amendment was accepted by the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of section 74 is a matter for the Garda and I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that the Garda authorities are not aware of any difficulties in the operation of the provision.</P>
    <P>The issue of drug and solvent abuse is always a cause of concern and I am keen that every effort possible is made to educate our young people with regard to the effects of misuse of drugs.  This implies not only the giving of information about the various substances of abuse at the appropriate age, but providing young people with opportunities to develop skills, awareness and self esteem that will enable them to resist pressures to become involved in potentially harmful drug usage.</P>
    <P>To this end the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has in place a number of initiatives designed to combat drug misuse and I am satisfied that these represent a comprehensive response to the problem.  However, this is a constantly changing problem and we are vigilant to ensure that our prevention efforts are properly focused and effective.</P>
    <P>In addressing the complexity of this problem it is important that prevention efforts be multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary in nature and, for this reason our education efforts are often done in co-operation with other Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>This approach has led to co-operation between my Department and other Departments and agencies in producing a substance abuse prevention programme, a drink awareness for youth programme, specific solvent abuse prevention materials and a community based training programme to tackle issues at local level.</P>
    <P>Another significant even which involved many Departments and agencies <Col N="164" /> was European Drug Prevention Week which took place from 16-22 November last year.  The activities of this event were co-ordinated by my Department and involved the Departments of Education, Justice and Labour as well as many non-statutory and voluntary agencies.  The event served to raise awareness about the vast range of initiatives in place to help combat drug misuse among young people.  It also saw the introduction of several new initiatives. It is envisaged that this project, which was supported by the European Commission, will be repeated every two or three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister does not have any figures it is estimated that there are ten fatalities every year.  In view of the recent tragic case in which a 12 year old girl died as a result of solvent abuse is the Minister not concerned about the failure of his Department to provide adequate treatment for those under 18 years of age?  I am shocked that the Minister did not deal with this matter in his reply.  It is quite clear that adequate treatment is not available for those under 18 years of age &mdash; who are most prone to this form of addiction &mdash; particularly if they live outside Dublin.  How does the Minister, who claims to be a reforming Minister, intend to tackle this serious problem for young people who, as I said, are most at risk?  It is probably not possible to legislate in this regard given that the solvents in question are easily accessible. Will the Minister indicate what initiatives he intends to take to cope with this problem?  I have no doubt that if it is not dealt with it will become worse in the future.  Finally, will the Minister approach manufacturers to see if it would be possible, given advances in technology, to make these substances unappealing so that they would be repellent to people?  This problem must be tackled on a number of fronts because it is far too easy for young children to get their hands on these solvents and abuse them, thereby putting their lives at risk.  The kernel of the problem is the failure of the Department to provide <Col N="165" /> adequate treatment for children addicted to solvents and, sadly, this problem will not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of the Deputy's points and I am very concerned about the matter.  This issue was discussed at great length when specific sections of the Child Care Act, 1991 were debated.  In relation to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy it is ironic that the provisions of the Act proved to be effective because, when the child in question sought to purchase the solvent, she was refused.  Unfortunately, an older person acquired it for her, with tragic consequences.  The retailer in question knew the legal situation and thus the provisions proved to be effective.  The question of making contact with the manufacturers was also discussed when the Child Care Bill, 1991 was debated.  As Minister for Health, I will again examine this matter &mdash; there is some merit in what the Deputy said &mdash; to see if solvents can be made less attractive but I presume it is the prospect of intoxification that is most attractive rather than anything else. There are a number of training and education programmes which I hope will prevent substance abuse.  In regard to the question of the provision of treatment for those addicted to substances, as the Deputy rightly said, I did not provide the details in my initial reply but I shall communicate with her when they become available.  I will check the numbers to see if there are any grounds for worry and whether people are in a position to avail of counselling and support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister is not aware of what is available. It is quite clear that no facilities are available for children addicted to solvents, particularly if their families are not in a position to pay for private treatment facilities.  In addressing the lack of services I hope the Minister will pay particular attention to the fact that if one is poor it is practically impossible to obtain comprehensive treatment, particularly for someone under 18 years of age.  This <Col N="166" /> is a further inequity for those whose lives are at risk in relation to this kind of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take what the Deputy said into account.  I listed a number of substance abuse prevention programmes and I do not want to take up the time of the House by going through them again in detail.  I believe a good framework has been put in place. It is not possible to identify everybody with an addiction but I will see if the mechanisms of the Outreach programme can be improved.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the very valuable contribution made by voluntary groups under the aegis of the hospice movement in the provision of hospice and home care for the terminally ill.</P>
      <P>In many instances, multidisciplinary care is provided for such patients in co-operation with local hospital and community care services.  Partnership and co-operation between the statutory agencies and voluntary bodies working in this area is essential to ensure that services for the terminally ill can be provided in a planned and co-ordinated fashion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to learn that I recently launched the newly formed Irish Association for Palliative Care which will provide a network of support for all those involved in palliative care services throughout the Thirty-two Counties.</P>
      <P>It will encourage the development of palliative care services nationally and will seek to promote educational and research initiatives in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also had the pleasure of launching the association's booklet <i>Guidelines for the Development of a Palliative Care Service,</i><Col N="167" /> the publication of which was partly sponsored by my Department.

Perhaps he could make a sum of money available to the hospice movement through the national lottery? The hospice movement does excellent work but is not established throughout the country.

However, I will provide it for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 42, 249, 252, 270 and 272 together.  All the issues raised by the Deputies in these questions were examined recently by a group representing my Department, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board.  This group had been asked to undertake a comprehensive examination of the number and distribution of consultant <Col N="169" /> and non-consultant hospital doctor posts in acute hospitals.  Based on this examination, one group was asked to put forward suggested courses of action designed to achieve an equitable mix and distribution of medical manpower through the country.  It was also asked to identify other issues which might need to be considered, such as the medical career structure.</P>
      <P>The discussion document proposed by the group has just been presented to me, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board.  I am studying it and hope to formally circulate it for discussion to all the interested parties in the near future.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on any of the specific recommendations in the document until that process is complete.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister respond to Question No. 16 which asks if it is envisaged that the number of consultant posts will be increased, as there was no reference to this?  The report to which the Minister referred recommends a 40 per cent increase in the number of consultant posts throughout the country. What is his view on the appropriate ratio between consultant and non-consulant hospital-doctor posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the specific question in conjunction with a number of others.  This question asked if I was satisfied with the number of consultant posts.  That specific question was put to the review group and their report has just come to hand.  I said in my reply that I do not wish to be drawn into commenting on its specifics at present.  However, I am on record in Opposition as saying that I am not satisfied with the distribution of non-consultant hospital doctor posts and consultant posts.  I will have to address this as Minister fo Health.  We must have an attractive career structure for Irish medical students so that they will continue in the profession.  I do not think it is appropriate for people to be in training, which I suppose non-consultant hospital doctors are until they become consultants, <Col N="170" /> for a huge portion of their lives. It is not appropriate either that doctors become consultants in their late thirties to early forties as it would be appropriate and beneficial to the health services if they were appointed at an earlier age.</P>
      <P>These are my views and I am very interested in hearing the results of the ongoing discussions before I make a final decision in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very fine for the Minister to be interested in listening to the ongoing discussion but the number of consultant posts is directly linked to the waiting lists, there lies the urgency of the problem.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to think there has been a decrease in the number of consultant posts and that this has led to waiting lists. There has been a rise in the number of consultant posts throughout the past 20 years; for example, in 1984 there were 1,085 consultant posts and in 1992 this rose to 1,170.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors which, obviously, necessitated a review.  I will look at this review, listen to the advice of those involved and make decisions in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, is it true that the ratio of consultants to non-consultant hospital doctors is very low compared with other countries in the EC?  Will the Minister comment on the fact that we continue to train a large number of medical undergraduates at a high cost to the taxpayer and ship them out because there are not enough consultant posts available to them to work their way up through the system?  At present we are subsiding the richest country in the world, the US, by exporting highly qualified graduates, who cannot remain because the opportunities for promotion are not available.  I presume the Minister is in favour of providing additional consultant posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to enable consultants to job-share, as has been done in the National Health Service in Britain?  Clearly this is the desire of a proportion, not all, consultants and would be immensely beneficial to the Irish service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues and I am in agreement with her on some of them.  As I said, I am concerned about the career path available to doctors, the implications this has for those who were trained at great cost to the State and then take the emigrant boat and secure very lucrative positions elsewhere, particularly in countries that can afford to train their own doctors. As a consequence, up to 34 per cent of non-consultant hospital doctor posts in this country are filled by non-nationals. We can work to achieve a better balance and this was one reason the review was instigated in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of applications for job-sharing at consultant level in recent times.  This has been looked at by Comhairle na nOspidéal and I am interested in its views on this matter. Depending on the speciality involved, some would be more amenable to job-sharing than others where more consistent care is required.  I would have to consult with the professionals in relation to that matter.  On the initial question relating to the disposition of new consultant posts, one matter that concerns me is the ever-increasing specialisation whereby there may be any number of specialities right down to the tiniest aspect of surgery or clinical medicine.  That matter will have to be considered with a view to getting the best possible value and the most efficient means of dealing with the resources available.</P>

As I explained in the presence of the Deputy opposite at an important health gathering over the weekend, these charges were introduced to raise revenue for other initiatives.

Given that the increase in charges has been inbuilt into the non-capital allocation to health boards for the current year, the Minister does not expect the review committee will recommend any changes, and if it does recommend changes, the Minister <Col N="173" /> will not act on them, at least in the course of the current year.</P>

      <P>The review group will consider more than simply the charges.  I want to see how best the services can be delivered.  I indicated to the Deputy that people have various comments to make on the charges.  Some general practitioners regard them as far too generous in that I am encouraging people to use out-patient departments at general hospitals rather than use general practice; some health board officials believe they are too generous in that for a charge of £60 a family will have access to accident and emergency services or out-patient services for a year, thereby encouraging people away from general practice; while others feel it is a barrier to people using these services.  I want to find out what the true position is so that there will be the best use of resources and the best standard of care for patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister said about the need for this review to educate him on the matter, in effect he put the cart before the horse in terms of these charges.  He used a blunt instrument by imposing across the board increases in charges without any knowledge of their impact.  Having done so he decided to review the matter because he was not fully aware of the effects on the community.</P>

I am sure his party gave very careful thought to the impact of the charges when they allowed the enabling legislation to be enacted in this House in 1987 and did not vote in favour of the motion to annul the charges.

The provision of an extra £30 million in this year's budget, increasing the total voted expenditure for health services by 12 per cent in a very difficult year, is proof of my commitment in this regard.

      <P>There are 1,335 patients awaiting cardiac surgery as at 30 April 1993.  Heart surgery for public patients is performed in three locations; the National Cardiac Centre, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork Regional Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cardiac surgery waiting list which includes patients from all health board areas is reviewed by the cardiac consultants on a regular basis to assess each patient and to determine the priority attached to each case.  The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned and is based solely on the patient's condition. <Col N="176" /> Twenty million pounds will be provided in 1993 for a major action programme to reduce hospital in-patient waiting lists. Cardiac surgery will be a priority in the allocation of funds for this major action programme and I will be announcing my decision in this matter in coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister said he is going to put in place a plan of action with specific reference to heart surgery, does he agree with the comments of his predecessor that heart by-pass surgery is a fashionable exercise and not one that requires urgent medical attention?</P>

      <P>Submissions from both Cork and the two Dublin units, the Mater Hospital and St. James' Hospital, have been made to me.  To give Deputies opposite a view of my intentions in this regard, approximately 1,000 cardiac operations were performed last year. With the resources available to me I can make significant improvements in those numbers.  The total in Dublin last year was of the order of 750 and I hope to raise that figure to 1,000.  The total in Cork was of the order of 200 and I hope to raise that to 400 which, annualised, would be the extent of the total waiting list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the situation that a two-tier health service exists and that if any one of those 1,335 patients can beg, borrow or steal £10,000 he or she can have a heart by-pass operation tomorrow in the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital?  Is the Minister aware that the terminology of his reply <Col N="177" /> to Deputies in relation to urgent representations being made to him regarding patients in our constituencies is exactly the same as that given by his predecessors, Drs. O'Hanlon and O'Connell? In other words, if the patient's condition gives rise to complaint he or she should consult their GP.  That is making a fool of very sick people.  The Minister should at least show some creativity and change the terminology of his replies. Will the Minister treat this as a priority because in most cases it is a matter of life and death?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy prepared his supplementary question before listening to my reply.  I said I intend increasing the number of heart operations in Dublin from 750 to 1,000 and in Cork from 200 to 400.  This will represent the most significant increase ever.  That is a measure of the priority that I attach to these matters.  I am not happy with the present position and am determined to address it.  That is why I have fought hard to obtain resources from Cabinet to carry out an initiative on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>In relation to the terminology of my replies, obviously a patient's need for treatment is a clinical decision.  No one in urgent need of a heart operation should be deprived of that if the clinical decision is that it is urgent.  There will never be a time when we will have no one on waiting lists.  That is not possible regardless of what resources we provide because there are always new patients arriving to be treated.  I intend to maximise the provision of heart surgery and a number of other specialist surgical procedures and I will make a significant impact on these procedures in the next 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's efforts to redress the balance he has given in his reply the misleading impression that obtaining heart surgery is need-based when we are all aware it is money-based.  If one can afford to pay for treatment privately the chances of getting an operation are hugely increased.  Would the Minister agree that there is a double disadvantage for public <Col N="178" /> patients because the poor socio-economic factors related to cardiac conditions are such that if one is poor one is more likely to suffer from a serious cardiac condition?  That is a hidden disadvantage for the people on waiting lists for major surgery to relieve their condition.  I appreciate the Minister is dealing with the problem of waiting lists and is trying to provide additional resources. However, if he does not address the inherent contradiction within the health service in relation to this type of treatment, inevitably, those people who most need treatment are those who will be unable to avail of it because of the present two tier system.  Simply shoring up an existing system, which is based on inequality, will not address the problem because next year the Minister may find that another sector within the health service is requesting emergency funding and he will be unable to deal with the problem.</P>

It is my responsibility to optimise the public health service.  My colleagues in Government agree that resources should be allocated to make the necessary changes in relation to this matter.  The Deputy who shouted we should stop subsidising it will find inherent in the charges, and the increasing charges this year, that the largest amount of money was allocated to secure a better return from private <Col N="179" /> patients in public hospitals for the faciities available to them.

We are all pleased that surgeons carry out emergency operations but people who are on the waiting lists do not move up the list unless they have a heart attack or others on the list die.  I accept the Minister's bona fide plan to improve the system, but will it cater for people on the waiting list?  Surgeons are run off their feet and I express my gratitude to them.  I see them as the present day Florence Nightingales of the medical service.  People only realise the work surgeons do when those close to them undergo operations.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Carey's anxiety in regard to people who have been a long time on the waiting list. However, the decision in regard to dealing with the waiting list is a clinical one made by a doctor on the basis of need. <Col N="180" /> I discussed this with specialists.  Some patients may be diagnosed as in need of by-pass surgery but not immediately. Sometimes it is suggested it would not be in their interest to have such surgery in the immediate term.  That may sound fanciful but that is the case in some instances.  The length of time is not always the determining factor.  If 1,400 or more procedures were carried out annually and there is an annualised waiting list of about 1,300, we should have a full patient turnover annually. Obviously, emergency cases and those in clinical need will be given priority but there should not be long waiting lists.</P>

      <P>My role is to be primarily responsible for the public health service but I am mindful of the fact that most people who avail of private medicine are contributors to the public health services, because they pay PRSI contributions, and are entitled to avail of a public hospital.  My only function in terms of distinguishing between the two is to have a clear view of those who opt for private and those who opt for public care.  People who opt for private care should be charged something approximate to the real cost of providing it.  I have moved towards that and I will continue in that direction in a way that allows the balance to which the Deputy referred to be maintained. <Col N="181" /> I do not intend to abolish private medicine.</P>

The Minister referred to specific targets with regard to clearing the list this year.  I put it to the Minister that a figure of fewer than 1,000 operations in the Dublin area, means in effect that the proposed unit at St. James's Hospital will not be proceeded with having regard to departmental targets and that the unit in the Mater Hospital could cater for 1,000 operations in a year.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on Aer Lingus.  I am anxious that private medicine is available but that it would not ultimately determine the quality of medical care.  I accept what the Deputy said about moving towards a situation where people who opt for private care pay something approximate to the cost of the provision of that service.  It is not acceptable that a significant cross-subsidy should exist between the public and the private health service.  I have already had discussions with various organisations and hospitals about that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 58 together.  The provision of services for people with a mental handicap in County Mayo and, in the first instance, is a matter for the Western Health Board.  It is also a matter for the board to determine the level of funding required for the maintenance of those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the additional funding of £8.5 million which has been made available for the development of services in 1993 for people with a mental handicap, a sum of £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions to provide a broad range of additional services.  The allocation of this additional funding was determined on the basis of the waiting lists for services and on the current level of service provision in each area.  The precise services and their location in the western region will be agreed by the mental handicap co-ordinating committee <Col N="183" /> within the guidelines issued by my Department and are subject to my approval.  As a result, I am not yet in a position to inform the Deputy of the additional funding which will be made available for mental handicap services in County Mayo this year.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees and approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for people with autism, these services are provided in County Mayo by the Western Care Association as part of their mental handicap services with financial assistance from the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Crisis relief is regarded as an essential element of services for people with a mental handicap and every effort is made to ensure that the needs of families in emergencies are met.  There are facilities for day care at the Western Care Association in addition to respite care and day care facilities at Arus Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>A development plan for the provision of services specifically for children and adults with autism has been prepared by the association and is being examined by the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of services for people with autism, national lottery funding of £65,000 was provided by my Department through the Western Health Board to the association in 1992 to facilitate the replacement of facilities at Ballinamore.  A further national lottery grant of £70,000 was provided to the association in 1992 to assist them with funding difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the £8.5 million for future development the Western Health Board got a paltry £158,000 for 10 per cent of the country's population?  Is the Minister <Col N="184" /> further aware that the Western Care Association which caters for 400 young people through providing intensive services, remedial centres, training centres, early childhood centres and so on have had their funds cut back by £412,000 this year?  The Minister may refer us to the Western Health Board but the decision was due to a shortfall in funds and, as a result, 32 jobs are on the line.  I put it to the Minister that the week before the election the Minister's director of elections, Mr. Barry Desmond, promised, among the detailed proposals in Labour's programme, the provision of £25 million next year to catch up with the Needs and Abilities report prepared by the last administration and effectively shelved by them.  How can the Minister brazenly turn his back on such a clear and unequivocal commitment, on which the hopes of so many parents and carers hung?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very proud of my ability, with Government support, to provide the greatest amount ever of resources for mentally handicapped services. We provided £8.5 million in addition to the £6 million extra provided last year bringing total expenditure on mentally handicapped services this year to £209 million.  Of course, it is not enough.  I wish I had more money for the elderly, child care and a range of other services.  The reality is that voted moneys for the Department of Health amounted to £1,700 million this year.  With other expenditures this year we will spend in excess of £2 billion.  I am anxious to provide the best possible service, particularly to parents of mentally handicapped people.</P>
      <P>In the Western Health Board area I understand that discussions are taking place between the Western Care Association and the Western Health Board.  I hope that particular difficulties in that area can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has honoured the clear commitment to give priority to mental handicap services.  Most mental handicap organisations throughout the <Col N="185" /> country have already congratulated the Government in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the particular problems of autism? Where there is an autistic child in a home the situtation is catastrophic, there are behavioural problems and they injure not alone themselves but anybody within striking distance.  I have here a file containing eight letters from parents who are literally prisoners of their children in their homes.  When the Minister comes to Mayo to open the new general hospital will he meet the parents to hear at first hand their situation and try to do something positive to retain some semblance of crisis relief?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>An important issue is the support given for residential care and obviously resouces have to be targeted to the area of need.  The information available to me is that we are in need of approximately 1,324 residential places, 3.9 per cent of which are in the Western Health Board area.  I accept and am personally aware of the requirements of people with autism.  Last Friday I opened Sligo General Hospital and availed of the opportunity to visit the Cloonamahon centre.</P>

Their attendance was impossible when they were not notified.  I wish to protest that the meeting was held without informing them.

      <P>Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that each House of the Oireachtas has the power to make its own rules.  Article 15.12 provides that all official reports and publications of either House, as well as utterances made in either House wherever published, shall be privileged. Article 15.13 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that Members of the Oireachtas shall not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.  The Committees of the House of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1976, makes provision similar to Article 15.13 of the Constitution regarding utterances of Members of the Oireachtas at committee hearings &mdash; this means that no action can be taken against them outside the Oireachtas no matter what they say. The Houses of the Oireachtas are sovereign under the Constitution and are entitled to legislate and discuss matters of national policy and public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule has its own merits in ensuring that the judicial process is not encroached upon, or a case prejudiced to the extent that it could lead subsequently to a mistrial, it is obviously widely accepted in the House that the rule as applied heretofore was too blunt an instrument which leant too far in restricting comment whenever there were court proceedings in existence to the detriment of debate of national issues in the Dáil.  Over time this had a disproportionate effect on Dáil proceedings and prevented the House from discussing matters of real public concern. The convention of the <i>sub judice</i> rule must be considered against the background of the inherent right and duty of the House to debate any matter considered to be in the public interest.  This House will, of course, retain the right to relax the application of the rule further should the occasion demand.  The operation of the rule has always been subject to the right of the Dáil to legislate on any matter.  Indeed on two occasions previously, <Col N="354" /> for the debates on the Greencore Report and the Cavan rape case, the convention was set aside.  In view of the primacy attached to motions of no confidence the application of the rule has also been relaxed in such motions in November of last year and October 1991.</P>
    <P>The application of the rule or convention of <i>sub judice,</i> meaning &ldquo;in course of trial&rdquo; was a self-regulatory power to restrict debate in the House.  By convention for almost 70 years the Dáil has imposed upon itself the voluntary restraint of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the general desire to avoid the risk of prejudicing judicial proceedings.  The risk of prejudice occurs when comment in the Dáil might influence a jury or prejudice the position of parties or witnesses or otherwise prejudice proceedings.  On 22 October 1986 the then Ceann Comhairle gave the following description of the <i>sub judice</i> rule:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, which has operated in this House for over 60 years, is to protect litigants, plaintiffs and defendants and ensure that actions coming before the courts are not prejudiced by being discussed in this House which enjoys absolute privilege.  If the rule were to be ignored and the House used as a sort of pre trial forum or as an alternative for other court procedures &mdash; I have in mind interrogatories and discovery &mdash; in my opinion it would undermine our system of justice, bring about unfair judgments, and influences unfairly tribunals, judges and juries.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 8 April 1993 the House passed the following motion:</P>
    <P>Subject always to the right of Dáil Éireann to legislate on any matter (and the guidelines drawn up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges from time to time), and unless otherwise precluded under Standing Orders, a Member should not be prevented from raising in the House any matter of general public importance, even where court proceedings have been initiated:</P>
    <P>Provided that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> 1.  the matter raised must be clearly related to public policy;</P>
    <P>2.  a matter may not be raised where it relates to a case where notice has been served, that is to be heard before a jury or is then being heard before a jury;</P>
    <P>3.  a matter should not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or judicial tribunals;</P>
    <P>4.  Members may only raise matters in a substantive manner, that is by way of Parliamentary Question, debate on the adjournment and, Motion and so forth where due notice is required; and</P>
    <P>5.  when permission to raise a matter has been granted, there continues to be an onus on Members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might in effect prejudice the outcome of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>This motion is an attempt to ensure that a fair balance is achieved between the inherent right of the Oireachtas to inquire into and debate matters of public importance, on the one hand, and the need to ensure that any such debate should not prejudice proceedings before the courts, on the other hand.  It will open up debate on matters of public concern particularly where so called &ldquo;gagging writs&rdquo; were utilised in the past.  In effect the intention of the conditions is to strike a better balance in that the benefit of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the past will be maintained while at the same time allowing matters of public concern to be debated.</P>
    <P>There is an element of risk involved in that there can be no guarantee that comments will not be made which may be subsequently regarded as being prejudicial or as interfering with the courts. The onus of responsibility in this new found freedom of debate rests with the individual Deputy.  No guidelines or conditions <Col N="356" /> of themselves can afford the same protection that operated heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Chair should not be placed in a position which requires him to make instant rulings during the course of a debate on the admissibility or otherwise of matters <i>sub judice</i>.  The Chair should have adequate opportunity to become aware that a matter to be raised is relevant within the context of the motion and to decide whether or not the matter is of general public importance. The long standing ruling of the Chair that &ldquo;Members of the Judiciary are independent by virtue of the Constitution and they may neither be criticised nor have their rullings referred to in the House except on a substantive Motion&rdquo; shall continue to apply.</P>
    <P>It became clear during the recent debate on Dáil reform when the issue of the <i>sub judice</i> rule was discussed that there is a divergence of opinion on how far debate on matters <i>sub judice</i> should be restricted.  It would be laudable, in my opinion, if the Dáil would not silence itself on issues freely spoken about outside the House.  Furthermore, the mere issue of a writ should not be allowed to stop discussion in this House.  We must be conscious, of course, of the fact that untrue allegations made under privilege in the House against non-members or organisations cannot be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>Freedom of speech is a fundamental right without which Members would not be able to carry out their duties. Members must be able to speak the truth without fear of retribution.  Imposed on this freedom are the constraints outlined in the motion passed by the House; these conditions have been put in place for the simple purpose of ensuring, in so far as they can, that proceedings before a court are not prejudiced by comment in the House which might influence a jury or prejudice the position of parties and witnesses. The Constitution confers specific functions on the courts and the principle of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution must be observed.  The motion recognises that the courts are the proper place to judge alleged breaches of <Col N="357" /> the law or claims by one citizen against another and the restraints are being adopted out of a respect by this House for the judicial process, the democratic rule of law and the proper upholding of our laws by fair trial proceedings.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that the relaxation of the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule has been long sought by the Opposition of the day as it inevitably allows a greater number of issues to be raised, which is the <i>modus operandi</i> of Opposition generally.  However, with the new found freedom to raise matters which were <i>sub judice,</i> there is an onus on Members to be responsible in their remarks and to avoid the temptation of reacting to the emotional clamour that often surrounds controversial cases before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important extension of the discussions that have taken place in committee and in the Dáil in regard to reform of this House.  We must assume that Members are elected to this House in the interest of the people and that they have that interest at heart. In the course of their legislative duties there will be occasions when public demand and opinion require that matters of importance to the nation and the people are raised in this House.  For 70 years this Assembly was extremely restricted in that people could not make comments that would be prejudicial to trials, that might lead to unfortunate circumstances for people or organisations outside this House or that might lead to a mis-trial.  Again, one assumes that every elected Member understands that they are elected to this House by democratic mandate to carry out their legislative functions in so far as they can and that, as they see it, matters which should be raised can be raised in the House.  In that regard it is important that the Government have conceded &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; on the requirement that Deputies from all sides should be allowed raise matters which people in every public house in the land discuss and in so doing that Members would be conscious <Col N="358" /> of their responsibilities under the mandate by which they were elected.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that matters raised in this House cannot be challenged in the courts, but the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should examine that issue. There have been occasions in the past where Members, for one reason or another, made strong allegations under the privilege of this House and, as determined recently by the High Court, no sanctions can be imposed on them arising from such allegation.  Therefore, it is important that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the regulatory body of this House, should consider if sanctions can be imposed against Members who make wild allegations about witnesses or organisations who are not Members of this Assembly.  Nevertheless, it is important that matters of public interest are raised here.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a member of the gay community was kicked to death in a public park in Fairview and a great deal of intense and emotional discussion took place in this House about whether statements should be allowed on such a sensitive and important matter and on that occasion statements were allowed.  I assume that every Member, and those who will be elected in the future, will respect the relaxation and freedom inherent in this change, which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also look at Standing Order 30 in this context.  Over the years very few Members have been allowed under Standing Order 30 to raise matters of public importance and urgent necessity. The purpose of this short debate is to explain to Deputies the criteria which will apply and the matters they will be allowed to raise under the relaxed <i>sub judice</i> rule.  Standing Order 30 should also be examined in this context.  A few years ago Members tried to raise under Standing Order 30 the proposed execution of a foreign journalist in, I think, Iran or Iraq, but the debate was disallowed on the basis that it was not urgent.  The person involved went to meet his maker, but the matter was not allowed to be discussed in the House under Standing Order 30.  This discussion <Col N="359" /> is important in that it explains to Deputies the matters they may raise, the guidelines laid down for raising these matters and the extent to which they may go in their statements.  I assume all Deputies understand that they cannot make comments which might prejudice a case before the courts or being decided by a jury, thereby leading to mistrial.</P>
    <P>This change is part of the overall reform package now going through the Dáil.  Provided the system operates reasonably well during this session, I understand that from the autumn session onwards there will be a three week plenary session of the Dáil followed by a one week debate on committee work. The relaxation of Standing Order 30 will be critical in the sense that there will not be a plenary session of the Dáil during that week and issues of vital national importance may need to be raised by a mechanism other than by way of Private Notice Question or a question to the Taoiseach.  In this context we should consider the relaxation of Standing Order 30 so that some matters can be discussed in the House.</P>
    <P>This change is an important step forward. I hope that the Ceann Comhairle will see to it that Deputies are entitled, under the relaxed <i>sub judice</i> rule, to raise matters which they consider to be important, matters which they would not previously have been allowed to raise in the House even though they were discussed openly in all sections of the media and on every street, lane and byway. Giving Deputies the privilege of raising such matters in the House will enable them to lead public opinion and meet the demand that political leaders raise matters of national importance.  I trust that in so doing Members will bear in mind that, even though allegations made in this House against individuals or organisations who are not represented in the House cannot lead to the imposition of sanctions on them by the courts, statements made by them in this privileged assembly can have serious repercussions for people outside the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that this brief debate will clarify <Col N="360" /> the position in regard to the relaxed <i>sub judice</i> rule, which will make the business of the House more relevant, immediate, fundamental and responsive.  The public are very cynical regarding the restraints and blockages in the operation of the Houses of the Oirechtas and I hope that this measure, which is part of the overall package of Dáil reform, will lead to a new and enlightened perception of this House by the public and enable the House to lead on many issues of public importance and to respond to public demands in an effective, proper and fitting manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a Member of this House during the period 1987-89 when these matters first became of considerable public interest and controversy. I presume these issues were controversial before that.  During that time the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was so concerned about this matter that it sought advice from counsel nominated by the then Attorney General in drawing up new rules relating to the <i>sub judice</i> controversy.  I have to say at the outset that I am somewhat disappointed that it has taken from 1988 until 1993, five years, for this House to face up to an issue which it realised in 1988 was of some considerable importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by a phrase used by Deputy Kenny which underlines to some extent the problems we faced.  He said that the Government was conceding something to this House.  Of course, the Government of the day does not regulate order in this House; it is the Chair who regulates order, in accordance with Standing Orders which Members put in place of their own free will.  Apart from ordering business in the House under the Constitution, the Government has no role whatsoever in the operation of the procedures of this House.  It never was, properly speaking, a matter for Government to concede anything in this House. This is not, in the last analysis, a concession made by the Government; we are making a concession to ourselves.  We decide what we will allow ourselves to say and what Standing Orders we will put <Col N="361" /> in place for the Chair to interpret and implement on our behalf.  This is not a matter for Government, and it never was a matter for it.  The sad fact is that this now seems to be almost a concession by the Government when it is not so. Deputy Kenny's phrase is telling in this regard.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make about the <i>sub judice</i> role is that it seems to cover two distinct areas.  The first is the notion referred to by the Minister of State about the separation of powers and the respect of the various organs of State one for the other.  The second is the protection of individuals engaged in litigation of a specific kind before the courts. These are quite separate considerations. In so far as it relates to proceedings which are ongoing before a court and the practice which grew up over the years, the <i>sub judice</i> rule was nominally for the protection of litigants; it was not there for the protection of judges.  The other rule, that is, the ruling by the Chair of this House on a consistent basis that judges should not be criticised &mdash; this was referred to by the Minister of State in his speech &mdash; is an entirely different species of animal; it has to do with mutual respect between the organs of State established under the Constitution.  There is a view that because judges are independent, as provided for in the Constitution their independence would be over-borne and considerably subverted if this House were to take on itself the role of commentary box on every judicial decision handed down and that in some sense the Judiciary would be performing under the spotlight of constant supervision and correction by political masters in this House. Those are two entirely separate matters: the first is the protection of litigants and the second is the respect owed to the court system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first matter, we, in this House, have been far too protective of the process of litigation over the decades.  When one considers that the Judiciary is not likely to be influenced by anything which is said in this House in the way in which it carries out its work and that the <Col N="362" /> issuing of a document, for example, a plenary summons in the High Court or a lesser summons or document in some other court, was sufficient in the past to make any state of affairs to which the document related a no go area for this House, it is obvious in retrospect that we erred totally on the side of caution.  The proof of the pudding is that every citizen is free to express his or her views on what is happening in the courts as long as they do not commit an act which might amount to contempt of court.  If they make a remark in public which is designed or is likely to have the effect of prejudicing the outcome of court proceedings or, in some sense, embarrassing a litigant and preventing a litigant from having fair access to justice by generating a wave of criticism that effectively denies him or her access to the courts in reasonably calm circumstances, they can be found guilty of contempt of court.  I could make remarks anywhere in this city which were perfectly acceptable to the Judiciary and did not amount to a contempt of court, but if they were made here where I have privilege, the same remarks would fall foul of a self-imposed censorship without regard to its fundamental purpose. The rule in relation to <i>sub judice</i> was overly encrusted with practice in this House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there has been a change, a realisation that this was an act of unjustifiable, unwarranted, self-censorship, and that this House has finally addressed the matter in terms which are a good deal more liberal than proposed in the various reports of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges since 1988, which culminated in this resolution having been passed recently.  A lot of effort was put into establishing a more restrictive code in relation to <i>sub judice</i> matters.  I am glad that finally this matter has been dealt with in terms which are, on the face of them, liberal.</P>
    <P>It was not just a matter, as the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, implied, of the Opposition of the day always being in favour of liberalising debate and the Government being against it.  This is not a concession made by Government; this <Col N="363" /> is a right we accord ourselves.  In the course of negotiations leading to the formation of a new Government in 1989 and the revised Programme of Government in 1991 this matter was tabled by my party on two separate occasions, with a view to ensuring that the Government did not obstruct the entitlement of Members to a fair rule in this regard which did some justice to the right of freedom of speech and to Members' rights to say things inside this House which they would be perfectly entitled to say outside the House.</P>
    <P>I am slightly worried about clause 2 of the proviso to the Motion which was passed.  It seems to me there is a misprint in it that it reads at present:</P>
    <P>A matter may not be raised where it relates to a case where notice has been served, that is to be heard before a jury or is then being heard before a jury;</P>
    <P>It would appear that some blip has occurred on somebody's word processor there.  The wording originally proposed was &ldquo;notice of trial&rdquo;.  There appears to be an error in the text of the proviso which I hope will be picked up and amended at some future stage.</P>
    <P>I note also that this is restricted to the courts.  Without in any way querying, in a disrespectful way, rulings you have made, a Cheann Comhairle, in relation to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, I note there is nothing here which changes the basis of the rulings you have handed down in relation to that tribunal.  I query why that is so.  Why are we liberalising in relation to the courts and retaining a restrictive, self-censoring view of our right to comment on other tribunals established in the public interest?</P>
    <P>I note also that the Minister of State has announced to this House that the following long standing ruling of the Chair that shall continue to apply:</P>
    <P>Members of the Judiciary are independent by virtue of the Constitution and they may neither be criticised nor <Col N="364" /> have their rulings referred to in the House except on a substantive Motion.</P>
    <P>I do not know why a member of Government considers that this is a matter on which he can announce what is to apply in future, since it is a ruling of the Chair. But, even if it is taken as indicative of the wishes of the parties in Government, I do not think that ruling is necessary.  One can be independent under the Constitution but can have one's rulings referred to in the House, other than on a substantive motion, without compromising one's independence.  It is suggested in the Minister of State's introductory remarks, that for some reason judges' rulings cannot be referred to in the House except on a substantive motion.  Effectively, that means that somebody would have to table a motion condemning a judge's ruling on some matter, or perhaps even a proposal to remove a judge under the Constitution before any ruling of a judge can be referred to in this House.  That is over-restrictive. I do not know where it comes from as a ruling in relation to the <i>sub judice</i> matter.  I do not know why it is relevant thereto but, in so far as it is proferred by the Minister of State as a practice that will continue, I query it; I say it is completely wrong.  Why should not somebody in this House refer to a judge's ruling in terms which do not compromise the judge's independence? Have we not had many occasions on which judges' ruling have attracted fair, level criticism by Members of this House, most recently in relation to sentences handed down by the courts.</P>
    <P>These changes are welcome but they are not made <i>ex gratia</i> by the Government. I worry very much about the statement of the Minister of State that judges' rulings may not be referred to in this House except on a substantive motion. In a modern, healthy democracy, the Judiciary are quite robust and capable of criticising Government and the Legislature on their failures to take certain steps.  They do so frequently in the Supreme Court and elsewhere.  Fair criticism of the Judiciary is of the essence of <Col N="365" /> democracy.  No judge should require of this House, or of this democracy, that his rulings should not be referred to except on a substantive motion.  No judge of any substance or note ever resents, or in any sense tries to inhibit, decent debate and level-headed criticism of his judgments. Independence and immunity from comment are not the same thing; they are very different.  If we had a Judiciary immune from criticism it would no longer be independent; it would become a self-serving and distorting feature of our society.</P>

      <P>May I make an opening point on a matter that has not really been contested by anybody so far, that is, the reference to the matter under debate as the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  To the best of my knowledge &mdash; and I am open to contradiction &mdash; there is no such thing as the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  What we are talking about is no more than a convention that has grown up in the House, self-imposed by Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that no criticism of yourself, Sir, or of your office is implied by this but I have gone back over some letters I and my colleagues have received from you ruling out matters on the basis they were not admissible under the application of the <i>sub judice</i> convention. If one takes a quick look at a cross-section of them one finds they really are instructive.  There was, for example, the cost to the State of money due to women under social welfare equalisation arising from judgments of the European Court on Human Rights in the Cotter and McDermott case; allegations of malpractice in the planning system in Dublin; public drugs dealing in Thomas Street in Dublin; the purpose of Garda raids on a named meat plant; the information available to the Department of Tourism and Transport regarding the Aer Lingus Holidays affair; certain matters relating to the Greencore affair; the non-payment <Col N="366" /> of compensation to former Irish Shipping workers; allegations of the fixing of bread prices in certain areas; the collapse of the prosecution in the trial of the two men charged with the murder of a German tourist in the Phoenix Park; and the question of compensation promised to Nicky Kelly.  The House would agree that those matters are of legitimate public concern and in many cases warranted action on the part of this House but because of the way in which the <i>sub judice</i> convention was interpreted we were not allowed to deal with them.</P>
    <P>In a letter that you wrote, Sir, on 4 October 1991 to my colleague, former Deputy Eric Byrne, you indicated that you had disallowed the following question: if the Minister for Social Welfare would give a breakdown of the cost to the State of the £200 million due to women as a result of the Cotter and McDermott case.  That was a notable case from the point of view of the women who had been affected in terms of their entitlement to social welfare.  The decision was made by the European Court.  Admittedly, other cases were pending in the Irish courts. The question to the Minister for Social Welfare was not permitted.</P>
    <P>While the Nicky Kelly case is still topical, we are not permitted to raise it.  The allegations of malpractice in the planning area in Dublin are the source of considerable and extensive public interest and concern.  Furthermore, the question of the Garda raid on a meat plant is an interesting one.  It is important to say that legal action was not always initiated; on occasion the mere threat or prospect of legal action seemed to be sufficient to adduce this rule or convention. In this case questions, in addition to those raised by Deputy McDowell, can be raised about the manner in which we have debated the conduct of the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry.  There were matters which had nothing to do with the issues under investigation which were of public importance and which this House ought to have discussed at that time.</P>
    <P>For example &mdash; I am not referring to any specific issue under investigation &mdash;<Col N="367" /> the question of the public interest and of who was there to prosecute it raised its head.  Until the day the tribunal completes its work this will remain a pertinent issue.  At an early stage in the affairs of the tribunal I was annoyed and angry about the manner in which counsel for the Attorney General interpreted their role.  Having considered the matter over a number of months I can see that counsel for the Attorney General were confronted with a genuine dilemma in that it is difficult to prosecute the public interest if as a result one may damage one's own clients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>In relation to their mandate on behalf of the State authorities and Ministers they seemed to take a partisan and selective view of who were entitled to have their interests protected. Distinctions were made as between Ministers, apparently on the basis of party affiliation.  On many occasions fundamental matters of public interest were let go and not prosecuted before the tribunal unless one of the other parties to the tribunal took them up.</P>

      <P>That is one aspect which warranted a discussion in this House because the <i>raison d'être</i> of the tribunal was to clarify these issues of public <Col N="368" /> interest and, if they were not adequately provided for, the chairman of the tribunal had to concede that counsel for the tribunal had to deal with them.

While I accept, Sir, that you have done no more than apply precedent and convention, we have been overly protective.  In a situation where there is such an imbalance in the House as between the Executive and the Opposition the <i>sub judice</i> convention should not be used as a shield behind which the Executive can hide.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the Irish Shipping case which arose in the early days of the life of the Coalition Government in 1984.  To this day we have not been able to raise issues on behalf of former employees of Irish Shipping in this House.  This surely is an unreasonable application of that rule.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell, who knows a great deal more about this matter than I do, on the question of the ability of this House to criticise decisions of the Judiciary.  Reasonable criticism is necessary in terms of the independence and status of the Judiciary but this matter has not been considered sufficient here.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions Fine Gael have raised the question of whether people should be sent to the stocks for abusing the privilege conferred on us.  I do not know what their fear is or from what misty depths of the past it harkens, but we have always been overly responsible in this House and I am sure all Members of the House will continue to be.</P>

      <P>&mdash;Repeal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; contained in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, thus enabling RTE to improve the range and quality of the public service broadcasting that it can offer to the Irish public;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Provision for access to broadcasting for the independent sector, thus enabling them to increase output and jobs in the audio-visual industry and giving them a firm home base to enable them to compete internationally;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Measures to ensure that commercial local radio broadcasting remains viable;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Ensuring that Irish advertisers have access, at a reasonable cost, to a strong domestic TV advertising medium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework for broadcasting in this country is based on legislation that is over 30 years old.  The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, under which RTE operates <Col N="370" /> has been significantly revised on only one occasion, in 1976, and the legislation under which the independent broadcasting sector operates, the Radio and Television Act, 1988, is modelled largely on the legislation applicable to RTE.  The foundation legislation comes from a time when public service broadcasting in Europe was the norm, when many Governments in Europe prohibited advertising on their broadcasting services; when the technology was such that there was very limited scope for people in one country to see the television programme services of their neighbours and when high powered telecommunications and broadcasting satellites did not exist. Today's broadcasting environment is unrecognisable from that of even ten years ago, never mind 30.  Today the number of television channels available to viewers who choose to invest in the necessary receiving equipment is ever increasing; the majority of the new channels are supported by advertising and their primary purpose in life is to maximise profits for their owners by maximising audience share with programmes appealing often to the lowest common denominator.  Even news and current affairs programming is increasingly seen as something that must be packaged to attract audience share, and perhaps packaged in a way that does not enable the viewer to be accurately and fully informed.  It is perhaps worth noting that according to an OECD report published in 1992 entitled <i>Telecommunication and Broadcasting &mdash; Convergence or Collision?,</i> the revenue structures for the public broadcasting service industry in Europe in 1989, based on data from 18 countries was as follows: satellite and cable advertising 1.2 per cent; Pay TV 3.4 per cent; basic cable subscription 5.4 per cent; TV licence fees 12.4 per cent; broadcast TV advertising 77.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reality is that international competition for Irish viewers is here to stay. It will not go away and there are no technical means at our disposal, even if we wanted to, to prevent reception of these services.  Yet, the philosophy of <Col N="371" /> public service broadcasting offers us the best model of democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>Against this sort of background, there is clearly a pressing need to look seriously at the present structures for Irish broadcasting services to see in what respects they should be altered and strengthened to ensure that Irish TV and radio programming is of the highest quality and that it remains the preferred choice of Irish viewers, in spite of international competition.  In this regard it is a measure of the relevance of home produced programmes on RTE to Irish audiences that these programmes attract the highest audiences.  I am in the course of examining all the issues involved and I will of course, be consulting with interested parties as my thinking evolves, and I have begun such consultations.  Whatever new structures are considered appropriate must guard against a gradual slipping away into an uncritical market led ideology.</P>
    <P>However, it must be recognised that this process of review of the existing structures will take time.  My aim is that whatever revisions are made will stand the test of time and will be relevant into the next century.  In the meantime I am satisfied that there are urgent issues to be addressed arising especially from our experience of almost three years operation of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  The Bill before the House can be regarded as but the first and critical step in the implementation of a comprehensive package of legislative proposals on broadcasting.  I believe that with these problems addressed in the Bill out of the way, the situation will exist whereby the regulatory structures for broadcasting in the longer term can be examined and considered calmly and completely in all their complexity.</P>
    <P>The Bill has essentially two elements. It provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, and restores the situation with regard to broadcast advertisements on RTE services that obtained prior to the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, that is that the total daily times and the maximum time <Col N="372" /> in any one hour for broadcast advertisements fixed by the authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. It also restores the situation to what it was when applicants for independent broadcasting contracts sought their franchises from the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that RTE must make specific amounts available for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector in each financial year.  The independent production sector has already proven itself to be able to make programmes of the highest quality and capable of significant international success.  Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 placed two restrictions on RTE in relation to advertising;</P>
    <P>(i)  a limit on the revenue which RTE could earn from advertising and</P>
    <P>(ii)  a reduction of 25 per cent in the amount of airtime which RTE could make available for advertising.</P>
    <P>This latter restriction was perhaps the most damaging for all the sectors associated with broadcast advertising.  The intention was to divert advertising revenue from RTE to independent broadcasters.  At the time the Act was framed, the independent national radio service &mdash; Century Radio &mdash; was in financial trouble.  It was hoped that the independent television channel would be on air quickly and that both would provide a strong alternative advertising vehicle to absorb the advertising diverted from RTE.  Since the Act was passed, Century Radio has closed down and the independent television channel has not emerged.  I should stress that at no stage did I ever accept the logic or indeed the object of such provision, as I do not believe that one sector has to be starved in order to promote another.  The capping provisions have failed manifestly to deliver any of the intended benefits and the very inflexibility of the provisions has resulted only in serious and continuing damage to RTE, to advertisers and advertising agencies and to independent <Col N="373" /> programme makers &mdash; I must emphasise with attendant job endangering and job losses.  Viewed from a certain perspective, a perspective which I do not share, section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, might have seemed like a good bet.  It was always certainly a gamble. Experience has shown that unfortunately the future development of broadcasting was wagered on what turned out to be non-runners.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difficulty with the 1990 capping provisions is that they institutionalise the concept that various groups of Irish citizens are target audiences and &ldquo;market segments&rdquo; to be exploited by broadcasters.  The 1990 Act says to broadcasters both in public and private ownership that one part of the &ldquo;market&rdquo; is yours, this part is not.  Your audience share should be this, your competitors' share should be that.  Broadcasters are condemned to spend their time maximising their share of the audience in order to prove their success.  If they are too successful within this pitifully narrow scope, they are, particularly if they are in public ownership, in trouble because then they have more than their &ldquo;fair&rdquo; share, they are accused of abusing their dominant position and there is a cry for a further levelling of the playing pitch. This rhetoric enjoyed a particular currency a few years ago.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this attitude has nothing to do with what broadcasting is about. The norms of creativity and critical capacity must be affirmed and supported in broadcasting and indeed in RTE.  At its best, a broadcasting service, public or private, community, local or national, is both an expression and a reflection of our culture and aspirations.  Broadcasting is about creativity mixed with a capacity to be critical.  It is about people being able to look at themselves critically and take control of change rather than be the victims of change as they are in pure marketled commercial broadcasting.  Broadcasting is at once a window on the world and on our own community, a mirror in which we can see the best and the worst in ourselves.  It can be an eye, a lifeline, even a friend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> Broadcasting has the power to release the creative talent of a community and of a nation, to lift national morale and to harness all that is best in ourselves.  The true potential of our radio and television services will never be realised if they are treated as just another commodity to a standardised formula like sausage meat, to be produced as cheaply as possible as if the only measures of the success of any particular programme are the size of its audience share and of its profits.  With the growing internationalisation of broadcasting services, there is no shortage of bargain basement television and radio producing bland pap both in its conception and execution.  Must we really condemn our own broadcasting services to compete at this level?  Surely it is far better to encourage our own programme makers to continue to provide quality material which is relevant to Irish viewers and listeners.  Irish broadcasters must be encouraged to provide an antidote to the trans-national factory sale approach to broadcasting.  We as regulators must insist that broadcasters continue to educate and inform as well as entertain.</P>
    <P>I have been available since I took office to meet and listen to all those with an interest in the fate of section 3 of the 1990 Act.  Virtually all sectors directly affected by the 1990 Act have stressed to me the severe operational difficulties they have experienced with the legislation.  RTE has found it impossible to live within the provisions of section 3 of the 1990 Act unless it literally turned away business or employs some mechanism which would have distorted the advertising market to a devastating extent.  If RTE was forced in 1993 to observe the cap on advertising plus the cumulative effect of the last two years, additional distortions will arise which will result in possibly irreparable damage.  As a result of the capping provisions many advertising production companies are now understood to be in severe financial difficulties.  To continue with the provision would leave RTE faced with the prospect of letting up to a possible 300 staff go.</P>
    <P>Advertisers' and advertising agencies' main concern has been the huge rise in <Col N="375" /> the cost of advertising which resulted from the reduction in advertising minutage imposed by the 1990 Act.  Industry sources estimate an increase of almost 55 per cent in the cost since the introduction of the 1990 Act.  This alone results in difficulties for small to medium sized advertisers in marketing products and in developing-promoting new or small indigenous brand names on RTE television; diversion of advertising to other television stations there are also indications that significant amounts are simply being withheld and of increasing amounts of non media &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; expenditure; indications that bigger diversion to UK terrestrial and satellite channels will occur if the Act is not changed and marketing control and-or the budgets of international companies reverting to head offices outside the country with negative consequences for advertising agencies, production houses and industry generally.</P>
    <P>Independent television producers are seeking the removal of the cap on RTE advertising revenue as the imposition of the cap resulted in a reduction in the amount of independent programmes commissioned by the station.  The figures are there to substantiate this.  It had the effect of initially freezing, then forcing a decline in the activity and the number of people employed.  They also feel that the continuation of the cap is preventing RTE from developing a constructive policy on independently produced programme commissions.</P>
    <P>The national newspaper industry is virtually alone in its support of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  Their position is that the Act should not be changed and should be implemented rigidly.  They argue that as RTE is in receipt of both licence fees and advertising revenue, RTE can keep the cost of TV advertising artificially low at the expense of the newspapers.  They contend that significant advertising would be diverted to them in the long run if the Act remains in force and that to revert to the pre-1990 situation would have serious implications for the financial viability of the newspaper industry.  Perhaps <Col N="376" /> the strongest assumption and the base of their case is that advertising revenue easily migrates from the visual medium, that is television, to the print medium, that is newspapers.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the newspaper industry has difficulties.  They are faced with increasing competition from UK papers which can be produced more economically than Irish newspapers given the UK economies of scale.  However, there is no underlying evidence to show that newspapers have benefited significantly from the 1990 Act.  On the contrary major advertisers have made it quite clear to me that their advertising budgets for media other than television &mdash; newspapers both national and provincial, local broadcasting and so on &mdash; have had to be curtailed in order to maintain their presence on television.  Industry figures also show a catastrophic drop in the number of days spent shooting commercials here from 147 in 1989 to 67 in the first ten months of 1992 reflecting a huge loss of income to freelance film makers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reduction in advertising time imposed by the Act and resulting increase in advertising costs has clearly demonstrated that certain categories of advertisers are prepared to spend virtually any amount to maintain a presence on television.  Because of RTE's preempt system of selling advertising time &mdash; a sort of auction &mdash; smaller Irish companies have been forced off television altogether, reduced the level of promotion for smaller brands and reduced the number of new television advertisements being made.  It is vitally important to the economy that indigenous companies and companies promoting brands developed in Ireland have access to a domestic television advertising medium at a reasonable price and that RTE does not have to rely on multinational companies to provide its advertising revenues.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that advertising revenue is being diverted out of the Irish economy.  I am very concerned that revenue should have to be diverted to foreign stations because of an artificial <Col N="377" /> distortion of the Irish television advertising market.  While there are differences of opinion as to the amount actually being diverted to non-Irish stations so far, there is no doubt that non-Irish stations are aggressively seeking advertising business here and it must be accepted that the current situation allows the real possibility of significant diversion with its related job effect.</P>
    <P>The majority of the concerns expressed to me are genuine and need immediate attention if the situation is not to get progressively worse and significant job losses throughout the economy are to be avoided.  However, I have to say that I have not seen any convincing evidence that would support the view of the national newspapers of Ireland that a significant part of frustrated television advertising revenue would divert from RTE to them if the 1990 Act is not amended.  Any benefit which might accrue to the newspapers would come at an unacceptably high cost to the other sectors which I have already mentioned and to the economy as a whole.  It is for these reasons that I am proposing the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, as an immediate measure.</P>
    <P>Turning to the independent television sector, this is a sector which has already proved itself to be capable of producing a range of high quality programmes.  The sector has a strong export orientation and I believe that, to realise its full potential, the sector must have a guaranteed domestic base through RTE services, as the national, and at present, only television broadcaster.  More and more reliance is being placed by broadcasters in other countries on the output of the independent production sector.  The sector in Ireland is capable of high profile morale boosting success and a mature sector has the capacity to sustain substantial growth in skilled jobs.  We are all aware of the phenomenal screen success in recent years of the Irish film makers and Members of the House will want to join me in congratulating them.  We must ensure that everything possible is done to nuture and release this great reservoir of talent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> In one sense creative talent is a national resource like mineral wealth, agriculture, or natural gas resources. Talent provides the opportunity for wealth creation and jobs if it is exploited properly and sensitively.  It is unique in that it cannot be measured in terms of population size, nor is its potential dependent on market share.  It does not depend on geography or geology nor on the size of a country.  We can truly say that we are as rich as any other country in this resource.  Accordingly, it is not simply sensible that we invest in our creative talent resource, it is imperative. Irish film makers have already demonstrated their abilities.  What makes their case so urgent in these times is the potential for the creation of highly skilled employment.  We must provide a strong domestic base to enable them to build on their international success.  It is no longer appropriate, given the importance of the sector, to leave its development entirely at the discretion of the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>As part of my longer-term proposals for the restructuring of Irish broadcasting I plan to create a regulatory environment which will further foster the development of the sector.  However, immediate statutory provisions aimed at ensuring its short term survival and development are necessary. To this end I am proposing a provision whereby RTE will be required to make available specific amounts of money each year for programmes commissioned from the independent sector.  I should emphasise, of course, that money available for commissioning programmes cannot be confined to the Irish independent production sector but I am confident that the Irish sector will be able to secure the maximum number of commissions consistent with the resources available to it.  I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the total daily times for advertising and the maximum times for advertising in any one hour on RTE services fixed by the RTE Authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.  This is, in effect, a restoration of the situation which obtained under the <Col N="379" /> Broadcasting Authority Acts before the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, with effect from 1 September 1992.  RTE would have reached the limit on revenues imposed by that section after this date.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that RTE must make specific amounts of money available in each financial year for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector. The amount to be set aside for this purpose will be £5 million in 1994, rising in stages to £10 million in 1998 and to 20 per cent of television programme expenditure in 1999 and thereafter or £12.5 million, whichever is the greater.  The amount of £12.5 million will be adjusted annually in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Under this section, the RTE authority will be required to keep a special account &mdash; termed the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; television programmes account&rdquo;&mdash; into which the moneys to be made available under this section for programmes to be commissioned from the independent sector are to be paid.  The funds in the account can only be used for this purpose.  In each financial year the amounts specified above must be paid into the account and all the funds in the account must be spent or contractually committed in that financial year, unless it is impracticable to do so.  The requirement to spend all the money in the independent programmes account is not, therefore, absolute.  I believe that RTE must remain in control of its own schedules and must be responsible for determining the quality of the programmes which it transmits.  An absolute requirement to spend a specific amount of money in each year or indeed a requirement to devote a particular quota of broadcasting hours to independently produced programmes could lead to a situation where money was being spent on independent commissions regardless of quality.  However, I should stress in the strongest terms possible, that I do not foresee any realistic prospect of any significant amount of money being <Col N="380" /> left unspent at the end of any year because of lack of capability in the independent production sector to meet RTE requirements.  I expect RTE to work closely with the sector so that independent film makers are commissioned to provide quality programmes across the whole range of RTE output.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of section 4 provides that if any of the moneys in the independent television programmes account remain to be expended after the end of the financial year in which they were paid in, the amount not spent must remain in the independent television programmes account in addition to the following year's allocation unless I, as Minister, authorise RTE to withdraw the unspent portion.  Under section 6 RTE will have to make a special report to me on the operation of the independent television programmes account each year, including its activities as respects the commissioning of programmes and any other matter which I may direct.  It is my intention that this report shall contain a complete list of the programmes and programme makers commissioned in each financial year.  The section also provides that the report shall be laid before both House of the Oireachtas.  This will ensure that the independent programmes account is operated in a completely transparent manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes to considerable lengths in section 5 to define &ldquo;independent television programme&rdquo;.  The essence of the definition is that an independent television programme is a programme made by a person who has control of the participants, the persons involved in making the programme, and the equipment and facilities used in making the programme, and is neither a subsidiary nor a holding company of a broadcaster.</P>
    <P>I regard the provisions in the Bill as interim measures designed to address specific issues that are immediate and to give prompt effect to the commitments on broadcasting in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I am aware of concerns expressed by some local radio operators to the effect that while the 1990 cap imposed on RTE had no identifiable <Col N="381" /> beneficial effect on their sector, to restore the pre-1990 situation without any further measures to assist the local radio sector will damage the growth of independent broadcasting.  Fears have also been expressed that the restoration of the pre-1990 situation would allow RTE to use unfairly its dominant broadcasting position to undermine local radio stations.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite clear about this.  I will not stand for any abuses by RTE of its position in Irish broadcasting.  The sources of funding available to RTE under the Broadcasting Authority Acts are intended to allow RTE as our national station to provide a range of broadcasting services that is responsive to the needs and desires of the nation. RTE was not established to set up markets, to target audience segments or to crush other broadcasters.  The Irish audience has shown time and time again that it wants intelligent high quality programmes and that it wants a choice of services.  Indeed, I was very heartened to hear from certain independent radio broadcasters that their listeners are demanding a significant output of news and current affairs programming of high quality and of interest and relevance to the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>After the enactment of this Bill the total daily times for broadcasting advertisements fixed by the Authority and the maximum periods so fixed to be given to advertisements in any hour shall be subject to the consent of the Minister.  I will have no hesitation in withholding my consent if I feel RTE is abusing its position in any way.  I wish to emphasise that I am personally committed to the undertaking in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the effect that measures will be taken to ensure the continued viability of local radio and I will be looking, in particular, at what I consider to be the crucial role of community radio which, perhaps, has not been adequately addressed until now. However, in general, I believe that there are few immediate measures that can be taken to meet the objectives of developing a strong independent radio sector. <Col N="382" /> Such measures that might appropriately be taken are of a more long term nature and should be dealt with in my proposals for the radical restructuring of the broadcasting sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has been the subject of particularly ill-informed comment in one newspaper yesterday. Deputies will appreciate if I am slow to praise the investigative qualities of the newspaper in question for having managed to get sight of a Bill which was presented to the Oireachtas and published over a week ago.</P>
    <P>In the article in question, it was suggested that while the Bill, if enacted, will lift the 1990 cap on RTE revenues, it will also give me as Minister a new sinister power to approve or disapprove RTE advertising rates.  This is not the case.  As I have explained, section 2 of the Bill simply restores the situation to that which obtained since 1976 right up to the enactment of the Broadcasting Act, 1990. Section 20 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by the 1976 Act, provided that the total daily times and the maximum time in any one hour for broadcast advertisements fixed by the RTE Authority shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.  I fail to see how the restoration of the situation which operated from 1976 up to 1990 can be seen as a new power with sinister undertones for the future of RTE.</P>
    <P>My record in the defence of RTE as our national broadcaster is clear.  I have always believed that RTE has done a magnificant job in providing a national broadcasting service both on radio and television that is public service oriented and which is relevant to and popular with Irish audiences.  I could list all RTE's major achievements down the years, but I do not think this is necessary as I am sure there is no argument in this House on the subject.  RTE has nurtured some of our very best broadcasters and film makers.  The credit for the revival of interest in our enviable traditional music culture, for example, can be fairly ascribed to a number of dedicated individuals in RTE.</P>
    <P>With regard to another comment in the <Col N="383" /> article to which I refer, Deputies who have given the Bill even the most cursory examination will be aware that there is no power to sequester funds from RTE contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning to the independent television production sector, the suggestion that my proposals requiring RTE to make specific amounts available for programmes commissioned by the independent sector is an attempt to privatise RTE programme production is patently ridiculous.  As I have said, the independent production sector has shown itself capable of producing a range of high quality programming. Irish programme makers in this sector must have a stable domestic outlet for their talents if the independent production sector is to realise its potential. RTE is, in any event, under EC law required, as with any other broadcaster in Europe, to devote a proportion of its output to independently produced programmes. RTE is already committed to increasing independent productions on its services.  My proposals simply formalise the position and set down a reasonable time table for reaching a reasonable output.  These proposals will create high quality sustainable jobs in this exciting sector.  It is not an attempt to privatise RTE in any way.  RTE remains in control of its schedule and is the arbiter of the quality of the programme proposals made to it.  Money is not being diverted from RTE; the money will have to be spent on making programmes in any case.</P>
    <P>I was also amazed at the suggestion that a carefully drafted provision in section 5 defining exactly what is meant by an independent television programme is seen as a sign of distrust of RTE.  What would the anonymous writer have preferred? I read, with sadness, that anonymous appellation, a special correspondent who must have been so afraid of what I was doing that she or he could not put their name to the article &mdash; what a sad development in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Would the anonymous writer have preferred a loosely worded provision? I repeat I do not distrust RTE.  I <Col N="384" /> simply want to make my intentions absolutely clear to this House in the first place. I make no apologies for carefully drafted or tightly worded legislative proposals.</P>

      <P>Consumers are always told that they should read the small print of any contract and on the packaging of any purchases.  This advice is given because even the most blatant operators tend to stick by the big print &mdash; the major claims and slogans by which they attract customers.  However, in this lightweight Bill we are looking at a reversal of that process.  Most of us remember the big print of the general election.  The big print claim of the Minister's party was change &mdash; change for the better &mdash; but it was change for its own sake.  This was the Minister's chance to demonstrate a commitment to change.  It was an opportunity to demonstrate that commitment on a personal and party level and on the part of the partnership Government. There are few areas where a commitment to radical change would be more welcome by the legislators than in the area of broadcasting where we have had a pattern of <i>ad hoc</i> interference which has set back the development of the mass media by perhaps a decade.  We were entitled to expect change in this area, particularly from the Minister, but the disappointment in this regard is great. This Bill does not provide change; it provides more of the same interference in RTE's affairs on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The former Minister, Deputy Burke, interfered with RTE and clamped an irrelevant and ineffective cap on its advertising.  It is interesting that Fine Gael's predictions in relation to that <Col N="385" /> measure have come true.  This Bill also interferes in RTE's affairs by proposing the removal of the cap on advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same but there are several questions still unanswered.  The Minister is way ahead of the former Minister because the cap on advertising was one of the silliest moves ever taken; it was a move but not a policy. We have not seen enough policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in his speech that we have not had a review of national broadcasting for some time and it is badly needed.  We have seen reactive moves, not quick reactive moves but very slow moves to deal with the range of problems. For example, pirate radio was well established before any decision was made to address the problem.  RTE's dominance of the market was well established before any action was taken in relation to the cap on advertising.  The Minister is removing that cap but does this Bill reflect a better understanding of broadcasting and the media generally than the legislation which introduced the Common Agricultural Policy?  I would say not.  This Bill is a holding mechanism, a knee jerk reaction.  Would the Minister not agree that this is a piecemeal legislation for dealing with urgent problems?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a piecemeal response to broad spectrum problems. The Minister mentioned consultation. We need much greater consultation in relation to the development of broadcasting. Is the Minister waiting for Peter Brook in the UK to introduce his legislation? I am sure the Minister is aware that there is full consultation in this regard in the UK involving a wide group of public and political organisations.  The Minister will claim that his planned review will involve much consultation but in the meantime what will be done?  The Minister is oiling the squeekiest wheels, <Col N="386" /> RTE and the independent producers, but he is postponing everything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister is behaving as if his current action has no effect on the wider issues.  He is behaving as if he can implement this Bill and the rest of the media in Ireland will sit in freeze frame until he has carried out his review.  That will not happen.  First, the Bill will have effects other than those planned.  I agree that the Minister is correcting some of the worse features of the recent Fianna Fáil Act, particularly by removing the cap on RTE advertising.  This is a sensible move but there is no evidence that the Government has given any thought to the hard pressed local and national newspaper industry or to the independent radio sector.</P>
      <P>RTE, which has a vision of its function has already indicated that, while grateful for the removal of the cap, it is wary of being precipitated, by this ostensibly sensible Bill, into a pattern of operation and a set of circumstances which may impinge on its funding, planning, programme and ability to deliver.  The independent producers have not protested, as that would be looking a gift horse in the mouth.</P>
      <P>This legislation on the fact of it has two beneficiaries, one of which is saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and the other saying &ldquo;thank you, but&rdquo;.  That is not a great pay-off for the Minister's first moves in this important sector of broadcasting.  The Minister has chosen to disregard the wider issues and to put to one side all the other interested groups.  He has chosen to postpone consideration of the impact on viewers, listeners and readers and he has unravelled something, as if that would bring us back to where we were some years ago.  The Minister might call this a specifically female insight, but when one unravels knitting, for instance, one does not end up with wool similar to the wool from which the garment was originally made.</P>

      <P>One ends up with <Col N="387" /> wool which is permanently distorted. This Bill will unravel an appalling aspect of our broadcasting history but it leaves the fabric distorted.  The Minister is also assuming new powers without addressing many broader connected questions, for instance the whole question of cable and satellite television, future financing, pan European broadcasting, the North/South dimension and the case for reforming the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
      <P>I am talking about reforming an agency which is only a few years old but the Independent Radio and Television Commission operations clearly need to be examined.  In the excitement of their national tour they publicly interviewed potential owners and managers for the local radio franchises, then there was the allocation, and after that silence and a reduction in importance.  This is not as it should be.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission should have been structured as a serious development agency.  The notion that broadcasting with its employment potential should be considered apart from the context of industrial policy generally is ludicrous. Clearly this is a very important area for job creation and development having regard to international developments in broadcasting.  It must be linked to our industrial policy.  The reform of the Independent Radio and Television Commission should be total.  That organisation should be free to become a fully fledged development agency.  Not only can it help to develop the commercial potential of the local stations, it can develop a series of satellite industries. It can deal in a real way with standards and training.  There is a substantial role to be fulfilled in the development of local and community broadcasting but it is not currently being fulfilled.  As currently constituted the Independent Radio and Television Commission cannot possibly deliver on the sort of development agency task I talk about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another urgent concern is that of many local radio stations about the question of national and international news.  While a <Col N="388" /> source of news is available and used by some stations it does not fill all needs and there is a strong case for examining the potential to develop a separate, fully staffed source of news and current affairs programming.  The Association of Independent Radio Stations, the organisation representing the interests of the local radio stations has raised this question of public service radio in a submission to the Government on this area.  The Bill fails to take this into consideration which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a local radio station to make money and carve out a niche with a maximum of music of a particular kind and minimum speech.  Many of the people running local radio stations have a broader and deeper interpretation of their role.  They see local radio as an essential tool of local democracy and believe that local radio stations should be truly local, that over-dependence on popular music takes away from what is local and pushes them in a direction in which ideally they would not wish to go. Many of them also believe they can provide a vital public service function &mdash; information, public debate and education specially related to their area &mdash; but they know that it costs money.  Even when they had such programming in their original plans they were hampered by constraints which they could not have foreseen.  Transmission costs have been grossly in excess of what they might have expected to pay and these have had a knock-on effect on the scope and excellence of programming.  Some stations have taken the obvious route and relied more on music than they would have liked if they had complete freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>The financial constraints will not go away.  We are not talking about something that just reduces the profits earned by entrepreneurs.  We are talking about a reduction in the funding available to the programme planners and, inevitably, that means a reduction in the public service element of what is broadcast.  Transmission and maintenance costs are too high.  The Minister has not made the smallest gesture of concern in regard to <Col N="389" /> these problems in the Bill, these constraints have huge implications for local broadcasting.</P>
    <P>AIRS indicated well in advance of the Minister's action that the RTE cap should only be lifted with the diversion of approximately 6 per cent of licence fees to the Independent Radio and Television Commission or another body.  This is one-sided action.  Local broadcasting has huge potential and huge gaps.  For example, drama is virtually non-existent in local broadcasting.  I am sure the Minister agrees that matters because drama is a constant vibrant aspect of provincial life.  Some drama groups have sustained amateur live theatre and given several generations the experience of seeing the works of the great writers of Ireland and other countries performed live on the stage.  Yet, local radio stations rarely, if ever, have anything to offer in the area of drama.  This is not because they are not interested but because drama production is so expensive.</P>
    <P>As an aspect of cultural life, local radio should be empowered to include drama in its programming.  Drama is just one of many areas of special interest to programming which are currently not in the lexicon of local radio, because of costs.</P>
    <P>In some ways, what we have here is &ldquo;Ray Burke, mark II&rdquo;.  It is a scary prospect, not so much because of what is in the Bill but because of what is not in it. The Bill does not address the role of public service broadcasting.  Its role is assumed.  It is often criticised and an ambivalent approach is often expressed but, in many ways, the issue is unaddressed in a changing context.  We need public service broadcasting.  We should consider what we expect from it, what it means now, what it should cost the nation and how far it should be built in as an integral factor in our consideration of all mass and local media.  We should consider to what extent the disbursement of the licence fee should influence public service broadcasting.  This Bill does not address public service broadcasting and its repositioning at this critical time in broadcasting.  The Minister in his speech acknowledged that the face of broadcasting <Col N="390" /> has changed dramatically over the last ten years and will continue to change in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address the question of overseas marketing of material commissioned from independent production houses.  Who will market these programmes? Who is in control?  Who will pay?  There is a general acknowledgment of the Minister's concerns and clearly he is seen as a man of culture, idealism and vision in this area but this Bill does not do justice to the sort of thinking I expected.</P>
    <P>There is no vision here, no over-arching view of public communication which is needed at present, which would fit our media to serve the needs of the next century.  There is, for example, no suggestion of an overall broadcasting authority.  RTE will continue as it is and the independent sector will continue as it is, even though the most cursory glance at both areas would indicate that the pattern of control, of influence, of standard-setting and of planning at what could be called the &ldquo;board level&rdquo; of independent broadcasting is hugely different from the pattern at the policy-making level of RTE.</P>
    <P>Many of the independent producers have told me that while they welcome what is, in effect, a directive to RTE to spend sums ranging to £10 million on independent production, they are concerned about its implementation.  Independent producers fear that where there is much money to spend but no particular specifications as to the way it is spent, it is possible that a number of distortions could happen.  We want a viable, professional and well resourced private sector in this area.  Much will depend on how the programmes are commissioned and the standards applied.  New productions must encompass a broad spectrum of programmes.  I am not saying RTE would disburse these moneys in a whimsical or irresponsible way but RTE is an organisation with a history of monopoly which has been set in competition with other media in recent years.  It is also an organisation with a strong internal skill base.</P>
    <P>Are independent producers made <Col N="391" /> more independent and more viable if RTE has to spend more money on them? There was a real opportunity here to radically restructure broadcasting in a way that would get the best from every area, so that RTE was freed to build on its marvellous track record and become a branded producer of world class and so that independent producers could develop projects which would be subjected to objective specifications and standards for purchase, influenced by the fact that the purchaser was also a competitor.</P>
    <P>RTE is an unequalled national asset, as the Minister stated, not just in the way it has delivered on its brief to inform, to educate and to entertain but in the way it has reinvented itself, constantly adapting to a changing Ireland and a changing pattern of technology.  As the Minister said, it has gone over and above what could be expected of it in many ways.  It has a commitment to young people in sharp contrast to emerging tendencies in other European countries.  RTE has given encouragement and has been the start of many careers in popular music. It has been a very powerful force in encouraging and supporting young composers and musicians.  RTE programmes have recognised the crafts of the people of Ireland.  RTE has nurtured and popularised cultural activities in a way that no other agency could and that few broadcasters do.</P>
    <P>It makes no sense whatever that this Bill makes no proposed changes in the managerial structures within RTE.  In marketing terms, the Minister is doing what is called line extension.  However, even with simple products, line extension is a dodgy proposition.  Just because a company makes a good photocopier does not mean that it will necessarily make a good computer, or succeed in selling it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, just because RTE has a splendid broadcasting track record does not mean that it is necessarily good at purchasing or commissioning independently produced programmes.  The programme making area of RTE is run by the same management group which <Col N="392" /> has the power to commission externally generated programmes.  That is a confused mission.  In fact, it may sometimes be an impossibly confused mission.  New structures are needed to deal with programme proposals that go to RTE.  There is no provision in this Bill to ensure that this happens.  That opportunity has been lost and ignored.  It is legitimate to ask why this has happened.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister came under considerable pressure, towards the end of her time in the Department, because she had not come up with comprehensive legislation to deal with the many issues affecting mass media.  She indicated she would not deal with this in a fits-and-starts way, that she would review the whole broadcasting scene and that there would be many change.  In fact, there has been no change.  In the meantime, we have seen changes in the title of Departments and civil servants have moved from Departments.</P>
    <P>In the world of broadcasting there has been remarkably little change.  The many papers prepared for that review by interested parties, at their own expense and in their own time, are still relevant. The Minister had all that data at his disposal. He could have spent the last month consulting with his partner Minister, who comes from the same county and shares his concerns about the Irish language and broadcasting.  He had access to all the data gathered previously, altered the information where necessary and brought it before the House.  Instead, he ditched that process and put action on the back burner for months, if not years. That is disgraceful.  He should have taken the time and introduced legislation which genuinely set a course for the future, as opposed to bringing forward a quick-fix Bill which ignores the many structural problems I have outlined and which are very serious for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This Government is meant to be an all-change Government.  Yet, if we look at the facts, rather than the slogans, we see in this Bill a recipe for continuation of a lethal pattern for broadcasting of ad hockery and quick fixes that never really fix anything.  This Bill leaves many questions <Col N="393" /> unanswered for RTE, for the independent producers around the commissioning of the programmes and it does not address the other sectors I mentioned.  There is no evidence of the partnership Government here.  There is no evidence that the previous Minister and the present Minister shared one idea, one objective, one insight.  We have all these new structures with programme managers and facilitators to make sure things happen speedily yet the evidence of this Bill is that when it comes to an aspect of Irish life which affects, directly or indirectly, every citizen of this State, the Government with all its programme managers can only come up with a corn-plaster of a Bill and a promise of postponement when apparently so much work had been done.  Why could it not have been presented to us in a more comprehensive way instead of in this piecemeal fashion?</P>
    <P>It is a sad performance from the Minister and is let down in this critical area. Fine Gael will not be supporting this Bill. The Minister has failed to address the many issues facing broadcasting which I have outlined and this Bill is not the way to proceed.  We need a broadcasting policy within which the industry can develop confidently.  The Minister's current approach carries the danger that it will not provide the sort of long term framework within which RTE, indepdenent broadcasters, film-makers, independent radio and others can plan for a solid future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register my disappointment at the Bill.  Admittedly, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, said it was an interim measure and presented it as such but that has only added to my disappointment. If ever a Dáil needed substantial legislation to get its teeth into it is this one.  Minister Higgins is known to be a creative, energetic and innovative thinker and politician.  My hope was that he would have presented a comprehensive wide-ranging Bill which is what everybody in the broadcasting media wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> I am disappointed with this Bill because it is too narrow, and limited in scope although many of its proposals are laudable.  I support measures to enable independent programme makers and people who have the talent and creativity so poetically described by the Minister to achieve the full potential in broadcasting terms.  However, such a measure should be brought forward in the context of a comprehensive broadcasting Bill effectively described by my colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>Instead there are two simple measures, one of which does not have any real concern about the impact it might have on the independent radio stations.  Even though I fully support the lifting of the cap on advertising, I would like to have seen it discussed in the broader context of how it will impact on local radio stations. The second measure is to require RTE to make a definite payment on a staged basis over a number of years.  That is put in place with no real thought as to the capacity of RTE to sustain that degree of loss of revenue or the capacity of independent programme makers to deliver. These are two major deficiencies in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of broadcasting and national broadcasting policy is extremely complex. There are many interpretations of the whole question.  These include, for instance, the role and broadcasting position of RTE which is a wholly Stateowned company.  Until recently it enjoyed a monopoly in radio broadcasting and still enjoys a monopoly in the provision of national television service. There is the impact of television stations located outside our jurisdiction, notably in Britain.  There is the role too of the independent film making sector, the independent local radio stations, and the newspaper industry and how it interrelates with and is impacted upon by RTE with its dominant share of the national advertising cake.  These are just some of the key issues in the national broadcasting field.</P>
    <P>In addition there is the philosophical question of the nature of broadcasting policy and what its priorities should be at <Col N="395" /> this juncture as we move towards the turn of the century and beyond.  We should also consider the role of the State in dictating broadcasting policy and the extend to which the greater degree of competition and diversity of opinion and thought is facilitated by a vibrant and professional broadcasting network.</P>
    <P>I cite some of these considerations simply to convey the complexity of the issues that arise when broadcasting policy is debated.  Moreover, I do so to underline how very disappointing this first legislative proposal is from a new Minister in charge of broadcasting.  Given the amount of debate generated here since the Broadcasting Act, 1990, I am disappointed that the Minister, as his first legislative initiative in this area, brought forward such a selective and limited set of proposals.</P>
    <P>I want to outline the policy approach of the Progressive Democrats to national broadcasting and relate that to the proposals before the House this evening.  I want to explain the degree to which we find the intentions of the Government reasonable, but also how they represent a lamentably inadequate initiative to deal with fundamental questions in this area.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats favour competition in all strands of the media. The need for this is self-evident.  Nobody would suggest that our interests would be served if people's choice was confined to just one national daily newspaper.  We should keep the experience in relation to newspapers in mind when discussing broadcasting.  Until recently there was a State monopoly in radio and television through the medium of RTE.  The advent of competition from local radio stations throughout the country has been of enormous benefit.  It has given people in local communities a greater range of programming and enabled a range of local community issues to be ventilated and debated, something that would have been impossible with a single national broadcasting station like RTE.</P>
    <P>Competition in radio has also been good for broadcasters.  It has allowed a host of excellent broadcasters, who were <Col N="396" /> formerly solely reliant on RTE, to explore their talents and gain fulfilment with these local stations.  It has provided employment opportunities for many more broadcasters and journalists than would have been possible if there had been only one national station.  The outcome is generally healthier and is preferred by the vast majority of people in this State.  There is no doubt but that local communities have been enlivened and enriched.  However, there is scope for further growth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke of the potential for the growth of drama on local radio stations.  That is just one area where there is scope for further development.  What impact will the lifting of the cap on advertising have on the potential for growth and development?  I hope the Minister will answer that question because that cannot be ignored.  We should encourage the growth of local stations and if it can be demonstrated that the lifting of the cap on advertising would have no adverse effects on such stations then the Minister has done a great day's work.  I loathed the concept of a cap on advertising from the outset, but I have no doubt the Minister will demonstrate that the lifting of it will have no adverse effects on local stations when replying on Thursday next.</P>
    <P>An attempt to create an alternative independent radio station has foundered but it is important to remember that the Radio and Television Act, 1988, together with the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, created a structure for the emergence of both independent television and radio and for the Independent Radio and Television Commission as the overall industry regulator. That mechanism still exists.  The demise of Century Radio, the alternative radio station, was due to many factors, but undoubtedly the main factor was the dominant position of RTE radio in the marketplace.  To state this is not to criticise RTE but, in the case of its radio services especially, it is a compliment to the fact that it had developed personalities and programmes which were so popular with the general public that Century Radio simply was incapable of wresting a <Col N="397" /> significant and viable proportion of their audience from them.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, therefore, history will probably record that the Century Radio experiment was relatively stillborn and could never get off the ground.  In every respect, compared to the expertise, track record and popular appeal of RTE radio, it was a mere minnow which RTE was soon able to gobble up.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the attempts by a previous Minister for Communications in 1990 to seek to address some of these questions, and indeed the very important and allied question of the competition between RTE and the newspaper industry for advertising revenue. At the core of his approach was the infamous cap on RTE's advertising revenue and the associated proposal to deflect some of RTE's licence fee revenue to the alternative national broadcasting stations on radio and television.</P>
    <P>Every party in this House came to the conclusion a long time ago that that particular experiment was both ill-judged and a failure.  Indeed, that Minister's successor in Government had prepared alternative proposals to amend the 1990 legislation which were not brought forward.</P>
    <P>At the core of any debate touching on national broadcasting policy, therefore, for good or ill, is the dominant position that RTE commands in relation to broadcasting both on radio and television and the associated matter of its dominant position in the advertising market place. Stating this is not for one moment to adopt an anti-RTE position.  Indeed, this country has been well served by RTE down the years.  Its overall track record has been outstanding, and through both its radio and television service, it has maintained a high standard of all that is best under any definition of public service broadcasting.  Its range of current affairs programmes, on radio in particular, is outstanding and the station's capacity to do programmes of special interest, including the interests of various minorities, is exemplary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when I advance the Progressive Democrats desire for choice, <Col N="398" /> competition and variety in broadcasting at national level for both radio and television, I do so in the context of the age in which we live where the consumer has come to demand &mdash; and expect &mdash; choice and variety, particularly in the matter of opinion-forming and entertainment. Furthermore, as a modern, sophisticated and democratic State, we should respond to that desire on the part of our people.</P>
    <P>To refer again to the matter of newspapers. I do not believe anybody would seriously suggest that the Irish people would be best served if we only had one national daily newspaper, however outstanding it was.  People want a diversity of opinion, outlook and approach which simply could not be encompassed within a single publication.  The argument is even more sustainable where radio and television are concerned because these media are more powerful and more immediate in their impact.  We have, as I have noted, a degree of competition in radio, though I would prefer to see a viable national independent radio service also available to the Irish people that would compete directly with RTE.</P>
    <P>In the matter of television programming, this country would be much better served if we had a independent television channel competing with RTE in the provision of programmes, particularly in the fields of news and current affairs.</P>
    <P>I know that RTE makes the point repeatedly that it is in a very competitive environment in so far as the beaming-in of British stations is concerned.  That matter raise serious issues concerning the financial viability of RTE, but it does not address the more fundamental matter of the provision of a rich and varied choice of news and current affairs programmes of particular Irish interest.</P>
    <P>Let me put it another way.  In the newspaper sector, reliance on a single national newspaper here would not be adequately explained away by pointing out that people could buy English newspapers if they wanted an alternative viewpoint. The reality is that in areas like news and current affairs, British television stations <Col N="399" /> do not, generally speaking, interest themselves with Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>That is the core argument of the Progressive Democrats.  We want to see the provision on a competitive basis of alternative broadcasting services here and particularly in the field of television.  This is especially pertinent when we talk about current affairs programming because, unlike many other areas of activity by RTE, that station's present record in current affairs programming is not as satisfactory as it was in recent years and this needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am well aware too that this is a view shared by many concerned programme-makers within the station.  Only a few years ago we had a serious vibrant current affairs programme, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, which broadcasted three nights a week. More recently this was replaced by a mish-mash of three programmes, whose timetable has not yet been fully communicated to the people.</P>
    <P>More recently, one of these programmes has gone off the air.  Has anybody noticed?  It is fairly common ground now between anybody interested in current affairs and politics here &mdash; be they political practitioners, journalists, broadcasters or concerned citizens &mdash; that the range, quality and depth of current affairs broadcasting on Irish television is not as good as it was or ought to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not disagree with the Deputy on that.  The point I have made illustrates the need for an overall comprehensive debate on all aspects of broadcasting here and points to the necessity for competition.  If there was strong vibrant competition to RTE there would not have been the lapse we have seen in recent times.  If we had a vibrant alternative channel which presented lively current affairs programmes on three or four evenings a week, RTE would sit up and take notice and compete vigorously.  We would all benefit from such competition.  This is a concrete <Col N="400" /> example of the point I am making in support of my party's belief that competition in broadcasting is essential if broadcasters are to attain their full potential and audiences are to get the kind of television they seek and deserve.  Moreover, greater competition would provide more employment opportunities for professionals and ensure that politicians and interested members of the public are given a better service and a greater variety of opinion forming debate.</P>
      <P>Another practical example of the deficiencies in RTE's coverage of news and current affairs, peculiar to election time, is the effective stop-watching of reportage of the various political parties which takes no real account of news value.  Smaller parties in particular have suffered from this practice as they tend to be at the end of the queue.  Clearly the only reason such a situation pertains is because RTE has a monopoly.  For example, during the general election campaign last November RTE predetermined the days in which it would record television and general news coverage on radio of the election campaigns of the various political parties.  The Progressive Democrats Party might as well not have launched its significant, thought-out policy documents on key matters of public concern, such as unemployment and crime, if they were not launched on the day predetermined by RTE to give them coverage.  If, for example, my party only got coverage on the fourth, ninth and thirteenth days of the election campaign, it might as well have been silent all the other days.  This is not good enough from the point of view of the listeners or democracy.  This could not happen if RTE did not have a monopoly. I should like to see this practice discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the specific proposals in the Bill.  Ironically, the Bill stems directly from the monopoly enjoyed by RTE.  It is a recognition of one of the unsatisfactory consequences of this monopoly, namely, the existence of an independent non-RTE film programme making sector which, in the present circumstances, is almost utterly <Col N="401" /> reliant on RTE for its survival and livelihood. Many independent film makers formerly worked on RTE but left for a variety of reasons.  It is fair to point out that it has been RTE's consistent policy to commission programmes from the independent film making sector. However, its capacity to do this was severely constrained by the imposition of the advertising cap in 1990.  I understand that RTE had planned to increase its intake from the independent sector at the rate of 10 per cent per annum before the 1990 Act was brought forward.  My party does not have any objection to the principle of making fair provision for independent programme makers.  Incidentally, it is a principle we totally support and would like to see promoted much more strongly.</P>
    <P>Our disagreement with the Bill is fundamental. It is too narrow in its focus, this issue should be addressed in the context of an overall Bill which would put forward reform measures and put in place a broadcasting policy which would take us to the turn of the century and beyond. All these issues are inter-related and there is a risk involved in isolating them. This Bill addresses a very small segment of the problem and the Minister should go back to the drawing board and formulate a much more comprehensive Bill which will make us look again at the problem and the potential of public service broadcasting.  When the Minister was out of the House I said he had the creativity and capacity to do this, and I ask him to do so now.</P>
    <P>Finally, will the Minister urgently examine the predicament of Cork local radio, 89FM?  This radio station has been forced to operate under the most stringent and stifling restrictions since its inception.  For example, it is prevented from broadcasting at weekends.  As a result, coverage of sporting events, etc., is excluded from its agenda.  The implications of this in terms of programming and revenue from advertising are self-evident. This is a good radio station which has a creative and responsible approach to the coverage of current affairs at both national and community level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> The Progressive Democrats Party cannot support the Bill for the reasons I outlined.  The changes proposed in the Bill should be included in a much wider broadcasting Bill, which I ask the Minister to formulate and introduce in this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill. This debate marks the end of one of the most shameful episodes in our broadcasting history.  The Broadcasting Act, 1990, was conceived in malice, motivated by political cronyism and rammed through the Dáil in June 1990 with a degree of political ruthlessness which was virtually unprecedented.  This Bill will largely undo the damage caused by that Act.</P>
      <P>The publication of this Bill represents an astonishing U-turn by Fianna Fáil.  It must be particularly humiliating for the former Minister for Communications, Deputy Ray Burke, a principal author of the 1990 Act who put so much effort into steamrolling the legislation through this House.  If the Bill is a humiliation for the then Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, it must be very satisfying for the current Minister to bring it forward in view of the shameful way he was treated in this House by Fianna Fáil during the debate on it.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Act had nothing to do with providing a better broadcasting service for the public.  That Act had two aims. First, it was designed to penalise RTE for &mdash; what many Fianna Fáil Ministers believed &mdash; its too critical approach by news and current affairs programmes to the then Government.  Second, it was also an attempt by Fianna Fáil to rescue a handful of mainly rich investors in private radio stations, some of whom had close connections with Fianna Fáil, from the results of their own commercial mismanagement and misjudgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original proposals announced by the then Minister, Deputy Burke, in the Dáil debate during Private Members' Time on 29 May 1990 would have been particularly disastrous and could, if implemented, have spelled the end of <Col N="403" /> public service broadcasting.  He proposed to divert £3 million in licence revenue to private stations, to cap RTE's advertising revenue and to effectively end 2FM's role as a popular music station.  He had clearly underestimated the reaction of RTE employees, the trade union movement and the listening and viewing public to his proposals.  Such was the strength of the reaction, the Minister was forced to back down on the proposals to divert licence revenue and radically alter the format of 2FM.  Indeed, when the legislation finally made its way through the Dáil in relation to RTE, it had been pared back to the single but key element of a severe cap on RTE's advertising revenue, a unique formula which displayed a very odd attitude to a public sector company. At a time when all such companies were being urged to improve their efficiency RTE was to be penalised for being successful; the more successful it was the more revenue it earned and the more it was to be penalised.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of import-and developments since the passage of the 1990 Act.  In the first place, the then Government clearly underestimated RTE's resilience, resulting in a considerable growth in both their licensing and advertising revenues.  Advertising was not generally diverted from RTE to the private sector.  In addition, the main outcome of the cap was to divert approximately £17.5 million which would otherwise have been available for programme-making into the Exchequer's coffers. Also, many people involved in the private stations have discovered that running a successful radio station requires a lot more skill and management expertise than simply organising a pop concert or managing a showband.</P>
    <P>The cap on RTE's advertising revenue did nothing to save Century Radio which went to the wall.  I regret that, although I predicted, in the course of the debate on the 1990 Bill, that there was unlikely to be space for a third national telestation or indeed a third national television station.  Unlike a number of local stations, Century Radio made a genuine <Col N="404" /> effort to provide something more than a diet of non-stop pop and patter.  In particular, Century Radio provided a first-class news service which compared admirably with that provided by RTE. However, it is significant that, since Century Radio went to the wall in November 1991, the Independent Radio and Television Commission has been unable to find any contractor to run a national commercial radio service.  In addition, the proposed independent television channel, TV3, which the 1990 Act was designed specificaly to facilitate, seems unlikely to feature on our screens.</P>
    <P>Given these developments it seems likely that, for the foreseeable future, RTE only will provide national television and radio broadcasting, with the 21 commercial stations continuing to cater for local needs.  It is not a satisfactory position; there are gaps in the service.  There is a demand for genuine community radio as distinct from plain commercial, local radio.  It is wrong for Members of this House to confuse the two services.  By and large local commercial radio is not community radio, its objectives are different in many respects.  There are plenty of groups nationwide prepared to provide a local radio service comprising something more than continuous music with the odd item of local news thrown in but they have not been given an opportunity to get off the ground, with the odd exception, such as Anna Livia Radio in Dublin.  A limited range of music is played on RTE and the commercial stations.  For instance, those people who prefer to listen to classical music are not very well catered for by FM 3 which broadcasts within very limited hours in the early morning and evening.</P>
    <P>Of course, RTE is a popular target of critics and, in some cases, criticism is merited.  For example, recently a pre-recorded interview with the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, was broadcast on the Sunday news programme, when she effectively accused me of being a liar in this House when I claimed that the McCreevy dirty dozen social welfare cuts had not been reversed.  RTE did not <Col N="405" /> bother to contact me between the time the programme was recorded and broadcast to ascertain whether I had anything to say, or any refutation of a fairly serious allegation.  If I had not heard the programme in question and telephoned RTE nothing would have been done about it. In fact, even then, they said it was too late for them to do anything on that programme but, that if I telephoned a statement through to them, they would carry it on subsequent news programmes, which they did for the remainder of that day.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that, in many respect, news programmes often contain allegations which RTE journalists should make some effort to substantiate before being broadcast.  I have been the victim of similar allegations on live programmes which are not easily controlled by the programme managers and broadcasters. I do not propose to go into details because I know it might upset some people.  In any event, the point I am making is that RTE is not above criticism. Certainly I should like to see some more effective method of ensuring that news programmes are lively and controversial and challenge views, but some effort should be made to ensure that the main objective is fairness.  That being said, in some cases, such criticism is merited but any fair and impartial assessment of RTE's performance generally would conclude that it has done reasonably well.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the then Government sent in international consultants, Peat, Marwick and Mitchell, probably the most eminent consultants to the broadcasting industry to sort out RTE.  Those consultants gave RTE a clean bill of health on all the major aspects of business efficiency.  Since then RTE has had to face competition in the radio sector, originally from Century Radio and currently from many local commercial radio stations.  In the television sector RTE has faced intense competition as the four British channels became more widely available; extra channels were provided by Cablelink and more and more satellite dishes sprouted from the sides of houses.  It appears that arguments that RTE does not face competition are spurious and do not accept <Col N="406" /> the reality of the environment within which RTE exists and operates.  That was true in 1990 when the cap was introduced on its advertising revenue and is probably true today, given the current development of cable and satellite channels.</P>
    <P>Despite increased competition and Government attempts to obstruct it over the past five years RTE has witnessed a 20 per cent increase in licence revenue and a 36 per cent increase in advertising revenue in real terms, achieved without any increase in the licence fee since 1986. There are those who argue that RTE should not need a licence fee.  For example, they point to the United Kingdom as an example, where the BBC has a licence fee revenue only and ITV advertising revenue only.  The important distinction to be drawn between the United Kingdom and here is the size of our respective populations, there are approximately 20 million licence payers in Britain compared with approximately one million here.  To put the matter in perspective, the BBC spends in excess of £100 million on its news service alone whereas, for not much more, RTE provides not just news but two complete television channels and several national radio services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the funding of broadcasting in Europe the United Kingdom is the exception while RTE is the norm.  Nearly all small and medium-sized countries finance their national broadcasting by a combination of licence fees and advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December, 1948 states that &ldquo;everyone has a right to seek <Col N="407" /> and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution&rdquo;.  This State is a party to that Convention.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees completed in Geneva on 25 July 1951 and the Protocol to that Convention completed in New York on 31 January 1967 detail the specific procedures to be applied by the signatories to that Convention to applications for political to applicants. protections to be afforded to applocants. This State became a signatory to the Geneva Convention on 29 November 1956 and to the Protocol on 6 November 1968.</P>
    <P>Despite our international obligations and our accession to the Protocol and Convention we have at no stage enacted legislation to reflect their provisions in our domestic statute law.  The basic legislation that applies to non-national seeking to enter this State, who are not citizens of any other European Community member state, is contained in the Aliens Act, 1935 and in a labyrinthine series of statutory instruments made under that Act since it came into force. A substantial number of these have over the years been repealed or rendered irrelevant. From my own research, however, there appear to be in the region of 20 statutory instruments still in force addressing a variety of issues that fall under the regime of the 1935 Act.  The 1935 Act pre-dated both the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>During the past decade substantial concern has been expressed about the manner in which we in this State treat the small number of persons who arrive at points of entry to the State and claim political asylum.  In Shannon Airport, in particular, prior to the major political changes which have seen a series of independent states emerging from the ashes of the former Soviet Union, there were numerous reports of passengers on Aeroflot planes seeking asylum and finding themselves bundled back on board planes without any opportunity fully and properly to present their case to be allowed <Col N="408" /> to remain in Ireland.  It seemed at the time that this State was more concerned with ensuring use by Aeroflot of Shannon Airport and the economic benefits derived from that than with protecting the individual human rights of the small number of individuals who sought to stay here to escape from a politically oppressive regime.</P>
    <P>Agitation in the early eighties for greater protection for asylum seekers resulted in the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government having discussions with the representative of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees then based in London and by a letter of 15 December 1985 agreeing by way of administrative procedure to incorporate within our practices procedures for the determination of refugee status and asylum applications in Ireland which were designed to reflect our international obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The United Nations High Commission was anxious at the time to see legislation enacted in Ireland but the view of the then Government was that the very limited number of asylum applications received in this country did not warrant legislative action incorporating the relevant procedures, as the commissioner had proposed in a letter on 24 April 1985. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the then Government were a major advance on the position up to then.  It confirmed in writing certain basic guidelines that it was intended would be followed which sought to ensure that most of our obligations under the Convention were complied with.</P>
    <P>It is now over seven years since these procedures were agreed with the United Nations Irish Commission on Refugees. It is the unanimous view of those who have worked to assist persons who have sought refugee status and political asylum in this country that the current situation is unsatisfactory and that there is a need for legislation which would fully implement in domestic law our international obligations under the Geneva Convention and which would not only incorporate the procedures agreed by the <Col N="409" /> Government in December 1985 but which would also fill a number of the gaps left by these procedures.  A number of examples could be given of how, in practice, we have failed to comply with our international legal obligations and of the need for more stringent statutory provisions to protect the civil and human rights of those who seek asylum here.</P>
    <P>In October 1990 a young Chinese student who had joined the huge demonstration for democracy in China arrived in Ireland having escaped arrest, having been accused of treason and having been tortured.  Instead of being treated humanely when he arrived in this State seeking political asylum, he was immediately detained and spent seven months in Mountjoy Prison.  He was finally released from prison on 20 May 1991 by order of the High Court.  Subsequent to his release the Minister for Justice determined that he did not qualify for recognition as a refugee and we have been given no public explanation about this decision.  Only yesterday, 3 May 1993, he was forced to bring an application before the High Court challenging the decision made by the Minister.  That case is now before the House Court for determination.</P>
    <P>In November 1990, on a Friday, four Sri Lankans arrived and sought political asylum.  By the following Tuesday they had been deported.  On the same day two more Sri Lankans arrived only to be deported two days later, despite the civil difficulties and the political unrest in their country.  Within one week the Department of Justice had returned them to India without taking any action to ensure that they would not be sent to Sri Lanka from India or to ensure their continued safety would be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Last summer, at a time when we agreed to admit to this country a number of Bosnian refugees &mdash; a relatively small number compared to the number admitted in other European Community member states &mdash; a lone refugee from Yugoslavia who was not part of the main group arrived unannounced and sought political asylum.  Before any reasonable consideration had been given to his application <Col N="410" /> he was bundled back on a plane and flown to Paris.  Subsequently, the Government had to agree to his return to Ireland and to his being given permission to remain here when the full details of his story became known.</P>
    <P>Last November there were extraordinary scenes in Shannon Airport when a large number of Kurdish refugees were physically forced back on a plane flying to Canada.  Access to them by individuals concerned about their plight who wished to ensure they had access to legal help was denied by officials at Shannon Airport and they were forced out of the country before their position could be independently clarified.  I can tell the House that on the evening in question I made a number of telephone calls to Shannon Airport to try to ascertain the position and I was finally allowed to talk to someone in authority after the plane had taken off from the airport.</P>
    <P>The unsatisfactory manner in which we have dealt with applications for political asylum during the past five years has given rise to a series of court cases which would not have arisen if the individuals concerned had felt that they had been given a proper opportunity clearly and fairly to state their case and to have their applications determined.  Although the courts have stated in recent cases that the procedures the State agreed to with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in 1985 will be regarded as enforceable against the State, it is clear that some of those who come here seeking political asylum are not informed of the procedures and they are not applied in their cases.  Indeed, few have any real opportunity to seek to vindicate their rights before the courts when those rights are not respected.  Those who seek asylum should not be required to go to court to avail of the protections which this State is already obliged to extend to them under international law.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that in a number of respects present procedures even when properly applied are inadequate.  For example, decisions are made in secret and no written details are published about the manner in which the Convention <Col N="411" /> principles are applied in individual cases.  There is no reason such information could not be made available while preserving the anonymity of the individual where necessary either for his protection or the protection of members of his family if they remain living within the country from which that person has sought to flee.</P>
    <P>No details are published of the country of origin of persons who are either granted asylum or who have had their applications for asylum turned down and there is no independent right of appeal. These and a number of other defects are addressed in the Bill I have brought before the House.</P>
    <P>It is true to say also there is obsessive secrecy within the Department of Justice which applies to all its dealings in this area.  Political responsibility for the manner in which the Department of Justice deals with applications rests with the Minister of the day.  It is not the officials who are to blame for the inadequacies of the procedures but the Minister, who has political responsibility for ensuring that matters are properly dealt with.  An example of the obsessive secrecy that applies and the belief that no information should be made available to the public is again reflected in a parliamentary question which I put to the Minister today and to which I received a written reply. This simple straightforward question did not in any particular respect endanger our national security.  This is how I put my question:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice the current status of the families residing in this State who came from Bosnia in 1992; whether any of them have applied for refugee status and political asylum; and whether, if such applications are made, political asylum will be granted.</P>
    <P>I understand there are in the region of 170 people approximately who are members of families that came from Bosnia.  I do not think my question puts their lives at risk.  It is not such a matter of great secrecy that a Member of this <Col N="412" /> House should not be told that none of them has sought asylum, all have sought asylum, or should they seek asylum they will be granted it.  What reply did I get from the Department?  The reply states:</P>
    <P>Persons from the former Yugoslavia admitted to the State in accordance with the Government decision of last year were granted temporary protection status with the full righs of refugees.</P>
    <P>Temporary protection status is not a concept I fully understand but it is a concept manufactured to provide for the situation. If it protects the rights of those who come from Bosnia and gives them protection, I have no quibble with it but I do not know from the reply whether any of those persons want to remain here permanently as opposed to temporarily. The reply further states:</P>
    <P>Every application for refugee status or political asylum is considered on an individual basis in accordance with the procedures in this area agreed in 1985 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  It is not the practice in accordance with the spirit of those agreed procedures to disclose publicly whether or not identifiable persons have applied for political asylum.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the United Nations High Commission procedures, as agreed, that runs counter to providing basic information in the context of a known group of people who have been given temporary sanctuary in Ireland as to whether some of them have sought political asylum. Presumably, the political situation they came from is well known to all of us.  I think we are entitled to a more detailed reply; we are entitled to know if any of those families have sought to reside here permanently and sought political asylum. On the basis they are coming from the same political background, of ethnic and violent friction which puts their lives sufficiently at risk to bring them to Ireland one does not need a great deal of imagination to draw a conclusion that all those people properly fall within the status of <Col N="413" /> political refugees who are entitled to political asylum if they seek it.  It should not be a matter of secrecy.</P>
    <P>The number of people who seek asylum in this State annually is not large compared to the numbers who seek asylum in most other member states.  In fact, it is extremely small.  In 1988 there were 49 applicants; in 1989 36; in 1990 62; in 1991 31 and in 1992 38.  In 1988 two applications for political asylum were granted and in the years 1989-92 one application was granted.  A small number of applicants, as far as I am aware, although not granted political asylum have been allowed to remain in the State but the majority of those who sought political asylum were, I understand, required to leave.  We do not know the criteria applied in determining whether any of their cases were valid.  We do not know from which country most of these people come or why it was determined that they did not quality for political asylum.</P>
    <P>On 23 March 1993 there were 53 applicants awaiting decision and this number included 20 applications received in 1993. One could speculate that those 20 may include some of the Bosnian refugees who came here to escape from the conflict in their country, but I do not know.  It should not be a secret if it does include those families.  Although the number who seek political asylum in Ireland is small, we have under the Geneva Convention an international obligation to respect the human dignity of each such applicant and to ensure that not only is each applicant's legal rights protected but they are each treated in a humanitarian way and with respect.  At present the fate of the asylum seeker is very much in the hands of the individual official with whom he or she first comes in contact at the point of entry and the manner in which each applicant is treated is not open to public scrutiny. There is a growing and widespread concern that many of those who seek political asylum in this State are not properly treated, their rights are not respected, and the spirit of the Geneva Convention is not applied.</P>
    <P>In Amnesty International's report of 7 <Col N="414" /> November 1991 entitled &ldquo;Europe: Human Rights and the Need for a Fair Asylum Policy&rdquo;, in reviewing the practices and procedures and the laws enforced in a variety of EC member states it states in regard to Ireland:</P>
    <P>Amnesty International believes that the asylum proceedings in Ireland are entirely inadequate to identify all those in need of protection.  The fact that in practice few asylum seekers actually seek protection in Ireland, compared with the numbers seeking asylum in other EC member States, does not diminish the need for deficiencies in the asylum procedures to be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>Amnesty, the Irish Refugee Council, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, have all clearly stated the need to ensure that all necessary protections are afforded to those who claim political asylum in this State.  Last summer, Amnesty and Young Fine Gael joined together in a campaign to reform our laws and procedures and Fine Gael in its election programme for Government committed my party to introducing the legislation that is now before this House. The public's unease at the manner in which we deal with asylum applications is also reflected in the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for Government, 1993-1997, which states:</P>
    <P>Our policy towards treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the Courts.</P>
    <P>During Question Time on 17 February 1993, I sought to explore what was intended by this passage in the programme. I was concerned that it was simply a cosmetic gesture in the direction of those concerned about this area and that there was no substantive new measures intended by the present Coalition Government.  Moreover, it was clear that this provision in the programme was couched in terms which ensured that matters <Col N="415" /> relating to asylum would continue to be dealt with by ministerial diktat emerging from the Department of Justice and that there was no commitment of any nature to the introduction of the reforming legislation that is so badly needed. The Minister's reply illustrated clearly that the Government parties had no real substantive proposals that they intended taking arising out of what is stated in the programme and no real thought had been given by them to the measures it might take.  In response to my question asking the Minister &ldquo;the new procedures, if any, she proposes introducing to guarantee rights of hearing, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts for refugees and asylum seekers&rdquo;, she simply responded by stating that she would be taking whatever action may be appropriate in order to meet these commitments. The rest of the reply confined itself to detailing the 1985 arrangements previously mentioned.  I regret that it is the junior Minister in the Department of Justice who has been sent into the House again this evening.  The Minister is absent again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again absent for an important debate on legislation. The form in this Government seems to be that the senior Minister stands in front of the camera for photo opportunities and appears on RTE news bulletins when she feels there is a need for personal publicity.  The junior Minister is sent into the House to do the legislative work and on occasions to do the dirty work on the Minister's behalf which she feels may not go down well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>She never responds to a debate or allows herself to be interrupted in this House.  This is a shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is not here to reply to this debate is indicative of the seriousness with which she <Col N="416" /> treats the commitment given in the Programme for Government.  Her absence is regrettable.  Subsequent to the Minister's reply, Fine Gael published this Bill on 18 March last.  It is the result of substantial work undertaken in Fine Gael and of extensive consultation with many of those who work in this area.</P>
      <P>We deliberately delayed processing the Bill through the House for a period of almost two months following its publication so as to afford time to Government to consider its detailed provisions in the hope that Second Stage could be agreed without contention.  I am pleased to note, despite the fact that there is no member of the Labour Party present for the debate, that in the intervening period at the Labour Party Conference a motion was unanimously passed in the name of the Rathfarnham Dublin-South branch of the Labour Party &mdash; Rathfarnham is part of the constituency which I represent &mdash; stating:</P>
      <P>Conference calls on the Government to protect refugees in Ireland by legislating to incorporate into Irish law the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1968 Protocol, including specifically such safeguards as access to legal advice, access to interpretation, the right to substantive appeal and the establishment of an independent and expert body to consider each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides the legislative vehicle whereby the Labour Party in Government can implement the wishes of conference as expressed four weeks ago.  I hope I am wrong in my suspicions that the absence of the Minister for Justice and the fact that there is not a single Labour Deputy present for this debate bodes ill.  I suspect their absence indicates that the Government will be stating to the House that it opposes this measure. I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Justice will prove me wrong in that regard.  If such an attitude is taken it is clear that the Government parties will be effectively betraying the commitment given in the Programme for Government and the Labour Party will <Col N="417" /> be showing the political two fingers to the motion passed at conference.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill a refugee is defined as &ldquo;a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion (i) is outside of the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it, or (ii) not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to that country&rdquo;.  This definition derives directly from the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will ensure that every person who seeks recognition as a refugee and who seeks asylum will, first, have the right to access to legal advice and representation and access to an interpreter, and will be informed of such rights; second, it ensures that a person who seeks asylum will be notified of all information obtained by the Minister for Justice with regard to an application made and will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond to such information; third, it ensures that a person who seeks asylum will be interviewed by an official who is familiar with the provisions of the United Nations Convention and the State's obligations under that convention; fourth, it guarantees that a person who seeks asylum will be entitled to communicate independently with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and will be advised in writing of the decision reached and the reasons for the decision, and finally it provides for a right of appeal to a newly established refugee appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>In determination of applications for refugee status and asylum the Minister for Justice, under the legislation, will have the following obligations.  No asylum seeker can be removed from the State without being given an opportunity to properly present his case.  Every application received will have to be examined in accordance with the State's obligations under the United Nations Convention and the Minister will be required to seek the views of the United Nations High <Col N="418" /> Commission on Refugees and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of all applications received.  In determining applications received the Minister will have to take into account not only the views expressed by the applicant and the communications received from the United Nations High Commission and the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also views expressed by other bodies and organisations including Amnesty International and the Irish Refugee Council, to whom I pay tribute for their outstanding voluntary work in this area. Where the United Nations Convention does not apply, under the legislation it will be open to the Minister on humanitarian grounds to grant refugee status and asylum to an applicant.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill an applicant who is dissatisfied with a decision reached will, within a period of 21 days from receipt of notification of such decision, be entitled to appeal to the refugee tribunal. This independent tribunal will fully hear the case made by the applicant and the decision will be final subject to an appeal to the High Court on a question of law. Appeal hearings before the tribunal will be in public unless an applicant requests that they be held in private, in which case such request will be granted.  While it is desirable that decisions made by the tribunal be transparent, it is recognised that it may be necessary that such hearings be held in private so as to ensure that nothing said could place at risk an applicant's life or the lives of family members or friends who remain in the applicant's country of origin.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be required to publish an annual report detailing its work and the decisions made by it.  This provision will ensure a degree of transparency about the decision-making process so that Members of this House and the general public will see how the legislation is working and the manner in which we are complying with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to each of the sections in the Bill.  Section 1 details the Title to the Bill.  Section 2 provides that the Bill will come into operation six <Col N="419" /> months after its enactment.  Section 3 is the definition section.  It contains the definition of refugee already referred to, which corresponds exactly with the definition contained in the Geneva Convention. Section 4 deals with applications for recognition of refugee status and for asylum and provides that any person who is within the State or who arrives at the frontiers of the State may apply to the Minister for Justice to be recognised as a refugee and to be granted asylum.  This section provides that an appeal may be made against a decision of the Minister to a refugee appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 detail certain circumstances in which a Minister may refuse to determine an application for asylum and are in accord with the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Primarily the Minister may decline to determine an application in circumstances where there is another state in which the applicant may apply for recognition as a refugee whose laws and practices comply fully with the requirements of the Geneva Convention and with which the applicant has closer connections than with this State and where there are no special circumstances requiring the Minister to consider and determine the application.  The Minister may also decline to process an application where a final determination has yet to be made on an application for asylum by a person to such state or where the applicant has been refused recognition as a refugee in such state.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Minister for Justice, prior to determining an application for asylum, to seek the views of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This makes part of our statute law the procedure that is supposed to be applied under the arrangements agreed with the High Commission on Refugees in 1985.  Prior to making a decision the Minister must also have regard to communications received, as previously mentioned, not only from the High Commission on Refugees and the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also from any other <Col N="420" /> body or organisation.  This allows for non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council, the Commission on Justice and Peace or any other body to make submissions to the Minister with regard to the decision to be made on an application for refugee status and asylum.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that every person who seeks recognition as a refugee and who seeks asylum shall be entitled to access to legal advice and representation and, where necessary, a right of access to an interpreter.  Moreover, it requires that every such person be informed of their rights in this regard.  Section 7 provides that every person recognised as a refugee must be granted asylum.  Section 8 prohibits the Minister or any person acting on the Minister's behalf from deporting or removing from the State or returning any person to any other state where &ldquo;their life or freedom would be threatened&rdquo; on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  Nor can such person be removed to a third state unless the Minister is satisfied that that state will not so deal with them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 details a number of circumstances in which a person will cease to be a refugee and cease to be entitled to political asylum &mdash; for example, where a person previously granted asylum voluntarily returns to his or her country of origin.</P>
    <P>Section 10 excludes certain persons from entitlement to protection as a refugee and to a grant of political asylum. For example, refugee status will not be extended to a person who has committed a war crime, or a crime against humanity or who has committed a crime of genocide within the meaning of the Genocide Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice for the &ldquo;making, consideration and determination of applications&rdquo; under the Bill. While conferring on the Minister a general power to make regulations, the section specifically requires that regulations be made to provide for the following matters: (a) the immediate <Col N="421" /> notification to the Minister by immigration officers of the making of an application; (b) the interviewing of all applicants by an appropriate person familiar with the provisions of the Convention and the State's obligations thereunder; (c) the representation of applicants at such interviews by a solicitor and the provision of the services of an independent and competent interpreter where necessary; (d) notification to all applicants of their right to legal representation, access to an interpreter and of their right to appeal against any determination made; (e) notification to all applicants of information obtained by or on behalf of the Minister with regard to an application made and to afford reasonable time to the applicant to respond to such information; (f) notification to all applicants of their right to independently contact the Commission; (g) the communication in writing of the determination to the applicant and the giving of reasons for a determination to him and, in the event of an application being refused, the giving of this notification to the applicant of his right to appeal under the Bill and the manner in which that right may be exercised.</P>
    <P>Section 11 also recognises the importance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status by requiring that nothing contained in any regulations made under the Act shall contravene its provisions. This is important so as to ensure that we fully comply with our international obligations and it is also a further step towards ensuring an international uniformity of approach for asylum applications.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is worth noting that the European Parliament on 5 November 1992 in a report of the Committee of Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the harmonisation within the European Communities of Asylum Law and Policies, the rapporteur of which was Mr. Patrick Cooney, MEP, a former Minister for Justice in this State, noted that the interpretation of the definition of a refugee in the Convention, which coincides <Col N="422" /> with the definition contained in this Bill, has given rise in practice to difficulties, in particular because the terms &ldquo;well founded&rdquo; and &ldquo;persecution&rdquo; can mean many things.  It is important, the report states, that &ldquo;the interpretation within the members states of the EC be as consistent as possible, for consistency in this regard has to be fundamental to any process of harmonisation&rdquo;.  The report emphasises the need for a consistent interpretation of qualifications for refugee status and recommends &ldquo;that in order to achieve this consistency, member states should have recourse to the UNHCR handbook on procedures and criteria which deals comprehensively with this very difficult point.&rdquo;  Organisations such as Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Refugees have emphasised to me the importance of making reference to the handbook in this legislation.  That reference is now contained therein.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that nothing contained in the Aliens Act, 1935, or in any of the orders made under the Act shall be taken to require or to authorise any action which contravenes this State's obligation under the Convention and that in the event of any conflict between the terms of any order made by the Minister for Justice under section 11 of this Bill and an order made under the 1935 Act, the order made under this Bill shall have priority.</P>
    <P>Section 13 establishes the Refugee Appeal Tribunal and provides that it shall &ldquo;be independent in the exercise of its functions&rdquo;.  Under section 14, an applicant who is dissatisfied with a ministerial determination that he or she be refused recognition as a refugee and be granted asylum is given 21 days from the date of notification of a decision made to lodge an appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the full hearing of a case on appeal before the tribunal. It allows the tribunal to take into account additional matters raised by an applicant that were not raised in the original application. The decision of the tribunal is final, subject to an appeal to the High Court on a question of law.</P>
    <P>Section 16 details the powers of the <Col N="423" /> tribunal.  It may make one of the following orders: (a) it may disallow the applicant's appeal; (b) it may allow the appeal and declare that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of the Bill; (c) notwithstanding the disallowing of an appeal, it may direct the Minister not to remove or deport the applicant to any specific country or countries stated by it; (d) notwithstanding the disallowing of an appeal, it may recommend that the Minister give an applicant humanitarian leave to enter and remain in the State for a specified period of time or indefinitely or until a specific condition or specific conditions are fulfilled; (e) having regard to the significance of any matters submitted for its consideration by the applicant which were not available for consideration by the Minister, it may decline to determine the appeal and, in that case, refer the application back to the Minister for determination.  An appeal would still be allowed from the ultimate decision made by the Minister. The Minister is required under the Bill to comply with a determination made by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The schedule to the Bill provides for the establishment of the tribunal which is to have a chairman and a vice-chairman who must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing and four ordinary members.  The members are appointed by the Minister for Justice and the provisions relating to such appointments are similar to those that apply to the appointment of members of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is provided that the tribunal when sitting is to be composed of the chairman or vice-chairman and two ordinary members of the tribunal and the tribunal can sit in two separate divisions if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is empowered to take evidence on oath to require persons to attend before it as witnesses and the Minister is empowered to make regulations as to the manner in which the tribunal is to exercise its functions.  The tribunal is required to submit an annual report to the Minister which report is to be published and laid <Col N="424" /> before both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that there is clear public knowledge as to how we are administering the Bill and complying with our international legal obligations.</P>
    <P>I have now completed outlining the general structure of the Bill.  The need for this legislation is, I believe, widely recognised.  It is my hope that this Bill will receive the same constructive response from the Government that resulted in two earlier Private Members' Bills tabled by me passing through the Oireachtas and being enacted into law.  I refer in this instance to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the Adoption Act, 1991 which allowed for the recognition of foreign adoptions.  If those Bills had not been published as Private Members' Bills and had not been accepted by Government, the legislation that they have put on our Statute Book would still not have formed part of our law today.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Protection Bill, 1993, is brought before this House by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party not as a party politically contentious piece of legislation but as a constructive measure designed to ensure that those who seek refugee status in Ireland and claim political asylum are treated with dignity and humanity and that their rights under international law are fully respected.</P>
    <P>I am specifically asking the Minister of State at the Department of Justice that the Government would not, by way of knee-jerk reaction, automatically oppose this measure simply because it comes from the Opposition side of the House. I ask the Government to agree to its successful passage through Second Stage without contention and to its move to Committee Stage before the newly established Select Committee on Legislation and Security for a detailed examination. If the Government agrees to us so proceeding I would, of course, be happy to take on board any constructive amendments that may be proposed to the Bill by the Minister so as to ensure its effectiveness. If the Government so deals with the matter we will be seen to be clearly on the road to copperfastening Dáil reform <Col N="425" /> and allowing this House to act truly as a legislative Assembly.</P>
    <P>If the Government simply opposes the measure on the usual trite grounds that it is looking into the issue itself and listing a number of theoretical defects in the Bill, it will undermine entirely the credibility of the claim made in Government statements that it wants to bring about political change and allow Members of this House to act truly as legislators.  I hope my premonitions that arise from the absence of the Minister for Justice and the absence of a single Labour Deputy in the House prove to be wrong.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will tell us this evening that the Government accept in principle the intent of this Bill, that it will not be opposed on Wednesday week and that we can proceed to a constructive Committee Stage in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and that we can, effectively, have this legislation enacted before we adjourn for the summer recess.</P>

But good in spots is not good enough.  For this reason I am opposed to this Bill and I look to the Minister for Justice, in consultation with her Government colleagues, to make whatever proposals she considers may be essential in the area of consideration of applications for refugee status or political asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people think of refugees the images that come to mind are those of people who are fleeing war zones, such as those who are the victims of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. Everybody on all sides of the House can sympathise with the truck loads of people, often women and young children, who are moved from one part of <Col N="426" /> Bosnia to a safer area where they are surrounded by people of their own ethnic origin.  It is regrettable that those people feel they have to flee their homes, but it is understandable that they should want to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that those people feel they have to flee their homes but it is understandable that they should want to do so.  Overall, it is something which attracts a great deal of sympathy and rightly so.</P>
      <P>The Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, that is the 1951 Convention as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol, gives special protection to a person who flees his or her own country on the basis of well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  That description, which is set out in the first article of the Convention, is to all intents and purposes a definition of a refugee.  Successive Irish Governments have lived up to the obligations imposed on them by the Convention.  The principal vehicle used by various Governments to implement that policy has been an agreement entered into in 1985 between the Department of Justice and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</P>
      <P>That agreement was entered into between the London Office of the United Nations Commission for Refugees and the Department of Justice to deal with the small numbers of asylum seekers who come here each year.  This formal agreement, which has been held by the courts to be legally binding on the Government, was introduced in 1985 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Michael Noonan, who represents Limerick East and a member of Deputy Shatter's party.  The agreement was welcomed by all parties interested in this area as a well-balanced and fair procedure which would ensure the safety of the genuine refugee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask why did the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, consider that an <Col N="428" /> agreement between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Justice was the most appropriate way of introducing arrangements for considering applications for political asylum?  Why did he not take the line that Deputy Shatter is now taking which is to the effect that legislation is essential.  The answer to that, as I understand it, is that Deputy Noonan considered that the number of applications was so small and the method of considering them &mdash; to see whether such applicants fitted the definition of a refugee as set out in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention &mdash; was so clear that legislation was unnecessary and would be bureaucratic and too heavy-handed for the approach that was needed.  Deputy Noonan was right in this approach to the question at the time, an approach which was seen as fair and far-sighted. The numbers of persons applying in Ireland for refugee status since the agreement was introduced has not increased significantly.  We are still receiving approximately 40-45 applications per year.  In other words, very little has changed since 1985 and the reasoning behind this formal agreement between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Justice is still as clear and as sound today.  That is why the Bill before the House is in the nature of a sledge hammer being used to crack a nut.  It is, in short, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill would also appear to be deficient because it appears to have been drafted without account being taken of the international obligations which will be placed on us when the Dublin Convention is ratified.  The Dublin Convention on Asylum, or to give it its full title, the Convention Determining the State Responsible for Examining Applications for Asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European Communities, is an important convention which was signed by the member states of the Community during Ireland's presidency of the Community in the first half of 1990.  In that regard I place on record our appreciation of the successful work carried out by Deputy Ray Burke during <Col N="429" /> our presidency, in having the Convention signed in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>That Convention is currently in the course of ratification by the Twelve member states.  It is expected that it will come into effect next year.  It will impose on us and on the other member states an obligation to consider which of the Twelve will consider applications for refugee status from third country nationals.  Its provisions are complex and have regard for the principles of international law.  It goes way beyond the simple provision in section 4 of the Bill before the House.  In this regard, the Bill can only be described as deficient.</P>
    <P>When I said earlier that the Bill was good in some respects I was referring to those provisions which are lifted more or less from the agreement between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Justice. That agreement is very specific.  It provides, for instance, that immigration officers should be provided with written guidelines which indicate that persons should not be returned to a country to which they are unable or unwilling to go, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group or political opinion, nor should they be returned to a country where their personal safety might be seriously threatened as a result of the prevailing political situation.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides also that such individuals will not be refused entry or removed until they have been given an opportunity to express their case fully, until their application for political asylum has been examined and a decision reached.  Furthermore, the asylum application must be examined by the Department in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention and 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees.  I have outlined already a definition of a refugee as described in Article 1 of the Convention. Moreover, the examination of the application by the Department shall not preclude the taking into account of humanitarian considerations that might justify the grant of leave to remain in the <Col N="430" /> State.  I would like to place on record that while the vast majority of applications for refugee status under the Convention are refused because they do not qualify under the terms of the Convention, a considerable proportion of the applicants are, nevertheless, allowed remain here for humanitarian reasons and they are very often processed for naturalisation as Irish Citizens in due course in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Justice provides that applicants for political asylum will be given the necessary facilities for submitting their cases to the Department.  If applicants are not proficient in English the services of a competent interpreter will be made available when they are being interviewed.  They must be informed of the procedure to be followed and are always given the opportunity to contact a representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees or a local representative of their choice. All applicants are given this information in a language which they understand.  In addition, all applicants are interviewed in person and interviews are conducted to the greatest extent possible by officials of the Department who understand asylum procedures and the application of refugee criteria and who are as well-informed as possible on the human rights position in the country of origin.  Of course, applicants' legal representatives may be present and represent their clients at such interviews.</P>
    <P>In all cases the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Office in London is consulted for their views on whether the application falls within the terms of the Convention and this is quite right.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees does not have an office in Dublin because the number of asylum seekers applying here would not warrant one.  The idea of referring each application to their London Office is very satisfactory because of all the people in the world, they are amongst the best able to decide who does or does not qualify under the Geneva Convention for refugee <Col N="431" /> status.  Indeed the UNHCR has been given a special supervisory role under the Geneva Convention to ensure that countries comply with its terms.  We are very pleased that they have undertaken to examine each application on our behalf.  They are the acknowledged experts in the field and keep themselves well informed of the human rights position in the country of origin of asylum.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to place on the record of the House the fact that no Minister for Justice has ever disagreed with the views of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as to whether a particular individual qualifies for refugee status.  The factual position is that less than 5 per cent of applicants meet the criteria set out in the Convention.</P>
    <P>I have set out the procedures that exist for considering asylum applications.  I am satisfied that it has worked well in dealing with the number of persons who apply here for refugee status.  I do not see the Bill as essential.  I am not in favour of supporting it.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil chun labhairt ar an mBille seo ach creidim go bhfuil bunlocht amháin air.  Tuigim, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil fonn ar an Teachta Shatter dídeanaithe a chosaint, agus tá mé go mór ar a shon sin ach tá locht ar an mBille seo sa mhéid, de réir mar a thuigimse an scéal, go mbraitheann an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt go mór ar an United High Commission for Refugees le haghaidh comhairle agus cinnithe a dhéanamh, maidir le dídeanaithe atá ag iarraidh fanacht sa tír seo.  Má ghlactar leis gurb é siúd is fearr, gur féidir leo cinnithe a dhéanamh i gcásanna mar seo, b'aisteach an rud é sinne dream éigin a chur os a gceann siadsan, is é sin, coiste achomhairc chun go bhféadfaí athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chinneadh a bheadh déanta ag dream a aithnimid a bheith ceaptha&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;glacaim leis go rachfar i gcomhairle leo, ach ó thaobh an achomhairc de, i <Col N="432" /> gcás go ndéanann siad moladh, nach ceart duine a ligean isteach sa tír, tá an Teachta ag rá go mba cheadmhach achomharc a dhéanamh in aghaidh an bhreithiúnais sin chuig an tribunal seo. Cuireann sé sin iontas orm.  Má tá sé de nós glacadh leis an gcomhairle atá á cur ar fáil acu siúd, ba cheart cloí leis an nós sin agus gan cur ina gcead siadsan sa tír seo nuair atáimid a mhaíomh gurb é bunús an Bhille ná feidhm a thabhairt do na coinbhinsin éagsúla atá á gcur i bhfeidhm go héifeachtach sa tír seo cheana féin.  Creidim go bhfuil an Bille seo, go bunúsach, lochtach, agus go bhfuil casadh á chur sa scéal nach bhfuil gá leis.  B'fhearr dúinn athbhreithniú a dhénamh.  Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an t-Aire ag dul do seo sa chaoi go bhfeidhmeofar na cleachtais i dtaobh dídeanaithe, go bunúsach de réir chomhairle an UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Cé ar cheart, agus cé nár cheart ligean isteach sa tír seo?  Caithfimid bheith ansoiléir gur ag caint ar dhídeanaithe atáimid, dream go mba chontúirt dóibh dá gcuirfí ar ais iad go dtí a dtír dhúchais féin.  Mar sin, is é an rud is bunasaí a chaithfear a phlé ná an bhfuil an chontúirt sin ann?  Má ghlacaimid leis gurb amhlaidh an scéal, caithfear glacadh leis freisin go bhfuil breithiúnais mhíchearta á ndéanamh ag an United Nations High Commission nuair a bhíonn siad ag tabhairt comhairle don Rialtas anseo.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Broughan, ní raibh cás ar bith riamh ann go ndeachthas in aghaidh na comhairle a thug siad.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cosaintí eile atá á gcur isteach sa Bhille, dá mba rud é nach raibh na seirbhísí aistriúcháin á gcur ar fáil, ná na cosaintí agus comhairle éifeachtach dlí, cheapfainn go mbeadh cás ann le cosaint dlí a chur ar fáil do dhaoine.  Ach is é fírinne an scéil go bhfuil na háiseanna seo á gcur ar fáil, chomh fada agus is féidir, agus, mar sin, níl aon ghá le iad a chur isteach sa dlí.  Chomh maith leis sin bheifí ag baint de sholúbthacht an chórais.  Is é an cheist a chaithfear a thógáil ná, an bhfuil daoine á gcoinneáil amach as an tír seo, dídeanaithe atá i gcontúirt d'uireasa an Bhille seo?  Má tá, caithfidh go bhfuil an chomhairle atá á tabhairt <Col N="433" /> ag an United Nations High Commission lochtach.  Is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil an breithiúnas a thabharfadh muide níos cirte ná breithiúnas na heagraíochta idirnáisiúnta a bhfuil de chúram orthu na ceisteanna seo a phlé.  Go praiticiúil tá na coinbhinsin á gcur i bhfeidhm, mar a dúirt an t-Aire.  Government policy on political asylum is and has been in accordance with our international commitment arising under the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol. A procedure was agreed in 1985 with the UN High Commissioner for refugees, providing the administrative structure for dealing with applications for refugee status.</P>
    <P>Anois, is léir ón méid sin go bhfuil na córais riaracháin a leag na coinbhinsin sin síos á chur i bhfeidhm anseo, agus is léir mar sin, go gcaithfidh go gcreideann an Teachta a chuir an Bille seo faoi bhráid an Tí go bhfuil na coinbhinsin sin lochtach agus nach bhfuil dóthain cosanta iontu do dhídeanaithe.  Ar eagla go mbeadh míthuiscint ann faoin uimhir daoine atá i gceist sa rud seo ar fad agus cá mhéad cás a thagann faoi bhráid an Aire chuile bhliain, nó faoi bhráid na Roinne, táimid ag caint go bunúsach faoi thart ar ceathracha duine.  Sin an líon daoine atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Tá contúirt ann in fhoclaíocht an Bhille go mbeadh muid ag tabhairt ceart dlíthiúl do chuile dhuine a thiocfadh isteach sa tír seo, dídean a lorg.  Tá an baol ann go bhféadfadh daoine as éadan an chosaint seo a lorg agus teacht tríd an chóras seo, an t-achomharc.  Bheadh an oiread sin daoine ag teacht isteach faoin gcóras sin, go bhféadfadh dhá rud tarlú: go gcuirfí moill ar chásanna fíordhídeanaithe nó go séanfaí cearta d'fhíordhídeanaithe dá bharr.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal, bheadh míúsáid á baint as an gcóras ag daoine nach fíordhídeanaithe iad.  Sin é an fáth gur chuir mé an oiread sin béime ar an ngné seo.  D'fhéadfadh an liosta éirí chomh fada sin i ngeall ar an méid forálacha a bheadh anseo &mdash; an córas achomhairc agus mar sin de &mdash; go mbeadh cearta bunaidh bainte amach ag <Col N="434" /> daoine sa tír seo faoin am go dtiocfadh a gcuid cásanna go dtí an t-achomharc&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Mar sin, creidim gurb é an bealach is fearr chun an chuibhis seo ná breathnú as an nua ar na córais riaracháin a bhaineann leis an cheist seo ar fad, féachaint le cinneadh sciobtha a dhéanamh.

      <P>I must say that tonight's debate is a shameful passage in the recent history of this House.  I use those words not with an undue sense of exaggeration because we come here with important legislation proposed by a private Member of this House and it does not even get the courtesy of a ministerial reply.  It does get the attention of two backbenchers speaking on behalf of the Government, one of whom clearly used a script supplied to him by the Department of Justice.  The other availed of our national language to express views &mdash; to which I will return &mdash; which are unacceptable in any modern democracy and which, veiled in our national language, may not get the currency which they deserve.  I was listening carefully and I understood what he said.  The logic of what he said should be brought out in sharp detail.</P>

      <P>This Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter is designed to bring some form of order and administrative law into a very important aspect of Irish public policy, the way in which we deal with people who come to our shores and our airports seeking protection from this State in accordance with international law.  The Bill seeks to put a legal system in place to protect those individual's rights in accordance with our obligations under international law.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite who have spoken have upheld the past practice here of a totally unreviewable administrative practice which, in effect, is denying people ordinary basic human rights.  Those Deputies who have contributed to this debate do not understand what they are dealing with.  What about the Libyan student who spent two years in prison here awaiting a determination of his status and awaiting deportation because the Irish Government was not in a position to put him back from whence he came?  What about the Chinese student, to whom Deputy Shatter referred, who spent seven months in Mountjoy jail because his only crime was to come to this shore without a visa and to invoke the protection of this country against political persecution in Peking? What does Deputy Ó Cuív think or care about such a person?  That person spent seven months in Mountjoy jail in circumstances where criminals in Ireland are being let go to make room for people like him.  Has the Deputy any idea of the shame he brings on us?</P>

Moreover, they are not even told that they have a right to see a lawyer to get them out of jail.  They spend weeks and months in our prisons without any entitlement to legal aid or review or appeal from the decision which put them there in the first place.  The Deputies opposite who have spoken according to supplied scripts agus trí Ghaeilge have never seen the people they are talking about.  While they are doing the Minister's dirty work tonight they are ignoring the reality that a young Chinese student spent seven months in Mountjoy jail because he had the cheek to come to this country and ask to be considered as a refugee.  I wonder what kind of political tradition is represented by the Deputies who think that is all right.  I suggest that tonight is one of shame for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív told this House go raibh contúirt ann maidir le daoine nach dídeanaithe iad, míúsáid a bhaint as cosaint atá ar fáil sa Bhille seo.  He said that people who came to this country who were not really refugees could abuse the protections Deputy Shatter was offering to them in this Bill.  It is important that this House should understand that, although he disguised it by not using the ordinary vernacular of many <Col N="438" /> people here.  He said this Bill offers safeguards that some people who are not genuine refugees could abuse, according to him it was a fundamental defect in the Bill that a safeguard could be abused. What a scandalously low view of international law that represents.  One does not give anybody any rights because those people who are not entitled to them might abuse them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood precisely what the Deputy said and the record will show that I am quoting him fairly.  The Deputy also went on to say that nobody in Ireland was denied refugee status if the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees thought that he should be accorded it.  That totally departs from reality because people are regularly put back on flights without any knowledge of their entitlements under international law.  It may be that Deputy Ó Cuív and Deputy Foley think that people who come here from Bosnia and Sri Lanka have read up their UN Convention, that they know the words they should invoke, that they know their legal rights when they arrive at Shannon, understand international law and are fully conversant with their rights. However, everyone of us knows that that is far from being the reality and that people have been bundled back onto planes.  The incident to which Deputy Shatter referred where the Kurdish refugees were herded aboard a plane to get them out of the country before they could have any access to anybody who was in any way well disposed towards them underlines precisely why it is necessary to have a system of law as opposed to simple administrative discretion to deal with these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Someone who comes to this country and asks for refugee status is entitled to some basic rights under international human law and one of them is that he deals with somebody who is capable of representing his case to the people who are about to make the decision about <Col N="439" /> him.  That involves a right to see a lawyer immediately to make his argument to the administrative tribunal of whatever kind that is to make the decision about him. That right, if it exists at all, exists only on paper.  The reality is that an officer of the Department of Justice, using powers under the Aliens Act, is entitled to make a decision about that person and commit him to jail without any judicial interference whatsoever.  Deputies may disagree with that, but that is the fact. People are lodged in Mountjoy and put into our prisons at the behest of the officials of the Department of Justice, and they are not granted access of an immediate kind to any judicial authority before a decision of that kind is made in respect of them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is clearly unaware of a stage in this House's legislative process called the Committee Stage.  If he sees any defect in a Bill which he agrees with in principle, he or any other Member of this House is free to table an amendment to deal with it and it is precisely on that basis that we should operate.  This notion of hunting through the Bill &mdash; which happens in every Department whenever a Private Members' Bill is tabled &mdash; to look for something wrong in it and saying that it cannot be given a Second Reading and cannot go through Committee Stage for the purpose of improving it is entirely spurious.  Again and again some poor benighted civil servant is put to hunting through every Bill to find some defect in it so that somebody can stand up and say go bhfuil sé lochtadh bunúsach, to use the Deputy's phrase.  The fact that the Bill is &ldquo;defective&rdquo; is the great put down.</P>
      <P>This Government stated in its joint Programme for Government that our policy on the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards and that procedures will be introduced &mdash; not that they are in place &mdash; to guarantee rights of hearing, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts.  These are the defences, na cosantaí, that the Deputy said would be abused and therefore must be denied.  These are precisely what this Government has promised and they now, through the medium of a back bencher, say that they have no intention of delivering on that commitment because people may abuse those rights when they are presented.  That is what the Deputy said and if the Deputy would only read his own Government's Programme for Government he would realise that his speech not only subverts what is in that programme but flagrantly contradicts the spirit of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter signalled well in advance his intention to introduce this Bill.  He stated very clearly in public that it was his intention to put in place a set of procedures which would guarantee the rights of persons coming to Ireland seeking refugee status.  I hope he will take it amiss when I say he has done the minimum that would be necessary to vindicate their rights by putting in place a form of appeleate system which has been promised by the Government and some system of access through the medium of an appeal on a point of law to the High Court.  His Bill is meritorious in every respect in so far as it amounts to a vindication of the promise made by the Government to deliver new rights to people who are seeking asylum in our country.  His Bill would prevent the kind of abuses of which he spoke &mdash; the summary rejection of people who claim refugee status, their being put onto aeroplanes and hustled out of the country before they can have adequate access to people who might be in a position to help them, people who might by sympathetic to their point of view.  Instead of that, what both of the backbench contributions from the Government seem to ask this House to accept as preferable is a system of administrative decision by nameless officials who are not accountable to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Aliens Act, 1935, was introduced in very different times.  It was introduced even before the Constitution, about <Col N="443" /> which Deputy Shatter spoke a few moments ago.  In my view that Act is illegal and unconstitutional because in many respects it leaves the Minister with an unfettered discretion in relation to aliens and lays down no legislative policy to be followed.  We discovered recently that legislative measures which give Ministers virtually untrammelled powers to deal with either individuals or classes of individuals, such as was given to the Minister for Justice under the Aliens Act, have been struck down by our courts.  At some time in the future the Aliens Act will come a cropper.  A High Court judge will state that the statute and labyrinthine series of orders made under that Act are infirm because they all amount to an abdication by this House of its obligation to uphold the rights of the individuals concerned and entrusts unlimited legislative powers in the Minister for Justice to exercise in regard to aliens.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the Progressive Democrats support it.  At present, persons who arrive in Ireland seeking refugee status are at the mercy of Department of Justice officials who can, without any court order, intervention of any kind or court supervision, commit such people to prison for indefinite periods.  That is what is happening at present and that is what the two Deputies defended.  In one case which came before the courts recently, to which Deputy Shatter referred, a Chinese national who claimed refugee status under the UN Convention on the basis that he was likely to be subjected to persecution because he took part in the Tiananman Square demonstrations was held for seven months in Mountjoy Prison while this State considered his application.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind Deputies opposite that while he was occupying a prison space, others who were convicted of crimes by our courts were released early.  Guilty people went free while an innocent person was kept in jail.  That was done because a departmental official thought it possible to commit that man to prison for an indefinite period until such time as lawyers who got in contact <Col N="444" /> with him through voluntary organisations vindicated his rights.  Deputy Harney told me this evening that a Libyan has recently spent almost two years in prison awaiting deportation by the Irish State.</P>
    <P>Those people have the same rights as any person in Deputy Ó Cuív's constituency. They have a right not to be deprived of their liberty except in accordance with the law.  What law gives a departmental official the right to say that while he or she considers a refugee's position the person must remain indefinitely in a penal institution?  Why do we not have a holding centre or a system of bail for such people?  All those things could be provided under the provisions of this Bill by an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to both Deputies who contributed on behalf of the Government that their contributions ignore basic human and constitutional rights and, as a matter of basic constitutional law, the right to liberty is not only confined to Irish citizens but given to all people who fall within the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  Those rights were not vindicated by recent decisions of the Minister for Justice of officials of that Department who do not have a right to deprive others of their liberty or subject them to an indefinite term in jail. That is what happens and the Deputy does not know what he is talking about. I have met and spoken to people who have spend seven months in jail.  The Deputy is full of wind and sound but knows nothing of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> My final comment in regard to the way in which the Government has responded to this Bill this evening relates to the absence of ministerial response.  I must say that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is assiduous in participating in the affairs of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in his interplay with other Deputies, in debating matters with other Deputies, in listening to their points of view and, in general, in participating as a responsible Member of this Legislature.  I must say that in his favour.</P>
      <P>However, it is noteworthy that nobody from the Department of Justice, with ministerial responsibility, would stand up and respond to Deputy Shatter's speech without advance notice.  If I may use the phrase without undue harshness on the two Deputies who came in here to respond, a sandbagging operation was done so that the Minister or Minister of State could come back with a more considered response at a later stage.  The Minister of State, in particular, does not deserve the sharp end of my tongue on this matter but his senior Minister does. On every occasion she has come before this House she has single handedly delivered set piece speeches without any interruption.  She never gives way to another Member of the House.  She never takes a point from the other side of the House, but studiously ignores every interruption, remark or comment in the course of her parliamentary duties.  She buries her head in her script and bashes on as if nothing said in this House could possibly affect how she should behave.  I have noticed that on a number of debates in this House.  She does not even take Committee Stages of her Bills in case she would be forced to discuss any measure on a rational basis with a member of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not a proper way for a Minister of our Government to treat this House. As Members of the Oireachtas we are entitled to put forward points of view to the Government during debates and to <Col N="446" /> have adequate responses to those points during the course of debate by members of the Government.  The two Ministers in the Department of Justice, especially the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, pay great service to this House, but a Minister should not come in here and supply a script stating that that is his or her attitude and we can like it or lump it.  We are entitled to have a genuine debate in this House.  We have had some interplay of ideas across the House tonight, not with the people making the decisions but with their proxies who have been sent in here to keep the debate on the boil, as it were, until such time as they can deal with it more decisively at a later stage.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a matter of fundamental human rights.  We are great at lecturing the rest of the world about departures from human rights when it suits us.  We are great at pointing out abuses in Central America, South Africa and Central Europe.  We are the first to point out what is wrong with the way the rest of the world is run.  We are great at saying we have some unique role to play in the manner in which Irish foreign policy is conducted through the auspices of the United Nations, but the United Nations set in place a convention in relation to the treatment of refugees. Whatever about the theory of ministerial co-operation with the Commissioner of the United Nations in relation to refugees, the facts are very different.  The fact is that this country does not vindicate the rights of refugees adequately and, in effect, unreviewable decisions are being made as a matter of course in regard to people seeking refugee status here. Moreover, the statistic that was trotted out here by Deputy Foley that only 5 per cent of applicants are found to be genuine is not to the point.  The figure may be 5 per cent or 10 per cent, but the relevant issue is whether any individual is included in that 5 per cent and by what criteria he or she is found to be included or excluded.  That is the crucial issue, and no amount of bluster and hot air in this House can take away from one fundamental fact, that is, when it comes to according people basic constitutional <Col N="447" /> protections under our Constitution, and as a matter of international law, one must establish fair procedures, one must be willing to set down some system by which a decision made can be reviewed at a time when someone can do something about it if is wrong.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sale of Greencore Shares.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Last week I noted the frustration of many Members of the House, as indeed you did Sir, when our roles of procedure failed to give us the opportunity to raise this matter on the day when it was perhaps uppermost in people's minds.  Last week's sale of Greencore shares by the Government represents a failure in terms of policy, politics and will.  It is a further debacle for the Minister for Finance in particular and the Government in general in terms of their reputation and dealings with the business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the failure of policy, I find it deeply ironic that a few days in advance of the Government's announcement of its so-called commitment to the Culliton report, it was announced yesterday with an extraordinary fanfare by the Labour Minister for Enterprise and Employment and his junior Ministers in that Department, that the disposal of the <Col N="448" /> Government's shares in Greencore should have flown totally in the face of the recommendations of Culliton.  That report clearly acknowledged the need for further study of Irish food industries &mdash; I acknowledge that &mdash; but it still contained some basic recommendations.  It recommended, in particular, that the food industries' performance in Ireland could be significantly improved by a greater and selective involvement in the industry by multinational companies with access to the market and to best industry practices.</P>
    <P>A linkage between ADM, Archer Daniels Midland, and Greencore was straight out of the Culliton philosophy, and it should have been jumped at by the Government.  ADM is a major player on the world agri-business stage, employing 13,000 people and with sales of over £9 billion per annum.  As a minority partner for Greencore, ADM offered extraordinary and diverse access to market intelligence, to open up global markets for products, to high class technology and to best international practice in terms of agri-business management.  To have failed to secure such a player as an active partner for Greencore, which that company's management clearly recognised as being in its company's best interests and which the Culliton logic would insist is in the nation's best interest, discredits the Government and the Minister for Finance in the disposal of these shares.</P>
    <P>Sadly, I think the reason ADM has been lost to Greencore arises from a failure of politics at the core of Government itself.  The head of the Minister for Finance, which seemed fairly clear in his earlier contributions to this House, was overruled by the heart of the Labour Party which a few months ago did not want any privatisation at all and the next month changed its mind but did not know how best to exploit it in the nation's overall interest.  This anti-Culliton gesture in practice from this pro-Culliton Government in theory is yet another example in its early days of a confused Administration where the blind are leading the blind from one policy <i>cul de sac</i> to another. <Col N="449" /> The Progressive Democrats Party supports the sale of the Greencore shares. There was no point in the Government staying on as a large passive minority shareholder in a company clearly bursting at the seams to develop through the market.  However, to have disposed yet again of a large volume of Government-held shares by rounding up the usual institutions is a lost opportunity and a glaring failure of will.  The Minister for Finance knows that ADM was the ideal partner for Greencore &mdash; he said as much in this House.  The decision not to sell the shares to ADM and the blunder of letting them slip through the net comes down to a failure of will on the part of the Minister to insist on doing what he knows to be right and correct instead of letting the qualms of his confused partners in Government rule the day.  For a Government ostensibly committed to an enterprise culture, it is about time we saw some real evidence of its ability to do business with business.  The creation of an enterprise society requires more than rhetoric, press conferences and new brass plates on ministries in Kildare Street.  As I said at the outset, the failure to sell the shares to ADM is a policy failure, a political failure and, most of all, a failure of will on the part of the Minister for Finance who has to answer for this tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated publicly, the termination of my discussions with Archer Daniels Midland, ADM, the US-based food major on their possible purchase of the State's residual shareholding of 25 million shares in Greencore plc was on the initiative of ADM.  The Government is fully cognisant of the value to the economy of the businesses which ADM own and operate in Ireland and had welcomed their interest in becoming a long term partner of Greencore, which would have assisted development of the indigenous food sector.  I am hopeful that their contribution to the economy will continue and increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sale of its shares to ADM, which would have given them a <Col N="450" /> holding of 25 per cent or more, the Government made it clear that it would facilitate the waiver of the requirement, in the Greencore articles of association that no shareholder could hold more than 15 per cent of Greencore's shares.  This would have required the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, as the special shareholder, and a vote by the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the safeguards and protections conferred by the special share remain very firmly in place, and would have done so even if the sale to ADM had gone ahead.  The special share protects the company from take-over and prevents any alteration in the articles of association &mdash; the constitution of the company &mdash; without the consent of the special shareholder.  I would repeat that the sugar quota is a national question &mdash; it is not a Greencore quota &mdash; and cannot be taken out of the country no matter who owns the shares in Greencore.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made to the effect that the Government should have retained a strategic share in Greencore. This makes no great sense.  It had been made clear at the flotation that the Government would not take up any rights issues which the company might seek from the market in due course.  Any such rights issues would <i>de facto</i> dilute the Government stake.  Furthermore, those rights issues would have been made difficult by the overhang of the Government shareholding.  The retention of its shareholding would, therefore, have acted as a continuing drag on the development potential of the company.  Therefore, the sale of the Government's shares was in the best interests of the company's future development.</P>
    <P>In my statement to the House on 3 March last, I made it clear that the initial advice I received from Davy Stockbrokers, my advisers in this matter, was that a share placement was the appropriate way to dispose of the Greencore shares which I then held.  The management of Greencore had, however, come to the conclusion that the future growth and development of the company <Col N="451" /> would be best served by entering into a strategic partnership with another company. They sought a partner who would provide strengths complementary to Greencore's own in the areas of technology, access to markets, etc.  Their choice of partner was, of course, ADM.</P>
    <P>The sale of the Government's shares to ADM, and consequent alliance between ADM and Greencore, then came into the picture.  The attractions of this outcome for Greencore were clear, but in the light of concerns that were expressed I allowed time for other groups to make offers.  In the event no comparable offer was made although there had been much comment to the effect that an Irish food group or groups would bid for the Government's shares.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with ADM then took place, but eventually ADM withdrew. That was, of course, their privilege.  I then reverted to what Davy Stockbrokers had originally advised and disposed of the shares by means of a placement at a very satisfactory price.  As is usual, and necessary, in deals of this kind, my advisers made discreet soundings in the market, without publicity.  On the day of the placement itself, again following the usual market practice, they completed the sale within hours.</P>
    <P>Although certain voices have been raised in criticism of this deal, I believe it to have been in the best interests of the company and the Government.  I was glad to note the statement issued by Greencore's chief executive, Mr. Gerry Murphy in which he said:</P>
    <P>We were particularly pleased at the positive market response to the placing and the successful take-up of the shares by Irish and overseas institutions.  The Government's sale and the inclusion of Greencore in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index for Ireland will be a further positive boost to the wider ownership and liquidity of our shares.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future of Greencore, I am confident that it will involve further growth and diversification and <Col N="452" /> that Greencore will make a substantial contribution to the economy and to employment in the years ahead. However, as Greencore is now a privately owned company, its corporate strategy, including possible alliances with other companies, is a matter for the company itself.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the food industry in Ireland, its growth and development, and will be studying carefully the recent report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry in this regard.  I am most anxious that all possible opportunities for growth in employment and value-added within Ireland should be fully exploited.  In addition, the development of the food industry has the potential to offer our farmers improved outlets for their produce and opportunities to diversify their output.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cox for having given me the opportunity of placing these matters on record.  I might confirm for him that the decision of the Government some weeks ago was to allow me, as Minister for Finance, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to conclude discussions with Archer Daniels Midland and that, if ADM did not want to conclude those discussions, which was their privilege, to sell the shares to the institutions.  I am also grateful to Davy's who acted on behalf of the Government and who were advisers to Greencore, for the success and excellent result last Friday morning from the sale of the shares and I appreciate the interest shown by ADM and others earlier.  It is my fervent hope that the Greencore company goes from success to success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for having given me this opportunity <Col N="453" /> to raise a vitally important issue, the discharge of untreated sewage into Cork Harbour from the Whitegate area.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, there is a major drive to attract visitors to the Cork harbour area where there are numerous water sports facilities such as wind-surfing, sailing and rowing.</P>
      <P>An estate of local authority houses was built in Upper Aghada in 1968.  Sewerage piping from these houses led to the river which flows into Whitegate Bay.  The sewage from Upper Aghada, all Whitegate and the houses in between, stays on the slobs in the Whitegate tidal bay for some 12 hours daily.  A local authority report of 1991 stated that raw sewage from Whitegate village and Upper Aghada, with an estimated population of 737, is discharged via a culvert to the foreshore directly on to the promenade in the centre of Whitegate village, where there is considerable, visible pollution. There are also noxious smells throughout the village, especially during the summer months.</P>
      <P>The present position is completely unacceptable.  Local beaches such as White Bay are used by a large section of the community.  An analysis of the water carried out in 1991 showed pollution levels to be significantly higher than those recommended by the EC guidelines for bathing water.  As far back as 1972 the chief medical officer of the Southern Health Board said that the pollution was a danger to public health.</P>
      <P>In 1992 contract documents for a scheme costing £256,000 were submitted to the Department of the Environment. The people of Whitegate are very anxious that the Minister makes the money available for this scheme to be commenced and, on behalf of my constituents, I urge him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be well aware, the EC has laid down strict guidelines concerning pollution.  All too often these guidelines are disregarded by private and public bodies alike, which is not good enough, since waterways are among our most valuable assets/resources and must be protected at all times.  We should remember that our country has a reputation <Col N="454" /> of being a green, unpolluted island and we must do everything we can to maintain that good image.  The Whitegate area in Cork Harbour is one of the most scenic areas nationwide.  Let us keep it that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mulvihill for having given me a few moments of his time to raise the long saga of the Whitegate sewage problem.</P>
      <P>Whitegate has become one of the new tourist centres of east Cork, especially since the opening of the Trobolgan Holiday Centre.  In addition, in recent years there has been development in and around Whitegate and the Aghada area.  As a result of this and the location of the ESB station at Aghada sewage has been a problem in Whitegate Harbour.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mulvihill said, a sewerage scheme had been promised for many years but nothing has happened.  I join him in requesting the Minister to solve this problem as quickly as possible as it is causing concern in the locality.  I urge the Minister to do his utmost to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past six years my Department has provided in excess of £45 million for new and improved water and sewerage schemes throughout County Cork.  So far this year almost £7.6 million have been allocated to schemes in the county.  In addition, significant progress has been made in the planning for new sewage treatment facilities or sewerage networks at a number of locations throughout the county, including Cork city.  Mitchelstown Midleton, Kinsale, Bantry, Cobh, Skibbereen and Leap which are included in a list of environmental projects in respect of which Cohesion Fund assistance is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Whitegate and Upper Aghada, Cork County Council made an application to my Department for grant assistance of £50,000 under the small water and sewerage schemes programme in 1989 and the grant was approved.  At that time, Cork County Council was <Col N="455" /> informed that the work should be undertaken and all claims in relation to schemes made in that year.  However, Cork County Council did not carry out the work in 1989 and the scheme was resubmitted for consideration in 1991 at an estimated cost of £125,000.  Because of the existing level of commitments and the increased number of high priority schemes competing for funds it was not possible to approve the scheme.  Late last year Cork County Council submitted contract documents in respect of the Whitegate sewerage scheme to my Department for consideration under the major water and sanitary services programme. The scheme is now estimated to cost £256,000.  I understand that Cork County Council has also sought tenders for the work.</P>
    <P>While Cork County Council has outlined to my Department the problems posed by the prevailing circumstances, notably in relation to public health, visual pollution and odours, recognition of the need for the scheme was implicit in the approval of grant assistance in 1989.  I would point out that the local authority did not utilise the grant when the money was available.  The scheme has increased in scope and cost since while, at the same time, the scale of investment implications of our national obligations has been clarified and intensified.  In this context, despite the local authority decision to proceed to contract documents and tender stages, so far it has not been possible to afford the scheme priority within the national programme or to give any specific commitment with regard to its funding.</P>
    <P>The matter is at present under consideration in my Department.  I can assure Deputies Mulvihill and Michael Ahern that I will do everything I can to ensure that funds are made available as soon as possible to allow the scheme to proceed.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, <Col N="456" /> for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is essential to state clearly that this area aid application scheme must be scrapped immediately. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has unleashed a new plague on this country of which there are reported to be 172,000 cases.  This virus is causing otherwise sane people to go absolutely frantic with worry.  It is called IACS, the integrated administration and control system, which takes the form of a 16-page questionnaire which, among other things, goes to the absurd lengths of asking farmers to declare the area of any rock outcrops on their farms and to estimate the area of headlands and uncultivated strips of land beside ditches, walls and fences.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of the madness which has been engendered by that scheme that none of the normal tasks that should receive attention on farms at this time of the year is receiving proper attention. Farmers should be spraying crops, managing grassland, closing fields for silage and planning their flocks for next year but instead they have been obliged to do these nonsensical sums and worry about whether a neighbour's kale or fodder beet crop will squeeze out a few more acres of winter barley from the national base area.  Farmers are spending their days anxiously waiting for maps to arrive in the post and their nights travelling to briefing meetings so that they can be told what this dreadful cursed form is all about.  For example, they are trying to calculate whether it would be worth their while to forego premiums on some groups of animals in order to maximise their entitlement to extensification premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who applied to the Ordnance Survey Office for maps to accompany this nonsensical form before 24 March and who were told they would have the maps by 1 May are now being told that they will have to wait for another week.  Those who applied after 24 March were told, first, that they would have to wait six weeks but they are now being told they will have to wait seven weeks.  It has been reported that there are up to 1,000 <Col N="457" /> unopened applications for maps lying in the Ordnance Survey Office.  In desperation farmers are going to the Land Registry, the Farm Development Service and county councils for maps.  Only yesterday I was told by a Teagasc officer that one third of the farmers in his area who had received maps were given the wrong maps.  It is clear that the system cannot cope.</P>
    <P>The Minister's tardy and grudging response today was that livestock producers will not need maps this year and that everybody else will have an extra 17 days, until the end of this month, to submit their maps but they must provide a certificate from the Ordnance Survey Office stating that the application was submitted before 31 March.  I am sure that there will be a delay in issuing these certificates from the Ordnance Survey Office.</P>
    <P>The chaos goes as far as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Today, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry gave a written reply to my colleague, Deputy McGinley, which was not up-to-date on these points.  In the face of this chaos the best that the agriculture commissioner in Brussels, Commissioner Steichan, can do is wag an admonitory finger at us and remind us of the penalties for late or erroneous applications.  There is no trace of the slightest understanding of the pernicious effects this virus is causing all over the European Community.  As I said, this entire scheme is madness and it cannot work.</P>
    <P>The united efforts of Teagasc officers who are working overtime, farm consultants throughout the country, officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the farming press and the major farming organisations still cannot cope with the pressure in completing these forms.  The two Ministers of State sitting opposite, in particular Deputy Treacy, should know this because a couple of weeks ago I met a large group of his constituents who were totally distracted and wondering what they should do about this.</P>

I wonder if he is really living in the same world as the rest of us or has he gone absolutely daft?  It is beyond belief that a Fianna Fáil Minister could propose this kind of bureaucratic lunacy.  I could believe it of the Labour Party which is chronically addicted to bureaucracy but it is incredible that Fianna Fáil should do this.</P>
      <P>It is time that the Government faced reality.  We must tell the Commission that this is not the way to implement the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  It must scrap this mad enterprise.  It is time for us to work out a way to apply these flawed Common Agricultural Policy reforms which a careless Fianna Fáil Government agreed to.  We must stop this madness and get away from the notion that farmers all over the country should spend their time filling out forms rather than occupying themselves by engaging in crop husbandry and so on.</P>

      <P>The issuing of maps is a matter for the Ordnance Survey Office which is under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>EC regulations laying down rules for the new aid schemes stipulate that applications must be lodged by 15 May.  Maps must be supplied with applications for arable aid in order to enable land areas to be located for control purposes.  Applications for aid will be accepted after the closing date but a penalty of 1 per cent per working day applies to amounts payable in such cases, and no aid can be paid where applications are received after 3 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some delays are being experienced in securing maps from the Ordnance Survey Office.  This is largely due to a late influx of requests for maps <Col N="459" /> notwithstanding the fact that my Department advised farmers several months ago to secure these maps in good time.  This message has been emphasised regularly by Teagasc advisers, by the farming media, by farming organisations and by the Ordnance Survey Office itself.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that some farmers may not be in a position to supply their maps by the closing date for applications. In an effort to alleviate this problem, my Department has this week announced that applications without maps will be accepted provided that the relevant maps are forwarded by 31 May 1993.  I must emphasise that this concession does not apply to the application form, which must be received by the closing date.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has already stated in the House that unwitting errors will not be penalised.  The Department will take as sympathetic and pragmatic an approach as possible within the Community regulations. I am satisfied that this arrangement will enable farmers to meet the application deadline and avoid the penalties to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The objective of the ESB-Government subsidised electrification scheme is to aid rural electrification. This scheme replaced the EC-funded Western Package electrification scheme which was terminated in 1990 and covers those areas designated as less favoured or disadvantaged &mdash; the counties of Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry and parts of all the remaining counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme aid is provided for the following services in towns and villages where agriculture is the principal <Col N="460" /> economic activity: the provision of a new electricity supply, increased supply and the provision of three-phase supply.  Aid is also provided for the supply of electricity to firms and co-operatives engaged in the marketing and processing of farm products.</P>
    <P>The scheme applies to farming in its wider sense such as mushroom growing, poultry, pig farming etc.  The scheme is financed jointly by the ESB which provides 60 per cent, the Department of Energy which provides 20 per cent and the successful beneficiary who also provides 20 per cent.  To date, over 1,600 applicants have benefited under the scheme at a cost of £3.76 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I understand from inquiries that there is now serious doubt about the future of this scheme.  Apparently the Department of Energy is not prepared to pay its share of the subsidy, i.e., 20 per cent.  Over 300 applicants are waiting for clearance, 200 for payment and 100 for approval.  Many of these are small farmers who are trying to upgrade their dairies because of EC hygiene regulations.  Some are involved in developing alternative farm enterprises such as mushroom or poultry production, while others are in the process of installing an electricity supply for the first time.  These people live mainly in remote parts of the west and can only now afford the luxury of an electricity supply.  However, because of the action of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, and its apparent refusal to co-operate with the ESB in making financial provisions for this scheme, many small farmers will now be left in the dark.  This is totally unacceptable in the Ireland of 1993.  Many small farmers will be forced out of milk production.  Several small on-farm enterprises will be put on hold pending clarification from the Department who process and adjudicate on the applications.</P>
    <P>This scheme made a major contribution to rural Ireland.  The Minister will be making a very short-sighted decision if he scraps the scheme which <Col N="461" /> helps to brighten up the lives of so many people and helped to generate several small enterprises in the disadvantaged areas.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that this scheme is continued. Will he make a statement on the intention to continue with the scheme and the basis for doing so?  Will he arrange an immediate meeting between the ESB and the Department to resolve the differences which, obviously, have arisen in order to ensure the immediate payment of grants to successful applicants and to guarantee the survival of this vital scheme to rural Ireland?</P>

      <P>If it is to be discontinued it will be another serious blow to the economic life of rural areas.  I know, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy does, of many families in our part of the country who would not have electricity only for this scheme.  We know that people often have to pay between £4,000 and £6,000 to the ESB, which has the monopoly, for a connection They would not be able to afford this and, therefore, would not have the benefit of electricity on the farm or in their homes.  I appeal to the Government not to discontinue the scheme and to continue its funding.  I know there are applications in the pipeline from people in my constituency and I am sure every Deputy from the west can say the same thing.  If this scheme were to be discontinued it would be a serious blow to rural Ireland, especially to those living in remote parts and to agricultural production.  In my opinion it would also be a very serious blow to the west.  I hope the Minister will confirm that there are absolutely no plans to discontinue this scheme.</P>

      <P>The allegations being made by the Deputies that there is a crisis facing 300 farmers is a misrepresentation of the facts.  At present the ESB is carrying <Col N="462" /> out work to complete connections for farmers who have been approved for aid under the farm electrification grants scheme.  As indicated to the House in a reply to a parliamentary question last week, details of the ESB's work programme, carried out under this special scheme is a day-to-day matter for the company, for which neither the Minister, Deputy Cowen nor myself have direct responsibility.  We are informed that to end-March 1993, just over 90 jobs of work were completed under the scheme by the ESB.  This compares favourably with the total of just under 500 connections, during 1992.</P>
      <P>Aid has been provided towards the cost of upgrading electricity supply for many farms and assisting the connection of remote holdings for more than a decade, both under the former EC funded Feoga western aid programme and in its present special form.  The reality is that, in the light of national and international developments in agricultural policy, the relevance of the scheme is constantly reducing.  Last year, just under 500 farmers received aid for connection work carried out by the ESB.  This represents about 5 per cent of the total rural connections carried out by the ESB, for the same period and almost all farms now have an electricity supply.  I need hardly mention the influences that Common Agricultural Policy and GATT reform, have on the whole direction of the farming sector, not alone in the European Community but, more particularly, here at home.</P>
      <P>A total of £150,000 has been allocated for our Department's special contribution to the scheme for 1993.  The Department provides 20 per cent aid and the ESB provides a further 60 per cent towards the cost of connections, leaving the customer, with only 20 per cent to pay.  The House may wish to note that in the normal course of events ESB customers traditionally contribute 50 per cent towards connection costs for their individual supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen indicated to this House <Col N="463" /> on a previous occasion, that the future of this scheme is under active consideration. He is in contact with his Cabinet colleague, Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about this matter and officials of our Department are in discussion with ESB.  I would like to take this opportunity to assure those <Col N="464" /> farmers who have been approved for aid under this scheme that these commitments will be honoured in due course and applications currently being received will be processed in due course.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 May 1993.</P>

      <P>The decision to relocate the General Register Office to Roscommon was taken by the Government as part of its ongoing policy of decentralising State agencies.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House on 10 March last in response to questions from Deputies Avril Doyle and John Connor, my Department has been examining in detail the various options for effecting the decentralisation and is taking into account the needs of all users of the Office.  I have received a number of representations about the matter from Members of the Oireachtas, various organisations and individual members of the public, mostly stressing the potential problems involved for genealogists and others undertaking searches, including tourists.  I am also aware of the concern recently expressed by Dublin City Council in the matter.  One of the particular issues being addressed in my Department's consideration of options is the maintenance of adequate facilities for genealogical research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> I hope to be in a position shortly to make decisions as to the precise steps to be taken.  No costs have been incurred to-date and it will not be possible to estimate likely costs until a decision has been made on which option is to be implemented.</P>

      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970 health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board employs 58 full-time home helps and 848 part-time home helps.  The rates of pay for the fulltime home helps are in accordance with the national rates.  The rate of pay for part-time home helps is £1.00 per hour. The total expenditure on the home help service in the Western Health Board area in 1992 was £1.335 million, with 1,432 elderly people availing of the service.</P>
      <P>The part-time home help service originated with the concept of the good neighbour and the level of payment to home helps reflects the voluntary ethos of the service.  It is a matter for the Western Health Board to decide, within competing priorities for health resources, the approprite level of remuneration for home helps.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Full access to medical treatment is available to all patients and admission for treatment is dictated by clinical needs with priority given to urgent cases. However, the Government recognises, that waiting lists for a number of particular specialities are giving cause for concern. In order to tackle this problem, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other <Col N="190" /> procedures), ophthalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery. The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialities and to set a maximum period of 6 months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    <P>Discussions regarding waiting lists are nearing completion with the various hospitals and health boards I will shortly be announcing my decisions in regard to the allocation of the £20 million.</P>

      <P>Following the notification of 1993 allocations to health boards in March I met the chairman and chief executive officer of each board to discuss the allocations.  At these meetings I emphasised the Government's determination that expenditure should be contained within approved limits during 1993.  The health board representatives committed themselves to cooperating fully with this objective.</P>
      <P>During the past two weeks officials of my Department have again met officers of each health board to discuss their plans for the provision of services based on the already notified allocations for 1993.  While it is still early in the year I am confident that the steps being taken by health boards in relation to the control of expenditure will be successful.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, propose to review the allocations as notified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 43 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>Following publication of both the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse and the Report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee a range of initiatives have been taken, particularly in the Dublin area, to improve services for drug misusers and those with HIV.</P>
      <P>One of the main initiatives has been the development by the Eastern Health Board of its services at the AIDS Resource Centre in Baggot Street and associated satellite services in Ballyfermot.  The Eastern Health Board provides medical and social support and counselling to drug misusers and to those who have tested HIV positive.  A needle exchange service is available in Baggot Street and Ballyfermot.  Counselling services, in addition to those provided by the health board are available from a number of non-statutory organisations in the Dublin area and from the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street.  The services are available to persons under 18 years of age.  I am sending to Deputy McDowell a copy of my Health Promotion Unit's Resource List on Primary Prevention of Drug Misuse which contains very useful information on treatment and counselling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the transmission of hepatitis, the risk-reduction services which include the needle exchange programmes are aimed at preventing the spread of infection between drug users. I have recently received the report of the Expert Group on the Prescribing of Methadone.  It recommends a structured <Col N="194" /> framework for the treatment and care of drug users in the community involving general practitioners, community drug teams and specialist treatment centres. The initiatives to be pursued will greatly facilitate the general health care of drug users.  I am asking the relevant organisations to look to the implementation of the recommendations as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The reasons for making these appointments in this manner have included the board facilitating the re-deployment of staff from other health agencies due to changes in the service provision, the re-employment of former female officers who became widowed and the employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 34, 36, 54, 75, 95 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women is that multi-annual funding should be provided to rape crisis centres from health boards.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1991 funding for rape crisis centres came from a number of sources. The unsatisfactory nature of this type of funding was recognised by Government and, following a Government decision in July 1991, it was decided to fund these centres from my Department's national lottery allocation and to channel this assistance through the health boards. This arrangement is similar to that used by health boards to fund voluntary bodies for some community and family planning functions.  It is my intention that these new arrangements for funding rape crisis centres will continue.</P>
      <P>In 1993 funding for rape counselling centres and services will be £248,000, an increase of 90 per cent on funding in 1992.</P>

The accommodation provided ranges from a specific ward provided for this purpose to the placing of patients in gynaecology or ante-natal wards which are, of course, separate from post-natal wards with mothers and babies.  Single room accommodation may also be provided, where possible.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention that counselling is generally made available to these patients, which is also in line with the recommendations of the Second Commission of the Status of Women.</P>

      <Quest>if he will, as a matter of urgency, enquire into the reason the taking of one's own life has increased sixfold in the past twenty years; if he will use the internal organisations within health boards for this purpose; and if he will invite the Northern Ireland Minister for Health and Social Services to co-operate in conducting a similar enquiry in Northern Ireland due to the alarming increase in similar cases there.</Quest>

      <P>The number of reported deaths by suicide in 1973 was 105 and the corresponding figure for 1992 was 352.  This is slightly more than half the increase suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that a significant part of this increase is due to improved reporting over this period.  In regard to responding to the problem of suicide, I believe that the appropriate role for my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, lies in the organisation and delivery of psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>There is a role for health promotion. The promotion of mental health is part of health promotion generally.  In this regard, one chapter in the Green Paper on Mental Health launched in June 1992 discusses the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide. The Green Paper outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>The causes of suicide are complex. Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.  In response to the problem of suicide the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large proportion of suicides is <Col N="202" /> associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable mental illness.  Health boards are involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school playgroups, life-skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>Research into suicide, including possible collaborative projects, is primarily a matter for the Health Research Board which body has carried out a number of studies in this area &mdash; mainly aimed at establishing the accuracy of reporting systems.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government has recently announced its intention to introduce a Bill decriminalising suicide.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Health Act, 1970 the health boards provide dental services to children, medical card holders and their dependants and I am satisfied that the boards are complying with their legal obligation.</P>
      <P>About 1.7 million people are eligible for these services which are provided by salaried dentists and associated staff employed by the health boards.  The current level of funding for dental services is of the order of £20 million.  Special additional funds for the development of orthodontic and adult services was made available over the past few years.  In 1993 a further £2 million has been made available by the Government to continue the development of the health board dental services as the first phase of commitments under the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>The following outlines the range and scope of dental services provided by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> A Preventative Services</P>
    <P>(1)  Fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>(2)  Alternative fluoride supplementation for the population residing outside of fluoridated public water supplies.</P>
    <P>(3)  The provision of dental health education in schools.</P>
    <P>(4)  A fissure sealing programme for susceptible teeth as a preventive strategy against dental decay.</P>
    <P>B Treatment services</P>
    <P>(1)  Children's dental services</P>
    <P>The dental treatment resources of the health boards are prioritised into the provision of primary care dental services for national school children.  Organised dental care is available to this group in all areas throughout the country.  Areas have adopted a planned structured approach by targeting the services at selected classes within schools.</P>
    <P>Under existing programmes about 275,000 children are screened annually and 250,000 children receive treatment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Orthodontic Services</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of secondary care, (i.e. specialist, orthodontic treatment health boards operate guidelines issued by the Department to ensure that the resources are used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.</P>
    <P>Cases requiring attention have been categorised in accordance with the Department's guidelines depending on the severity of their condition.  In total <Col N="204" /> the current level of services in health boards provides orthodontic treatment for approx 16,000 cases per annum.</P>
    <P>(3)  Adult Dental Service</P>
    <P>Dental services to eligible adults are provide by health boards through their own dental staff and/or through private dental practitioners.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the current overall level of service provides treatment for approx 36,500 adults per annum.</P>

      <P>The detailed information on bed numbers sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report.  I am assuming that the question refers to acute hospitals i.e. those in which the bed designation system applies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the formal designation of beds between private and public has improved the access of public patients to hospital beds.  The bed designations, which came into effect in March 1992, are subject to review in the light of activity patterns and the first review is currently in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. M.R. Fartookzadeh, the Iranian Deputy Minister for Health and Medical Education, visited Ireland in August, 1992. Soon after I was appointed Minister for Health I was invited by the Government of Iran to make a reciprocal visit, which I undertook on 19 and 20 April, 1993.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit, I had a number of meetings with senior figures in the Government of Iran.  I met Dr. Hassan Ebrahim Habibi, the First Vice-President. I also had a meeting with Mr. Mahmud Vaezi, the Deputy Foreign Minister.  I had two lengthy meetings with my opposite number in the Iranian Government, Dr. Reza Malekzadeh, Minister for Health and Medical Education. I paid a visit to the Iran University of Medical Sciences and Hazrat-e-Rasoul Training Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the opportunity throughout my visit to emphasise the traditionally good relations which have existed between Ireland and Iran.  These relations continue to be strengthened through visits by Ministers and other officials.  Work continues on a bilateral basis through the Joint Commission for Bilateral Co-operation. Mr. Vaezi, the Foreign Minister, <Col N="207" /> is in Dublin this week to prepare for the next session of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I discussed the opportunities for greater trade between Ireland and Iran. As Deputies will be aware, Iran was a major purchaser of Irish beef before the BSE scare.  The Iranian Government is now satisfied about the quality status of Irish beef and I would hope that contracts can be signed in the near future.  I also discussed the scope for Ireland to import non-oil products from Iran.</P>
    <P>Of course, the main purpose of my visit was to discuss co-operation in the area of health services and medical education. During his visit to Ireland in 1992, Dr. Fartookzadeh signed an agreement with Deputy Chris Flood, former Minister of State at the Department of Health, promoting co-operation between the two countries in the area of medical education. The details of putting this agreement into operation formed a major part of my discussions.  I also discussed co-operation in other areas in which Ireland has considerable expertise such as hospital design and project management, training in health service management, etc.  Agreement was also reached on cooperating in areas such as the development of vaccines, transfer of technology, etc.</P>
    <P>I found the visit stimulating and fruitful. I was received with great courtesy and hospitality.  The visit allowed me to put the Government's position on a wide range of issues directly to the Iranian Government, including the Government's disquiet over the fatwah imposed on Salman Rushdie, and they, likewise, were able to put their views directly to me.</P>

      <P>In the course of a recent meeting with the Medical Council, I pointed out that their statement in relation to ethical guidelines on abortion had given rise to considerable confusion as to its precise interpretation.  I asked the Medical Council to re-examine the statement with a view to further clarification and they undertook to do so.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council have subsequently issued a further statement which does not, in my view, resolve these problems of interpretation.  However, I have noted the statement and will be considering it in the context of the action required to implement the Programme for a Partnership Government's commitments in this area.</P>

      <P>From information currently available within the various health board areas, it would appear that approximately 1,300 residential places are required to meet the needs of those awaiting services. What is not clear, however, from the information available to my Department is the proportion of those on waiting lists for residential care who require immediate placements and the level of care which they require, those who, with the provision of other services such as day care or home support services, may not immediately require residential placement and those who at some stage in the future will require residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement has recently been reached between my Department and the various statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap on the adoption of an information system which will be set up in the various health board regions over the coming months.  This system will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the <Col N="213" /> numbers of people with mental handicap in the various regions both in services and awaiting services, their current and future needs, and the levels of support which are required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The availability of such information will enable my Department and those responsible for the provision of services to plan in a co-ordinated manner the services which will be required to meet both those current and future needs.</P>
    <P>As the cost of the provision of residential accommodation can vary greatly according to the level of support and the type of accommodation required by individual clients, I am not in a position to give the Deputy details of the cost of such provision.  However, the information system which I have already mentioned will provide data on an ongoing basis on the level of support required by each person on the registers and so will facilitate the provision of updated costings in relation to both current and future service needs.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to enable the implementation of the recommendations of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;<i>Needs and Abilities</i>&mdash; to be accelerated.  While I am satisfied that the additional funding of £8.5 million which has been made available by the Government for the development of services for people with mental handicap in 1993, on top of the £6 million made available last year and which is being repeated this year, will provide a real improvement in the services, I intend to build on this in future years.</P>

      <P>Health boards through their senior clinical dental surgeons work in close co-operation with the consultant paediatric services at Cork Dental Hospital and School and the Dublin Dental Hospital and School.</P>

      <P>I have reiterated on many occasions the clear commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the protection of the ethos and traditions of the Adelaide Hospital.</P>
      <P>The ethos of the Adelaide Hospital has played a distinctive role in the development of Irish health care, due in no small part to the quality of its nurse training.  This tradition will be maintained in the new Tallaght Hospital and 40 places in the new nursing school will be reserved for nurses from the Adelaide tradition.</P>

      <P>I regard the ability of both statutory and voluntary service providers to respond to an emergency such as the death of a parent or guardian as a very important part of our services for people with physical disabilities and mental handicap.</P>
      <P>With regard to services for people with a mental handicap, the additional funding provided both this year and in 1992 has been used to specifically address a number of gaps in services.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the provision of an additional £5 million revenue and £1 million capital enabled 127 extra residential and 26 extra emergency places, among other support services, to be put in place.</P>
      <P>An additional £8.5 million has been made available in 1993 for the further development of services for people with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the additional £8.5 million, I have made available new resources of £2 million to strengthen the funding base of the <Col N="216" /> direct funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.</P>
    <P>Four million pounds has been allocated to the health board regions and this money will be used to provide a broad range of additional services, including 90 residential places for the provision of on-going care and for emergency and respite care.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place this year through the allocation of £2.5 million capital funding which was made available in the budget.</P>
    <P>The additional funds which have been provided this year, together with the £6 million spent in 1992 and which is being repeated this year, should ensure that every genuine emergency case which may arise in future can be catered for by the agencies which provide services for people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>As regards people with physical disabilities, there are approximately 360 residential care places available to cater specifically for this group.  A new Cheshire Home at Monkstown which opened last year provides 20 places.  An additional 20 residential places will become available when the Cheshire Homes in Sligo and Letterkenny open later this year.</P>
    <P>The Review Group on Physical Disability has presented me with interim recommendations.  I hope that some progress can be made this year in increasing the number of residential care facilities for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government to reviewing the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients to effect any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patients' rights.</P>
      <P>In addition, further charters which will be based on legal reform where necessary, will be issued to cover groups such as children, expectant mothers, the elderly, the mentally ill, and people with a physical or mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drafting is under way in my Department at present on a Charter of Rights for Children in Hospital and I hope to be <Col N="218" /> in a position to issue this charter in coming months.</P>
    <P>The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) system, which has approximately 60 per cent coverage of all hospital discharges, is currently the only source of information on hospitalisation by age group.  In 1990, 26 per cent of discharges reported through HIPE were in the 0-14 age group, which is equivalent to an estimated 128,000 hospital discharges in the 0-14 age group during 1990.</P>

      <P>The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960 provides for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies to reduce the incidence of dental caries.  Regulations made under the Act prescribe that the amount of fluorine which may be added to a water supply shall be such that the water shall contain between 0.8 to 1.0 parts of fluorine per million parts of water.</P>
      <P>The fluorine content of fluoridated public water supplies is determined daily by a colorometric method and, in addition, laboratory analysis is carried out at intervals not exceeding four weeks. A general report on the fluorine levels for each fluoridated water supply is submitted by health boards to my Department on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>Results are closely monitored at local level by the health boards and also by my Department.  Most of the results achieved fall within acceptable levels.  In cases where unsatisfactory results are obtained remedial action is taken as soon as possible by the health board in liaison with the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly 70 per cent of the population now reside in areas served by fluoridated water supplies.  It is my Department's policy to ensure a 100 per cent coverage <Col N="219" /> of all public water supplies serving a population of over 1,500.</P>
    <P>Studies carried out show that there has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of dental disease and in tooth loss since the introduction of the programme for the fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>In order to assist health boards in extending and upgrading fluoridation schemes my Department have made a special capital grant allocation of £200,000 per annum available over the past few years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> Section 7 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which was brought into operation on 1 December 1992, requires each health board to establish a child care advisory committee for its area.  Ministerial directions have been given to the boards in relation to these committees, in accordance with section 7 (5).</P>
    <P>Seven of the health boards have appointed a child care advisory committee for their respective areas.  The Southern Health Board is in the process of finalising the membership of the committee for its area.</P>
    <P>While my function under the legislation is confined to giving general directions in relation to the committees, I shall of course take a keen personal interest in the progress of the committees which have a valuable role to play in the planning and development of child care services in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Act, which was also brought into operation on 1 December last, requires each health board to undertake an annual review of the adequacy of the child care and family support services available in its areas and to have a report prepared in the matter.  The first such reports must be prepared by 1 December 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 98 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The VHI plays a very important role in the health services of this country as the main insurer of private health costs. The extent of its membership &mdash; over one third of the population &mdash; is a reflection of the extent to which it has fulfilled its role, despite the major changes which continue to occur in the health services.</P>
      <P>Legislation which is being prepared in anticipation of the EC Single Market in health insurance from July 1994 will open the market on a community rating basis to insurers who wish to provide insurance cover in this country.  Any legislative amendment necessary to put the VHI in the best possible position to cope with anticipated changes in the pattern of provision of health services and with a competitive health insurance market will be made in the context of that legislation.</P>
      <P>Discussions are now taking place between my Department and the VHI on a range of issues which must be addressed in order to enable the VHI to plan efficiently for at least the next three years.  Among the issues being discussed is the level and method of recoupment of public hospitals in the years 1993 to 1995 in respect of the services they provide for private and semi-private patients who are members of VHI.  I expect that the discussions will be concluded by the end of this month and that decisions will be made by the Government in June.</P>
      <P>I do not have any application at present from the VHI in relation to increases in subscriptions.  Any such proposals will have to be considered in the wider context of the outcome of the discussions to which I have just referred.</P>

      <P>I recognise the valuable work being carried out by voluntary organisations who counsel and provide support to the victims of rape and sexual abuse. I am aware that there is a need to ensure that there are adequate facilities available to support these unfortunate victims. Following such traumatic experiences, victims can avail of services, both statutory and voluntary, for on-going counselling and support to deal with the trauma of the assault.

      <P>The total amount being spent this year on services for people with a mental handicap is approximately £209 million.</P>
      <P>The services for people with a mental handicap which are directly provided by the health boards have benefited in recent years from the additional resources which have been made available for the general development of mental handicap services.  In particular, significant progress has been made in transferring people with a mental handicap, who in former years were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, to a specialist mental handicap service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 942 people with mental handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1992.  A further 447 people were accommodated in redesignated units associated with these hospitals but which are now part of the mental handicap service. These figures compare with 1,495 and 310 respectively in 1990.  I am satisfied that the specialist mental handicap services run by the health boards in general are adequately funded and staffed and that the accommodation provided is in good repair.  The Deputy will be aware of problems in the mental handicap service of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  In response to the need to improve services in the hospital, I have allocated additional funding of £200,000 to the Eastern Health Board this year to improve staffing levels.  Additional capital <Col N="227" /> funding will also be made available to the board to improve the quality of accommodation to clients of the service.</P>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £8.5 million has been made available this year to develop more services for people with a mental handicap.  While I am conscious that much more needs to be done to meet fully the needs of all persons with a mental handicap within the services, in particular those who are on a waiting list, I am satisfied that this injection of £8.5 million on top of the £6 million made available last year, which has been repeated this year, will provide a real improvement in the services.  I intend to build on this progress in future years.</P>

An explanatory leaflet on the position of such borderline products under the regulations is available from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that a subcommittee of the Food Safety Advisory Committee has been considering the desirability of controls on certain products of the general descriptions mentioned by the Deputy which are not medical preparations and which are not covered by existing legislation. I will be considering the recommendations of the committee in due <Col N="228" /> course and, if necessary, will bring forward further legislative measures to give effect to them.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Paraquat spray is very easily purchased and is on occasions used by those wishing to end their own lives; and if his attention has further been drawn to the devastating effects of this substance when drunk.</Quest>

      <P>The Poisons Regulations, 1982-1991 provide stringent controls in relation to the sale of Paraquat.  Its sale is restricted to pharmacies and outlets licensed by health boards.  It may be sold only for use in agriculture, horticulture or forestry and may be sold only to a person who is known by the seller or who is certified in a manner provided for in the regulations as being a person entitled to purchase such preparation.  A record must be kept of each sale and such record must show the name and address of the purchaser, the purpose for which the Paraquat is required, the quantity sold and the name and address of the person, if any, by whom the certificate referred to above was given.</P>
      <P>Paraquat must also be sold in its original sealed container.  The label must contain the name of the seller or supplier and the address of the premises from which the poison is sold or supplied.  It must have the word &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; legibly written on the label and also the following warning:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Keep out of reach of children.  Do not re-pack from this container. Destroy container when empty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sadly I am aware that this substance is on occasions used by those wishing to end their lives and also of the nature of the effects of this substance when drunk. However, I think the Deputy may agree that the restrictions already in force which I have described cannot be faulted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I have provided £410,000 in the 1993 revenue allocation to Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin for the development of a national medical genetics counselling service.  A medical genetics consultant is being recruited at present to head up the service.</P>
      <P>This new service will be backed up by a medical genetics laboratory which will be able to test for all medical genetics conditions.  The counselling arising from referrals to the centre will be non-directive in nature.</P>
      <P>As soon as the detailed arrangements for the national centre have been finalised, I will be considering how best the service might be organised on a regional basis.</P>

      <P>Ireland fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to bring about a democratic government in Cambodia.  The elections being held there from 23 to 28 May, organised by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), are an essential step in the process of democratisation.  In addition to organising the elections, it is UNTAC's role to ensure that they are free and fair.  There are currently 40 members of the Garda Síochána and 12 members of the Defence Forces serving with UNTAC.  A number of Irish citizens are also in the service of UNTAC.</P>
      <P>In addition, in response to a request from the UN, it is envisaged that a number of Irish citizens will travel to Cambodia to act as UN polling station officers during the elections.</P>
      <P>While it is a matter for the people of Cambodia in free and fair elections to decide on their Government, I must make it clear that Ireland abhors the policies and practices associated with the Khmer Rouge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my concern about the expenditures of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to which the Deputy refers.  As Governor I have responded by pressing for greater cost control and welcome the action taken by the Board of Directors in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under the bank's statute, approval of the budget is a matter delegated by the Governors to the Board of Directors.</P>
      <P>The Board of Directors for some time had seen a need to strengthen the budgetary process in response to the growth and complexity of the bank's organisation and operation.  In the course of approving the 1993 budget in December last, the board instructed management to take steps to this end.  The Board of Directors have now agreed on specific measures to strengthen budgetary control of all aspects of the bank's expenditure, including entertainment and travel costs.  In addition, the Board's Audit Committee has been instructed by the board to conduct a detailed and comprehensive inquiry, with external support if necessary, into the procedures followed and the costs incurred in the fitting out of the banks' headquarters.  Ireland's alternate director has been involved in formulating these measures.</P>
      <P>In my statement at this year's annual meeting of the Governors I made it clear that Governors, as representatives of shareholder members, were ultimately accountable to taxpayers for the funds entrusted by the national authorities to the bank and I welcome the decisions taken by the Board of Directors to reinforce control of the bank's own budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acting on my behalf and on the behalf of the other Governors, Governor Waigel, then chairman of the Board of Governors, had already expressed his concern to the Bank's President at the criticisms of the bank which was damaging its reputation.  He referred to the board decisions on strengthening the <Col N="241" /> budgetary process and was assured by President Attali that all the necessary information would be made available, that he would do everything to implement these measures and would work towards a more cost-conscious attitude on the part of the bank towards its expenditure.  The Governor also told President Attali that a conclusive assessment of the criticisms that had been expressed would have to await the findings of the inquiry by the Board's Audit Committee.</P>
    <P>My position was also reflected in the statement of the Danish Presidency made on behalf of European Community Governors which drew attention to the harm that could be done to the bank by any tendencies to unjustified spending, particularly given the hardship being experienced by the countries in transition to the market economy and the budgetary austerity in the bank's member countries. The Presidency stressed the need for cost consciousness and welcomed the strengthening of budgetary procedures decided on by the Board of Directors. The Presidency specifically welcomed the decision to have the Bank's Audit Committee carry out a special inquiry into the fitting out of bank's new headquarters and stated that the result of this inquiry would be considered very carefully and any necessary action taken.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the measures agreed by the Board of Directors to ensure that a more cost conscious expenditure policy is quickly put into operation in the bank in relation to all aspects of its expenditure. I expect to be informed of the outcome of the Audit Committee's inquiry and will fully support any appropriate action which may be called for as a result.</P>

      <Col N="243" /> The person concerned applied for free telephone rental allowance on 26 January 1993.  The application was accompanied by medical evidence in respect of the spouse of the person concerned.

As a result, the application had to be rejected and the person concerned was notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>On 15 March 1993, further medical evidence was submitted in respect of the spouse.  This was referred to the Department's medical adviser who, on this occasion, determined that the medical condition of the scheme had been fulfilled.

      <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office receives approximately 18,000 appeals every year.  Of the appeals currently under consideration, 3,031 are on hands for more than three months, 12 weeks.  Of these, a total of 2,261 were received more than four months ago and 1,026 of this number have been on hand for over six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many appeals on hands for some time are cases which involve oral hearings or <Col N="244" /> special investigations.  They would include, also, cases where executors are contesting the recovery from deceased pensioners estates of pensions overpaid, cases where appellants are being paid but are seeking some decrease in the amount of means assessed against them and cases where the person has been found to be concurrently working and claiming benefit and is contesting the amount of the overpayment.  In some cases, delay arises where oral hearings have already been arranged and adjourned at the request of the appellant or his legal representative so that further evidence might be submitted.</P>
    <P>At the end of March 1993 there were approximately 7,570 appeals under consideration at varying stages, ranging from those recently received to those which had been the subject of necessary additional inquiries and were ready for determination.  A small percentage of these cases would be appeals which had recently been determined but had yet to be recorded as being finalised.</P>
    <P>When an appeal is received from a person dissatisfied with the initial decision of the Department of Social Welfare the grounds upon which the appeal is based are examined.  This may involve a second examination by a medical referee in the case of a sickness benefit claim or a further investigation by a local officer of the Department in the case of claims under other schemes.  It is often possible for the deciding officer to revise the initial decision at this stage when the additional information has been received and thus resolve the appeal speedily. Alternatively, if the facts have been fully established already and appear to be agreed in substance, the appeals officer may be in a position to make a summary determination of the appeal.  In other cases, any contention may be resolved only by way of an oral hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office give priority in so far as possible to appeals where the person appealing claims to be dependent on the social welfare payment in contention.  The continuing high number of people who are availing of <Col N="245" /> their statutory right of appeal has resulted in some delays in processing appeals.  Both the Social Welfare Appeals Office and my Department review procedures constantly to see how the administrative system can be streamlined better, be made more efficient and, at the same time, constitute an improvement in the service to customers.  Examination of appeals files suggests that a significant proportion of appeals arise from a lack of awareness of the statutory conditions.  A new unit has recently been established in my Department to review the entire initial decision making process, including the manner in which decisions are conveyed to applicants.  I expect it to place considerable emphasis in the review on the need to observe fully the normal principles which should apply to ensure natural justice when dealing with applicants and those who appeal.  This would mean dealing with applicants and those who appeal.  This would mean ensuring that each customer gets as much information as possible on the reasons for the decision in his/her case, especially where a claim is being rejected in full or in part.  I am confident that, in addition to improving the service to customers, this unit will do much to help reduce the incidence of appeals as customers will understand better the reasons for the decisions, especially unfavourable decisions, in their cases.  In turn this should help to reduce the overall delay.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he proposes to take in relation to the Ombudsman's decision in making a submission to the Commission on Social Welfare suggesting that it was inequitable that people who had paid more social insurance contributions should be treated less favourably than those who had paid less contributions over a shorter period.</Quest>

      <P>The submission in question was made in 1984 and concerned the operation of the contribution conditions for old age contributory pension.  To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered from January, 1953 when the unified social insurance system came into effect, or from the time they started insurable employment, if later.  People who have gaps in their insurance record for one reason or another may not be able to meet the contributions' average condition.</P>
      <P>In recent years measures have been introduced to assist those categories most affected by gaps in their insurance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 special partial old age pensions were introduced for people who became compulsorily insured for pension in 1974 on the abolition of the social insurance remuneration limit but failed to qualify for pension subsequently because of gaps in their insurance record caused by the operation of the limit.  Under the arrangements proportionate pensions were granted to such people for contribution averages of between 5 and 20. In 1991 <i>pro rata</i> pensions were introduced for people with a mixture of full and <Col N="247" /> modified insurance, the rate of pension payable being in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the full rate.  The 1992 Social Welfare Act made provision for the introduction of an alternative &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test for entitlement to the maximum rate of old age contributory and retirement pensions. This allows a person to qualify for full pension if he/she has an average of 48 since 6 April, 1979 when the present PRSI system came into operation.</P>
    <P>The whole question of contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions is being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of their final report on a new national pensions system.  It is expected that this report will be finalised and submitted shortly.  The matter will be considered further in the light of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the Labour Inspectorate of my Department.  The Labour Inspectorate are primarily engaged in the enforcement of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements which specify minimum terms and conditions of employment in various sectors and industries. The Labour Inspectorate has a staff complement of ten inspectors and four administrative support staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Munster area is currently serviced by five inspectors.  One inspector is based full-time in Cork city and has responsibility for Cork city and county.  That inspector does not have to travel to Dublin on a regular basis.  The remainder of the inspectors are based in Dublin <Col N="258" /> but four of them have specific responsibilities for inspections in the Munster area.  The work of the inspectorate primarily involves routine inspections of premises to determine compliance with the relevant orders and agreements. However, where complaints of non-compliance with the provisions of those orders and agreements are received or where urgent cases involving legal time limits for prosecution arise, they are dealt with as a matter of priority.  The question of the staffing levels in the inspectorate is currently under active consideration.</P>

      <P>A strike commenced at the company's Dublin plant on 28 March in a dispute over union recognition. A number of workers in the Dublin plant wish to be represented by SIPTU.  This was the subject of a Labour Court hearing in May 1991.  The court recommended that the company recognise SIPTU's right to negotiate on behalf of its members in the plant.  The recommendation is not binding and management has indicated that it wishes to continue to negotiate solely with the works committee which represents the majority of the workforce.</P>
      <P>In an effort to avert the strike a conciliation conference under the Labour Relations Commission was held on 24 March but no agreement was reached. The services of the Labour Relations Commission continue to be available to the parties.</P>

      <P>An analysis of progress towards this objective in Ireland, together with possible future strategies was set out in my Department's publication of July, 1992 <i>&ldquo;Waste: A Discussion Paper&rdquo;;</i> a copy of which publication is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>More recent specific initiatives taken by my Department in this area include the establishment of a Cleaner Production Centre in University College Cork and the commissioning of a special study to promote greater uptake of clean technologies by Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in municipal waste recycling over the past few years.  I am confident that the present 8 per cent rate of recycling of household/commercial waste can be substantially increased.  As a first step in developing a national recycling strategy, local authorities together with industrial, consumer and environmental interests have been asked for their views on the various issues raised in the recently published recycling study.</P>

      <P>I have replied to Deputy Moynihan's representations in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position under the EC milk quota regulations is that the butter fat content of milk deliveries is a factor in assessing the super-levy for the quota year.  If a member state's reference butter fat level is exceeded in a quota year the amount of the milk deliveries for that year must be adjusted upwards on the basis of a set formula.  If the adjusted amount exceeds the national quota, super levy is payable on the quantity in excess of the quota. <Col N="276" /> The individual producer's situation is taken into account in that his/her milk quota must also be adjusted, positively or negatively <i>vis-à-vis</i> his/her own butter fat reference level.</P>

      <P>The EC Regulations also provide for the establishment of both a national reserve equal to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the sum of the individual quotas allocated to producers and special reserve equal to 1 per cent of the total of the individual quotas allocated to producers in the disadvantaged areas.  As the applications for the suckler cow scheme were accepted up to the end of 1992 and as the retention period for the scheme is six months, it will not be possible for some time yet to indicate the total number of suckler cows which received the premium in 1992 and, therefore, to indicate the sizes of the reserves.  When these reserves are established and the criteria for allocating quotas from them have been decided this person's application for an increase in suckler cow quota will be processed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>EC Regulations require producers submitting applications for arable aid and livestock premia to submit area aid applications this year and in future years.  In the case of producers of arable crops the area aid application also serves as the actual application for arable aid.  In the case of livestock producers the area aid application is a declaration of forage area and is to enable my Department to calculate stocking density under the livestock schemes and eligibility for extensification grants.</P>
      <P>I accept that the area aid application form is a relatively complex document and may give rise to concern among farmers. Because of that I arranged for my Department to alert farmers in 1992 to the introduction of that application form and to the need to obtain relevant supporting documentation, especially maps. My Department also issued an eight page help sheet with the application forms in order to assist farmers in completing their applications.  My Department has also liaised with Teagasc and the farming press to enable both to answer queries from intending applicants and, in the case of Teagasc, to offer assistance in completing the forms.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, I believe farmers will be able to meet this year's deadlines for submission of the applications. In the case of those applying for arable sector aid or of livestock farmers with land that had been ploughed at any time since 1 January 1987, the closing date is 5 pm on Friday, 14 May 1993. In the case of livestock producers with permanent pasture only, however, I managed to secure in the relevant EC Regulation an extension of the deadline so as to allow those applicants to submit their area aid applications with the first livestock applications submitted after 14 May 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to defer the submission of area aid applications beyond these dates &mdash; to do so would make it impossible for my Department to pay arable aid or any livestock premia in 1993 since both are dependent on the information <Col N="285" /> contained in the area aid applications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 to 210, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Details of the numbers of jobs created and lost in the food industry, excluding the drink tobacco and by-products sectors, for each of the years 1980-1992 inclusive are set out in Table 1.  These figures have been obtained from data compiled by the State grant agencies.  A breakdown of the figures by sector is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of grants paid by the grant agencies towards the cost of capital investment and research and development work in the food industry for each of the same years are contained in Table 2.  Because of the way in which this data is compiled it is not possible to relate the capital investment grants to total investment <Col N="286" /> costs or to give a breakdown of the research and development grants by sector.</P>
    <P>State support for research and development work is also provided, both directly and indirectly, by various other agencies and institutions such as An Bord Tráchtála, CBF, An Bord Glas, BIM, Teagasc and the universities.  However, it is not possible to quantify this support in monetary terms.</P>
    <P>Although many new food products have been developed by the Irish food industry since 1980, there is no comprehensive list or directory of these available at present.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212, 213, 214 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments to the Milk and Dairies Acts 1935 to 1955, the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, and the Creamery Act, 1928, are necessary to take account of commercial and technological developments in the dairy sector over the past number of years.  These Acts also require amendments in the light of the adoption last June of Directive 92/46/EEC on the harmonisation of EC dairy hygiene and milk quality standards. This directive, which is far reaching and comprehensive and affects all aspects of the dairy industry, is due to come into force on 1 January 1994 and the immediate task must, therefore, be to implement it at national level by having relevant Regulations in place by the end of this year.  While a considerable amount of work has been done already towards up-dating and revising our national dairy legislation, it is necessary, before proceeding further with this task, to consider the implications for that legislation of the EC Directive.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the negative effects that will be caused to the postoffice network in rural areas in view of the policy to transfer social welfare recipient payments from post offices to banks; and his views as to whether this privatisation of social welfare will have serious consequences for the future of small rural offices and rural communities.</Quest>

      <P>In keeping with his policy of improving service to social welfare customers and introducing an element of choice in payment methods, the Minister for Social Welfare recently offered a direct credit facility to old age contributory and retirement pensioners under which they could voluntarily opt to have their pensions paid into a bank or postoffice savings account if it suited them.  I understand that, to date, about 5,400 people have opted for this new method of payment, which will become available next month.  The remaining pensioners will continue to have their pensions paid at postoffices.</P>
      <P>An Post is the main agency for payment of social welfare customers.  This role has now been underpinned and strengthened by the completion of a comprehensive services agreement between the Department of Social Welfare and An Post.</P>
      <P>The introduction of alternative payment facilties for pensioners must be viewed in the context of the new agreement under which it is envisaged that there will be an expansion of the overall level of social welfare business that will be carried out at postoffices.</P>
      <P>I understand from An Post that the introduction of direct credit payment facilities for pensioners will not have any serious consequences for the rural post office network.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports that problems have been encountered in the vessel head and control rod piping contained in some pressurised water reactors (PER) operated by the French electricity utility and that a similar type of reactor is nearing completion at Sizewell in south-east England.</P>
      <P>I am aware that before Nuclear Electric plc can operate the PWR at Sizewell, it is required to obtain a licence from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, N.I.I. which is a part of the UK Health and Safety Executive.  The N.I.I.  Will only issue such a licence when it is fully satisfied with all safety aspects of the plant. However, in view of the reports and the Government's concern to minimise risks to the Irish population, I have asked my officials to raise the question of the safety of the new plant at an early meeting with the UK authorities.</P>

Those proposals were formulated on the basis that the legislation currently in place, which dates back to 1932, is in need of updating. The proposals envisage the extension of competition within the passenger road transport area on a regulated, orderly and phased basis.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring forward, as soon as possible, for consideration by the Government draft proposals to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932, with new provisions which would cater more effectively for the development of the bus industry and the needs of the travelling public.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 237, 238 and 241 together.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion in the recent past when replying to a question on the scheme of civil legal aid and advice I stressed the importance I attach to having the scheme put on a statutory basis so that people will at least have their rights delineated in a statutory manner and will know exactly where they stand.  Work on the legislation is progressing in my Department and I will bring the legislation before the House as soon as it is ready.</P>
      <P>I also expressed my intention over the term of the Government to do my utmost to ensure that increased resources to the maximum possible extent, consonant with available Government resources, are directed towards the scheme.  The extent to which it will be possible to expand the scheme, and the pace at which that expansion will take place, depend on the resources which can be made available from public funds for that purpose. That will depend on the budgetary position in each year.</P>
      <P>Because of the level of demand on the services of the Legal Aid Board, it is necessary for a person who applies to a law centre for legal aid to be placed on a waiting list.  However, no law centre is closed to applicants for legal aid, and there is provision in the scheme for priority to be given in certain circumstances, such as child abduction, child care and cases involving domestic violence.  The number of people on waiting lists at each of the board's Dublin law centres is as follows:</P>

      <Col N="299" /> With regard to the person referred to by Deputy Mitchell in his question the position is that my Department has no funds at its disposal to assist him in his action.  Also, as defamation proceedings are excluded from the scope of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice except where such proceedings arise by way of counterclaim in a legally aided case, no assistance can be provided to that person by the Legal Aid Board through any of its law centres.</P>
    <P>The reference in some of the questions to the scheme being free is inaccurate. Contributions are required of legally aided persons relative to their means.</P>

      <P>In the context of developing the National Alcohol Policy advertisements were placed in the national newspapers inviting written submissions from interested parties which would assist in the development of a National Alcohol Policy. Aiséirí responded to that request by submitting a detailed document outlining their views on a wide range of areas relevant to the development of the policy. I am grateful to Aiséirí for their comprehensive submission and I can assure the Deputy that cognisance has been taken of their views in the drafting of the National Alcohol Policy.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives in relation to alcohol programmes for schools.</P>
      <P>The Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme is a combined inititive between the Health Promotion Unit and the National Youth Council.  It is a preventive programme which aims to inform and educate young people about the responsible use of alcohol and the dangers of misuse.  The programme is now being used by youth leaders, teachers, probation officers and juvenile liaison officers.  To date over 1,000 people have attended the training seminars which equip people with the skills necessary to use the DAY pack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Productions, produced a Video &mdash;&ldquo;Handle With Care&rdquo;&mdash; which comprises a practical alcohol awareness programme for primary and post-primary schools concentrating on young people making informed decisions for themselves in relation to alcohol.  There is a comprehensive <Col N="304" /> teacher's guide which accompanies the video and the video is available from the Health Promotion Unit and is primarily aimed at 10-15 year olds.</P>
    <P>A community-based programme &mdash; Drug Questions Local Answers &mdash; is also in operation.  This aims to create a community response to all drug problems and places particular emphasis on the problems created by alcohol misuse.  Seminars are held regularly by the Health Promotion Unit throughout the country and attended by health and educational professionals and interested voluntary workers.</P>
    <P>A substance abuse prevention programme involving school staff is being piloted in selected second-level schools during the current academic school year. The aim of this Programme, which is a joint Department of Health/Department of Education initiative, is to enable students to develop their ability to take charge of their health and to make informed decisions about the use of all drugs, including alcohol, in their lives.</P>
    <P>The role of parents is increasingly being highlighted in terms of their influence on children and the support and skills required in handling alcohol issues which affect their children.  In conjunction with the Cork Social and Health Education Project, the Health Promotion Unit has developed a parent education training programme.  A full-time project officer has been appointed to coordinate the programme which aims to help parents cope with problems caused by substance (including alcohol and tobacco) misuse.</P>
    <P>In addition the Health Promotion Unit provides a range of information on alcohol, including a series of three booklets relating specifically to young people and alcohol.  These booklets are directed at young people themselves, their parents and youth leaders and have been widely disseminated and are available from the Unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 260 and 273 together.</P>
      <P>As soon as I receive the report of the team investigating the role of the health service in the County Kilkenny incest case, I intend to discuss with the Government the provision of the necessary resources to allow for the full and effective implementation of the Child Care Act 1991 at the earliest possible date. The need for improvements in the health boards' existing staffing levels will be addressed in the context of those discussions.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House on 27 April, it is extremely difficult to estimate accurately the cost of implementing the remaining provisions of the Act, because the level of need for services under the legislation is not known.  My Department is pursuing with the health boards the likely scale of the additional resources that need to be invested for the successful implementation of the entire Act.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Strokestown Community Enterprise Group are campaigning to have a community based nursing home provided in Strokestown.  The provision of an adequate number of extended are beds for the elderly in Co. Roscommon is a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The number of extended care beds for the elderly recommended in the report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A policy for the Elderly</i> is ten beds per 1,000 elderly.  This figure is dependent on also having 2.5 assessment beds per 1,000 elderly in specialist departments of geriatric medicine in general hospitals and three beds per 1,000 elderly for rehabilitation in general or community hospitals.</P>
      <P>There are 290 extended care beds in County Roscommon, giving a ratio of 34 beds per 1,000 elderly in the county.  This ratio does not suggest that there is a shortage of extended care beds for the elderly in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board's plans for the development of services for the elderly include the provision of a home for the elderly in Strokestown.  A site has been purchased but the Deputy will appreciate that before proceeding to develop the home, the board must take account of the capital funds at its disposal and the capital priorities of the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of establishing a system of statutory registration for the health/social service professions has been under consideration for some time.  The groups concerned are physiotherapists, social <Col N="315" /> workers, radiographers, chiropodists, care workers, speech therapists, occupation therapists, dieticians, environmental health officers and medical laboratory technicians.</P>
      <P>However, great difficulties have been encountered in devising any scheme which would meet the requirements of the various professions and which would provide for a system of self-financing self-regulation. Since the professions insisted that each discipline's registration arrangements be independent, no crosssubsidisation of smaller groups by larger groups could be provided for.</P>
      <P>Moreover, some of the largest professions remained undecided about their participation in any scheme of statutory registration.</P>
      <P>In light of the difficulties which I have outlined, I am currently examining the practicality of dealing with this matter through legislation.</P>
      <P>There are two methods whereby professional disciplines within the health service are recognised i.e. 1. the establishment, by statute, of a registration body as currently applies in the case of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists and opticians; and/or 2. the formal approval of minimum levels of qualifications by the Minister for Health under Section 18 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>An important criterion for recognition is employment of the professional discipline concerned in the health services. Once that criterion is met, recognition is by declaration of minimum qualifications.</P>
      <P>Existing controls and procedures within the public health services allow for the exercise of all appropriate mechanisms in the public interest.</P>
      <P>Persons availing of private services should satisfy themselves that their practitioner is professionally qualified.</P>

While no specific funds have been provided in the 1993 Estimates in respect of the provision of dialysis services at Castlebar General Hospital, my Department will be discussing this matter with the Western Health Board in the context of the Board's 1993 service plans.</P>

      <Quest>whether, in relation to the hospital charge of £20 per day, this charge is payable for both the day of admission and the day the patient is discharged from the hospital; and whether double charging is in fact involved if another patient is similarly charged on being admitted to a hospital bed for which a charge has been made for that day to the departing patient.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 296 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, a person is liable for a statutory charge, unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  These Regulations state that this daily charge, which is currently £20, applies per day or part of a day.  The maximum liability which applies to each individual is £200 in any period of twelve consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Maintenance charges for public and private accommodation apply on a per night, rather than a per day basis.</P>
      <P>In my Press Statement of 23 February, 1993 I referred specifically to this aspect of the Regulations as being of particular concern to me and it is one of the issues being examined by the Group which I have set up in order to review the statutory charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the study to which the Deputy refers.  The study, &ldquo;Behaviourial Risk Factors among Young Adults in small areas with High Mortality versus those with Low Mortality&rdquo;, received some financial support from my Department's Health Promotion Unit.  On the basis of their findings the authors of the study recommended that a health promotion programme be developed and targeted at the population of high mortality areas in Dublin; that the programme should be aimed at reducing smoking and increasing exercise and healthy eating; and that it should be developed in co-operation with local residents and agencies other than those involved purely in health care delivery.</P>
      <P>Incorporated in the current health promotion activities of the Eastern Health Board are programmes which are specifically targeted at socially deprived areas.  These include: family development programmes aimed at first-time mothers in deprived areas which involve structured interventions promoting physical, mental and emotional health; the travellers programme which involves a mobile health clinic for travellers with medical and nursing personnel involved in health promotion.</P>
      <P>My Department is supporting a number of initiatives in the Dublin area which are aimed at encouraging healthier lifestyles among disadvantaged groups. In co-operation with the Eastern Health Board, the Unit has established a pilot nutrition project in a Dublin suburb.  This project is developing a community-based intervention model which will take into account the constraints faced by disadvantaged groups in the area of nutrition.  A project officer has been employed to work with local statutory and community groups on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware a Dublin Healthy Cities Project is in place for a number of years now.  The Healthy Cities Project, which is a network of European cities, is a WHO initiative to promote health at local level.  The parties to the Dublin Healthy Cities Project are Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, <Col N="321" /> Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.  The project is involved with many voluntary and statutory bodies as well as community groups on a range of issues affecting health including smoking and exercise.  Many of its projects are based in disadvantaged areas.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit provides support for some of these projects.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit is supporting the initiatives of Dublin Corporation in promoting the welfare of the elderly and in this context has funded the provision of leaflets on Hypothermia and Safety and Security.  The Unit is also providing financial support for a Health Promotion programme for Teenagers in a North Dublin suburban community school.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are as set out hereunder.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that the Government has allocated £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other procedures), ophthalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery.  The Government objective is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialities, and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>For the past few years special additional allocations have been provided specifically for the development of orthodontic services. As a result health boards have been able to increase their levels of orthodontic service provision.  At current levels of treatment health boards are completing over 5,000 cases annually.</P>
      <P>Consultant orthodontists have now been successfully recruited to the following boards:</P>
      <P>1.  Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>2.  North-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>3.  Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>4.  South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>5.  Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>6.  Eastern Health Board/Dublin Dental Hospital and School.</P>
      <P>Health boards which have not so far been successful in recruiting consultants have made alternative arrangements with private specialists for the time being and will make further efforts to recruit consultants in the near future.</P>
      <P>In addition to their own clinical involvement a primary duty of the newly recruited consultant orthodontists is to organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures for existing health board dental staff.  Further improvements in service levels will then be possible.</P>
      <P>The Government is providing an additional £2 million in 1993 on improving the dental services in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>I understand the concerns you have expressed regarding the provision of orthodontic services and I can assure you that I will further improve the situation as resources become available to me.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that elderly people receive the highest quality of health care available.  The objectives of health policy, towards the elderly are set out in the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i></P>
      <P>They are to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when elderly people can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities for service development at present are to strengthen Community Care Services for elderly persons and their carers at home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals, to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm, and to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years Ahead.</i> In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to develop services for the elderly and their carers.  This extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine of the elderly in general hospitals, to increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists in the community and to develop services for the elderly mentally inform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress achieved in developing the health services for the elderly in line with the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i> will be maintained.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government we will be developing a health service of the highest quality so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well looked after should they need medical care.  Among the <Col N="328" /> priority issues in health for the Government which are of direct benefit to the elderly are the expansion of facilities for hip replacement, cataract and bypass surgery and the implementation this year of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has some 120 dental surgeries in its health centres throughout its area.  These provide dental services for their catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Most of the surgeries are of modern design having been provided in recent times.  All are fitted with the most modern equipment available.  All surgeries are up-dated and equipment replaced on a regular planned basis, or as required. There are a number of surgeries which are specially equipped for the provision of orthodontic services and the Board have proposals to extend these further.</P>
      <P>All plans for new health centres include provision for additional dental facilities.</P>
      <P>There are 8 Principal Dental Surgeons who head the teams which provide services within geographic regions covering the whole of the Board's area.  The Board employs some 120 dentists with ancillary staff.  The Board also makes use of the services of a number of private dentists, from time to time, as necessary, to provide services for adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full orthodontic treatment is available through arrangements with consultants, specialist orthodontists, and members of the Board's dental staff with appropriate training and experience.  As I mentioned, a number of centres have been specially equipped to provide orthodontic services. Existing service arrangements with <Col N="329" /> the Dublin Dental Hospital for the provision of orthodontic treatment are also being expanded.</P>
    <P>The Board is in continuing discussion with my Department in relation to proposals for the improvement and development of dental services.</P>

      <P>The enforcing authorities designated under the School Attendance Act, 1926 in the County Borough of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford are the respective school attendance committees, appointed under the Act, situated. Elsewhere the gardaí are charged with this responsibility.  The officers referred to by the Deputy were appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any report that shows that truancy is more prevalent in areas outside the areas designated under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper proposes a review of the working of the School Attendance Act including an examination of the roles <Col N="338" /> and responsibilities of the various agencies involved.  A working group has been established in my Department to carry out this review in consultation with the interested parties.</P>

      <P>A scheme was introduced in the late 1970s under which grants were paid to schools, to employ full-time caretakers if the schools fulfilled certain criteria. Because of public finance constraints, this scheme began to be phased out from 1982.  There are currently 275 caretakers in schools under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a phased programme was commenced in September 1992, to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services in national schools with 100 pupils upwards.  This programme is operated on the basis of a grant of £30 per pupil to schools with a maximum of £15,000 per school.</P>
      <P>This programme relates to schools not being provided with such services under existing arrangements, including the scheme I have just mentioned and also the Social Employment Scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand that the dispute referred to buy the Deputy is in regard to appointments under the Social Employment Scheme.  While this is a question, in the first instance for FÁS, which operates the Social Employment Scheme, my Department is taking the matter up with FÁS in order to ensure that there is no hold-up of appointments of caretakers under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme comprises a complex and integrated nationwide service, involving the daily transportation of approximately 165,000 children, on 2,400 vehicles.  The cost to the Exchequer of operating the scheme in 1992 was £34.3 million.</P>

    <P>A principle objective of the scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live a long distance from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  The operation of the scheme is kept under <Col N="346" /> constant review to ensure an efficient and cost-effective service.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with the School Management my Department approved last year the provision of additional accommodation at St Columbas College, Stranorlar.</P>
      <P>Tender documents for the extension have been submitted but additional information is necessary and has been requested.</P>
      <P>However, it has not been possible to include financial provision for the extension in the 1993 second level programme because of other demands deemed to be of a higher priority which had to take procedence.  It will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>
